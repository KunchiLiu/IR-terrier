	<criteria>Patients that as part of their routine clinical care and according to the locally approved label, are either; Starting fingolimod at time of study entry. Starting another approved DMT or started within maximum 6 months prior to study entry. Patients, or a able legal representative of the patient, who are willing to provide written informed consent. Fingolimod patients will constitute the fingolimod cohort while patients with the other DMT will constitute the parallel cohort Patients previously or currently treated with a cytotoxic agent (e.g. mitoxantrone, cladribine, alemtuzumab) or natalizumab Patients participating simultaneously in another study with inclusion/exclusion criteria more restrictive than the label or an interventional study unless this is a study on fingolimod lasting 1 month maximum Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
