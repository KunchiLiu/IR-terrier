	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the tolerability and pharmacokinetics of Sevuparin/DF02 when administered as an i.v. infusion in combination with Malanil® (atovaquone/proguanil) as anti-malarial treatment in subjects affected with uncomplicated malaria. The study will also assess the potential of Sevupatin/DF02 to reduce infected erythrocyte sequestration and rosette formation. The study consists of a dose escalation part (part 1) followed by an open labelled, randomized comparison of treatment with Sevuparin/DF02 and Malanil® versus Malanil® alone (part 2).</brief_summary>
