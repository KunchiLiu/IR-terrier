	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multicenter, extension study of intravitreally administered ranibizumab in two cohorts. The first cohort (reported separately under FVF3426g, NCT00379795) enrolled subjects with primary or recurrent Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV) secondary to Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) who completed the treatment phase of a Genentech sponsored study (FVF2598g (NCT00056836), FVF2587g (NCT00061594), or FVF2428g (NCT00056823)). The second cohort (reported here) enrolled subjects with macular edema secondary to Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) who completed the 6-month treatment and 6-month observation phases (12 months total) of a Genentech sponsored study (FVF4165g (NCT00486018) or FVF4166g (NCT00485836)). Patients were enrolled within 14 days of completion of the previous study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Signed informed consent form The 6month treatment and 6month observation phases (12 months total) of a Genentechsponsored ranibizumab study for RVO (FVF4165g or FVF4166g) Expectation by the investigator that the subject may potentially benefit from intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment History of intraocular surgery (including cataract extraction, scleral buckle, etc.) within 1 month prior to Day 0 of this extension study Concurrent use of systemic antiVEGF agents Use of RVO treatments not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the study eye Use of intravitreal bevacizumab in the study eye and/or fellow eye Macular edema in the study eye due to other causes than RVO such as diabetes History of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or macular hole (Stage 3 or 4) in the study eye History of idiopathic or autoimmuneassociated uveitis in either eye Uncontrolled glaucoma in the study eye (defined as intraocular pressure â‰¥ 30 mmHg despite treatment with antiglaucoma medication) Pregnancy or lactation Premenopausal women not using adequate contraception History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use an investigational drug or that might affect interpretation of the results of the study or render the subject at high risk for treatment complications Current treatment for active systemic infection Inability to comply with study or followup procedures</criteria>
