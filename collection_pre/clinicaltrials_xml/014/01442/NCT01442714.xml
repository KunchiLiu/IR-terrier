	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - Determine the lack of disease progression (CR/CRi/PR/HI rate) after 6 cycles of treatment with the combination of azacitidine plus lenalidomide in previously treated patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and high-risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes (HR-MDS). Secondary Objective: - Determine the 42-day survival after treatment with this combination in elderly patients with previously treated AML/HR-MDS patients</brief_summary>

	<criteria>To be eligible to participate in this study, a patient must meet the following criteria (at the principal investigators' discretion): AML (according to the WHO 2008 classification), including: de novo or secondary AML previously treated with demethylating agents for AML secondary AML previously treated with demethylating agents for MDS de novo or secondary AML previously treated with high dose lenalidomide for AML (&gt;=25mg) High Risk MDS, including Del (5q) and nondel (5q), previously treated with lenalidomide. novo or secondary HRMDS previously treated with demethylating agents White blood cell count (WBC) at initiation of treatment &lt;= 10,000 o If WBC is &gt;= 10,000 patients may be started on an appropriate dose of hydroxyurea (to be determined by the investigators), until WBC &lt;10,000, at which time the hydroxyurea will be discontinued for 24 hours prior to enrollment Age &gt;= 60 and not an immediate candidate for allogeneic stem cell transplantation Unwilling or unable to receive conventional chemotherapy Prior therapy, with either single agent demethylator (5Azacitidine or Decitabine) and/or Lenalidomide ECOG performance status &lt;= 2 (See Appendix C for definitions) Life expectancy &gt;= 2 months All study participants must be registered into the mandatory RevAssist program, and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of RevAssist Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)â€  must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL 1014 days prior to study enrollment and again within 24 hours of prescribing lenalidomide (prescriptions must be filled within 7 days) and must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin two acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional effective method at the same time, at least 28 days before she starts taking lenalidomide. FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing. Men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with a FCBP even if they have had a successful vasectomy. (See Appendix A: Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable Birth Control Methods). Willing and able to understand and voluntarily sign a written informed consent Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements Patients meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from this study: Patients with LRMDS (lowrisk Myelodysplastic Syndromes) progressing to HRMDS after low dose lenalidomide or 5day azacitidine will not be eligible. History of intolerance to thalidomide or development of erythema nodosum while taking thalidomide or similar drugs Known or suspected hypersensitivity to azacitidine or mannitol Patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors. Concomitant treatment with other antineoplastic agents, with the exception of hydroxyurea Previous participation on the VIREL study with the concomitant use of azacitidine plus lenalidomide. Antineoplastic treatment less than four weeks prior to enrollment, with the exception of hydroxyurea Use of any other experimental drug or therapy within 28 days of baseline Inability to swallow or absorb drug Active opportunistic infection or treatment for opportunistic infection within four weeks of first day of study drug dosing New York Heart Association Class III or IV heart failure Unstable angina pectoris Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia Uncontrolled psychiatric illness that would limit compliance with requirements Known HIV infection Pregnant or breast feeding females; lactating females must agree not to breast feed while taking lenalidomide Other medical or psychiatric illness or organ dysfunction or laboratory abnormality which in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the patient's safety or interfere with data interpretation Laboratory abnormalities: Either creatinine &gt;=1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance &lt;=50 mL/min Total bilirubin &gt;= 1.5 x institutional ULN (Upper limit of normal) (unless documented Gilbert's syndrome) AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) and ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase) &gt;= 2.5 x institutional ULN</criteria>
