	<brief_summary>Tuberculosis is the most common opportunistic infection (OI) in HIV-infected persons worldwide, including in South East Asia. Significant numbers of patients experience tuberculosis-related paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS) after ART initiation, yet the optimal treatment of TB-IRIS is unknown. A recent randomized-controlled trial showed the benefit of prednisone over placebo in reduction of days of hospitalization and invasive procedures. The investigators hypothesize that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are as effective as corticosteroids for treatment of non-life threatening TB-IRIS in HIV-infected patients and hypothesize that adjunctive treatment with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (Statins) may improve the outcomes. This is a randomized controlled trial with a 2x2 factorial design to test the relative benefit of corticosteroids, NSAIDS, and Statins for the symptomatic and immunologic control of TB-IRIS.</brief_summary>
