	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of a family-based tobacco use prevention intervention directed at immigrant Latino parents of middle school aged youth as delivered in partnership with seven community organizations. The primary outcomes of the study are youth susceptibility to tobacco use, and changes in parenting practices among the parents of the youth. The planning, initiation, and delivery of the intervention will occur in collaboration with community organizations that have identified this project as important to the families they serve. Though the collaboratively designed training curriculum has been successfully tested and a study design for the current project established, a substantive development period for this project will allow the research team and collaborating organizations to consider key aspects of design and delivery.</brief_summary>
