	<brief_title>The Effect of Tomato Ketchup on Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The consumption of tomatoes and tomato products has been associated with a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease and some types of cancer. Tomatoes and tomato products provide a good source of antioxidants (lipophilic and hydrophilic). The major tomato antioxidants comprise lycopene, α-tocopherol and ascorbic acid. It has been reported that these antioxidants in isolated form exert directly or indirectly anti-inflammatory effects in vitro. Studies with tomatoes or tomato products revealed that the observed anti-inflammatory effects could not be caused by the presence of only one antioxidant. It was suggested that these effects were due to the combination of antioxidants. In recent cell culture studies with human endothelial cells we have shown that tomato ketchup exerts significant anti-inflammatory effects, which could be related to the particular composition of antioxidants, i.e. lycopene, ascorbic acid and α-tocopherol. Since, however, the relevance of the observed anti-inflammatory effects for humans is entirely unknown, the present pilot study aims to assess the acute effects of a single tomato ketchup consumption on ex vivo elicited inflammation in a small group of healthy volunteers.</detailed_description>
