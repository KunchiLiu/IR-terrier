	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to assess the immunogenicity of Daclizumab High Yield Process (DAC HYP) 150 mg administered every 4 weeks by subcutaneous (SC) injection using the pre-filled syringe (PFS) in participants with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The secondary objectives of this study are to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of DAC HYP following single and multiple doses of DAC HYP administered by the PFS in a subset of participants with RRMS and to evaluate the effect of DAC HYP on the PK of probe drugs for cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open-Label Immunogenicity and Pharmacokinetics Study of Daclizumab High Yield Process Prefilled Syringe in Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following a screening period, participants will receive DAC HYP over a 24-week treatment period (6 monthly injections) and then enter a 20-week washout period for assessment of immunogenicity, PK, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability. The 20-week washout is necessary to ensure measurement of anti-DAC HYP binding antibodies (ADAbs) and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in the absence of drug interference. After washout, the participants may resume monthly treatment with DAC HYP 150 mg for an additional 3 years. All participants will be followed for 6 months after their last dose for safety monitoring. Additionally, two sub-studies will be performed: (1) an intensive serial PK sampling performed over the first and last dosing interval following DAC HYP doses administered at week 0 and at week 20, and (2) a therapeutic protein-drug interaction (TP-DI) sub-study, during which a probe drug cocktail will be administered at weeks 43 and 53 followed by serial probe-drug PK sampling up to 96 hours after probe-drug administration. A maximum of 20 participants will be enrolled in the TP-DI sub-study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key Must have a confirmed diagnosis of RRMS according to McDonald criteria and previous cranial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrating lesion(s) consistent with MS Must have a baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) between 0.0 and 5.0, inclusive Must have had 1 or more clinical relapses within the previous 2 years Women of child bearing potential must be willing to practice effective contraception during the study and 4 months after the last dose Key Other chronic disease of the immune system, malignancies, acute urologic, pulmonary, gastrointestinal disease Female subjects who are currently pregnant or breastfeeding Key Inclusion criteria for 3Year Treatment Extension: To be eligible for participation in the 3year treatment extension, participants must meet the following eligibility criteria at the time of reinitiation of DAC HYP: Must have been compliant with the 205MS302 (NCT01462318) protocol during the initial 24week treatment period and the 20week washout period in the opinion of the Investigator Must resume DAC HYP treatment ≤12 weeks after completion of the washout period (i.e., ≤12 weeks after their Week 44 visit). Participants who are currently receiving an approved IFN ß preparation must discontinue interferon (IFN) ß treatment at the time of reinitiation of DAC HYP dosing (no washout is required). Key Inclusion criteria for the TPDI Substudy: To be eligible for participation in the TPDI SubStudy, subjects must meet the following eligibility criteria at the Screening Visit at Week 40: Must have been compliant with the 205MS302 (NCT01462318) protocol during the initial 24week treatment period and through Week 40 of the 20week washout period in the opinion of the Investigator. Must agree to resume DAC HYP treatment ≤12 weeks after completion of the washout period (i.e., ≤12 weeks after their Week 44 visit). Must have normal liver function test results (total bilirubin ≤1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN), alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase ≤2 × ULN, and prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time ≤1.2 × ULN). Must have normal renal function as estimated creatinine clearance &gt;60 mL/min (CockcroftGault formula). NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
