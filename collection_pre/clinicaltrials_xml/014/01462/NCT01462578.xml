	<brief_title>Treatment of Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome or Acute Myelocytic Leukemia With an Impending Hematological Relapse With Azacitidine (Vidaza)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Analysis of the effectiveness of azacitidine 6 months after start of therapy to prevent a hematological relapse in MDS or AML patients with significant residuals or an increase of minimal residual disease (MRD) which is defined as: - decrease of CD34 donor chimerism (&lt;80%) after allogeneic related or unrelated HSCT in CD34+ or CD117+ MDS or AML or - increase in the AML-specific molecular markers in the quantitative PCR for t(6,9), NPM1+ AML &gt;1% (ratio to reference gene) after conventional chemotherapy or allogeneic HSCT or - persistence of the (above) MRD level &gt;1% after conventional chemotherapy or allogeneic HSCT - tolerance of azacitidine - quality of the response of the MRD (major vs. minor) and the relapse-free survival and overall survival 12, 24 and 30 months after starting treatment with azacitidine - modulation of CD34+, NK- and T-cells of MDS and AML patients by azacitidine</detailed_description>
