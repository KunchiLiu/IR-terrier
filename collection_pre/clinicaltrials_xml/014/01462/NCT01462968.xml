	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find the heparinization method, which 1. affect the heparin-protaminsulfate ratio in the best way to achieve haemostasis 2. gives the smallest change in endogenous thrombin potential (ETP)postoperative compared to preoperative (deltaETP) as an indicator for haemostatic activation during cardiac surgery. The hypothesis is that the deltaETP is larger in the Haemochron Signature Elite group than in the Hepcon-group because of the heparinization-method. Therefore there is a potential higher risk for use of bloodproducts postoperatively.</brief_summary>
