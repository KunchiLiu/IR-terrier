	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of light therapy using a narrow 467nm light compared to a 580nm light in subjects with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). It is hypothesized that the 467nm light will improve the symptoms of SAD better than the 580nm light.</brief_summary>
