	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of a Medical Device (KULIST)to Treat Perianal Fistulas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with chronic uncomplicated perianal fistulas located below levator ani will be treated twice daily with KULIST for 8 weeks. The efficacy will be evaluated by means of an overall clinical evaluation of fistula closure, as well as by anal ultrasonography. Also changes in Patient Assessment of Symptoms and Impact on Daily Function will be evaluated. Safety will be evaluated by standard adverse event /adverse device effects reporting.</detailed_description>
