	<brief_summary>MicroRNAs are important regulators of many cellular functions but their expression profile in human vitreous is still unclear. Aim of this study is to investigate microRNA expression profile by PCR in human vitreous of macula hole patients which is suggested to be similar to that of healthy patients.</brief_summary>
