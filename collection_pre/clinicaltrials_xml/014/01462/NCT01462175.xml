	<brief_summary>This multicenter, open label, dose-escalating study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of RO5503781, administered once daily (QD) or once weekly (QW) in participants with advanced malignancies except leukemia. Participants will receive multiple escalating oral doses in two different dosing schedules (Sch) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.</brief_summary>
