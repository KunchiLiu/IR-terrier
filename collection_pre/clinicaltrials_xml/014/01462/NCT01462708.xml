	<criteria>Early PD Subjects Inclusion criteria: The participant is 30 years or older. Written informed consent is obtained. Participants have a diagnosis of PD (based on UK Brain Bank Criteria) within the past 2 years. Modified Hoehn and Yahr stages 12. No evidence of dyskinesia by history or clinical examination For females, nonchild bearing potential or a negative urine or blood pregnancy test on day of [18F]MK9470 injection. Advanced PD subjects Inclusion criteria: The participant is 30 years or older. Written informed consent is obtained. Participants have a diagnosis of PD (based on UK Brain Bank Criteria) of at least 5 years duration. Modified Hoehn and Yahr stages 14. No evidence of dyskinesia by history or clinical examination For females, nonchild bearing potential or a negative urine or blood pregnancy test on day of [18F]MK9470 injection. Subjects who have a clinical diagnosis of advanced PD with dyskinesia will be recruited for this study. ePD subjects Inclusion criteria: The participant is 30 years or older. Written informed consent is obtained. Participants have a diagnosis of PD (based on UK Brain Bank Criteria) of at least 5 years. Modified Hoehn and Yahr stages 14. Evidence of dyskinesia either by history or clinical examination For females, nonchild bearing potential or a negative urine or blood pregnancy test on day of [18F]MK9470 injection. PD (all stages ePD, aPD, aPDdys)Subject Selection. Subjects who have a clinical diagnosis of ePD, aPD, aPDdys will be recruited for this study. All PD subjects Exclusion criteria: The subject has a clinically significant abnormal laboratory value and/or clinically significant unstable medical or psychiatric illness The subject has any disorder that may interfere with drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion. The patient has evidence of unstable gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, hematological, neoplastic, endocrine, neurological, pulmonary, or other disorder or disease. Evidence of a stroke or mass lesion in a clinically relevant area that may interfere with the imaging outcome measure Subjects with radiation exposure above acceptable levels Pregnancy Healthy Control Subject Selection: subjects who have no neurological disease will be recruited for this study. Healthy control subjects Inclusion criteria: The participant is 18 years or older. Written informed consent is obtained. Negative history of neurological or psychiatric illness based on evaluation by a research physician. For females, nonchild bearing potential a negative urine or blood pregnancy test on day of [18F]MK9470 injection. Exclusion criteria: The subject has a clinically significant abnormal laboratory value and/or clinically significant unstable medical or psychiatric illness. The subject has evidence of clinically significant gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, hematological, neoplastic, endocrine, neurological, immunodeficiency, pulmonary, or other disorder or disease. The subject has any disorder that may interfere with drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion. Subjects with radiation exposure above acceptable levels Pregnancy</criteria>
