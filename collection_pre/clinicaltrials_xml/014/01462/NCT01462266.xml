	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the insulin-sparing effect of sitagliptin 100 mg once-daily compared with placebo over 24 weeks in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have inadequate glycemic control on insulin alone or in combination with metformin. The primary hypothesis of this study is that after 24 weeks, sitagliptin reduces the dose of insulin relative to placebo.</brief_summary>
