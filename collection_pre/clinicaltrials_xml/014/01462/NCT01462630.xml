	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well pazopanib hydrochloride works in treating patients with advanced angiosarcoma. Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pazopanib Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Advanced Angiosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the progression free survival (PFS) at 3 months and response rate defined as complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) in angiosarcoma patients treated with pazopanib. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess overall survival of patients treated with pazopanib. II. To gather more safety data for pazopanib in this patient population. III. To explore the ability of [F-18] fludeoxyglucose (FDG) (positron emission tomography [PET])/computed tomography (CT) imaging to assess response. OUTLINE: Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD). Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>

specify site of origin as cutaneous vs. noncutaneous Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of =&lt; 2 Must have measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 or cutaneous disease amenable to serial measurements should be present; a measurable lesion is defined as a lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with the longest diameter &gt;= 10 mm with computed tomography (CT) scan; lesions that have been treated with therapeutic intent will be considered measurable if they have increased in size by more than 20% Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1.5 X 10^9/L Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dL (5.6 mmol/L) Platelets &gt;= 100 X 10^9/L International normalized ratio (INR) =&lt;

40 mIU/mL and an estradiol value &lt; 40pg/mL (&lt; 140 pmol/L) Subjects using HRT must have experienced total cessation of menses for &gt;= 1 year and be greater than 45 years of age OR have had documented evidence of menopause based on FSH and estradiol concentrations prior to initiation of HRT Childbearing potential, including any female who has had a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment and for 3 months after the completion of treatment, preferably as close to the first dose as possible, and agrees to use adequate contraception; acceptable contraceptive methods, when used consistently and in accordance with both the product label and the instructions of the physician, are as follow: Complete abstinence from sexual intercourse for 14 days before exposure to investigational product, through the dosing period, and for at least 21 days after the last dose of investigational product Oral contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone Injectable progestogen Implants of levonorgestrel Estrogenic vaginal ring Percutaneous contraceptive patches Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year Male partner sterilization (vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia) prior to the female subject's entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that subject Double barrier method: condom and an occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with a vaginal spermicidal agent (foam/gel/film/cream/suppository) Female subjects who are lactating must discontinue nursing prior to the first dose of study drug and refrain from nursing throughout the treatment period and for 14 days following the last dose of study drug A male is eligible to enter and participate in this study if he and his female sexual partner in the reproductive age group agree to use effective methods of contraception Prior malignancy: Subjects with a history of a prior malignancy other than angiosarcoma who have been diseasefree for at least 2 years prior to the first dose of study drug and/or subjects with a history of completely resected nonmelanomatous skin carcinoma or successfully treated in situ carcinoma are eligible History or clinical evidence of central nervous system (CNS) metastases or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, except for individuals who have previouslytreated CNS metastases, are asymptomatic, and have had no requirement for steroids or antiseizure medications for 3 months prior to first dose of study drug;
