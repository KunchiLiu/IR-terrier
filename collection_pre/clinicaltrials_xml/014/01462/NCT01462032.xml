	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate two potential treatments for children with Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) that do not involve the use of medication. Our goal is to develop new interventions for preschoolers with ADHD that will result in enduring reductions of ADHD symptoms and associated impairments in children, and thus prevent long-term difficulties characteristic of many children with ADHD. Both interventions involve weekly playgroups (of roughly five children) in which children engage in designated activities while parents engage in groups focusing on parent education, support, and their children's activities. It is hypothesized that both interventions will be helpful, but that only one will have lasting effects well beyond the end of active treatment.</brief_summary>
