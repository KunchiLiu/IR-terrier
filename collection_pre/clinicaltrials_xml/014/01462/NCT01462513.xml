	<brief_title>L-BLP25 in Patients With Colorectal Carcinoma After Curative Resection of Hepatic Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial is designed for patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma (CRC), who have undergone a complete resection of their primary tumor and recent resection of their liver metastases (R0 or R1) with curative intent. No generally accepted standard care is available following curative-intent resection of hepatic metastases in colorectal cancer patients. L-BLP25 is a cancer vaccine that targets MUC1, a well known tumor-associated antigen. Recently, it has been shown that MUC1 is associated with cellular transformation as demonstrated by tumorigenicity and can confer resistance to genotoxic agents. High levels of MUC1 cell surface expression, reported immunosuppressive activities of its released ectodomain, and anti-adhesive properties all contribute to the ability of the MUC1 antigen to protect and promote tumor cell growth and survival, and make MUC1 an attractive target for cancer immunotherapy. Based on these results, L BLP25 may have potential as adjuvant therapy after curative resection of hepatic metastases in colorectal cancer patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Signed written informed consent. Female patients of childbearing potential (and if appropriate male patients with female partners of childbearing potential) must be willing to use an adequate method of contraception for 4 weeks prior to, during and 12 weeks after the last dose of trial medication. A negative pregnancy test is required for female subjects. Adequate contraception for female subjects is defined as two barrier methods, or one barrier method with a spermicide, or intrauterine device or use of hormonal female contraceptive. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum with complete resection of primary tumor and no evidence of local relapse. Metastatic disease of the liver, with recent (&lt; 8 weeks prior to randomization), both primary or secondary resection (R0 or R1) of all liver metastases. Metastasectomy may have been either synchronous or metachronous. Neoadjuvant therapy may have been applied prior to metastasectomy. Subject has had a colonoscopy or rectoscopy within the last three months prior to initiation of therapy Subject has an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Subject has adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function within 2 weeks prior to initiation of therapy as defined by the following: Absolute neutrophils &gt; 1,500/mm3 and platelets &gt; 140,000/mm3. Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). AST and ALT &lt; 2.5 x ULN. Creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN. International Normalized Ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) within normal range respectively within therapeutic range in case of anticoagulation. Willingness to comply with study protocol requirements. Metastases other than liver metastases. R2 and Rx resected liver metastases. Patients with R1 resected liver metastases can be included if a further surgical resection is seen as not indicated or necessary in the surgeonÂ´s opinion. Chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to randomization. Receipt of immunotherapy (e.g. interferons, tumor necrosis factor, interleukins, or growth factors [GMCSF, GCSF, M CSF], monoclonal antibodies) within 4 weeks (28 days) prior to randomization. Any known autoimmune disease, past or current. A recognized immunodeficiency disease including cellular immunodeficiencies, hypogammaglobulinemia or dysgammaglobulinemia; hereditary or congenital immunodeficiencies. Known or newly diagnosed active hepatitis B infection and/or hepatitis C infection, autoimmune hepatitis, known human immunodeficiency virus infection, or any other infectious process that in the opinion of the investigator could compromise the subject's ability to mount an immune response, or expose him/ her to likelihood of more and/or severe side effects. Past or current history of malignant neoplasm other than CRC, except for curatively treated nonmelanoma skin cancer, insitu carcinoma of the cervix or other cancer curatively treated and with no evidence of disease for at least 5 years. Medical or psychiatric conditions that would interfere with ability to provide informed consent, communicate side effects, or comply with protocol requirements. Clinically significant cardiac disease, e.g. cardiac failure of New York Heart Association classes IIIIV; uncontrolled angina pectoris, uncontrolled arrhythmia, uncontrolled hypertension, myocardial infarction in the previous 12 months as confirmed by an ECG. Splenectomy. Previous (less than 4 weeks prior to randomization) or concurrent treatment with a nonpermitted drug. Pregnancy and lactation period. Participation in another clinical study within 30 days prior to randomization. Known hypersensitivity to the study treatment drugs. Known alcohol or drug abuse. Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity. Any other reason that, in the opinion of the investigator, precludes the subject from participating in this study.</criteria>
