	<brief_summary>This study will prospectively compare the findings of two diagnostic tests, Direct Magnetic Resonance Arthrography(MRA) and Indirect MRA, to the findings during shoulder arthroscopy in patients with shoulder pain. The sensitivity and specificity of both Direct and Indirect MRA's in diagnosing specific pathologies of the shoulder will be determined using shoulder arthroscopy as the gold standard.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison of Indirect and Direct MR Arthrography of the Shoulder Using Arthroscopic Correlation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Direct MR arthrography (MRA) requires the injection of a contrast agent into the shoulder under fluoroscopic or ultrasound guidance, followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This is invasive, risks infection, and requires time and resources. It has recently been shown that the intravenous administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine enhances the joint cavity during an MRI and thus indirectly produces an arthrographic effect(Indirect MRA). The study will enroll patients who have already had a Direct MRA as part of their standard of care diagnostic test for shoulder pain, if it is determined by their surgeon that arthroscopic surgery is indicated they will be asked if they would be willing to have an Indirect MRA prior to their arthroscopic surgery. The patient will need to have a blood test(BUN and Creatinine)done to ensure kidney function is normal, and a serum and urine pregnancy test, if female, to ensure there is no pregnancy, prior to the completion of the Indirect MRA. After the patient's scheduled shoulder arthroscopic surgery, the results of the two MR arthrography techniques will be compared for sensitivity and specificity in detecting partial and full thickness rotator cuff tears, labral tears, long head biceps dislocation/tearing, and grade IV cartilage lesions by comparing the results to the actual arthroscopic findings. The Direct MR arthrography and arthroscopic surgery are standard of care and would occur regardless of this study, the Indirect MR arthrography is the diagnostic intervention that is study-related.</detailed_description>
