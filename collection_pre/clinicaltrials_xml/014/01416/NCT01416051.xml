	<brief_summary>Today's obesogenic environment, favors behavioral choices that lead to an excess of energy intake over expenditure, and consequently weight gain. Intervention strategies that harness the body's own appetite and satiety regulating signals could provide an effective means of countering excessive energy intake. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a vegetable oil emulsion (Olibra) would result in weight loss that was associated with a reduction in food intake.</brief_summary>
