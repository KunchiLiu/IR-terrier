	<brief_summary>This study is needed to assess the feasibility of integrating this therapy with current treatment regimens. If this study shows success a formal phase II test study to conduct feasibility will be the next step. The first dose level chosen for this study is 66Gy of radiation to the tumor between LET and standard photon therapy. This dose is the current standard of care for stage III . If this dose is found to be feasible then the dose of LET will escalate to the total dose of 74Gy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>IIIA : Histologic or cytologic diagnosis of ipsilateral mediastinal lymph node involvement, or Tumors greater than 7 cm or with chest wall invasion, or involvement of one of the following diaphragm, phrenic nerve, mediastinal pleura or parietal pericardium with hilar or mediastinal lymph node involvement. More than one mediastinal lymph node enlarged on CT scan and the same lymph nodes positive on PET scans or Paralyzed left vocal cord with separate lung primary distinct from the aortopulmonary lymph nodes on the CT scan. Evidence of tumor extension into the mediastinum and/or mediastinal structures either at the time of mediastinoscopy, bronchoscopy or on CT scans. IIIB: Histologic or cytologic diagnosis of N3 lymph node involvement; or Enlarged N3 lymph nodes on CT scan that are positive on PET scan as well. Patient must not have extension of lymph node involvement to cervical lymph nodes other than supraclavicular lymph nodes; or Right sided primary with left vocal cord paralysis; or Patients with a nodules in the same lung but no other areas of involvement. Patients with prior surgically resected stage I NSCLC who did not receive any adjuvant therapy, who now have stage IIIA or B NSCLC will be eligible.

Patients with concurrent malignancy. Patients with prior or concurrent malignancy will be allowed as long as the treating physician considers it unlikely to impact the clinical outcome of the patient. Patients with peripheral neuropathy ≥ 2. Serious medical illness including but not limited to uncontrolled congestive heart failure, uncontrolled angina, myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular event with 6 months of registration, history of chronic active hepatitis or history of HIV or an active bacterial infection will not be eligible.
