	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to assess whether there is a difference between a care protocol with the use of incentive spirometry (Voldyne ®) and another with the application of NIV (non invasive ventilation with single-level pressure) as a form of therapy. The main focus of the study is to determine the incidence of pulmonary complications in each technique.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) can prolong and improve the quality of life of patients with ischemic coronary syndrome but with the advancement of medical intervention to eligible patients for this procedure are those with more comorbidities where conservation and palliative therapies have been tried without success. Patients undergoing CABG often develop pulmonary complications such as atelectasis, restrictive ventilatory defect, decreased lung compliance, increased shunt and changes in gas exchange leading to probable hypoxemia. In an attempt to reduce the harmful effects and pulmonary complications arising from surgical procedures is instituted extensive physiotherapy program that tracks and monitors such patients from the preoperative to the postoperative immediate transfer to the ward and hospital discharge. The objective of this study is to assess whether there is a difference between a care protocol with the use of incentive spirometry (Voldyne ®) and another with the application of NIV (non invasive ventilation with single-level pressure) as a form of therapy. The main focus of the study is to determine the incidence of pulmonary complications in each technique.</detailed_description>
