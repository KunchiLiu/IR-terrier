	<brief_title>Evaluation of Subclinical COronary Atherosclerosis for Risk Stratification Using Coronary Computed Tomography (CT) Angiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The risk stratification of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in asymptomatic individuals represents a major challenge. For this purpose, a lot of risk prediction models that take demographic and clinical characteristics into account have been developed. Although Framingham risk score (FRS) is most widely used among multiplr risk prediction models, it has some limitation for prediction of CVD especially in young adult and women. Recently, coronary artery calcium score (CACS) has known to be powerful screening method for CVD, however, it cannot detect the noncalcified coronary plaques (NCP), so it does not represent the entire spectrum of atherosclerotic plaques and it also cannot evaluate the degree of stenosis. On the contrary, Coronary CT angiography (CCTA)can provide detailed coronary artery anatomy and plaque imaging about the location, burden and characteristics of atherosclerotic plaque per se, which might give additional insight to stratify the risk of future cardiac events and therapy. In this study, we will evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis on CCTA in asymptomatic population. And we will investiage the follow up data for major cardiac adverse event such as cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina and revascularization. Therefore, we will finally evaluate the prognostic value of CCTA for risk stratification in asymptomatic adults in comparsion with conventional risk stratification such as FRS and CACS.</detailed_description>
