	<brief_title>Managing Medication-induced Constipation in Cancer: A Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will undergo a baseline assessment during their regular outpatient visit. With their permission, the investigators will audio record this visit for quality control. After the study, the recordings will be erased. Patients will be asked to complete 4 questionnaires. The investigators will collect contact information so that the follow-up assessments can be done by phone.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The study sample will consist of patients who are receiving outpatient care at the Moffitt Cancer Center. Patients will be identified as those who have a diagnosis of cancer and are being treated with either opioids or vinca alkaloids, are adults (or children 1821 years old), either male or female, able to read and understand English, and able to pass screening with the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire and Karnofsky Performance Status Scale. Patients will be excluded: if they have nonmelanoma skin cancer or colorectal or gynecological cancer as their primary diagnosis; if they are excessively debilitated or deemed unlikely to survive for the eight weeks of the data collection period; if they are unable to read and understand English; if they have an ostomy that changes bowel function; if they have a current peritoneal catheter; if they have had abdominal surgery within the past six weeks; or have a disease process suggestive of mechanical obstruction (tumor or adhesion); if they have a history of chronic bowel disease (including irritable bowel syndrome, chronic constipation prior to cancer onset, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis or diarrhea as a result of radiation to the pelvis), or report chronic laxative use prior to cancer onset.</criteria>
