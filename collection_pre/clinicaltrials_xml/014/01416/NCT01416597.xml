	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to consolidate the cross-protection offered by influenza vaccines against circulating influenza A or B viruses that are not antigenically well-matched to vaccine strains and to determine the degree of cross-protection separately for influenza A and influenza B, through a systematic review of the literature.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Systematic Review of Studies of the Effect of Influenza Vaccine Against Mismatched Strains</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research question of this project is: "what is the cross-protection afforded by vaccination (using an LAIV, TIV, or other type of vaccine) against influenza A or B and their subtypes and lineages?" The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) Statement will be used to guide the reporting of this review. Studies reporting cross-protection data after vaccination with approved formulations of influenza vaccines with influenza A or B will be included. Inclusion will not be limited by publication status, or year of dissemination but will be limited to randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing influenza vaccine(s) with placebo. Only RCTs written in English will be included. A meta-analysis will be conducted if there is sufficient data.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy children, adults or the elderly will be included that participated in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and quasiRCTs comparing influenza vaccine(s) with placebo. Placebocontrolled randomized clinical trials (RCTs) reporting laboratoryconfirmed influenza among healthy participants vaccinated with antigens of influenza strains that differed from those circulating. All influenza vaccines will be included, and will be categorized as TIV, LAIV, and others (that is, nonTIV or nonLAIV). Only RCTs written in English will be included. RCTs which are not providing any data will be excluded. Studies using rapid influenza diagnostic tests will not be included, as their sensitivity is low (especially during flu season) and false positives are common during low activity seasons. Laboratoryconfirmed influenza through antibody assay as part of the primary outcome will not be included, as this is a less sensitive test than PCR and viral culture.</criteria>
