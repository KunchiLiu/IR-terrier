	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether anti arrhythmic medication, specifically Amiodarone, is required during the first three months post surgical ablation. Hypothesis: Amiodarone will not be required during the first three months as verified by no increase in rehospitalizations for recurrent Atrial Fibrillation, and report of sinus rhythm at surgical follow up (approximately 3 weeks from date of surgery), 6 weeks and 12 weeks to include patients' first follow up with cardiologist at approximately 3 months post surgery.</brief_summary>
