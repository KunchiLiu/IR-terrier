	<brief_title>Children Education and Cardiovascular Risk Reduction in Their Parents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Students aging 6 to 10 years old were exposed to two different approaches in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. For the students of the morning period (control group) we delivered written educational material for their parents in the beginning and middle of the year 2010 about healthy lifestyle (nutrition, exercise and smoke quitting). The students of the afternoon period (intervention group) received the same educational material for their parents and the children were exposed to a weekly educational program in cardiovascular prevention with a multidisciplinary heath team during the year 2010. This intervention tried to teach to these children, in different manners appropriate for their age, concepts of healthy nutrition, avoidance of tobacco and physical activity. Both at the inclusion in the study and one year later we collect data of parents and their children of the two groups, in a single weekend, including nutritional and exercise survey, measures of weigh, height, waist circumference, arterial blood pressure, and laboratorial exams.</detailed_description>
