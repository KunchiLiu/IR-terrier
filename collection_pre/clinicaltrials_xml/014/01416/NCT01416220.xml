	<brief_summary>This study is being done to look at how well people respond to two different drug treatments for depression. Clinically, people can respond differently to different treatments for reasons which are not always clear. Some research shows that people with a family history of bipolar disorder or completed suicide may react differently to standard medications used to treat depression than those without a family history. The investigators need to know if these drugs are effective to use in patients with depression who have a family history of bipolar disorder or completed suicide.</brief_summary>
