	<brief_summary>Thrombopoietin Receptor Agonists (TPO-ra) are novel treatment modalities for patients with refractory Primary Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP), but only few data are available for long-term effects of these drugs. In this observational study, effects and adverse effects including evaluation of bone marrow biopsies done at fixed intervals will be recorded from ITP patients treated with TPO-ra. For some patients, blood samples will be collected for research use.</brief_summary>
