	<brief_summary>A large proportion of falls in older people occurs when walking. Most studies have recently demonstrated correlation between the variations in spatiotemporal gait parameters and fall risk in elderly and in several diseases. The investigators objective is to analyse this parameters in population with gait stability disorders (post-stroke patients and fallers) to identify the most valuable and to develop/test a conglomerate stability score.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gait Parameters Analysis in Post-stroke Patients and in Elderly Fallers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Temporal-spatial gait parameters will be recorded in subjects aged 65-80 years : 30 healthy people, 30 patients at least one year post-stroke, and 30 fallers while walking on an electronic walkway GAITRiteÂ® at self-selected speed.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. For healthy subjects Aged 65 to 80 years (included) ; Patient has been informed and has signed the consent form. 2. For poststroke patients Aged 65 to 80 years (included) ; Stroke patients who had only one cerebrovascular accident, at least one year before inclusion ; Able to walk without using assisting devices or ambulatory aids ; No cardiovascular contraindication ; No history of neurological diseases with influence on walking capacities (excepted stroke) ; No history of vestibular or orthopaedic (lower limb) disorders ; No amblyopia ; Patient has been informed and has signed the consent form. 3. For fallers Aged 65 to 80 years (included) ; Reported 2 or more falls within 6 months prior to the beginning of the study ; Able to walk without using assisting devices or ambulatory aids ; No cardiovascular contraindication ; No history of neurological diseases with influence on walking capacities ; No history of vestibular or orthopaedic (lower limb) disorders ; No amblyopia ; Patient has been informed and has signed the consent form.</criteria>
