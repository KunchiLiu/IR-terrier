	<brief_summary>Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and trauma-focused cognitive-behavioural therapy (TF-CBT) have both been found to be effective in treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following single-event traumas and to be more effective than pure anxiety management or stabilization treatments. However, much less is known about the efficacy of the different treatment approaches in survivors of repeated or chronic interpersonal trauma. Recent evidence suggests that a combination of stabilization treatment + TF-CBT is efficacious in this population. Although EMDR is also often used in survivors of chronic interpersonal trauma, evidence on its efficacy are still poor. The aim of the current study is to compare the efficacy of (1) stabilization + TF-CBT and (2) stabilization + EMDR using a randomized controlled trial in a routine clinical setting.</brief_summary>
