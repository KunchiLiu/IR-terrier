	<brief_title>Evaluating the Safety and Immune Response to Two Pneumococcal Vaccines in HIV-Infected Pregnant Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pneumococcus is the most common bacterial opportunistic infection in HIV-infected children, and it is the leading cause of bacterial pneumonias in HIV-infected pregnant and non-pregnant adults. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV-23) and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) are two vaccines used for the prevention of pneumococcal (PNC) disease. The PPV-23 vaccine is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for HIV-infected adults, including HIV-infected pregnant women. The PCV-13 vaccine is recommended by the CDC for use in children, including HIV-infected children. Studies have shown that PCV-13 and vaccines like PCV-13 are safe for use in healthy pregnant women, but they have not been studied in HIV-infected pregnant women. This study will compare the safety and immune response to the PCV-13 and PPV-23 vaccines in HIV-infected pregnant women. This study will enroll HIV-infected pregnant women in their second or third trimester who are receiving antiretroviral therapy. The study will take place in two steps. In Step 1, participants will be randomly assigned to receive PPV-23 vaccine, PCV-13 vaccine, or placebo vaccine. At a baseline study visit, participants will undergo a physical examination, medical history and nutritional status review, fetal heart rate measurement, blood collection, an ultrasound, an adherence questionnaire, and a nose and throat swab procedure. They will then receive their assigned vaccine. Participants will not be told which vaccine they are receiving. Participants will remain in the clinic for 30 to 60 minutes after receiving the vaccine for monitoring. They will attend study visits 14 to 21 days after the vaccination visit, at Week 8, and at the time of labor and delivery. During these visits, they will undergo select baseline study procedures. After delivery, participants' babies will have a physical examination and blood collection. At 2 and 4 months after delivery, participants' babies will undergo select baseline study procedures. Participants' babies will receive the PCV vaccine according to the local standard of care. Step 2 of the study will begin 6 months after delivery, at which time participants and their babies will attend a study visit for a physical examination, medical history and nutritional status review, an adherence questionnaire, and blood collection. Participants who received the PPV-23 vaccine or the PCV-13 vaccine in Step 1 will end their participation in the study after this visit. Participants who received placebo vaccine in Step 1 will be randomly assigned to receive the PPV-23 vaccine or PCV-13 vaccine at this study visit but will not be told which vaccine they are receiving. Participants will attend a study visit 14 to 21 days after receiving the vaccine, which will include select study procedures.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria for Step 1: Pregnant women 18 to 39 years old who provide written informed consent prior to initiation of study Pregnant women 13 to less than 18 years old with a parent or legal guardian able and willing to provide signed informed consent or who have attained the minimum age of consent, as defined by the local Institutional Review Board (IRB), and who provide written informed consent prior to initiation of study Gestational age (greater than or equal to 15 weeks [15 weeks 0 days] to less than 33 weeks [32 weeks 6 days]) documented by the approximate date of the last menstrual period and corroborated by physical exam. Ultrasound will be performed at sites where it is available to confirm or correct gestational dates prior to immunization. Documentation of HIV1 infection defined as positive results from two samples collected at different time points. The same method may be used at both time points. All samples tested must be whole blood, serum, or plasma. More information on this criterion can be found in the protocol.

time prior to study entry documented by medical history or record Receipt of PPV23 at any time prior to enrollment documented by medical history or record Receipt of any live licensed vaccine less than or equal to 4 weeks or inactivated licensed vaccine less than or equal to 2 weeks prior to study entry Receipt of a nonlicensed agent (vaccine, drug, biologic, device, blood product, or medication) less than or equal to 4 weeks prior to vaccination in this study, or expects to receive another nonlicensed agent before delivery unless study approval is obtained Any significant (in the opinion of the site investigator) acute illness and/or oral temperature greater than or equal to 100.0 degrees Fahrenheit less than or equal to 24 hours prior to study entry Women who have virologic
