	<brief_summary>The CONFIRM study was developed to examine the prognostic value of cardiac computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) findings for prediction of future adverse cardiac events related to coronary artery disease (CAD) in a large, international patient population. The purpose of this multicenter registry is to correlate coronary and non-coronary cardiac findings by CCTA with demographic and clinical data for refinement of risk stratification of individuals with suspected or known CAD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>COroNary CT Angiography Evaluation For Clinical Outcomes: An InteRnational Multicenter Registry (CONFIRM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) of 64-detector rows or greater represents a novel noninvasive anatomic method for evaluation of patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). Early studies suggest a potential for prognostic risk assessment by CCTA findings but were limited by small patient cohorts or single centers. The CONFIRM Registry is a large, prospective, multinational dynamic observational study of patients undergoing CCTA. The primary aim of CONFIRM is to determine the prognostic value of CCTA findings for the prediction of future adverse CAD events. The CONFIRM registry currently represents 27,125 consecutive patients at 12 cluster sites in 6 countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. CONFIRM sites were chosen on the basis of adequate CCTA volume, site CCTA proficiency, and local demographic characteristics and medical facilities to ensure a broad-based sample of patients. Patients comprising the present CONFIRM cohort include those with suspected but without known CAD, with known CAD, or asymptomatic persons undergoing CAD evaluation. A data dictionary comprising a wide array of demographic, clinical, and CCTA findings was developed by the CONFIRM investigators and is uniformly used for all patients. Patients are followed up after CCTA performance to identify adverse CAD events, including death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, target vessel revascularization, and CAD-related hospitalization.</detailed_description>
