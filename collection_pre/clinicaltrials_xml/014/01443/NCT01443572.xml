	<brief_summary>Biliary atresia (BA) is a perinatal disease of unclear etiology, characterized by inflammation and obliteration of intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts, leading to cholestasis and cirrhosis. Kasai operation remains as the first line operative treatment in BA. In the previous studies, inhalation anesthetics might induce liver damage. The choice of inhalation anesthetic that minimally affects hepatic function is important. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare the postoperative recovery and hepatic function between desflurane and sevoflurane, two most frequently used inhalational anesthetics in patients undergoing Kasai operation.</brief_summary>
