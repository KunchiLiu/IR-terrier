	<brief_title>High MAP in Septic Shock With Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effect of mean arterial pressure (MAP) titration to higher level on microcirculation in septic shock patients with previous hypertension remains unknown. Our goal was to assess the effect of MAP titration to patients' usual level on microcirculation in septic shock patients with previous hypertension. We hypothesized that the increase in MAP from 65 mmHg to patients' usual level improved sublingual microcirculation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with septic shock for less than 24 hours Fluid resuscitation was performed according to the guideline for treating septic shock to maintain the central venous pressure (CVP) for more than 8 mm Hg and central venous oxygen saturation for more than 70% Patients requiring norepinephrine (NE) to maintain a MAP of 65 mm Hg. Septic shock patients with fluid resuscitation after CVP &gt; 8mmHg and mean blood pressure &gt; 65 mmHg Pregnancy Age &lt; 18 years Inability to acquire the usual level of MAP Refusal of consent by the patient or relative Participation in other trials during the last three months Hypertensive patients without hypertension treatment</criteria>
