	<brief_summary>This observational study is designed to analyse the urinary mRNA expression of Foxp3 and Vimentin, two genes involved in tolerance and early graft dysfunction in 500 renal transplant recipients from 17 renal transplant site in France and to determine the predictive value of these gene expression on the one year graft outcome including graft function, one-year graft histological analysis and incidence of acute rejection.</brief_summary>
