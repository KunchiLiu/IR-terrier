	<brief_summary>This study is a randomized controlled trial that will evaluate the impact of a brief educational script on the method of birth control that women receive at their 6-week postpartum visit. The one-minute script ("LARC script") is given to women in the hospital during their postpartum admission. It informs patients about long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods, specifically the contraceptive implant and the intrauterine device. The investigators hypothesize that women who are randomized to receive the LARC script will be more likely to report that they are using a LARC method, when queried immediately after their six-week postpartum visit.</brief_summary>
