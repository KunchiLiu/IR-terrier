	<detailed_description>Obese individuals are at high risk for the development of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Adipose tissue is a major source of pro-inflammatory molecules which can promote the development of atherosclerosis. Development of atherosclerotic plaques are mediated by oxidized or otherwise modified LDL cholesterol and infiltration of activated immune cells into the atherosclerotic lesions. Grapes contain high levels of polyphenols, a class of compounds known to possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine whether grape consumption can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by reducing the presence of inflammatory molecules and positively altering cholesterol levels, lipid profiles, and immune cell responses. Using a randomized cross-over design, twenty obese subjects will consume beverages containing either four servings of grape powder per day or the caloric equivalent without grape powder (placebo control) for a total of three weeks. After a two week washout period, the beverages will be switched for a further three weeks. Blood will be taken from each person at six intervals to determine lipid profiles, measure inflammatory markers in plasma, and analyze immune cell responsiveness.</detailed_description>
