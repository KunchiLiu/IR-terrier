	<brief_summary>To investigate safety and pharmacokinetics of mitiglinide and metformin in a fixed-dose combination of mitiglinide/metformin, compared with free combination of mitiglinide and metformin in healthy male subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics of Mitiglinide and Metformin in Free Combination and Fixed-dose Combination in Healthy Male Subjects.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Korean clinical practice guidelines on DM recommend that a second oral agent with a different mechanism of action be combined to the regimen when adequate glycemic control is difficult to achieve with an oral hypoglycemic agent accompanied dietary therapy. Therefore, a concurrent administration of metformin, a inhibitor of gluconeogenesis, and mitiglinide, an insulin secretagogue, could be an effective and ideal regimen for management of diabetes.</detailed_description>
