	<brief_title>Survey of Patients With Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome (IOIS) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterised by orbital inflammation without any identifiable local or systemic causes. It is a rare clinical entity and a diagnosis of exclusion. Lymphomas, thyroid eye diseases or systemic diseases can have similar presentation and so, a histopathological diagnosis is considered important. IOIS is a difficult condition to treat. Compilation of reported small series of patients with IOIS suggested that they require multiple systemic immunosuppressant drugs and radiotherapy. Recently, a large monocentric study including patients with biopsy proven IOIS showed that up to 40% of them can relapse. Their clinical and pathological features did not correlate with treatments outcomes. The investigators decide therefore to conduct a multicentric retro/ prospective study to determine clinical features, histopathology and treatment outcomes of French patients with IOIS.</detailed_description>
