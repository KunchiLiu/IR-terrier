	<brief_summary>Burn trauma,especially extensive ones, remains a life-threatening local and general inflammatory condition destroying the skin and underlying tissues, and resulting in serious sequelae. Remarkable progress has been achieved during last 30 yearsï¼Œstem cell therapy plays an important role in this progress. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) and human cord blood mononuclear cells (hCBMNCs) have been shown to have the ability to modulate the immune response and enhance angiogenesis, suggesting the novel and promising therapeutic strategy for burn. In this study, the safety and efficacy of hUCMSCs and hCBMNCs transplantation will be evaluated in patients with acute burn.</brief_summary>
