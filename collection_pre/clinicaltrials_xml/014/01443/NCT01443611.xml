	<brief_summary>The actual recommendations for infants aged 3 to 12 months presented with first episode of Febrile Convulsions highly recommend performing lumbar puncture in order to rule out Bacterial Meningitis. On the other hand, recent studies in the era of anti Pneumococcal vaccination arise the question if in the presence of a normal physical examination those recommendations are still relevant. The purpose of this study is to summarized retrospectively the clinical records of all the infants admitted to the pediatric wards in the ten years period since 2000 to 2010 in order to record the incidence of Bacterial Meningitis among infants admitted with the First episode of Febrile Convulsions.</brief_summary>
