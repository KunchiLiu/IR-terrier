	<brief_summary>HYPID study is an observational and prospective study of patients with interstitial lung disease and pre capillary hypertension diagnosed by right heart sided catheterization. The primary aim of the study is to identify prognostic factors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pulmonary Hypertension in Interstitial Lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pre capillary pulmonary hypertension (PH) may be present in patients with diffuse interstitial lung disease. In this context, PH represents an important factor of morbidity and mortality for these patients. One of the purposes of HYPID is to determine predictive factors of mortality within this cohort of patients. In order to reach that aim,the study includes an evaluation based on exams conducted for the routine follow-up of patients. Each patient will be followed during 2 years at least.</detailed_description>
