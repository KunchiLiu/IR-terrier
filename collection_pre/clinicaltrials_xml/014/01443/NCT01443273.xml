	<brief_summary>There are several factor that can be related to Neonatal Thrombotic events. Among them hypercoagulability can be the cause of those events. Factor V Leiden (FVL) and Prothrombin mutation are the most common causes of hereditary thrombophilia. The incidence of in the arab population is known to be higher than the incidence in another western populations. The purpose of this study is to review retrospectively the thrombophilic risk factors that were found in a cohort of premature babies and term newborns treated and investigated at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and at the Pediatric Hematology Unit.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thrombophilic Risk Factors in Preterm and Infants Treated at Ha'Emek Medical Center Between the Years 1990 to 2010</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All the demographic and clinical data will be summarized. Factors non related to the coagulation system like catheters, severe infections or congenital heart defects will be recorded. Also a full workup of prothrombotic risk factors are routinely performed in those infants. The study included basic coagulation analysis, Protein C, S and Antithrombin III activity, Activated Protein C Resistance, serum homocystein, lipoprotein (a) and Lupus Anticoagulant. Also the three common genetic factors are analysed including Factor F Leiden (G1691A), Prothrombin Mutation (G20210A) and MTHFR polymorphism (C677T).</detailed_description>
