	<brief_summary>The project is a randomized, controlled, prospective study of oocyte donors comparing the safety and efficacy of triggering ovulation using a combination of two drugs—GnRH agonist and very low dose hCG—versus triggering ovulation with a standard hCG dose alone or a standard GnRH trigger alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Dual Trigger Ovulation in Oocyte Donors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study population will consist of young women, age 21 to 34, presenting to our facility with the desire to donate oocytes and who meet FDA and program requirements for donation. Participants will be randomized to one of the three treatment interventions for triggering ovulation: 1) a standard dose of hCG, 2) leuprolide acetate 2 mg alone, or 3) a combination of the two drugs in low dosage (leuprolide acetate 2 mg and hCG 1500 IU). Study participants who choose to repeat oocyte donation during the course of the study trial, and who consent to participate in the trial again, will be randomized in a cross-over manner for any subsequent trials. Following randomization, the clinical care of study subjects will be the same as for non-participant oocyte donors. Participants in all three study arms will undergo standard ovarian stimulation protocol with gonadotropins, standard individualized adjustment of medication dose, standard criteria for administration of the ovulation trigger dose, and standard egg retrieval procedure. The recipient population will be recruited from women, age 18 to 55, who present to our center wishing to become pregnant using donor oocytes. All prospective participants who meet the Center for Reproductive Medicine (CRM) criteria be recipients of donated eggs will be eligible to participate, should they wish to do so. If a prospective recipient consents to participate in the study, then she would be matched with either a donor who is not participating in the study (and is receiving one of our standard triggers for ovulation) or a donor who is participating in the study and whose medication to trigger ovulation has been randomized into one of three groups: standard dose hCG, Leuprolide acetate, or a combination of low dose hCG and Leuprolide acetate. A recipient who chooses to participate in the study will have no additional tests or procedures over the ones that she would normally do in order to receive donated eggs.</detailed_description>
