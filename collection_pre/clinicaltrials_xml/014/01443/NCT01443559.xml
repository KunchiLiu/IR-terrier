	<brief_summary>Acellular porcine cornea is a valid substitution for human cornea because of its similar biological structure, corneal superficial curvature and good histocompatibility toward human. Facing the lack of human cornea donor, it is hypothesised that using acellular lamellar porcine cornea as an alternative of lamellar human cornea to treat infectious corneal ulcer.</brief_summary>
