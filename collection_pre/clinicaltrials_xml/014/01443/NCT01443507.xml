	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to compare exercise at 70% of maximal heart rate were total energy expenditure is twice compared to interval training at 90- 95% of maximal heart rate. Since 70% of maximal heart rate is well above the minimum threshold for improvements in maximal oxygen uptake it should be suited to investigate the effect of duration.</brief_summary>
