Patients must be on FDC LABA/ICS treatment ≥ 3 months prior to Screening (Visit 1) 7. Former smokers (defined as smoking cessation at least 1 year ago) or current smokers (including patients who ceased smoking within the past year) both with a smoking history of at least 20 packyears 1. Moderate or severe COPD exacerbation and/or COPD exacerbations treated with antibiotics or systemic glucocorticosteroids within 4 weeks of Screening (Visit 1) (ie, patients must be clinically stable) 2. Known alpha1antitrypsin deficiency 3. Current diagnosis of asthma (either controlled or uncontrolled) (Note: History of childhood asthma is not exclusionary.) 4. Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 45 kg/m2 5.
