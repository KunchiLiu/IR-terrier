	<brief_title>Fractional Laser Therapy and Dermabrasion for Scar Revision</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post traumatic and post surgical scar resurfacing is a common reason for patient visits to dermatologists and plastic surgeons. The Fraxel Laser is a new FDA cleared treatment for textural irregularities of the skin. There have been no studies examining the efficacy of Fraxel specifically for scar resurfacing though it is being used in clinical practice as its clearance was given under hte umbrella of "coagulation of soft tissue." Dermabrasion is the gold standard for scar resurfacing and provides the criterion against which Fraxel therapy should be measured.</detailed_description>
