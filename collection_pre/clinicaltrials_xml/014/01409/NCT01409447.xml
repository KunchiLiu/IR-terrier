	<brief_summary>Background: Matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) has been recently used to treat cartilage defects. The investigators had previously developed a biphasic osteochondral composite as the construct for chondrocyte implantation. The investigators further conducted this feasibility study of such device to treat patients with osteochondral lesion of the knee joints.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Repair of Articular Osteochondral Defect</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods: Ten patients with symptomatic isolated osteochondritis at the femoral condyle were treated by replacing the pathological tissue with autologous chondrocyte-laden biphasic cylindrical plug of DL-poly-lactide-co-glycolide, with its lower body impregnated with -tricalcium phosphate as the osseous phase. The osteochondral lesion was drilled to fashion a pit of identical size and shape as the plug. The chondrocyte-laden plug was press-fit to fill the pit. Outcome of repair was examined by KOOS scale at 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively, and tissue sample was collected with second-look arthroscopic needle-biopsy at 12 months. The primary outcome parameter was the postoperative change of KOOS; and the secondary outcome parameter was the regeneration of cancellous bone and hyaline cartilage at the repair site.</detailed_description>
