	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with simultaneous boost (higher radiation dose) to areas within the prostate with more prominent cancerous growth (intraprostatic lesions) utilizing intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) planning techniques is a safe and effective treatment in patients with low- and intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) With Concurrent Boost for Low- and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer involves several weeks of daily treatment sessions. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a newer form of EBRT that gives fewer treatments but higher doses of radiation per treatment. In many patients there are certain areas within the prostate with more prominent cancerous growth (intraprostatic lesions), which may require higher doses of radiation (boost) to treat effectively. This study will treat the prostate with simultaneous boost(s) to intraprostatic lesion(s) in 5 treatments over 10-14 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically proven diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma within one year Gleason Score 27 Clinical Tstage T1bT2c (AJCC 7th Edition) Clinical Nx or N0, and Mx or M0 PSA &lt; 20 ng/mL Low or intermediate risk according to NCCN guidelines: Low: Clinical Stage (CS) T1bT2a and Gleason 26 and PSA &lt; 10 ng/ml; Intermediate: CS T2bT2c and Gleason 26 and PSA &lt; 10 ng/ml, or CS T1bT2a and Gleason 7 and PSA &lt; 10 ng/ml, or CS T1bT2a and Gleason 26 and PSA 1020ng/mL ECOG performance status 0 or 1 Has had a pretreatment PSA drawn within a month of the beginning of protocol therapy If androgendeprivation therapy (ADT) has been initiated, must have a documented preADT PSA; this baseline PSA should not be obtained during following periods: 1) 10day period following prostate biopsy; 2) within 30 days after discontinuation of finasteride; or 3) within 90 days after discontinuation of dutasteride. Has completed a baseline healthrelated quality of life assessment Extended Prostate Cancer Index Composite questionnaire (EPIC26) Has had a history and physical examination (including digital rectal examination and a formal morbidity assessment via the ACE27) within 60 days Morbidity score (via the ACE27) of none (0), mild (1) or moderate (2) Willing and able to use adequate contraception during protocol treatment and for 3 months after the completion of protocol treatment Invasive (carcinoma in situ is allowed) solid or hematologic malignancy (other than this prostate cancer, or basal or squamous skin cancers) in the last 5 years Prior prostatectomy or cryotherapy of the prostate Prior radiotherapy to the prostate or lower pelvis Prior or concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy for prostate cancer (prior chemotherapy for a different cancer is allowed) Implanted hardware near the planning target volume that would prohibit appropriate treatment planning or treatment delivery in the investigator's opinion</criteria>
