	<brief_summary>The goal of the Phase I part of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the drug Yervoy (ipilimumab) that can be given with the drugs Temodar (temozolomide), Intron-A (interferon alfa-2b), Proleukin (aldesleukin, IL-2), and Platinol (cisplatin) to patients with metastatic melanoma. The safety of this combination will also be studied in Phase I. The goal of Phase II is to learn if this combination can help to control metastatic melanoma. Ipilimumab, interferon alfa-2b, and aldesleukin are designed to block the activity of cells that decrease the immune system's ability to fight cancer. Temozolomide is designed to stop cancer cells from making new DNA (the genetic material of cells). This may stop the cancer cells from dividing into new cells. Cisplatin is designed to poison the cancer cells, which may cause them to die.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study group based on when you join this study. Up to 6 groups of 3 participants will be enrolled in the Phase I portion of the study, and up to 46 participants will be enrolled in Phase II. If you are enrolled in the Phase I portion, the dose of ipilimumab you receive will depend on when you joined this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of ipilimumab. Each new group will receive a higher dose of ipilimumab than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of ipilimumab is found. If you are enrolled in the Phase II portion, you will receive ipilimumab at the highest dose that was tolerated in the Phase I portion. All participants will receive the same dose level of cisplatin, temozolomide, interferon alfa-2b and IL-2. If you develop intolerable side effects while on study, your dose of IL-2 may be lowered 1-2 times until the side effects get better. Catheter: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will have a central venous catheter (CVC) inserted, if you do not already have one. A CVC is a sterile flexible tube that will be placed into a large vein while you are under local anesthesia. Your doctor will explain this procedure to you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a separate consent form. Study Drug Administration: The study drugs will be given in 3 stages: induction, consolidation, and maintenance. Induction: Induction will last 12 weeks. You will receive the study drugs in up to four 3-week cycles: - You will receive ipilimumab by vein over 90 minutes on Day 1 of each cycle. - You will take temozolomide by mouth 1 time a day on Days 2-5 of each cycle. You should take temozolomide on an empty stomach at least 2 hours before or after a meal. Do not open the capsule, mix it with food, or chew it. - You will receive cisplatin by vein over 1 hour on Days 2-4 of each cycle. - You will receive aldesleukin by vein as a continuous infusion on Days 2-5 of each cycle. - You will receive interferon alfa-2b as an injection under your skin on Days 2-6 of each cycle. Consolidation: Consolidation will last 12 weeks. You will receive the study drugs in three 4-week cycles. - You will receive ipilimumab by vein over 90 minutes on Day 1 of consolidation. - You will receive interferon alfa-2b as an injection under your skin on Days 1-5 of each cycle. - You will receive aldesleukin by vein as a continuous infusion on Days 2-5 of each cycle. Maintenance: Maintenance will last about 1Â½ years. You will receive ipilimumab by vein over 90 minutes on Day 1 of up to six 12-week cycles. Other Drugs: You will be given other drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. The study staff will tell you about these drugs, how they will be given, and the possible risks. Study Visits: Before each cycle (+/- 3 days): - You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may have had. - Your performance status will be recorded. - Your vital signs will be measured. - If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine pregnancy test. Every week, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests. Before each cycle, some of this blood will be used to check your liver and kidney function. At the end of each cycle, you will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight. Any tumor that can be felt with the hands will be measured during the physical exam to see if it has changed size. Every 2 cycles (+/- 7 days), you will have a chest x-ray and CT or MRI scans to check the status of the disease. Anytime the doctor thinks it is needed, photos of the skin lesions will be taken. Your private areas will be covered (as much as possible), and a picture of your face will not be taken unless there are lesions on your face. Length of Study: You may continue taking the study drugs for up to 2 years. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-treatment visit and follow-up. End-of-Treatment Visit: Within 14 days after you stop the study therapy, the following tests and procedures will be performed: - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight. - Your performance status will be recorded. - You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may have had. - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a CT or MRI scan. Follow-Up: Every 2 months for up to 3 years, you will be contacted by phone or during a clinic visit to see how you are doing. This is an investigational study. Temozolomide, cisplatin, ipilimumab, interferon alfa-2b, and aldesleukin are FDA approved and commercially available to treat metastatic cancer. However, it is investigational to give temozolomide to patients with metastatic melanoma. Up to 64 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
