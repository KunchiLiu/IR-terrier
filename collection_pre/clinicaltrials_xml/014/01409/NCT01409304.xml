	<brief_summary>We intend to investigate whether deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (DTMS), a novel brain stimulation technique, is effective for treating major depression. We hypothesize that 4 weeks of DTMS will be associated with significant improvements in depressive and anxious symptoms without significant side effects.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of this pilot study is to assess, naturalistically, the effectiveness of deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (DTMS) in a sample of subjects with treatment-resistant depression. To do this, enrolled depressed outpatients will be assigned to receive 4 weeks of daily DTMS and will be evaluated at baseline and during week 5. We hypothesize that treatment with DTMS will be associated with significant clinical improvements in depressive and anxious symptoms, and will be well tolerated.</detailed_description>
