	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether ASA, the combination of ASA and clopidogrel, and darexaban, which have different effects on blood coagulation, influence each other in their effects. Also it will be investigated whether the blood levels of either drug are influenced by the presence of the other drug. In addition, the safety and tolerability of each drug and the combination of the drugs will be investigated.</brief_summary>
