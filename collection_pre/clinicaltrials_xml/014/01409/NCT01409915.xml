	<brief_summary>A medicine that is FDA-approved for bone marrow stimulation (called Leukine) will be tested for its ability to be tolerated by Alzheimer's disease patients and potentially to improve their memory.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Safety &amp; Efficacy of Leukine® in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preliminary preclinical results demonstrated that GM-CSF (Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, e.g. Leukine®/Sargramostim) rapidly reduced cerebral amyloid deposition and completely reversed memory deficits in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). To assess the efficacy of GM-CSF in humans, the investigators performed a retrospective analysis of a cognition study of human patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation for cancer and who garner cognitive impairments from the chemotherapy or irradiation. In the patients that received a colony-stimulating factor (CSF) to stimulate the bone marrow and recover immune system function, the investigators found that those who received GM-CSF (Leukine®/Sargramostim) plus G-CSF (Filigrastim) significantly improved in cognitive function as compared to those who received G-CSF alone. These findings combined with over two decades of accrued safety data using recombinant human GM-CSF, Leukine®/Sargramostim, in elderly leukopenic patients, suggested that Leukine® should be tested as a treatment to reverse cerebral amyloid pathology and cognitive impairment in AD.</detailed_description>
