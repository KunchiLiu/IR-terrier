	<brief_summary>The perceptual change on stroke patients during the movement recovery and its relationship with social participation still remain unclear. The purposes of this study are: 1) to observe the progression of perception deficit and 2) to understand the relationships among perception deficit and other functional indicators. A total of 90 stroke patients will be recruited. Each patient will receive three times evaluation, including perception tests, motor function test, daily living ability tests and social leisure participation questionnaires.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact of Perceptual Impairment on Social Participation in Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According to motor control theory, perception plays an important role in the execution of motion. Although the effect of rehabilitation for motor recovery on stroke patients has been well established, the perceptual change during the movement recovery and its relationship with social participation still remain unclear. A total of 90 stroke patients will be recruited. Each patient will receive initial evaluation, first follow-up evaluation after four weeks and second follow-up evaluation after five months. The contents include basic clinical screen tests, perception tests, motor function test, daily living ability tests and social leisure participation questionnaires. The purposes of this study are: 1) to observe the change of the during the experiment and clarify the progression of perception deficit and 2) to understand the relationships among perception deficit and the other functional indicators and determine the impact of perception deficit on activities and participation in stroke patients.</detailed_description>
