	<brief_summary>The most commonly applied treatment against acute temporomandibular signs and symptoms is pharmacotherapy. The evidence on treatment efficacy of non-medication treatments (like splints) is very low. Two very commonly used splints are the AqualizerÂ® and the soft polyester splint. These are splints applied for a short period of time, until the treatment with a hard splint and/or physiotherapy begins. Aim of this study is to compare the clinical short-time efficacy of these two splints for the treatment of acute temporomandibular pain and compare it to a control group receiving no therapy for that short time. The study hypothesis is that there is a difference in pain reduction between the three groups of patients (two intervention and one control group).</brief_summary>
