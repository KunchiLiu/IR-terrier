	<brief_title>Clinical Study Evaluating Safety and Efficacy of Fluticasone Furoate and Fluticasone Propionate in People With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a multi-centre, randomised, placebo and active controlled (with rescue medication), double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study. Subjects meeting all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria during Visit 1 (Screening Visit) will enter a two week Run-in Period. Subjects failing screening will not be eligible for re-screening. During the run-in and double-blind treatment periods subjects will maintain an electronic daily diary to record morning and evening peak expiratory flow (PEF), asthma symptom scores and rescue albuterol/salbutamol use. At Visit 2 (end of run-in/Randomisation Visit), subjects meeting the eligibility criteria will be randomised receive treatment with either fluticasone furoate 50 mcg once daily, fluticasone propionate 100 mcg twice daily or placebo. In addition all subjects will be supplied with albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol to use as required to treat symptoms. Subjects will attend 6 on-treatment visits at Visits 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 (Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 respectively). Subjects will receive treatment for 24 weeks. A follow-up contact will be performed 1-week after completing study medication (Visit 9). Subjects will participate in the study for up to a maximum of 27 weeks (including screening, treatment and follow-up contact).</detailed_description>
