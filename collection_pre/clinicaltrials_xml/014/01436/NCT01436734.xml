	<brief_summary>The aim of the study was to investigate the role of the Trasylol in glucagon prevention in degradation using radioimmunoactive method with I125. Additionally different incubation time was introduced in human plasma samples after oral glucose stimulation, also in fasted and hypoglycemia blood samples from patients' type 2 diabetes. Since, the structure and the techniques for the glucagon measurement are well described nowadays.</brief_summary>
