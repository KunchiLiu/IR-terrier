	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of SAR245408 administered in combination with SAR256212 in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Secondary Objectives: - To characterize the global safety profile of SAR245408 in combination with SAR256212 - To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SAR245408 and SAR256212 used in combination - To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) and tumor volume change (for expansion cohort only) - To determine the immunogenicity of SAR256212 as administered with SAR245408</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Investigational SAR256212 in Combination With SAR245408 in Patients With Solid Tumor Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a 28 day screening period followed by 28 day cycles (21 day cycle for the every three week dosing regimen, if used) . Patients will continue to receive SAR245408/SAR256212 as long as there is clinical benefit or until a study withdrawal criterion is met. The last posttreatment visit will be 60 days after the last dose or until IMP-related toxicities have resolved or are deemed irreversible, whichever is later.</detailed_description>
