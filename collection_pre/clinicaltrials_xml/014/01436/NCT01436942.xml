	<brief_summary>Background: Exercise is recommended as a cornerstone in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis together with medication. Last years, increased risk of cardiovascular diseases in patient with inflammatory diseases is reported, probably caused by inflammation and increased prevalence of traditional risk factors. In both healthy adults and other patient groups, cardiorespiratory and muscular strength exercises have been shown to have a positive effect on inflammation as well as on cardiovascular risk factors. To our knowledge this has not been shown in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of a cardiorespiratory and muscular strength exercise program on disease activity and cardiovascular risk factors in patients with ankylosing spondylitis</brief_summary>
