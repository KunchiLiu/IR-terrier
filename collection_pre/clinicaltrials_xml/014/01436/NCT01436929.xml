	<brief_summary>Tuberculosis is a worldwide common infectious disease and effective first line anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs were available such as isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. However, anti-TB drugs may induce hepatic injury resulting in discontinuation of anti-TB drugs or changing anti-Tb drug regimen. Silymarin has been widely studied for the effect on hepatitis and it has been used in hepatology. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that prophylactic administration of silymarin with anti-TB drugs may decrease the incidence and severity of hepatotoxicity induced by anti-TB drugs.</brief_summary>
