	<brief_summary>The drug investigated in this study is Rivaroxaban, a novel, once-daily, oral anticoagulant for the prevention (prophylaxis) of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) which may lead to a pulmonary embolism (PE) in people undergoing knee or hip replacement surgery. The purpose of this study is to establish bioequivalence of 2 immediate-release tablet treatments with Rivaroxaban: 2*5 mg tablets and 1*10 mg tablet will be given to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions; they will be administered as single oral doses in 2 periods. Both periods will be separated by a 7-day washout phase. Thus, the bioequivalence represents the primary study objective. As a secondary objective, this treatment will be assessed in terms of safety and tolerability. Bioequivalence will be evaluated and verified on the basis of pharmacokinetic data. Blood samples of the volunteers will be taken at specific points in time; these samples will be analyzed using various statistical methods to establish pharmacokinetic characteristics required to compare the 2 treatments. The planned treatments with Rivaroxaban will be considered bioequivalent if specific criteria defined in the study protocol are met. The study will be conducted in one center in Germany. 28 subjects meeting the inclusion criteria will participate. They will be treated according to a single-dose, randomized, 2-way cross-over, non-placebo-controlled design.</brief_summary>
