	<brief_summary>Misoprostol is a medication used extensively in obstetrics and gynecology for its ability to aid in softening the cervix as well as decreasing blood loss after abortion or vaginal delivery. Opinions vary as to its usefulness in aiding in cervical dilation, and in decreasing blood loss. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate whether misoprostol given buccally 2 hours prior to second trimester surgical abortion decreases blood loss from the procedure. The investigators will also assess whether misoprostol improves cervical dilation, changes the length of the procedure, changes the need for additional mechanical dilation, changes the subjective ease of the procedure, and changes a woman's pain.</brief_summary>
