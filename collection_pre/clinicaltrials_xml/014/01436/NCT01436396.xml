	<brief_summary>The study is designed to evaluate whether the first CYD dengue vaccination can be administered concomitantly with Stamaril® yellow fever vaccine during the same day and visit, but at 2 different sites of administration. Primary Objective: - To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the immune response against Yellow Fever in flavivirus (FV)-naïve subjects at baseline receiving one dose of Stamaril vaccine administered concomitantly with the first dose of CYD dengue vaccine compared to subjects receiving one dose of Stamaril vaccine concomitantly with placebo. Secondary Objectives: - To assess the non-inferiority of yellow fever immune response 28 days post-Stamaril vaccination based on seroconversion rates regardless of the FV status of subjects at baseline. - To describe the safety of Stamaril vaccine administered concomitantly with the first dose of CYD dengue vaccine, or Stamaril administered concomitantly with placebo. - To describe the safety of CYD dengue vaccine after the first dose of CYD dengue vaccine administered concomitantly with Stamaril vaccine or CYD vaccine administered alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Yellow Fever Vaccine Administered With Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine in Healthy Toddlers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All participants will receive a total of 8 injections during the study. Vaccine immunogenicity assessments for dengue neutralizing antibodies will be performed in a randomized subset of participants. All participants will be followed-up for safety during the study and for 6 months after the last CYD dengue vaccination.</detailed_description>

Previous vaccination against yellow fever (YF), hepatitis A, or measles, mumps and rubella. Receipt of blood or bloodderived products in the past 3 months which might interfere with assessment of the immune response.

Personal known seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as reported by the parent/legally acceptable representative. History of previous maternal vaccination against YF as reported by the parent/legally acceptable representative. Personal history of YF or dengue infection/disease as reported by the parent/legally acceptable representative. Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components of the vaccines that will be used in the trial, or history of a lifethreatening reaction to the vaccines used in the trial or to vaccines containing any of the same substances. History of contraindication to receipt of vaccines containing components of Stamaril (yellow fever vaccine), measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, hepatitis A vaccine, pneumococcal conjugated vaccine or of diphtheria (D) toxoid, tetanus (T) toxoid, pertussis toxoid (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP) and polio or other DTP vaccine (e.g., DTwP).
