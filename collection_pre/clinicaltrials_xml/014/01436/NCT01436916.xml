	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major public health problem .Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is also high i.e. 78-96% in different groups of population in north India. Observational studies find association between low Vitamin D status and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Prediabetes is a condition that progress to diabetes at a rate of 6-10% per year .There is mechanistic support that vitamin D may influence both insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity and subsequently T2DM incidence. In general, cross-sectional and prospective studies support the role of vitamin D in the prevention of T2DM. This study will be a single blind randomized placebo controlled trial to study the effect of oral cholecalciferol in insulin sensitivity and secretion in adults with prediabetes who are also vitamin D insufficient.</brief_summary>
