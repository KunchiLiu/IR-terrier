	<brief_summary>This is a cohort study which follows two groups of participants over a 12 months period. One group will access a team approach to care with the aim of reducing their cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks from a team of doctors, nurses and health care professionals. The other group will continue to access standard care from their treating doctor. Both groups will have CVD risk score evaluated after a 12 month period. The team care approach will involve specific tests to measure CVD risk as well as smoking cessation, exercise and dietary advice and support, including monitoring such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels</brief_summary>
