	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether 5% human albumin solution, given to correct hypoalbuminemia, could improve organ dysfunction in burn patients as assessed by a change in the SOFA score from baseline to day 7 (or before if the patient is discharged from the ICU or died).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypoalbuminemia in Burn Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each year approximately 2 million people are burned in the USA, from which 80,000 are hospitalized and 6,500 die. It is a well known fact that the two most important factors for mortality in burn patients are age and percent total body surface area burn (TBSA), which are unmodifiable findings. A predictable inflammatory response takes place after a burn injury leading to profound changes in patient homeostasis. As a result, hypoalbuminemia is one of the common finding in severe burn patients. 21% of hospitalized adult patients are hypoalbuminemic on admission. After admission, worsening of existing hypoalbuminemia and development of de novo one are frequently seen. Moreover, hypoalbuminemia, a potentially modifiable variable, has been strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes in critically ill patients and in burn patients. Dynamic organ dysfunction scores have been introduced in critically ill patients few years ago in order to describe the evolution of patients on a daily basis. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score is now one of the most accepted score in critically ill patients and has been validated in general medico-surgical unit, as well as in trauma and cardiac surgery patients. It encompasses components assessing six organ functions. This score has also been shown to predict mortality in critically ill patients and in burn patients when used in a dynamic way.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients admitted to the BICU in the Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal within 24 hours following their thermal burn injury. 2. Patients with second or third degree burns greater or equal than 20% of total body surface area. 3. Patients aged 18 years or older. 1. Patients with serum albumin greater than 30 g/dl at the time of randomization. 2. Patients with a do not resuscitate order. 3. Patients needing total parenteral nutrition. 4. Patients with the following chronic diseases that could affect baseline SOFA calculation or serum albumin levels: endstage kidney disease, nephrotic syndrome, hepatitis, exudative enteropaty, chronic thrombocytopenia or hematological malignancy. 5. Patients with a known reaction to albumin. 6. Pregnant or lactating women. 7. Patients younger than 18 years old.</criteria>
