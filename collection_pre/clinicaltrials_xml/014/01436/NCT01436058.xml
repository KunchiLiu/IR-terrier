	<brief_summary>Ankle osteoarthritis is a joint condition which results from damage and loss of the cartilage in a joint. Treatment options for ankle osteoarthritis are usually aimed at controlling pain and limiting motion that provokes the pain. Nonsurgical treatment approaches are tried first. If unsuccessful, surgical options are considered. Stem cell therapy is one of the therapeutic options that can repair the damaged cartilage. Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells have showed the capacity of bone and cartilage regeneration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Side Effects of Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation in Ankle Joint Osteoartritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this clinical study the investigators aim to investigate the safety of intra-articular injection of cultured autologous bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) to the ankle joint in patients with severe ankle osteoarthritis. Patients will undergo bone marrow aspiration and will receive cultured BM-MSCs one month later. Patients will be assessed clinically with scoring system (FAO, VAS, WOMAC) preoperatively as well as 2 and 6 months postoperative to measure pain reduction and joint function improvement. Paraclinical studies (X-Ray and MRI) will be performed before and 6 months after treatment.</detailed_description>
