	<detailed_description>Vital Therapies, Inc. (VTI) is conducting clinical trial VTI-206 in which subjects with acute on chronic hepatitis (AOCH) and acute alcoholic hepatitis (AAH) are treated with the ELAD system to assess the safety and efficacy of this therapy. The ELAD system incorporates cloned immortalized human liver cells (C3A cells). A hypothetical risk exists that, over an extended period of time, there may be an increased incidence of tumor in subjects treated with ELAD. The company is also collecting data related to whether a patient received a liver transplant and on survival.</detailed_description>
