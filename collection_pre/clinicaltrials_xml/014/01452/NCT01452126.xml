	<brief_summary>This is a dose finding study to identify the minimum effective anesthetic concentration (MEAC) of ropivacaine to produce insensate body parts sufficient for surgery in supraclavicular and infraclavicular approaches to the brachial plexus, parasacral and popliteal approaches to the sciatic nerve, femoral nerve and transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks in adults.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I to III (patients may be healthy or have systemic disease, but any disease does not pose a constant threat to life, and patients are neither moribund, nor not expected to survive without the operation).
