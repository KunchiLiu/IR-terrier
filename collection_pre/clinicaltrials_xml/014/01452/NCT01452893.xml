	<brief_summary>Patients with adrenal insufficiency also exhibit an adrenomedullary dysfunction. Furthermore, patients who suffer from both, adrenal insufficiency and type I diabetes more frequently report hypoglycemia, particularly after strenuous activities. The study investigates the counter regulatory hormonal response to physical stress and the impact on cognitive function in subjects with and without Addison's disease, type I diabetes and healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Counterregulatory Hormone Production in Adrenal Insufficiency and Diabetes Type I</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As patients with adrenal insufficiency also exhibit an adrenomedullary dysfunction and patients who suffer from both, adrenal insufficiency and type I diabetes more frequently report hypoglycemia, particularly after strenuous activities this study investigates the counter-regulatory hormonal response to physical stress and the impact on cognitive function in subjects with and without Addison's disease, type I diabetes and healthy subjects. Patients will perform ergometer training with an individualized intensity and fulfill cognitive function testing (stroop test and fatigue inventories) before and after strenuous activity.</detailed_description>
