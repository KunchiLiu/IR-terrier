	<brief_summary>Muscular compartment syndrome (MCS) is consecutive to an increase in intramuscular compartment pressures, and is a rare but serious postoperative complication. The INVOS (In Vivo Optical Spectroscopy) monitors tissular oxygenation continuously and non-invasively. The objective is to develop a model mimicking the physiopathology of MCS to assess the interest of the INVOS in this case.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>In Vivo Optical Spectroscopy Monitoring in a New Model of Muscular Compartment Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After inflation of a tourniquet (pressure equal to the mean arterial pressure, we will obtain a model of slight venous congestion and arterial hypoperfusion. A comparison will be made between INVOS monitoring, sensory deficits, pain, electromyography and invasive pressure.</detailed_description>
