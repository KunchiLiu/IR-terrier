	<brief_summary>The first objective is to determine the efficacy of calcium and vitamin D supplementation at doses of 1200 mg and 800 IU, respectively, to reduce the incidence of falls and fractures in non-institutionalized elderly people. The second objective is to measure and compare treatment groups (calcium and vitamin D vs placebo) as regards muscle strength and musculoskeletal function, bone mineral density, calcidiol level and treatment safety.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention of Falls and Fractures in Old People by Administration of Calcium and Vitamin D. Randomized Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: There are many studies that associate vitamin D serum levels in older persons with muscle strength, physical performance and risk of fractures and falls. However, current evidence is insufficient to make a general recommendation for administrating calcium and vitamin D to older persons. The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in improving musculoskeletal function and decreasing the number of falls in person aged over 65 years. Design: Phase III, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of already marketed drugs in a new indication. It will be performed at Primary Care doctor visits at several Healthcare Centers in different Spanish Health Areas. A total of 704 non-institutionalized subjects aged 65 years or older will be studied (sample size calculated for a statistical power of 80%, alpha error 0.05, annual incidence of falls 30% and expected reduction of 30% to 20% and expected loss to follow up of 20%). The test drug containing 800 IU of vitamin D and 1000 mg of calcium will be administered daily. The control group will receive a placebo. The subjects will be followed up over two years. The primary variable will be the incidence of spontaneous falls. The secondary variables will include: consequences of the falls (fractures, need for hospitalization), change in calcidiol plasma levels and other analytical determinations (transaminases, PTH, calcium/phosphorous, albumin, creatinine, etc.), change in bone mass by densitometry, change in muscle strength in the dominant hand and change in musculoskeletal strength, risk factors for falls, treatment compliance, adverse effects and socio-demographic data.</detailed_description>
