	<brief_summary>Tanshinone was originally isolated from dried roots of Salvia miltiorrhiza bunge. In Chinese medicine, this herb has been widely prescribed for several pathologies, including diabetes, acne, cardiovascular disease.It has been demonstrated that the therapeutic benefit of cryptotanshinone on prenatally androgenized rats may be mediated by its dual regulation of key molecules during both insulin signaling and androgen synthesis.The purpose of this study is to determine whether tanshinone may prove effective in eradicating Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) symptomatology.</brief_summary>
