	<brief_summary>Folklore has suggested that consuming grapefruit may promote weight control. Sparse data exist to support this hypothesis, though there is some evidence of health promotional effects regarding blood pressure and lipid profiles. The aims of this randomized controlled trial are to determine the role of grapefruit in: 1. Reducing weight 2. Reducing blood pressure 3. Reducing inflammation 4. Improving the lipid profile. The investigators hypothesize that six weeks of daily consumption of grapefruit will reduce weight, blood pressure, and inflammation while improving the lipid profile in overweight, healthy adults.</brief_summary>
