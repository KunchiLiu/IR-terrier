	<brief_title>Assessing Preference for 3 Female Condoms: A Comparative Evaluation of the PATH Woman's Condom, FC2 and the Reddy 6</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal of this study was to identify the female condom most preferred by study participants. This provided USAID with data to make informed decisions regarding female condom purchases. The study was conducted in three parts. The objective of Part 1 was to familiarize each participant with the three FC types, to minimize learning curve effect in subsequent phases of study, and to gather information on participant demographics, FC acceptability, device function, safety, preference for each of the condom types, and use of male condoms during the same time period. The objective of Part 2 was to determine actual, "unstated" and "unbiased" preference for a particular type of FC. The objective of Part 3 was to identify reasons for preference of a particular FC type and to document details surrounding product use/non-use.</detailed_description>
