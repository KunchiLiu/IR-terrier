	<brief_summary>The investigators specific aim is to compare the relationship between systemic fatty acid availability and insulin sensitivity in a relatively homogenous population of obese adults. The investigators anticipate 1) greater systemic fatty acid availability will be associated with lower insulin sensitivity and 2) greater systemic fatty acid availability will be associated with greater accumulation of fatty acid intermediates and pro-inflammatory markers.</brief_summary>
