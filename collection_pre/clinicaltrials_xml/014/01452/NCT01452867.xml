	<brief_summary>Inexperienced rescuers may encounter severe problems in an unconscious patient in opening and maintaining an upper airway patent. Gaining evidence which ventilation technique may be most efficient and safe is of utmost importance to potentially improve outcome during cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Ventilation With Bag-Valve-Mask, Laryngeal Tube S-D and Laryngeal Mask Airway Supreme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) ventilation has to be efficient to provide oxygen to the body and safe to avoid potentially fatal regurgitation and aspiration pneumonia and excessive stomach inflation. Basically trained rescuers have severe problems to ventilate a patient during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This study intends to compare three commonly employed ventilation techniques. First, the traditionally bag-valve mask ventilation is commonly taught during CPR course, despite recent evidence suggesting low efficiency rates. Second, the laryngeal mask and the laryngeal tube supraglottic airways have shown high efficiency and safety in previous studies in the hand of experienced clinicians. Until now it is unclear if basically trained rescuers are better in ventilation with bag valve mask ventilation or the supraglottic airway devices, the laryngeal mask and the laryngeal tube. The purpose of this study is to compare in anesthetised patients airway management and ventilation with bag-valve mask, laryngeal mask and laryngeal tube.</detailed_description>
