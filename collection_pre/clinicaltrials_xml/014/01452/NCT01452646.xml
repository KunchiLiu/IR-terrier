	<brief_title>Risk-adapted, MRD-directed Therapy for Young Adults With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The general objective of this study is that of setting up a multicentre, risk-adapted study that relies on pre-treatment cytogenetic/genetic features and post-consolidation assessment of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) to establish the final risk assignment and treatment of younger (≤ 60 years) patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Aim of this clinical trial is to verify whether the delivery of a post remission therapy whose intensity is risk-driven will improve the outcome in terms of both increased anti-leukemic efficacy and reduced therapy-related toxicity. All patients will receive induction and consolidation chemotherapy according to the Gruppo Italiano Malattie EMatologiche dell'Adulto (GIMEMA) LAM99P protocol. After the first consolidation, patients belonging to the low-risk category (core binding factor positive AML without c-Kit mutations, NPM1 positive FLT3 negative AML) will receive autologous stem cell transplantation, patients with high-risk features (adverse-risk karyotype, FLT3-ITD mutations), will be assigned to allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Patients with FLT3-TKD mutations or c-Kit mutated core binding factor positive AML and those belonging to the intermediate-risk karyotype category will be stratified according to MRD by flow cytometry and will receive risk-adapted treatment (autologous vs. allogeneic stem cell transplantation). All patients who meet the criteria for high-risk definition will be offered the allogeneic transplantation option regardless of the availability of a Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) identical sibling. In fact, for those lacking a HLA identical sibling all the other sources of hematopoietic stem cells (matched unrelated donor from international registry, unrelated cord blood, family haploidentical donor) will be considered. Autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation will be performed within 3 months from the end of consolidation therapy.</detailed_description>

Patients aged less than 18 or more than 60 years Patients already treated for their AML by other chemotherapeutic agents (with the exception of no more than 7 days HU), radiotherapy or more than 7 days corticosteroids Acute promyelocytic leukaemia Blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukaemia AML supervening after other myeloproliferative disease AML supervening after antecedent myelodysplastic syndromes of more than 6 months duration Other progressive malignant diseases. However, secondary AML following previously cured malignancies may be included as well as secondary AML following previous exposure to alkylating agents or radiation for other reason Inadequate renal or liver function (metabolic abnormalities &gt; 3 times the normal upper limit) Severe heart failure requiring diuretics Ejection fraction &lt; 50% Uncontrolled infections WHO performance status = 4 Severe concomitant neurological or psychiatric diseases Patients who are pregnant or adults of reproductive potential not employing an effective method of birth control. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 48 hrs prior to administration of chemotherapy. Postmenopausal women must be amenorrhoeic for at least 12 months to be considered of nonchildbearing potential. Male and female patients must agree to employ an effective barrier method of birth control throughout the study and for up to 3 months following discontinuation of study drug.</criteria>
