	<brief_summary>Desflurane and its effect on postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing thoracic surgery. Halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane are volatile anesthetics, a group of general anesthetics. Because of the hypnotic effects of these agents, attention has mainly focused on the central nervous system. In the last 10 years, however, numerous studies have reported that volatile anesthetic agents interact with membrane structures of the myocardium and thereby attenuate cardiac mechanical dysfunction and limit ultrastructural abnormality on reperfusion after prolonged ischemia in the myocyte. Anesthetic-induced preconditioning has become a main topic in cardiac research worldwide - Trial with medicinal product</brief_summary>
