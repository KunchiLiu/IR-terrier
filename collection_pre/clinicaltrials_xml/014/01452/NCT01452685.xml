Participants in whom investigator deems that the study drug shows no efficacy based on the level of pain, menstruation status, and the status of analgesic drug intake in TAK385/CCT101 study, or that study continuation represents an unacceptable risk 4. Participants in whom investigator deems that study continuation is difficult due to the occurrence of low estrogen symptoms in TAK385/CCT101 study which were attributed to the pharmacological effects of the study drug taking into account the level and frequency of the adverse events etc. as well as the riskbenefit of participants.</criteria>
