	<brief_summary>This study is a comparison of implant placed and simultaneously grafted with either autogenous connective tissue or a connective tissue allograft. The objective is to determine the change in soft tissue thickness and determine if a better result is obtained with the autograft or the allograft. The hypothesis is that there will be no difference in soft tissue thickness over the implant between the autograft and the allograft technique.</brief_summary>
