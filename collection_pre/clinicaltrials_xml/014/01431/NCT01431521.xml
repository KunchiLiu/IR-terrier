	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate changes in liver fat content following multiple oral doses of MK-4074 and Pioglitazone Hydrochloride in adult males and females with fatty liver disease. The primary hypothesis of the study is that a multiple-dose administration of MK-4074 200 mg twice daily for 4 weeks results in a decrease in hepatic fat content with respect to placebo in adult male and female participants with hepatic steatosis (i.e., on order of 50% reduction in hepatic fat with respect to placebo is expected).</brief_summary>
