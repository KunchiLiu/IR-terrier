	<brief_summary>The aim this study was to examine to what degree the slow turnover of lactated Ringer's solution during anesthesia and surgery can be prevented by infusing esmolol (a ß1-receptor blocker) or phenylephrine in patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecological surgery performed under intravenous anesthesia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Adrenergic Drugs on the Fluid Balance During Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION The renal clearance of infused crystalloid fluid is very low during anaesthesia and surgery, but experiments in conscious sheep indicate that the renal fluid clearance might approach a normal rate when the adrenergic balance is modified. METHODS Sixty females (mean age, 32 years) undergoing laparoscopic gynecological surgery were randomized to control group and received only the conventional anesthetic drugs and 20 ml/kg of lactated Ringer's over 30 min. The others were also given an infusion of 50 µg/kg/min of esmolol (beta1-receptor blocker) or 0.01 µg/kg/min of phenylephrine (alpha1-adrenergic agonist) over 3 hours. The distribution and elimination of infused fluid was studied by volume kinetic analysis based on urinary excretion and blood Hgb level.</detailed_description>
