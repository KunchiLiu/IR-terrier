	<brief_title>The Learning Curve of NBI With Magnification in the Diagnosis of Colorectal Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is very useful to use narrow-band imaging and Sano CP analysis in the differential diagnosis of colorectal lesions. The endoscopists who had never used NBI or no knowledge of NBI can have effective and stable diagnostic accuracy after using NBI with magnification to diagnose 15 target and non-target lesions respectively.</detailed_description>
