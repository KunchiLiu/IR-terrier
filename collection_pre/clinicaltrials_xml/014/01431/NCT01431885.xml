	<brief_summary>Use of modern diagnostic tools e.g. fetal fibronectin and ultrasound measurement of cervical length to diagnose preterm labor can result in improved outcomes compared to traditional diagnosis based on digital examination to measure cervical change.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Two Methods of Diagnosing Preterm Labor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Symptomatic preterm labor patients will be randomized to diagnosis of preterm labor by serial digital examination versus an algorithm incorporating transvaginal ultrasound measurement of cervical length and vaginal fetal fibronectin.</detailed_description>
