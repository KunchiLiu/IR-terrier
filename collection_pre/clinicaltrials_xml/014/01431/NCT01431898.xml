	<criteria>Adult subjects 1865 years of old, inclusive Documented chronic HCV infection to be of at least 6 months duration and plasma HCV RNA ≥ 5 log10 IU/mL at screening. HCV treatment naïve or PEGIFN, IFN, and/or RBV experienced (treatment must have ceased at least 3 months prior to screening). Treatment experienced subjects should not exceed 40% of the subjects enrolled in each cohort Monoinfection with HCV genotype 1a for Cohorts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 and monoinfection with HCV genotype 1b for Cohort 6 and 7. Estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 70 mL/min, QTcF interval ≤ 450 msec for males and ≤ 470 msec for females, QRS duration &lt; 120 msec, PR interval &lt; 220 msec, Body mass index (BMI) of 19.0 to 34.0 kg/m^2, inclusive. Urine drug screen positive for illicit/illegal drugs ALT and AST levels &gt; 5 times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) Direct bilirubin &gt; ULN, clinical or other laboratory evidence of hepatic decompensation (i.e., platelets &lt; 90,000/mm^3, prothrombin time ≥ 1.5 × ULN and albumin &lt; 3.5 g/dL) are not eligible for study participation. Subjects with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1,000 cells/mm^3 (&lt; 750 cells/mm^3 for black or AfricanAmerican subjects), hemoglobin (Hb) &lt; 11 g/dL, Coinfected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or another HCV genotype other than genotype 1a/b are not eligible for study participation. Evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (e.g., afetoprotein &gt; 50 ng/mL or as indicated by recent ultrasound or other standard of care measure) History of significant cardiac disease. The following ECG abnormalities at screening are exclusionary: QTcF (QT corrected using Fridericia's formula=QT/RR^0.333) &gt; 450 msec for males and &gt; 470 for females; QRS &gt; 120 msec (left or right hemiblock is not exclusionary); PR interval &gt; 220 msec; bradycardia (&lt; 45 beats per minute); second or third degree heart block. History of clinicallysignificant illness or any other major medical disorder that may interfere with subject treatment, assessment or compliance with the protocol History of a primary gastrointestinal disorder that could interfere with the absorption of the study drug or that could interfere with normal gastrointestinal anatomy or motility</criteria>
