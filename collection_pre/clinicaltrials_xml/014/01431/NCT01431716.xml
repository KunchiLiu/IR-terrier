	<brief_summary>This study is investigating the effect of switching from Flolan® to Epoprostenol for Injection (EFI/ACT-385781A) in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients currently treated with Flolan®. For this purpose patients being treated for at least 12 months with Flolan® will be switched from Flolan® to EFI/ACT-385781A and followed-up for 90 days. During these 90 days safety and tolerability of EFI/ACT-385781A will closely be monitored in all treated patients. This 90 follow-up will provide clinical evidence on the safety, tolerability, efficacy and treatment satisfaction of switching from Flolan® to EFI/ACT-385781A in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.</brief_summary>
