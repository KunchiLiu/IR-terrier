	<brief_summary>The timing of initiating short-term treatment for COPD exacerbations with oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotic therapy has been shown to influence the recovery time of exacerbations with early initiation of exacerbation therapy having a faster symptom recovery compared to delayed initiation. While oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotic therapy are crucial for immediate exacerbation therapy, maintenance therapy with controller medications for COPD has been recommended to reduce the risk of future exacerbations. The initiation of maintenance therapy after a COPD exacerbation has been shown to be beneficial in the reduction of risk of future exacerbations. However, there is a lack of information on whether the timing of this initiation influences the risk of future exacerbations. The following study evaluates the impact of early versus delayed initiation of controller medication therapy for maintenance treatment following a COPD-related exacerbation on outcomes of future exacerbations and costs in patients with COPD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outcomes Associated With Early or Delayed Maintenance Treatment Post-Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Exacerbation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study period for this analysis will range from January 2003 through June 2009. Patients with at least one COPD exacerbation will be selected as the initial population. Three types of COPD exacerbations will be identified: 1) hospitalization with a primary discharge diagnosis code for COPD, 2) an emergency department (ED) visit with a primary diagnosis code for COPD, 3) physician visit with a dispensing of oral corticosteroid (OCS) or antibiotic (ABX) within 5 days of the visit. Only the first two will be selected as index exacerbations, which is defined as the first chronologically occurring exacerbation for a patient. For hospitalization exacerbations the discharge date of the hospitalization will be the index date and for ED exacerbations the date of the visit will be the index date. The pre-index period will be defined as the 1-year period before index date and the post-index period will be defined as 1-year period after index date. The enrollment period will thus range from January 1, 2004 through June 30, 2008. The post-index period will be used to identify the date of receipt of prescription for first COPD maintenance medication. This date of receipt will be used to compute the time to start maintenance treatment. Maintenance treatment refers to the use of controller medications. Specifically the study hypothesis for the primary outcome being tested was: Ho: There is no difference in risk of COPD-related hospitalization/ED visit between early and delayed cohorts Ha: There is a difference in risk of COPD-related hospitalization/ED visit between early and delayed cohorts Hypothesis for the key secondary outcome of COPD-related costs that was tested was: Ho: There is no difference in COPD-related costs between early and delayed cohorts Ha: There is a difference in COPD-related costs between early and delayed cohorts</detailed_description>

	<criteria>at least 40 years of age, continuously enrolled for medical and pharmacy benefits during their pre and postperiod diagnosis of COPD (ICD 491.xx, 492.xx, 496.xx) Patients were excluded if they had MTx in the preindex period (to ensure inclusion of MTxnaïve patients) or if they received their first MTx during 181 to 365 days of the postperiod (as dispensing of MTx unlikely to be related to the index exacerbation). Additionally, patients were excluded if they had any of the following comorbid conditions anytime during the study period: respiratory cancer, cystic fibrosis, fibrosis due to, bronchiectasis, pneumonociosis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary tuberculosis, or sarcoidosis, and also if they had other doses (unapproved in the US) of fluticasone propionatesalmeterol xinafoate combination (100/50 mcg or 500/50 mcg) or budesonide dipropionateformoterol fumarate fixed dose combination (any dose).</criteria>
