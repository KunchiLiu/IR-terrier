	<brief_summary>Plantar fasciopathy is a chronic condition affecting both sedentary populations, individuals in the workplace who must stand for prolonged periods of time, and athletes. It can be disabling. There is no single accepted treatment course that is recommended in the literature. The use of pulsed radio-frequency electromagnetic (PRFE) devices has been proposed as a treatment option in chronic soft-tissue injury due to its ability to reduce pain and inflammation. The proposed study will investigate the efficacy of the use of a PRFE device for the treatment of chronic heel pain using a double blind randomized placebo controlled design study.</brief_summary>
