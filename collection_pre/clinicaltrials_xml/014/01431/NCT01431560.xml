	<brief_summary>The purposes of this study are to compare the outcomes of the biodegradable implants for the fixation of ankle fracture and those of metallic implants, and to assess the problems of the biodegradable implants. Null hypothesis is that the clinical outcomes of biodegradable plate and screws for ankle fracture are not different from those of metallic implants.</brief_summary>
