	<brief_summary>The primary object is to compare the early clinical efficacy (after 48-72 hours of therapy) of dalbavancin to the comparator regimen (vancomycin with the option to switch to oral linezolid) for the treatment of patients with a suspected or proved gram-positive bacterial skin or skin structure infections.</brief_summary>

Regular, chronic antipyretic use in patients unable to modify during the first three days of study drug therapy. 25. Life expectancy less than 3 months. 26. Conditions that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results. 27.
