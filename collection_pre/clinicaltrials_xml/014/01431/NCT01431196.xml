	<brief_summary>Molecular expression in breast cancer (BC) defines special fenotypes with different prognostic and predictive features.Since the addition of trastuzumab and lapatinib to chemotherapy, HER2 overexpressing tumors have become the best responders to systemic therapies, reaching pathologic complete response rates (pCR) around 50%. But HER2 negative tumors (luminal A and triple negative) are characterized by low chemosensitivity (luminal A) or early distant relapse after diagnosis (triple negative BC) . In this open, prospective, non-randomized and multicentric phase II study the investigators include stage II and III HER2 negative BC patients that are going to receive neoadjuvant sequential chemotherapy Epirubicin+Ciclofosfamide x 4 and then Docetaxel x 4)with an individualized vaccination with autologous dendritic cells pulsed with their own tumor. The hypothesis is that the reinforcement of the immune system with the autologous dendritic cell vaccination against HER2 negative BC could increase pathologic complete responses (pCR) and disease free survival(DFS), when added to chemo, surgery and radiation therapy and in a maintenance schedule.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial With Autologous Dendritic Cell Vaccination in Patients With Stage II-III HER2 Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chemotherapy schedule: - dose dense epirubucin 100 mgr/m2 plus ciclofosfamide 600 mgr/m2 every two weeks for four cycles with with GM-CSF support on day +1 (pegylated filgastrim) or on days +5 to +9 (filgastrim) subcutaneously - docetaxel 80-100 mgr/m2 every three weeks for four cycles. Addition of GM-CSF if docetaxel doses are &gt; 85 mgr/m2</detailed_description>
