	<brief_summary>This study aims to demonstrate non-inferiority of Pidogrel 速 compared to Plavix 速 in patients with coronary disease: - Primary Outcome Measures: measure of platelet reactivity by VerifyNow assay after 600 mg loading dose or after the last maintenance dose (75 mg). - Secondary Outcome Measures: Time to first occurrence of major cardio-vascular events (MACE). - Safety Criteria: severe bleeding (GUSTO scale).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Assessment of Pidogrel速 Versus Plavix速 (CAPP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>after randomization of patients in both groups (Plavix or Pidogrel), the measure of platelet activity by the VerifyNow assay, 4 to 12 hours after the loading dose of 600mg or after the last dose of clopidogrel for patients on maintenance dose. The VerifyNow assay will determine: - The PRU:-P2Y12 Reaction Units- -% Of platelet inhibition It will be considered low responder or clopidogrel resistant patient with PRU&gt; 235 or %inhibition &lt;15%. Monitoring of patients included in the study will take place over a period of 12 months, MACE will be notified and dated. MACE criteria are: angina, myocardial infarction, coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass graft, and stroke. Each hemorrhagic event will be notified and classified according to the GUSTO scale.</detailed_description>
