	<brief_title>CBT for Patients With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Substance Use Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder(ADHD) is an important comorbid condition in patients with substance use disorders (SUD). The prevalence of ADHD in patients with SUD is estimated 23%, and ADHD is associated with an untoward prognosis of SUD. However, adequate treatment programs for patients with ADHD and SUD are not available. Results of medication trials for patients with ADHD and SUD are disappointing, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has not yet been investigated in this population. In patients with ADHD without comorbid SUD, the results of CBT in randomized trials are positive. The purpose of this study is to investigate if CBT is effective in treating ADHD symptoms in patients with ADHD and SUD.</detailed_description>
