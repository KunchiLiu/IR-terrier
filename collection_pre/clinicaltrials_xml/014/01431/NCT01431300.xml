	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the image quality of Ablavar-enhanced MR angiography of the central veins of the chest, and to determine whether dose reduction can be performed while maintaining image quality. This will be a prospective randomized study, in which healthy volunteers will be recruited to undergo a central veins magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA). They will receive either the FDA-approved dose or a lower dose of Ablavar. Quantitative and qualitative analysis will be performed on the images.</brief_summary>
