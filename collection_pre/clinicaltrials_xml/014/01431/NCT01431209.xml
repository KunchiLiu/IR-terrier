	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well giving ruxolitinib phosphate (oral JAK inhibitor INCB18424) works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell or peripheral T-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma and are ineligible to stem cell transplant or have recurrent disease after stem cell transplant. Ruxolitinib phosphate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ruxolitinib Phosphate (Oral JAK Inhibitor INCB18424) in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell or Peripheral T-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the overall response rate (ORR) of subjects with relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) who are relapsed or refractory to front-line treatment and ineligible for stem cell transplantation or have recurrent disease after stem cell transplantation to oral ruxolitinib. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate safety of oral ruxolitinib in subjects with DLBCL and PTCL. II. Determine progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response, and overall response (OS) in subjects with DLBCL and PTCL. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Explore the relationship between responses to oral ruxolitinib and alterations in gene expression profiling (GEP) signatures as well as biomarker immunophenotypic changes related to JAK2/STAT3, NF-ÎºB, BCR, PI3K/AKT, and mTOR pathways. II. Evaluate potential effect of oral ruxolitinib exposure on JAK2/STAT3 pathway inhibition in serial tumor samples. OUTLINE: Patients receive ruxolitinib phosphate (oral JAK inhibitor INCB18424) orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
