	<brief_title>Amoxicillin Bioequivalence Study Brazil - Fast</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is prospective, open-label, randomized, crossover, single dose, with 02 treatments, 02 sequences and 02 periods. The objective is to confirm if two formulations of Amoxicillin trihydrate, in the form powder for oral suspension, are bioequivalent. The test product is Amoxicillin trihydrate - Clamoxyl 500mg/5mL (Glaxo Wellcome Production.) in the form powder for oral suspension and reference product is Amoxil Â® 500mg/5mL (GlaxoSmithKline Mexico SA) in the form of powder for oral suspension. Twenty eight healthy volunteers, of both genders, were evaluated. The volunteers received, in each period, the reference or the test formulation, according to the randomization list, under fasting conditions. In each period blood samples are collected in the following times: 0.00 (prior to administration of medication); 0.25; 0.50; 0.75; 1.00; 1.25; 1.50; 1.75; 2.00; 2.50; 3.00; 4.00; 5.00; 6.00; 8.00 (after administration of medication). The comparative bioavailability of the two formulations was evaluated based in statistical comparisons of relevant pharmacokinetic parameters, obtained from data of drug concentrations in blood.</detailed_description>
