	<brief_summary>Kawasaki disease (KD) is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children in the developed world. Despite available treatment, 25% of children in San Diego County appropriately treated for KD develop coronary artery abnormalities that could lead to complications later in life, including heart attack. Although investigators can identify children with KD that have these coronary artery abnormalities, there is no approved additional treatment to decrease coronary artery inflammation and arrest or prevent damage to the coronary arteries. Inflammation and damage to the arterial wall is central to these coronary artery abnormalities. Statins, a class of drugs that is known for lowering cholesterol, have also been shown to decrease inflammation in general as well as at the level of the vessel wall. Therefore, the investigators propose to study the safety of the drug atorvastatin in children with coronary artery abnormalities from KD.</brief_summary>
