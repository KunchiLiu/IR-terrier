	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to determine whether ADT started before or after sipuleucel-T leads to a better immune system response. This study will also evaluate the safety of sipuleucel-T treatment, immune system responses over time, the characteristics of sipuleucel-T, and changes in prostate specific antigen (PSA) values over time.</brief_summary>
