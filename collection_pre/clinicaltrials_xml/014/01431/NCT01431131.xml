	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare two methods of ridge preservation in the maxillary anterior esthetic zone to determine the best method to establish adequate bone and soft tissue to accommodate implant placement. For the positive control group a mineralized cancellous allograft will be placed in the extraction socket. For the test group a mineralized cancellous allograft will be placed in the extraction socket plus an additional graft will be placed to overlay the facial surface of the socket that will be composed of bovine xenograft material. Outcomes will be clinical horizontal and vertical dimensional change and histologic analysis of the graft material at 4 months post-placement.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects met the eligibility criteria if they were at least 18 years of age and had one nonmolar tooth requiring extraction that would be replaced by a dental implant. Extraction sites were bordered by at least one tooth. Exclusion criteria included: 1) debilitating systemic diseases, or diseases that have a clinically significant effect on the periodontium; 2) molar extraction sites; 3) presence of or history of osteonecrosis of the jaws; 4) history of IV bisphosphonate treatment; 5) history of oral bisphosphonate treatment for more than three years; 6) pregnancy or lactation; 7) known allergy to any material or medication used in the study; 8) required antibiotic prophylaxis; 9) previous head and neck radiation therapy; 10) history of chemotherapy in the last 12 months; 11) long term steroid or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy; or 12) failure to sign an informed consent approved by the Human Studies Committee. Patients were excluded post-treatment if they developed infection or had an adverse reaction to any of the materials used in the study.</detailed_description>
