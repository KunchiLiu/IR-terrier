	<brief_summary>The investigators are hypothesizing that decreasing estrogen levels will cause serum DKK1 to peak, then decrease gradually as estrogens reach a new lower, but steady level. The investigators also believe that the peak in DKK1 will initiated a wave of stem cell diversion from the osteoblastogenic pathway to the adipogenic pathway. The investigators will conduct a longitudinal cohort study of post menopausal women with hormone-responsive breast cancer that will be treated AIs. The study will observe anthromorphic and serum marker changes during the first year of their treatment.</brief_summary>
