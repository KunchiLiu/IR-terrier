	<brief_summary>This study is being performed to confirm that the new technique, Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (MBIR) with reduced radiation dose can deliver equivalent image quality for CT scans compared to current techniques (Filtered Back Projection with Adaptive Statistical Iterative Reconstruction (FBP with ASiR) and also to demonstrate that MBIR can improve general image quality characteristics at equivalent radiation dose levels.</brief_summary>
