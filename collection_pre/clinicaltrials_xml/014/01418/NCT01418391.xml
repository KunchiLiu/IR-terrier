	<brief_summary>Transversus abdominis plane block (TAP block) is a new regional block for abdominal wall.It had been reported the effect of post-operative pain control in minor abdominal surgery, such as inguinal hernia repair and appendectomy. On the other hand, because of the accurate of the pre-operative images, the minimal laparotomy for colon cancer was accomplished. Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effect, such as analgesic effect, hemodynamic stability, and post-operative morphine consumption, of TAP block in minimal laparotomy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>the Effect of the Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) Block on the Minimal Laparotomy : a Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>outcome measures: - Hemodynamic parameters (mean artery pressure, heart rate): recorded at time points of before induction of general anesthesia (baseline), after tracheal intubation immediately, after surgery started 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min; then recorded them every 10 mins. - Post-operative morphine consumption: recorded morphine consumption at the time intervals of post-operative 0~6 h, 6~12 h, 12~24 h, 24~36 h, and 36~48 h ,respectively. The total amount of morphine consumption was also counted.</detailed_description>
