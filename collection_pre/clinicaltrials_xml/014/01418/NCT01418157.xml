	<brief_summary>Acute mountain sickness is a common ailment in people venturing over 2500 m altitude. Pilgrims to high altitudes are at an added risk since they are unaware and they gain height faster than the recommendations. Acetazolamide is the standard treatment and prophylaxis of acute mountain sickness. There are no randomized controlled trials that have studied protective effects of Acetazolamide in rapid ascent, and there are few conflicting studies regarding this matter. This study is a randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled trial of Acetazolamide versus placebo in 380 healthy individuals travelling to Gosaikunda Lake of Nepal in rates of ascent that are faster than the recommendations. Acetazolamide 125 mg twice daily and a placebo will be randomly assigned for 3 days and participants will be assessed at 3 stations. This study will undertake to establish the role of Acetazolamide in Rapid Ascent and will be the first RCT done in this issue. The investigators hypothesize that Acetazolamide 125mg twice daily given before rapid ascent to high altitude in Nepalese pilgrims will not be superior to placebo in decreasing both the incidence and severity of acute mountain sickness.</brief_summary>
