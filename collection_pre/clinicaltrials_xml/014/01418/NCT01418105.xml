	<brief_summary>The research is about a prospective study conducted in patients suffering from dysphagia and cervical spine disorders and how they are interrelated. Three questionnaires have been given to patients with neurologic deficits, the first of these investigates the occurence of dysphagia in the three stages of swallowing, the second looks into the quality of life following a stroke or other neurologic damage and the third analyses how cervical spine disorders can affect every day life. After the bedside examination, VFSS or FEES, the patients are submitted to swallowing and cervical resistance exercises in fixed time periods after their hospitalisation. The results will be collected and evaluated using the statistical programme SPSS.</brief_summary>
