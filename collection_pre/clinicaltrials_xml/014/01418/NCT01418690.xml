	<brief_summary>Adequate tissue oxygenation is required for effective white blood cell function and bactericidal activity. Decreased tissue oxygenation is a risk factor for perioperative wound infections. Regional anesthetic techniques result in a functional sympathetic block and may increase tissue oxygenation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in tissue oxygenation using a non-invasive Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) device. The current study will evaluate changes in tissue oxygenation following regional anesthetic techniques (peripheral nerve blockade and neuraxial techniques such as caudal block) in pediatric patients). Regional anesthesia will induce a sympathetic blockade and improve tissue oxygenation.</brief_summary>
