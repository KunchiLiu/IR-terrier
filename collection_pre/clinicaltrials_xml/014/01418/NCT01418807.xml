	<brief_summary>We hypothesise that pain at minilaparoscopy for gynecologic disease is reduced when transvaginal rather than transumbilical specimen extraction is accomplished. This would be due to the avoidance of a 10-mm port in the umbilicus. Visual analogue scale score of post-operative pain will be obtained and patients satisfaction will be asked at the 2-month postoperative visit.</brief_summary>
