	<brief_summary>This is a case series study evaluating the feasibility and dosage of Intensive Mobility Training (IMT). Twelve participants with chronic, mild-to-moderate, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) causing significant locomotor impairment, who meet these specific criteria, will be recruited. Location and nature of neural insult will be determined by multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exam. All participants will receive 3 hours of rehabilitation per day for 20 days, focusing on gait and balance. Locomotion and balance will be comprehensively tested prior to IMT, after 10 days of IMT, and then again after the full dose of IMT. This study will determine the feasibility of this intervention in the population of TBI patients, allow an estimate of effect size and provide initial information on possible neural predictors of success. Furthermore the investigators will be able to determine whether the dosage of 10 days is sufficient or whether significant improvements are made with 20 days of the intervention.</brief_summary>
