	<brief_summary>Visual field areas, which are not absolutely blind, are hypothesized to have some residual capacities that constitute their potential for vision restoration. Vision restoration can be achieved by varies methods including behavioral training and electrical brain stimulation such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and repetitive transorbital alternating current stimulation (rtACS) which are able to influence the excitability and activity of cortical areas. It is hypothesized that transorbital alternating current stimulation (tACS) can improve the residual field of vision in patients with post-chiasmatic lesions.</brief_summary>
