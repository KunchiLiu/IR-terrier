	<detailed_description>Cervical cancer has a very high morbidity. Many patients need additional therapy after surgery in order to elevate the survival rate and life quality. In this research, we are going to give additional therapy to patients who have big tumor, deep invasion or tumor thrombi in the vascular system after surgery. randomized control method will be used in this research, in order to compare the survival rate and side effects between radiation therapy only, concurrent chemoradiotherapy, and concurrent chemoradiotherapy with additional chemotherapy. 3D-CRT and Topotecan will be used in this research.</detailed_description>
