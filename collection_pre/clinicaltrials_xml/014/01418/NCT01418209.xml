	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of both low-dose oral (by mouth) 17-ß-estradiol and the non-hormonal drug venlafaxine XR compared to placebo in reducing hot flashes. Included in this objective is the intention to compare venlafaxine XR to estradiol therapy, to provide evidence of the relative efficacy of venlafaxine to what is currently considered the most established but also a controversial therapy. 17-ß-estradiol is a type of estrogen. Venlafaxine XR is the extended release (XR) version of venlafaxine. Venlafaxine XR is an serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). A placebo is a substance containing no medication.</brief_summary>
