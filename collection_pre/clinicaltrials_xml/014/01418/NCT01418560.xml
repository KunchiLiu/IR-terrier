	<brief_title>Renal Sympathetic Modification in Patients With Chronic Renal Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic renal failure is serial clinical manifestations because of kidney damage. Previous studies found sympathetic nerves over activity in chronic renal failure patients. Traditional therapies included medications and dialysis replacement therapy need to spend much money. Renal ablation for sympathetic modification is a new method which is proved to be effective in decreasing sympathetic nerves activity. We assume that modifying renal sympathetic activity by ablation is effective and safe in treatment of chronic renal failure. This trial is going to recruit 200 patients (Ablation group VS Control group = 1:1) with a follow-up duration of 3 years. Patients in ablation group will receive additional necessary medications besides expectant intervention, and patients in control group will receive appropriate medications only. We aim to observe the effect of serum creatinine, creatinine clearance rate, glomerular filtration rate, urine microalbumin, urine microalbumin/creatinine, and composite cardio cerebrovascular events after renal sympathetic modification using THERMOCOOL® catheter, and evaluate safety and efficacy of the intervention.</detailed_description>
