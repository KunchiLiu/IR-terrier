	<brief_summary>This study will expand the understanding of factors associated with adherence to self care and the diabetes control among diabetes type 2 patients. The theoretical framework of the study incorporates central variables from two theoretical models: a cognitive model of health behavior - "Health Belief Model", and the Stress and Coping model. The study is innovative in its focus on the association between the patient's attachment style and adherence to self care and diabetes control, a topic less studied among diabetes patients, in addition to cognitive, social and emotional variables. Further emphasis is upon a comparison of the study model between males and females.</brief_summary>
