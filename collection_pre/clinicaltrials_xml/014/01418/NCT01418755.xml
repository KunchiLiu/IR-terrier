	<brief_summary>Recently an articular cartilage repair has been given much attention in the orthopaedic field. Cartilage regeneration capacity is very limited. Optimal approach seems to be a delivery of natural growth factors. Autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) contains proliferative and chemoattractant growth factors. The objective of the present study was to determine if PRP can increase tibiofemoral cartilage regeneration and improve knee function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Platelet-rich Plasma in Treating Patients With Tibiofemoral Cartilage Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fifty consecutive and strictly selected patients, affected by Grade II or III chondromalacia, underwent one year treatment (9 injections) with autologous PRP in a liquid form with 2,0 to 2,5-fold platelets concentration. Outcome measures included hte Lysholm, Tegner, IKDC, and Cincinnati scores. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate cartilage thickness and degree of degeneration.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>isolated Grade II or Grade III nontraumatic chondromalacia according to Outerbridge grading scale Grade I (only softening) or Grade IV (exposed subchondral bone) tibiofemoral chondromalacia; patellofemoral chondral damage; associated intraarticular lesions confirmed during arthroscopy (menisci, ligaments, osteochondral defects); associated extraarticular lesions confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (ligaments, tendons, bursae); lower limb axial deviation confirmed by whole leg weightbearing radiograph; knee trauma in patients history; body mass index (BMI) higher than 35; hyaluronic acid intraarticular injection 6 months prior the arthroscopy and up to last followup control; steroids intraarticular injection 3 months prior the arthroscopy and up to last followup control; symptomatic slow acting drugs for osteoarthritis (SYSADOA) and/or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) administration during the PRP treatment; systemic autoimmune rheumatic and/or polyarticular disease; gout, pseudogout and hyperuricaemia. Other exclusion criteria included: noninformed consent; treated knee injury during the PRP therapy; PRP injection cycle not completed; impediments to fill out the questionnaires; blood disease and/or immunosuppressant treatment and/or dicoumarol therapy; immunosuppressant and/or neoplastic and/or infectious diseases.</criteria>
