	<brief_summary>The prevalence of NAFLD is 50-70% in obese people. A decrease of calorie intake and increase of physical activity are recommended as an effective approach for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. However, the exercise model for NAFLD intervention is understudied. In the present study we aim to compare the effect of intensive and conventional exercise interventions on NAFLD.</brief_summary>
