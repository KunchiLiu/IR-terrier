	<brief_summary>In our experience, elongation of foveal tissue after macular hole surgery which was undetectable by conventional time-domain optical coherence tomography was often observed on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography images. Elongation of tissues inevitably induces some degree of disorganization of tissue microstructure. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate elongation profile of foveal tissue after macular hole surgery and to investigate its impact on visual acuity and metamorphopsia.</brief_summary>
