	<brief_title>Improving Complete Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR) of Colorectal Neoplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of the study is to compare the efficacy, efficiency and safety of two types of snares used in Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR), a combined needle and snare unit (ISnare, US Endoscopy) versus an oval braided snare with spiral wire (Snaremaster, Olympus). The secondary aim is to explore whether EMR efficacy and efficiency is depended upon the injection solution used, saline versus Gonak (a solution containing HPMC, saline, and epinephrine) for EMR.</detailed_description>
