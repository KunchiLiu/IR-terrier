	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine and compare the effect of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP38) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) on intracranial arteries and neuronal activity in patients with migraine without aura using a high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including MR angiography (MRA) and functional MRI (fMRI). MRA will be used to detect changes in intracranial artery circumferences before and after PACAP38 and VIP. fMRI will be used oo detect changes in blood-oxygenation-level-dependent-signal (BOLD-signal). PACAP38 but not VIP induces migraine like attacks in migraine patients. The migraine specific drug sumatriptan will be given to relieve pain and the effect will also be registered using MRA and fMRI.</brief_summary>
