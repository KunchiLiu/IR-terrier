	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness, the safety, and the tolerability of intranasal ketorolac (Sprix) in relieving acute pain in adults ages 18-64 who come to the ED seeking care. Considering all ED visits, pain is the most common chief complaint. Giving intranasal ketorolac (Sprix) after stomach and dental surgeries has been shown to be safe and effective, but no studies have investigated the use of intranasal ketorolac (Sprix) for the treatment of acute pain in the ED. Ketorolac (Sprix) has several advantages over other drugs commonly given for pain, including opioids. Ketorolac (Sprix) is non-addicting and has fewer side effects than opioids. The administration of ketorolac (Sprix) by other methods, such as IV, intramuscular shot, and oral pill form, has been shown to be safe and effective in treating acute pain. This study is being done to find out if giving ketorolac (Sprix) as a single dose nasal spray will have the same benefit in decreasing patient's pain.</brief_summary>
