	<brief_summary>Purpose: The investigators are proposing to examine the use of Savella® (Milnacipran) for treating irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in women. Participants: Eligible participants will meet the Rome III diagnostic criteria for IBS. Procedures: This study will observe patients treated with Savella® as well as patients treated with a placebo (pill with no active drug). The investigators will monitor and compare several patient and symptom related outcomes, as well as evaluate health related quality of life, psychological distress and related psychosocial measures to determine if the addition of Savella® improves clinical pain response as well as secondary outcomes including quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Milnacipran (Savella) in Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized primarily by abdominal pain associated with bowel dysfunction. Like many other painful functional somatic syndromes (e.g. fibromyalgia) the pathophysiology of IBS includes abnormal responses to pain and dysregulation of brain-body pain pathways. IBS affects up to 10% of the population, is a leading reason for visits to gastroenterologists and primary care doctors, and, in the United States, annually accrues health care costs over $20 billion. In their practice the investigators use centrally acting agents to treat IBS. Historically, the investigators have used tricyclic antidepressants based on results of clinical trials, including our NIH funded trial on desipramine. Nonetheless, these agents can produce side effects that limit their full application. More recently the investigators have begun to use SNRIs because they have been shown to benefit for various pain syndromes like diabetic neuropathy, fibromyalgia. The initial impression is that Milnacipran helps improve IBS symptoms and global well being. There is now a need to systematically determine Milnacipran's value for IBS.</detailed_description>
