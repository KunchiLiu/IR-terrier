	<criteria>For more information regarding BMS clinical trial participation, please visit www.BMSStudyConnect.com Key Males and females, 18 to 70 years of age Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1a or 1b HCVtreatment naive HCV RNA &gt;10,000 IU/mL at screening HIV1 infection (approximately 250 patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy [HAART], up to 50 patients not receiving HAART) For patients receiving HAART, HIV RNA must be below &lt;40 copies/mL at screening and must be &lt;400 copies/ml for at least 6 months prior to screening Key Patients receiving HAART who first initiated antiretroviral therapy within the last 6 months of Day 1 Patients receiving HAART who have changed their antiretroviral regimen due to safety or efficacy associated to HIV treatment within the last 3 months prior to Day 1. However, if changes are required to a patient's HAART regimen to meet the requirements of the protocol, these changes are allowed at the screening visit. The patient should wait a minimum of 1 month prior to Day 1 after a repeat of HIV viral load has been confirmed, &lt;40 copies/ mL Use of prohibited HAART regimens within 1 month of Day 1 and throughout the treatment period of the trial (patients receiving HAART who have changed their antiretroviral regimen to initiate any HCV treatment within 6 weeks prior to Day 1) Laboratory values: 1. Neutrophil count &lt;1500 cells/μL (&lt;1200 cells/ μL for Blacks) 2. Platelet count &lt;90,000 cells/μL 3. Hemoglobin ≤12 g/dL for females, hemoglobin ≤13 g/dL for males 4. Total bilirubin ≥34 μmol/L (or ≥2 mg/dL) unless a patient has a documented history of Gilbert's disease or antiretroviral regimen contains atazanavir 5. Alanine aminotransferase ≥5*upper limit of normal</criteria>
