	<brief_summary>In the past, the investigators often treated giant cavernous hemangiomas of the liver by hepatectomy.Recently RFA and laparoscopic hepatectomy are also available and could be applied to cure this disease.But we can't get a clear answer about their effectiveness and safety. Hence the investigators conduct this study to explore the effectiveness and efficiency of the these two methods and compare their short to mid-term outcomes.</brief_summary>
