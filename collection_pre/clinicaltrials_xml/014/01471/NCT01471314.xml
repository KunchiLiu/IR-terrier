	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine migraineurs during spontaneous migraine attacks without aura, using high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to study following: - Changes in resting state blood-oxygenation-level-dependent-signal (BOLD-signal) using functional MRI (fMRI). - Changes in circumferences of intra- and extracranial arteries using MR-angiography (MRA). - Changes in regional and global cerebral blood flow (CBF) using the arterial spin labeling (ASL) method. Moreover to perform diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans during spontaneous migraine attacks. The migraine specific drug sumatriptan will be given to relieve pain and the effect will be registered using MRA and fMRI if possible.</brief_summary>
