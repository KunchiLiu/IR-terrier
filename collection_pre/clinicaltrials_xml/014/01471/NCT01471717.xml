	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics and Safety of INX-08189 Administered With VictrelisTM in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled study in thirty-two 18 to 55 year old, male and female, healthy adult volunteers. Primary Objectives: Pharmacokinetic - To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of INX-08189 and INX-08032 when INX-08189 is dosed alone as compared to when dosed in combination with Victrelis - To characterize the PK profile of Victrelis when dosed alone as compared to when dosed in combination with INX-08189 Safety - To evaluate the safety of INX-08189 and Victrelis when dosed alone and when dosed in combination</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subjects must meet the following criteria at the Screening Visit (Visit1), in order to be eligible for study drug administration at Study Day 0 (Visit 3): 1. Must be a healthy male or female between 18 and 55 years of age (inclusive) with body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m2 (inclusive), and weigh â‰¥ 50 kg at the time of signing the informed consent; 2. Capable of giving written informed consent that includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. Signed informed consent must be on file prior to screening procedures; 3. Subject is able to understand and comply with the protocol requirements, instructions and restrictions; 4. Must be a nontobacco user for at least 3 months prior to selection; 5. Healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs, electrocardiogram and clinical laboratory tests at screening; 6. Women must be postmenopausal for at least 2 years or be surgically sterile with complete hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, and not be pregnant nor breastfeeding; 7. Male subjects, who are not surgically sterile with vasectomy, must agree to use a double barrier method of birth control, such as, a condom plus spermicidal agent (foam/gel/film/cream/suppository). This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until 30 days after the last dose of medication. Male subjects cannot donate sperm during the study and for 3 months after receiving the last dose of the study drug. Subjects must NOT meet the following criteria at the Screening Visit (Visit1), in order to be eligible for study drug administration at Study Day 0 (Visit 3): 1. Infection with Hepatitis A, B or C Virus; 2. Infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV); 3. History of or any current medical condition which could impact the safety of the participant in the study; 4. Current active or underlying gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, neurologic, psychiatric, metabolic, renal, hepatic, respiratory, inflammatory, or infectious disease; 5. Clinically significant abnormalities on centrally read ECG; 6. Currently significant diarrhea, gastric stasis, or constipation that in the investigator's opinion could influence drug absorption or bioavailability; 7. Safety laboratory abnormalities at screening which are clinically significant, or absolute neutrophil count of &lt; 1800 cells/mm3, or platelet count &lt; 130,000 cells/mm3, or hemoglobin &lt; 12 g/dl for women and &lt; 13 g/dl for men; 8. Women of child bearing potential; 9. Pregnant or breastfeeding; 10. Current abuse of alcohol or illicit drugs, or history of alcohol or illicit drug abuse within the preceding two years; 11. A positive urine drug test at screening; 12. Consumption of more than 2 units of alcoholic beverages per day or more than 14 units per week (1 unit of alcohol equals 1 glass of beer, 1 glass of wine, 25ml shot of 40% spirit), consumption of alcohol 72 hours before or after study medication intake, consumption of an average of more than five 240 ml servings of coffee or other caffeinated beverages per day; 13. Use of chronic prescription medications within 3 months, acute prescription medications within 14 days, or systemic overthecounter (OTC) medications, including vitamins, within 7 days of starting the study; 14. Received an investigational drug or vaccine within 30 days or 5 half lives, whichever is longer, from the receipt of a small molecule or 90 days or 5 half lives, whichever is longer, from the receipt of a large biological molecule prior to Study Day 0, or used an investigational medical device within 30 days prior to Study Day 0, or having participated previously in a study with INX08189.</criteria>
