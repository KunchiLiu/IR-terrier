	<brief_summary>The recurrence and metastasis of peritoneum is always the lethal consequence for gastric cancer patients, and there is no effective therapy until now. It has been reported by Dr.Fujimoto that intraperitoneal chemotherapy plus hyperthermic therapy, which called hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), can eliminate and suppress the free cancer cells and tiny metastasis in abdomen. Refer to the experience of systematic chemotherapy, HIPEC with combination regimen would have a brighter prospect. In this study, the investigators would use Oxaliplatin and paclitaxel sequent as HIPEC regimen. The safety and overall survival would be observed and evaluated.</brief_summary>
