	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if dasatinib can help prevent breast cancer from developing in the unaffected breast. Dasatinib is designed to decrease the activity of one or more proteins that are responsible for the uncontrolled growth of tumor cells.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 3 study groups: - If you are in Group 1, you will take dasatinib 40mg once a day by mouth with water. - If you are in Group 2, you will take dasatinib 80mg once a day by mouth with water. - If you are in Group 3, you will not receive dasatinib. You will be given a study drug diary to complete. In the diary, you will record when you take the study drug. Study Visits: At Month 1: - You will be called by a nurse and asked about any drugs you are taking and side effects you may be having. - You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and side effects you may be having. - Your drug diary will be reviewed. At Month 2 you will be called by a nurse and asked about any drugs you are taking and side effects you may be having. You will also be asked to review your drug diary. This call will take about 20 minutes At Month 3 (or if you leave the study early): - You will have a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of the breast for biomarker testing. Biomarkers are found in the blood/tissue and may be related to your reaction to the study drug. - Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing. - You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and side effects you may be having. - Your drug diary will be reviewed. Length of Study: You may remain on study for up to 3 months. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. This is an investigational study. Dasatinib is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of leukemia. Its use in breast cancer patients in investigational. Up to 66 patients will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 60 will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histological confirmation of ER negative breast carcinoma, stage I, II, or III 2. Completed all adjuvant therapy including (if indicated) endocrine, trastuzumab, radiation therapy 3. At least 18 years of age. 4. Female: A female is eligible to enter and participate in the study if she is of: a. Nonchildbearing potential (i.e., women with functioning ovaries who have a current documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy, or women who are postmenopausal); or b. Childbearing potential (i.e., women with functioning ovaries and no documented impairment of oviductal or uterine function that would cause sterility. This category includes women with oligomenorrhoea (severe), women who are perimenopausal, and young women who have begun to menstruate), has a negative serum pregnancy test at screening, and agrees to one of the following where considered acceptable to the local IRB/IEC: • Doublebarrier contraception (condom with spermicidal jelly, foam suppository, or film; diaphragm with spermicide; or male condom and diaphragm). • Abstinence from sexual intercourse from 2 weeks prior to administration of the investigational product, throughout the active study treatment period. 5. (Continued from above) • Male partner who is sterile prior to the female subject's entry into the study and is the sole sexual partner for that female subject. • Any intrauterine device (IUD). • Barrier methods including diaphragm or condom with a spermicide. 6. Able to swallow and retain oral medication. 7. ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status 0 to 2. 8. Provided written informed consent. 9. Adequate bone marrow function: Hemoglobin &gt;/= 9 gm/dL. • Absolute granulocyte count &gt;/= 1,500/mm^3 (1.5 x 10^9/L). • Platelets &gt;/= 75,000/mm^3 (100 x 10^9/L). 10. Serum creatinine &lt; 1.4 mg/dL or calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt;/= 30 mL/min 11. Total bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 times the upper limit of the reference range 12. Aspartate and alanine transaminase (AST or ALT) &lt;/= 2 times the upper limit of the reference range. 13. Patients must have a baseline ECG with QTcF within the normal range within 28 days prior to registration. 14. Normal mammogram of unaffected breast within 12 months prior to study entry. 1. Unwillingness to undergo RPFNA. 2. Contraindication to RPFNA including breast implant(s), bilateral radiation, anticoagulation. 3. Concurrent medical condition that would increase drug toxicity: Pleural or pericardial effusion, coagulation or platelet function disorder, ongoing or recent (less than 3 months gastrointestinal bleeding) 4. Uncontrolled angina, congestive heart failure, MI (within last 6 months), congenital long QT syndrome, history of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia, prolonged QTcF interval on preentry EKG (greater than normal range) 5. Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia if it cannot be corrected 6. Is a pregnant or lactating female. 7. Has evidence of recurrent or metastatic (Stage IV) breast cancer. 8. Is considered medically unfit for the study by the investigator as a result of the medical interview, physical exam, or screening investigations. 9. Has a known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to dasatinib 10. Has received treatment with any investigational drug in the previous 4 weeks. 11. Has received chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy or endocrine therapy within the past 12 weeks. 12. Is currently receiving oral steroid treatment (inhaled steroids are permitted) 13. Oral estrogen, progesterone, testosterone therapy within last 3 months. 14. Concomitant Medications, consider the following prohibitions (Drugs must be discontinued for 7 days prior to starting protocol therapy): Drugs that are generally accepted to have a risk of causing Torsades de Pointes including : quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, amiodarone, sotalol, ibutilide, dofetilide erythromycins, clarithromycin, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, mesoridazine, thioridazine, pimozide, cisapride, bepridil, droperidol, methadone, arsenic, chloroquine, domperidone, halofantrine, levomethadyl, pentamidine, sparfloxacin, lidoflazine. The concomitant use of H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors with dasatinib is not recommended. The use of antacids should be considered in place of H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors in patients receiving dasatinib therapy. Patient agrees to discontinue St. John's Wort while receiving dasatinib therapy 15. Patient may not be receiving any prohibited CYP3A4 inhibitors</criteria>
