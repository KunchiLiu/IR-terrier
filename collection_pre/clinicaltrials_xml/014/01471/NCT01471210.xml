Target Population Subjects with advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors or BNHL who are either refractory to or have relapsed from standard therapies, or for whom a standard therapy does not exist with measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria Life expectancy of 12 weeks or greater Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 1 Adequate organ and marrow function For certain subjects, willing and able to provide pre and posttreatment fresh tumor biopsies 3. Age and Reproductive Status Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men must be using an acceptable method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for at least 4 weeks prior to initiation of dosing, and for at least 60 days after the last dose of investigational product in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test [minimum sensitivity 25 UI/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG)] within 24 hours prior to the start of investigational product Women must not be breastfeeding 1. Target Disease Exceptions Subjects with known or suspected brain metastasis unless previously treated and without evidence of progression Subjects with a history of prior malignancy active within the previous 2 years except for locally curable cancers that have been apparently cured Subjects with hepatocellular carcinoma 2. Medical History and Concurrent Diseases Any active autoimmune disease or documented history of autoimmune disease, or history of syndrome that required systemic steroids or immunosuppressive medications, except for subjects with vitiligo, psoriasis inactive within past 2 years, resolved childhood asthma/atopy, or thyroid disease controlled by replacement therapy without the need for immunosuppression Known or suspected human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis A(acute), B or C infection History of any hepatitis (e.g., alcohol or nonalcohol steatohepatitis (NASH), drugrelated, autoimmune) Evidence of active infection, requiring parenteral antibacterial, antiviral or antifungal therapy &lt; 7 days prior to administration of study medication History of clinically significant cardiac disease, including but not limited to a history (personal or family) of congenital long QT syndrome Grade &gt; 1 QTc prolongation at baseline (&gt; 450 msec by Bazett formula) confirmed by a repeat electrocardiogram (ECG) History of myocardial infarction or uncontrolled angina within 12 months prior to administration of study drug 3. Physical and Laboratory Test Findings WOCBP who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method to avoid pregnancy for the entire study period and for up to 12 weeks after the last dose of investigational product Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding Women with a positive pregnancy test on enrollment or prior to investigational product administration Sexually active fertile men not using effective birth control if their partners are WOCBP Positive blood screen for hepatitis A IgM, hepatitis C antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, or HIV1, 2 antibody 4. Allergies and Adverse Drug Reaction History of allergy to Urelumab (BMS663513) or related compounds History of significant drug allergy (such as anaphylaxis or hepatotoxicity) to a prior biologic therapy 5. Prohibited Treatments and/or Therapies The systemic use of the following therapies are prohibited within 28 days of first dose of study medication, or longer where indicated: 1. Use of anticancer treatment (including investigational drugs) within 28 days 2. Immunosuppressive medications or immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids 3. Surgery (except minor surgeries,e.g., biopsies) or radiotherapy 4. Any nononcology live viral vaccine therapies used for the prevention of infectious diseases. Prior treatment with antiprogrammed death 1 (antiPD1)/Programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PDL1) or antiCD137 Any subject with the following reported drugrelated adverse events on anti Cytotoxic TLymphocyte Antigen 4 (antiCTLA4) will not be permitted on study: hepatic, diarrhea/colitis or endocrine adverse events (AE)s Grade ≥ 2, any other nonlaboratory immunerelated AE ≥ Grade 3. Subjects must have minimum 9 week washout period between the last dose of antiCTLA4 and the first dose Urelumab (BMS663513) Prior organ allograft or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation 6.
