	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis of ocular hypertension, primary openangle or pigment dispersion glaucoma in both eyes. On a stable regimen intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering medication within 30 days of screening visit. IOP considered to be safe (in the opinion of the investigator) in both eyes in such a way that should assure clinical stability of vision and the optic nerve throughout the study period. Willing to discontinue use of all other ocular drugs (prescribed and overthecounter) prior to receiving the screening dose during Screening Visit and for the course of the study. Other protocoldefined inclusion criteria may apply. Known medical history of allergy, hypersensitivity, or poor tolerance to any component of the preparations to be used in this study that is deemed clinical significant in the opinion of the Principal Investigator. Corneal dystrophies in either eye. Risk of visual field or visual acuity worsening as a consequence of participating in this study, in the investigator's best judgment. Bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that would preclude the safe administration of a topical betablocker. History of severe allergic rhinitis. Participation in any other investigational study within 30 days prior to the Screening/Baseline Visit. Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
