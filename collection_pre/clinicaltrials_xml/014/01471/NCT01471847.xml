	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, phase Ib/ II study (two parts) with patients that have locally advanced or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer. The first part (phase Ib) will investigate the MTD/ RP2D of the combination therapy of BEZ235 BID and weekly trastuzumab using a Bayesian model. Once MTD/ RP2D is established the second part (phase II) will start. Phase II will evaluate the efficacy and the safety of weekly trastuzumab plus BEZ235 BID compared to capecitabine and lapatinib.</brief_summary>
