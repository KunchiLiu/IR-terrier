	<brief_summary>The main objective is to evaluate the oncologic efficacy of percutaneous cryoablation of renal tumors smaller than 4 cm in patients with renal cancer that cannot be offered a partial nephrectomy. The oncologic outcome will be assessed by the presence or absence of residue or recurrence during a follow-up by MRI performed the first 12 months (M1, M3, M6, M12).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients should have the following characteristics: About 75 years, or Whatever the age: A context of familytype tumor (VHL, hereditary carcinoma, tubulopapillary ...); or solitary kidney, when the tumor is not easily accessible for nephronsparing surgery: Malignant centrohilar or intraparenchymal; or in a local recurrence (single or multiple) after partial nephrectomy (within a limit of 3 tumors to be treated); or in a subject with impaired renal function and therefore at risk of severe renal insufficiency (risk defined by a creatinine clearance below 30 ml / min by MDRD formula); and who do not present any contraindication for cryoablation treatment. The tumor(s) should meet the following criteria: Presence of one to three solid tumors of the native renal parenchyma with a largest diameter less than (or equal to) 40 mm, which corresponds to a maximum volume of about 32 cc, as measured by MRI. A preoperative MRI is essential since this technique presents a higher sensitivity. This control will also give more consistency to the evaluation of the radiological semiology at followup. And its/their location(s) will be accessible to a percutaneous approach. The search of metastases, including a thoracic CT scan, should be negative. Exclusion Criter ia: Partial nephrectomy feasible in good technical and oncologic conditions in patients under 75 years and in the absence of family tumors. Contraindication to any form of sedation. Irreversible coagulopathy Tumor&gt; 4cm Contraindication to MRI or gadolinium (proven allergy). NB: Patients with a glomerular filtration rate below 30 ml/min/1, 73 m2 will be injected with a single dose of the macrocyclic gadolinium with the highest thermodynamic stability (Dotarem or Prohance), given the united recommendations of AFSSAPS and EMA (European Medicines Agency) [45]. On the contrary, the linear molecules of gadolinium, due to their lower stability, will be contraindicated because of the risk of systemic nephrogenic fibrosis (FNS). Recurrence on the same location after a procedure performed out of the thermoablation protocol. Biopsy proven benign tumor Predominantly cystic tumor, defined by a necrotic content constituting over one third of tumor volume Presence of endovenous extension, of proven secondary extensions, visceral or in the lymph nodes (especially lung). In this regard, a thoracic CT scan will be routinely required before treatment, according to the recommendations of urological societies.
