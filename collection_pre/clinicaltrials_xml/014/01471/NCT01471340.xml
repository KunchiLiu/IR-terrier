	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety of DULERA. DULERA is a pressurized metered-dose inhaler (MDI) that contains two drugs combined, namely mometasone and formoterol in a single inhaler. Mometasone is an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), which reduces the inflammation in the airways. Formoterol is a long-acting beta 2 agonist (LABA), which helps to relax the muscles of the airways in the lungs, making it easier to breathe. In combination, mometasone and formoterol are used for the treatment of asthma. This study will evaluate whether participants taking a LABA in combination with an ICS in a single inhaler have a different risk of having serious asthma events (hospitalization, intubation and death) compared to participants taking an ICS alone.</brief_summary>
