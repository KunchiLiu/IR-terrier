	<detailed_description>Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a key mediator in the pathogenesis of established asthmatic disease. Tralokinumab is a human monoclonal antibody that blocks IL-13, which may result in improved control of asthma. This study will determine whether the addition of tralokinumab to standard asthma medications results in a reduced rate of asthma exacerbations in subjects with severe asthma.</detailed_description>
