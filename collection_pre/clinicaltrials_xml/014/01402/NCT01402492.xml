	<brief_title>Cocaine Use Reduction With Buprenorphine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project will assess the utility of buprenorphine in the presence of naltrexone as a potential medication useful in reducing cocaine use, commencing a research direction of great importance to both theoretical and practical addiction medicine. Buprenorphine will be provided as sublingual buprenorphine+naloxone tablets (Suboxone®, "BUP"). Naltrexone will be provided as extended-release naltrexone by injection (Vivitrol®, "XR-NTX"). In this multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, participants will randomly assigned to one of three medication conditions: 4mg buprenorphine plus naltrexone (BUP4+XR-NTX), 16mg buprenorphine plus naltrexone (BUP16+XR-NTX), or placebo plus naltrexone (PLB+XR-NTX) for 8 weeks of treatment. Participants will be scheduled for clinic visits three times weekly (for a total of 24 visits across the 8-week treatment period) for observed medication administration, provision of take-home medication, collection of safety, medical, drug use, psychological, and compliance measures. In addition, all participants will be scheduled for once-weekly individual Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) sessions. This protocol will explore the effects of these three medication conditions to test buprenorphine as a possible treatment for cocaine dependence. This study will advance the science, provide dosing information, and characterize the effects of the combination of the two medications in this population.</detailed_description>
