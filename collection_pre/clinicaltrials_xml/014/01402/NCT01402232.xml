	<brief_title>Reduction of Risk for Contrast Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. To identify risk factors of contrast-induced nephropathy on the base of literatures and the dates of our previous researches. 2. To develop a predictive model of contrast-induced nephropathy after coronary or percutaneous coronary intervention. 3. To raise optimal strategies for reduction of risk of contrast-induced nephropathy according to several combinations of different risk factors and clinical practice and determine and supply the guidance for clinical practice.</detailed_description>
