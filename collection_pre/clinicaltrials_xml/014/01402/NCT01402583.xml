	<brief_summary>Menopause represents a critical period in a woman's life as the hormonal changes and the failing ovarian function not only determine relevant modifications in the reproductive function but also in many other conditions and organs that apparently are scarcely linked with hormones. The PI's centre has among its main goals the treatment of chronic liver disease; in the last years, a increasing interest in gender-related issues has grown. Goal of this study is to verify the impact of menopause on response to antiviral therapy for CHC and in determining more severe fibrosis in comparison with age-matched men. To achieve this goal a database of all the PEG IFN/Ribavirin patients treated in the GI Unit of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia in the last 7 years will be set up. Demographic, clinical and biochemical data as well data regarding the reproductive history, time, type, length of estrogen deprivation and of hormone-replacement therapy will be collected.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Menopause is a Critical Factor in Determining Failure of Antiviral Therapy in Women With Chronic Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is designed retrospective epidemiological cohort study. Overall, a group of 442 women (168 still in fertile age; 274 menopausal) with HCV-positive CAH who underwent PEG IFN treatment in the last 5 years will be evaluated. For comparison, a group of 548 HCV-positive males with CAH will be evaluated. Liver biopsies before undergoing standard antiviral therapy will be scored for fibrosis, inflammation and steatosis. In women the presence, type and timing of menopause, associated hormonal/metabolic features and serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and hepatic tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels will be evaluated. The primary endpoint will be evaluation of SVR in females (in fertile and menopausal age) and in males.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All women treated for HCV chronic hepatitis, at the Unit Gastroenterology, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, in the last 7 years. Control group is a cohort matched for age (ratio 1:1) selected from a group of 558 men with chronic HCV treated in the same period No exclusion criteria aret predefined as the study includes all patients who were treated for chronic HCV hepatitis; exclusion was made upstream of the constitution of this cohort.</criteria>
