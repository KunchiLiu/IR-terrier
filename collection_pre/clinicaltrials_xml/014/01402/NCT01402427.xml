	<brief_summary>Background Verapamil is traditionally applied prophylactically in transradial procedures to prevent radial artery spasm. However, verapamil may have side effects and is contraindicated in some clinical settings. Methods: During an investigator‐initiated, randomized, double‐blind trial, we evaluate the need for preventive verapamil administration. After vascular access is established, patients receive either 5 mg verapamil (n=297) or placebo (n=294). We compare the rate of access site conversions as primary end point using a superiority margin of 5%. Occurrence of code breaks (composite of conversions and unplanned use of verapamil), overall verapamil use, procedural and fluoroscopic times, contrast volume, and subjective pain are investigated as secondary end points.</brief_summary>
