	<brief_summary>Chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is one of the few mostly observed distressing toxicity of cancer treatment. It can occur up to 90% in case of highly emetogenic chemotherapy use. CINV causes disturbance in daily living of cancer patient and reduces compliance with treatment Even with the standard anti-emetic measures up to 50% patient can suffer from this complication. Whereas there is standard anti-emetic guideline exists in case of adult patients, there no such guidelines made in pediatric population. The new drug Aprepitant has been recommended for use in adults with high efficacy, there no such concrete data available in children regarding its use. There are few retrospective reports and limited data available regarding use of Aprepitant in children with satisfactory efficacy in reducing CINV. As there no randomized large data to suggests its efficacy and its routine use in children, we have planned this study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate Anti-emetic Effect of Aprepitant Versus Placebo in Children and Adolescent Receiving Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Population: Children and adolescents (5-18 years) with weight between 15-65 kg receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) - - VAC (vincristine, dactinomycin/Adriamycin, cyclophosphamide) - ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) - Cisplatin/Doxorubicin Sampling technique Subjects who met the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned using random allocation number generated by computer into one of the two groups. The unit of randomization will be the subject at first cycle of HEC. The same patient will not be enrolled for twice Procedure for data collection: 1. The data will be collected from each patient from d1 to d10 of chemotherapy of which patient will received chemotherapy in day care, maximum up to d3. 2. After taking consent patient will be enrolled as per inclusion and exclusion criteria, and randomized to one of two groups. All baseline assessment will be done. Patient will be explained about the filling of the diary. In first 2 days. The subjects will fill the diary under the investigator supervision, and the rest of filling will be in home. Reinforcement will be done over phone. Procedure of double blinding - Double blinding will be done for the intervention. Four different boxes will be made for capsules. Total 3 capsules for 3 days will be made in a blister pack, mentioning the d1, d2, d3 (for each capsule). Two different body weight groups will be made: 15-40 kg, and 41-65 kg. - Group "A" will be the code for Aprepitant group and group "B" will be code for control group. Both patient and the investigator will be blinded regarding medicine in the code.</detailed_description>
