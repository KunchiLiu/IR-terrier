	<brief_title>Clinical Assessment Of Age-related Macular Degeneration Patients After Early Diagnosis and Treatment With Ranibizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will conduct an open label, multi-center study of naïve AMD patients that are identified early upon disease progression (had a normal VA, FA or OCT within 4 months prior to entry) to assess if treating with ranibizumab monthly can restore all patients to their baseline vision pre-AMD. Recent randomized clinical trials (MARINA, ANCHOR) have conclusively demonstrated that continued intravitreal therapy with ranibizumab in patients with subfoveal CNV from AMD leads to stabilization of vision in over 90% of patients and improvement in vision in at least a third of the patients and has led to the approval of ranibizumab (0.5 mg) for the treatment of neovascular AMD. Patients will receive monthly intravitreal ranibizumab injections for 12 months (with dose holding for return to baseline/ 20/20 or better and no evidence of fluid on SD-OCT or FA). All patients will have ETDRS vision and SD-OCT, and complete exam at each monthly visit. Patients will each have a blood analysis for genetics (either during the GALLEY study in which they converted to wet AMD and entered COMPASS or during this study).</detailed_description>
