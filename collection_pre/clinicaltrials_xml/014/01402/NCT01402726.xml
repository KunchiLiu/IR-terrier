	<brief_title>Renal Sympathetic Modification in Patients With Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure is a clinical syndrome of chronic cardiac dysfunction, with high morbidity and mortality. Traditional pharmacological therapies are used in clinical practice without breakthrough for long time. Previous studies confirmed that partly blocking sympathetic nerves activity contributed to improve cardiac function in patients with heart failure. Renal ablation with sympathetic modification is a new method which is proved to be effective in decreasing sympathetic nerves activity. The investigators hypothesis that renal sympathetic nerves modification is effective and safe in improving cardiac function. This trial is going to recruit 200 patients (Ablation group VS Control group = 1:1) with a follow-up duration of 3 years. Patients in ablation group will receive additional necessary anti-heart failure drugs besides expectant intervention, and patients in control group will receive appropriate anti-heart failure drugs only. The investigators aim to observe the incident of composite cardiovascular events after renal sympathetic modification using THERMOCOOL® catheter in patients with heart failure, and evaluate safety and efficacy of the intervention.</detailed_description>
