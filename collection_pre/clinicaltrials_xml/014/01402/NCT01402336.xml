	<brief_summary>GnRH (Gonadotropin-releasing hormone) antagonists in IVF (in vitro fertilization) has been accomplished by several randomized controlled trials compared with conventional GnRH agonist long protocol in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients. Moreover, there are debating issues that refer to the timing of GnRH antagonist initiation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the laboratory and clinical priority during ovarian stimulation for IVF in patients with PCOS treated with three different protocols.</brief_summary>
