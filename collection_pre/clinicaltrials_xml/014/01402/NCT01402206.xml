	<brief_summary>Most people in Sweden with mild to moderate depression are treated in primary care, but follow-up is unstructured, and we know little about whether structured, follow-up would affect the prognosis for depression and working life. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of regular, structured, patient-centered visits on mild to moderate depression.</brief_summary>
