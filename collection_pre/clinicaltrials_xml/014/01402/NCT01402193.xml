T1, T2, N0 with mastectomy Noninfiltrative breast carcinoma underwent mastectomy Other malignant tumor (concurrent or previous). Positive surgical margins. Patients with demonstrated hypersensitivity to Arimidex or any excipient. Patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 20 ml/min). Patients with moderate or severe hepatic disease. Oestrogencontaining therapies should not be coadministered with Arimidex as they would negate its pharmacological action.
