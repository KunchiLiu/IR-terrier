	<brief_summary>Clefts or invaginations of the gingival tissue are a frequent finding during orthodontic space closure after extraction of a tooth. They occur in about 35% of the cases. Increased risk of developing a gingival cleft is given in the mandibular arch. A gingival invagination impairs aesthetics, orthodontic treatment and periodontal health. The aim of this prospective split-mouth designed observer blinded study is to evaluate possible differences between tooth movement in recent or in healed extraction sockets on incidence of gingival clefts. We hypothesize, that similar to the results originated from an animal study immediate movement in extraction sockets reduces incidence of gingival clefts during orthodontic space closure.</brief_summary>
