	<brief_summary>Major interest in our investigation is to find out whether distinct fixation techniques influence catheter dislocation and/ or incidence of local inflammation. A systematic comparison of two different fixation techniques with regard to catheter location, analgetic potential and signs of local inflammation will be conducted. To ensure identical patients groups allocation will be strictly randomized. Furthermore, both patient groups will receive identical pain medication via the peridural catheter in situ. All catheter tips will be screened microbiologically after removal.</brief_summary>
