	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) on subjects with chronic musculoskeletal pain. The investigators hypothesize that subjects will show a decrease in pain symptoms in the active anodal stimulation group when compared to sham stimulation.</brief_summary>
