	<brief_title>A Phase III Study of PI-88 in the Adjuvant Treatment of Subjects With Hepatitis Virus Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma After Surgical Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma or HCC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide. Surgery to remove the tumour remains the principal form of treatment for liver cancer, however recurrence of the disease after surgery is common and survival after recurrence is poor. At the moment there is no recommended standard treatment for HCC immediately after the tumour has been removed surgically. PI-88 is a new experimental drug which blocks the growth of new blood vessels in tumours to stop the tumour growing (starves it of food) and also stops tumour cells spreading. Previous experience with PI-88 has shown it has been well tolerated and has shown some benefit in delaying the time it takes for the hepatocellular carcinoma to reappear after surgery. The purpose of this study is to determine if PI-88 is effective and safe in patients who have had surgery to remove primary liver cancer.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key inclusion criteria: 1. Histologicallyproven primary hepatocellular carcinoma with curative resection performed in the 4 6 weeks prior to randomization. 2. Age ≥ 18 years. 3. Written, signed and dated informed consent to participate in study 4. ECOG performance status 0 to 1 5. Child Pugh score ≤ 8 6. Platelet count ≥ 80 x 109 cells/liter 7. PTINR ≤ 1.3 8. aPTT ≤ upper limit of normal Key exclusion criteria: 1. Pathological confirmation of single tumor &lt; 2 cm in diameter which obtained from the most recent hepatectomy. 2. History of immunemediated thrombocytopenia other platelet abnormalities or other hereditary or acquired coagulopathies, or laboratory evidence of antiheparin antibodies, or any previous history of having tested positive for antiheparin antibodies. 3. Any evidence of tumor metastasis or coexisting malignant disease 4. Any prior recurrence of HCC or any liver resection prior to the most recent procedure 5. Clinically significant nonmalignant disease including, but not limited to, surgery within 6 weeks of randomization (apart from liver resection and reoperation for complications of liver resection), active clinically significant infection within 6 weeks prior to randomization, myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to randomization, cerebrovascular event within 12 months prior to randomization or clinicallysignificant gastrointestinal bleeding within 12 months prior to randomization. Subjects who have experienced postoperative complications of liver resection may be enrolled providing that such complications are fully resolved at the time of screening. 6. Subjects with uncontrolled infection or serious infection within the past 4 weeks. 7. History of prior HCC therapy including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, molecular targeting agents, vaccines, transarterial embolization (TAE), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), liver transplantation or surgical resection prior to the most recent hepatectomy, at any time prior to randomization. This includes pre, peri and postoperative treatments. Preoperative portal vein embolization is permitted. Subjects should not be enrolled if, at the time of randomization, it is planned that they will subsequently undergo liver transplantation regardless of tumor recurrence. 8. Concomitant use of aspirin (&gt; 150 mg/day), vitamin K antagonists (other than lowdose prophylactic use), heparin within two weeks prior to randomization, or other antiplatelet drugs (e.g. abciximab, clopidogrel, dipyridamole, ticlopidine and tirofiban). Low dose aspirin (≤ 150 mg/day) and lowdose prophylactic vitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin ≤ 1 mg/day) are permitted as concomitant medications. 9. History of allergic, anaphylactic or other significant adverse reaction to radiographic contrast media (iodinated or noniodinated), which cannot be managed by pretreatment with agents such as steroids or antihistamines, and which, in the opinion of the investigator, renders the subject unsuitable for routine CT scanning. Subjects who are contraindicated for CT scanning for other reasons (e.g. ferromagnetic implants, profound claustrophobia), should not be enrolled. 10. Subjects with history of inflammatory bowel disease, any other abnormal bleeding tendency, or subjects at risk of bleeding due to open wounds or planned surgery. 11. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or women of childbearing potential who are unable or unwilling to practice a highly effective means of contraception. 12. Active substance abuse, including alcohol, which, in the opinion of the investigator, risks impairing the ability of the subject to comply with the protocol. 13. Subjects who received other investigational or antineoplastic medication within the past 4 weeks. 14. Current participation in any other clinical study or research project which involves administration of a pharmaceutical product or experimental treatment, or which involves protocolspecified laboratory tests, imaging studies or other investigations.</criteria>
