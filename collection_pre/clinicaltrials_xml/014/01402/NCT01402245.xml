	<detailed_description>Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine does not confer protection against noninvasive pneumonia. The study compares the homing profiles of Pnc-specific plasmablasts in 15 patients with pneumonia and in 15 volunteers receiving Pnc polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) and 12 volunteers receiving Pnc conjugate vaccine (PCV)</detailed_description>
