	<brief_summary>Elastic MCT is a widely recognized and the consensus-approved treatment for chronic venous insufficiency (CVI).Efficacy evidence level is often insufficient (grade B or C), or based on studies carried prior to CEAP classification (2004). Item C3 of this classification relates to patients suffering from chronic venous disease and permanent oedema. Literature mentions only one study in which volume reduction in venous-induced oedema was primary endpoint. Indeed, 240 patients showed a 46.7 ± 8.2 ml reduction (SEM) after 12 weeks with a Class 2 compression sock (15-20 mm Hg at ankle). Volume is an accurate and reproducible quantitative measure considered nowadays as being gold standard when objectifying oedema variation. It is therefore particularly relevant in a C3-patient trial (CEAP classification). The main objective of the current study is to evaluate the clinical effect of Progressiv' MCT on volume reduction in permanent CVI-oedema after 3 months of treatment.</brief_summary>
