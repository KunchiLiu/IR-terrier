	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare the volume of injected ciment (polymethyl methacrylate) between a group of patients treated with vertebroplasty and a group of patients treated via kyphoplasty. Secondary evaluation will compare the restoration of vertebral height, volume and cyphotic angle between the two techniques, as well as extravation of ciment and functional and quality of life aspects related to these techniques.</brief_summary>
