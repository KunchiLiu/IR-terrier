	<brief_summary>The transition between acute care and community care represents one of the most vulnerable periods in health care delivery, particularly as the complexity of inpatient populations increases. Two recent North American studies found an incidence of post-discharge adverse events between 19-23%, with adverse drug events accounting for 66-72% of these. The vulnerability of this period has been attributed mainly to a failure of care providers to adequately reconcile discrepancies between home medications and discharge medications, as well as a failure to transfer this and other important information about the hospitalization and discharge to community care providers. While discharge communication with the primary care physician has traditionally occurred via a handwritten or dictated summary, major deficits exist with respect to timeliness of information transfer and adequacy of content in discharge summaries. Computer-enabled discharge communications can potentially avert such problems. This is particularly true for web-based solutions that do not require end users to acquire additional software/training to use them. The purpose of this research is to definitively assess the efficacy of a web-based seamless discharge communication tool that the Medical Ward of the 21st Century (W21C - see www.w21c.org) team in Calgary has developed through iterative consultation with multiple clinical stakeholders as well as patients/families. This tool has great potential to be implemented on a provincial level as well as across Canada and internationally because it operates on a web interface that does not confine its applicability to a single type of hospital information system. The purpose of this research is to definitively assess the efficacy of the web-based discharge communication tool that our team has developed in partnership with Alberta Health Services. In doing so, our specific objective will be to answer the following research questions: 1. Is the seamless discharge communication tool efficacious with respect to reducing hospital readmission and mortality (at 3 months), as well as reducing adverse events and adverse drug events? 2. Does the seamless discharge communication tool transfer appropriate, complete, and accurate discharge information in a timely manner compared to traditional discharge communication? 3. Is the seamless discharge communication tool efficacious with respect to improving physician and patient satisfaction?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The vulnerability of the transition period has been attributed to three main factors. First, changes to patients'medication regimens during hospitalization are numerous, yet failure to reconcile discrepancies between admission and discharge is frequent. Second, the patient/family is required to take over care responsibilities at discharge and must often relay important information to the primary care physician. This can be particularly challenging if discharge information is poorly communicated, presented too rapidly, if instructions are verbal only, or if the patient has low literacy or low health literacy.Finally, crucial information is often not transferred between acute care physicians and community physicians. Information about the hospitalization (such as medication changes, patient diagnoses, interventions,diagnostic findings, and necessary follow-up) is commonly transferred to the primary care physician via a discharge summary that is typically faxed or mailed. Unfortunately, deficits with respect to timeliness and/or complete failure to transmit are widespread. At the first post-discharge appointment, the discharge summary is unavailable to the primary care physician up to 75% of the time. This negatively impacts the continuity of care provided to many patients. When summaries are received, inconsistent content and inaccuracies are common. Acute care physicians, whether medical or surgical, often neglect to include diagnostic findings, treatment/hospital course, discharge medications, pending tests results, and whether the patient and family received counselling. Computer-enabled discharge communications have potential to avert such problems. Such communication platforms can provide an immediate link between acute care and primary care physicians, and interfaces can be designed to ensure consistent information transfer. In addition, physicians in both settings have expressed preference for electronic discharge documents over hand written/dictated summaries with respect to clarity, comprehensiveness, and positive impacts on continuity of care.</detailed_description>
