	<brief_summary>We performed a double-blind parallel study in a group of mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects who were given aged garlic powder over a period of 12 weeks. We measured serum lipids, including total cholesterol, low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides, and monitored their blood pressure.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An increased serum cholesterol level is an important risk factor for the development of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. Reduction of these and other risk factors through dietary modification, behavioral changes, and medicinal intervention has already substantially decreased the incidence and mortality from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. Supplementation of the diet with certain biofactors may further reduce such risk factors. Aged garlic belongs to a group of dietary supplements that may lessen the incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease by reducing lipids levels and decreasing platelet responsiveness to activating agents.</detailed_description>
