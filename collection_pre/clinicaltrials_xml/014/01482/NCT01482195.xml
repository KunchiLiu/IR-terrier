	<brief_summary>A recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (rAAV2) vector has been altered to carry the human MERTK (hMERTK) gene. This vector has been shown to restore vision in animal models that resemble human MERTK-associated Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), an incurable retinal degeneration that causes severe vision loss. The proposed study is an open label, Phase I clinical trial of subretinal rAAV2-VMD2-hMERTK administration to individuals with MERTK-associated retinal disease. This trial will lead to a greater understanding of the safety and thereby potential value of gene transfer in MERTK-associated retinal disease and will have implications for other forms of retinal degenerative disease amenable to this type of intervention.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>MERTKassociated retinal disease; VA: 20/100 or less in worse eye Ability to perform tests of visual and retinal function; Good general health based on a complete physical examination and hematology and chemistry studies performed at a pretreatment evaluation; Ability to comply with research procedures; Preexisting eye conditions that would preclude the planned surgery or interfere with the interpretation of study endpoints or surgical complications (for example, glaucoma, corneal or lenticular opacities); Complicating systemic diseases (such as medical conditions causing immunosuppression) that would preclude the gene transfer, ocular surgery or known sensitivity or allergy to medications planned for use in the perioperative period; Use of antiplatelet agents that may alter coagulation within 7 days prior to study agent administration; Use of immunosuppressive medications; Pregnancy or breastfeeding; Individuals (males and females) of childbearing potential who are unwilling to use effective contraception for 1 year following agent administration and barrier contraception for 3 months following agent administration; Any other condition that would prevent a subject from completing followup examinations during the course of the study and that, in the opinion of the investigator, makes the subject unsuitable for the study. Current, or recent (within the past 30 days, or 10 half lives of the drug) participation, in any other research protocol involving investigational agents or therapies. Recent (within past 6 months) receipt of an investigational biologic therapeutic agent.Subjects will not be excluded based on their gender, race or ethnicity.</criteria>
