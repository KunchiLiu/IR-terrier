	<brief_summary>All Hepatocellular carcinoma and Renal cell carcinoma patients who receive molecular targeted therapy will be candidates for the study. No additional treatment or intervention will be conducted except for blood sampling that will be limited to one time only. Blood samples (10 cc in volume) will be collected from all study participants once they provided written informed consent form. DNA will be extracted from peripheral blood samples using DNA isolation kit.</brief_summary>
