	<brief_title>Does Pulmonary Daoyin of China Give Additional Benefit Over Usual Therapy in Management of Stable Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, randomized, none-blind, controlled study to evaluate the effect of pulmonary daoyin therapy in moderate to very severe COPD subjects. Following a 14 day run-in period, approximately 464 subjects will be randomly assigned to none-blind treatment for 3 months. The primary measure of efficacy is the Exercise Capacity (6MWD) and spirometric values (e.g. FEV1). Secondary efficacy measures include Dyspnea (MMRC), Quality of life (CAT,SF-36), frequency of exacerbations. Safety will be assessed through the collection of adverse events. There will be a total of 4 study visits (randomization, and after 1,2,3 months of treatment).</detailed_description>
