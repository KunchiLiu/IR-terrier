	<brief_summary>In this prospective study, the investigators will evaluate and compare the usefulness of functional and volumetric informations obtained by 18F-FDG PET and MRI before and after the palliative chemotherapy with the aim of predicting tumor response and prognosis in patients with advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predictive Value of FDG PET/CT, DWI and DCE-MRI Scans for Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Receiving Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study cohort will undergo PET/CT and MRI scans prior to chemotherapy and after the first chemotherapy cycle. MRI scans include DCE-MRI and DWI. The following parameters will be calculated using these values: 1. Metabolic parameters on FDG-PET A. SUV change ratio (SCR) = SUVpost/SUVpre B. MTV change ratio (VCR) = MTVpost/pre C. TLG change ratio = SCR X VCR 2. Perfusion parameters on DCE-MRI A. Kep B. K-trans C. ve 3. Diffusion parameters on DWI A. Mean ADC B. fDM</detailed_description>
