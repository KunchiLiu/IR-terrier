	<brief_summary>Study has two parts: 1. Dose-finding: to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RAD001 (everolimus , Afinitor®) in combination with BEZ235 in patients with advanced solid tumors. 2. Dose-expansion: to assess safety and tolerability of RAD001 and BEZ235 at the MTD in patients with ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer and metastatic renal cell cancer</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male and female patients age 18 years or older In the dose finding phase, patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid malignancies that are metastatic or unresectable In the dose expansion phase, the enrollment will be limited to patients with: Patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) whose disease had progressed despite prior treatment with VEGFRTKI (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor) therapy (at least one but no more than two lines of VEGFRTKI therapy) Patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which is ER+/HER2, whose disease had progressed despite prior treatment with at least one but no more than two lines of chemotherapy and at least one prior line of endocrine therapy in the metastatic setting WHO performance status of 02 Lab parameters within specifically defined criteria Patients with measurable disease per RECIST 1.0 Patients who have previously received mTOR inhibitors or PI3K inhibitors Patients with CNS metastases unless previously treated with surgery, wholebrain radiation or stereotactic radiosurgery plus the disease having been stable for at least 2 months without steroid use for at least 1 month prior to the first dose of RAD001 and BEZ235. Subjects are not permitted to receive enzymeinducing antiepileptic drugs.
