	<brief_summary>The goal of the research is to determine the power and the feasibility of the study design and methods to inform a full-scale clinical trial that will determine whether treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in older adults with mild cognitive impairment delays cognitive decline and preserves everyday function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mild Cognitive Impairment and Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will collect pilot data from 110 participants on 1-year outcomes of treatment of obstructive sleep apnea using continuous positive airway pressure and the validity of neuroimaging for measuring clinical change in persons with mild cognitive impairment and obstructive sleep apnea. The results will inform the study design, sample size, participant recruitment and retention methods, and measures for a full-scale trial.</detailed_description>
