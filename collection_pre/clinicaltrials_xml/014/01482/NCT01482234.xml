	<brief_title>Text Messages and Physical Activity Among Teens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research will develop an innovative intervention that promotes physical activity to 14-17 year olds (roughly high school aged youth). It is guided by Self Determination Theory and seeks to enhance adolescents' feelings of physical activity autonomy, competence, and relatedness, key psychological needs related to motivation to be physically active. The physical activity to be promoted is walking, which has broad appeal and can be performed as part of usual-day activities. Since youth are heavy users of cell phones and texting, the intervention will send theoretically-grounded text messages designed to enhance physical activity.</detailed_description>
