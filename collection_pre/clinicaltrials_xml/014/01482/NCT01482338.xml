	<brief_title>Premenstrual Symptoms Treatment Comparing Between Oral Contraceptives Containing Desogestrel and Drospirenone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Premenstrual syndrome is commonly reported 20-90 percent in reproductive-aged women. Only a small percentage of women (2 to 5%) have significant premenstrual symptoms defined as Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). The exact symptoms and their intensity vary from woman to woman and even from cycle to cycle.While exact causes of PMS are not fully understood,current thinking suspects that fluctuation of endogenous sex hormones are relevant. The standard 21/7 design may induce menstrual-related symptoms including headache, mood swings, abdominal cramping, bloating, and breast tenderness that increase during the last week of active pills extending along the 7-day hormone free interval(HFI). The decline in endogenous estradiol levels during HFI may be responsible for the estrogen-withdrawal symptoms. While a new COC with drospirenone introduced in 24/4 design has been shown in clinical trials to significantly improve the symptoms of PMS, there has been questioned about efficacy of the other kind of COC which has optimal properties, for example, good-control cycles extend to the similar 24/4 regimen.</detailed_description>
