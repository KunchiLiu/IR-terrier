	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether RADIOEMBOLIZATION with 90 Yttrium microspheres is more effective on overall survival in advanced Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with or without portal venous obstruction and no extrahepatic extension than sorafenib which is now the standard treatment of advanced HCC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SorAfenib Versus RADIOEMBOLIZATION in Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: In patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, sorafenib is now the standard treatment with an increased median overall survival but an overall incidence of treatment-related adverse events of 80%. There is growing interest for RADIOEMBOLIZAION with 90 Yttrium microspheres. It involves infusion of embolic microparticles of glass or resin impregnated with the isotope yttrium-90 through a catheter directly into the hepatic arteries. A substantial number of open-label single-group studies showed supporting evidence for a potential efficacy on overall survival and acceptable or low toxicity. Trial design: multicenter, prospective, controlled, open label randomized trial of Y90 RADIOEMBOLIZATION versus sorafenib. Participants: Adult patients with 1) advanced HCC according to BCLC staging system (stage C) with or without portal vein thrombosis 2) ECOG performance status of 2 or less 3) adequate haematological, renal and hepatic functions 4) liver cirrhosis Child Pugh A - B7 and 5) no extrahepatic metastasis. Interventions: In the sorafenib group, patients will receive continuous oral treatment with 400 mg of sorafenib twice daily. In the Y90 RADIOEMBOLIZATION group, patients will first undergo angiography and scintigraphy for eligibility assessment (absence of or acceptable lung shunting) and preconditioning (embolization). RADIOEMBOLIZATION therapy with infusion of Y90 microspheres will be performed secondly. Objectives: The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of Y90 RADIOEMBOLIZATION to sorafenib in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Secondary objectives include the comparison of safety profiles, quality of life and health care costs between the two therapeutic groups. Outcomes: The primary endpoint is the median overall survival time. Secondary endpoints include adverse events reported according to the NCI CTC, progression-free survival at 6 months, response rates, general and hepatic-specific quality of life scores, health care costs which comprise the MICROCOSTING of Y90 RADIOEMBOLIZATION from the viewpoint of the hospital and the full cost of each strategy. Sample size: 400 participants (200 par arm). The trial have 80% power to detect a clinically meaningful increase in median survival time of 4 months between sorafenib (expected median survival time 10.7 months) and Y90 RADIOEMBOLIZATION (expected median survival time 15 months) with a two-tailed type I error risk of 5%. Randomization: 1 to 1 randomization will be stratified according to recruiting center, ECOG performance status (a score of 0 vs. a score of 1 or 2), presence or absence of macroscopic vascular invasion (obstruction of portal vein or any branch vs none) and previous chemoembolisation failure . Randomly permuted blocks of random sizes will be used. Study duration and Setting: Accrual period 24 months. Additional follow-up period: 12 months. 14 centres involving both clinicians (hepatologists, hepatobiliary surgeons, and oncologists) and radiologists and Nuclear medicine physicians on each site.</detailed_description>

Failure is defined as the absence of an objective response after two courses of treatment in the treated nodule (objective response according to modified RECIST criteria and/or EASL criteria).
