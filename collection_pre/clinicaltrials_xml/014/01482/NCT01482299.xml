	<brief_summary>This is a phase II study to evaluate RAD001 (Everolimus) in terms of 4-month progression-free survival rate (primary end-point) and response rate, toxicity, overall survival and biomarker assessment (secondary end-points) in patients with metastatic or recurrent gastric cancer with pS6 Ser 240/4 expression. Eligibility criteria include pathologically proven non-resectable adenocarcinoma of stomach with measurable disease who failed previous first-line palliative chemotherapy including fluoropyrimidine and platinum with high expression of pS6 Ser 240/4. Oral RAD001 (everolimus) 10mg daily will be administered and the dose will be adjusted according to the observed clinical toxicities. Treatment will be continued until disease progression or patient's intolerability to the study drug. A study requires 40 assessable subjects to decide whether the proportion of patients who are free from progression at 4 months (16 weeks), P, is less than or equal to 0.1 or greater than or equal to 0.25 with a target error rate of 0.05 and β of 0.2. If the number of responses is 7 or less, the hypothesis that P &gt;= 0.250 is rejected with a target error rate of 0.200 and an actual error rate of 0.182. If the investigators assume that drop-out rate is 10%, total accrual patient will be 45.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methodology: Prospective, non blinded, open label, single center phase II study Criteria for evaluation: Assessment of response will be assessed radiologically according to RECIST criteria after completion of the two cycles. Evaluation will be by physical examination, chest X-ray, abdomen-pelvis CT scan Safety criteria: Physical examination, vital signs, performance status, CBC, serum chemistry, NCI CTC V.3.0</detailed_description>
