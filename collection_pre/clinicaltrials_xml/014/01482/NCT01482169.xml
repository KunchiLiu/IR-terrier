	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that intravenous regadenoson is equivalent to intravenous Adenoscan® for the physiological assessment of intermediate coronary lesions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravenous Regadenoson Versus Intravenous Adenoscan® for Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective open label, single center pilot trial that will evaluate regadenoson compared to Adenoscan® to be given IV in the assessment of Fractional Flow Reserve. Forty eight subjects will be enrolled and get Adenoscan® administered via IV followed by Regadenoson IV.</detailed_description>
