	<brief_summary>This study aims to evaluate the safety and analgesic effect (efficacy) of Gastrolith powder (GASP) on skeletal pain caused by osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF) versus placebo, primarily as assessed by the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). It is also intended to evaluate disability change with the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index (ODI) and to evaluate whether GASP consumption leads to reduction in analgesic standard of care (ASOC) versus placebo, using weekly analgesic consumption diaries.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Osteoporotic patients aged 1880 years old, inclusive. Diagnosed Osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture(s) in at least one vertebra caused by an atraumatic event or a minimal traumatic event such as falling from standing height or less, or by other minimal trauma besides a fall (see section 4.2 Table I for definitions), and visible by either Xray radiography, CT or MRI. At least six (6) weeks and no more than six (6) months from the onset of severe back pain suspected to be caused by the OVCF.
