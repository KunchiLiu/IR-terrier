	<brief_summary>The Study Purpose is to demonstrate the superiority of optimized remote patient management compared to optimized standard care in the management and prognosis of heart failure, in the prevention of recurrent atrial tachycardia or atrial fibrillation episodes and in the reduction of inappropriate shock therapies. The remote care allows early intervention in terms of drug therapy adjustment and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT‐D) device reprogramming.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The outcome measure of the study is a combined endpoint of: - Proportion of patients with HF hospitalization or emergency unit admission with intravenous diuretics, Atrial Tachycardia/Atrial Fibrillation (AT/AF) episodes or cardiovascular/cerebrovascular episodes requiring hospitalization at 12 months - Proportion of patients with inappropriate Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD) therapies delivered at 12 months comparing optimized remote patient management to optimized standard patient management</detailed_description>
