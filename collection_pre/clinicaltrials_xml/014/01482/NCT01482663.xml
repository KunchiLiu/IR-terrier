	<brief_summary>Hand eczema is a common disease which often gives a chronic course thus affecting many functions in daily life. The body of evidence related to self-management of chronic hand eczema is poor. Better methods to support self-management of patients with chronic hand eczema may potentially improve the prognosis of a disease which is both a tremendous burden to the individual and to the society. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the effect of a newly designed guidance programme offering individual counselling compared to conventional information with written information sheets.</brief_summary>
