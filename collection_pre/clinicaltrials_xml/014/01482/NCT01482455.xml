	<brief_summary>There is a current debate whether impaired insulin-mediated microvascular perfusion limits the delivery of hormones and nutrients to muscle and whether short term FFA elevation affects transcapillary transport of insulin and glucose thereby representing a rate-controlling step for insulin-stimulated muscular glucose disposal in humans. To address these questions, the investigators determined the changes of interstitial glucose and insulin in skeletal muscle of healthy volunteers during intravenous administration of triglycerides or glycerol under physiologic and supraphysiologic hyperinsulinemic conditions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fat and Transcapillary Insulin Transport</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increased lipid availability reduces insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in skeletal muscle, which is generally explained by lipid induced inhibition of myocellular insulin signalling, It remains unclear whether lipids also impair transcapillary transport of insulin and glucose which could thereby become rate-controlling for glucose disposal Increased accumulation and availability of lipids cause impaired skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity. It is yet unclear if transcapillary transport of insulin and glucose is impaired by acute elevation of free fatty acids and represents a rate-limiting step during the development of short-term lipid-induced insulin resistance. We determined the changes of interstitial glucose and insulin in skeletal muscle of healthy volunteers during intravenous administration of triglycerides and heparin or glycerol under physiologic and supraphysiologic hyperinsulinemic conditions.</detailed_description>
