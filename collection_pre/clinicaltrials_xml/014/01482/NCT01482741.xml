	<brief_summary>Risks from imaging-related radiation exposure have become a popular topic in the media. Because these tests are commonly applied to patients at a cancer center, it is important to understand what patients know, how they feel about what they know, where they get their information, and how satisfied they are with available risk-benefit communication on this topic. The purpose of this study is to understand how cancer patients perceive risks and benefits of diagnostic radiation and their satisfaction with healthcare communication on this topic.</brief_summary>
