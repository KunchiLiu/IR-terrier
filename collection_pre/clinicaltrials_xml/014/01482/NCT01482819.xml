	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Be of legal age (i.e. 18 years) Be of Asian descent and have ―Asian eye‖ identifying features (see Appendix A) Be mentally competent, willing and able to sign a written informed consent form. Have contact lens distance sphere requirement in the range 1.00D to 6.00D. Have spectacle astigmatism &lt;1.25D in each eye Currently wear soft contact lenses (for at least 3 months prior to the trial ) without experiencing difficulties or contact lens related complications Have had an oculovisual examination within the previous 12 months. Have normal eyes with no evidence of abnormality or disease. For the purposes of this study a normal eye is defined as one having: No evidence of lid abnormality or infection No conjunctival abnormality or infection No clinically significant slit lamp findings (i.e. edema, staining, scarring, vascularization, infiltrates or abnormal opacities) No other active ocular disease Requires concurrent ocular medication. Clinically significant (Grade 3 or 4) corneal staining (FDA scale), corneal stromal haze, corneal vascularization, tarsal abnormalities, bulbar hyperemia, limbal hyperemia, or any other abnormality of the cornea that would contraindicate contact lens wear. Has had refractive surgery. Has had any anterior ocular surgery. Has had any other ocular surgery or injury within 8 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this study. History of abnormal lachrymal secretions. Preexisting ocular irritation that would preclude contact lens fitting. Keratoconus or other corneal irregularity. Extended lens wear in last 3 months. PMMA, hybrid or RGP lens wear in the previous 8 weeks Any systemic illness which would contraindicate lens wear or the medical treatment of which would affect vision or successful lens wear. Has diabetes Known/reported infectious disease (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis) or an immunosuppressive disease (e.g., HIV). History of chronic eye disease (e.g. glaucoma or ARMD). Pregnancy, lactating, or planning a pregnancy at the time of enrolment. Participation in any concurrent clinical trial or in last 30 days. Family member or employee of the clinical site, investigator or other study staff. Currently wears habitual contact lenses on an EW basis.</criteria>
