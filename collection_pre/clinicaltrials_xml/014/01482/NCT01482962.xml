	<brief_summary>This is a phase 3, randomized, 2-arm, open-label, international trial evaluating alisertib compared with single-agent treatment, as selected by the investigator from the offered options of pralatrexate or gemcitabine or romidepsin, in patients with relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). Note: romidepsin will not be used as a single-agent comparator in countries that do not permit its use at this time.</brief_summary>
