	<brief_summary>The cognitive and psychiatric comorbidities are crucial endpoints in epileptic patients. Among these comorbidities, the Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) accounts for one of the most important in terms of frequency and psychosocial and educational consequences. In these conditions, our study was designed to estimate the sensitivity to changes of the different sub-scores of the ADHD rating Scale IV (ADHD RS IV) in epileptic patient. This will then optimize our methodological approach for a therapeutic trial.</brief_summary>
