	<brief_summary>1. Purpose of the study -To compare stent patency and complication rate between endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided stent insertion and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) guided stent insertion for malignant biliary obstruction 2. Subjects of the study -Patients who have biliary obstruction owing to malignant tumors 3. Methods of the study - Prospective randomized controlled study - Patients were enrolled randomly in two groups, EUS guided stent insertion group or ERCP guided stent insertion group - Patients will get assigned procedure (EUS guided stent insertion or ERCP guided stent insertion)for decompression of malignant biliary obstruction - After the procedure, regular follow up, blood test,and imaging test will be done to check sufficient biliary decompression,stent patency and complications.</brief_summary>
