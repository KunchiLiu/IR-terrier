	<brief_title>Gatifloxacin Versus Ceftriaxone in the Treatment of Enteric Fever</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With the study hypothesis that Gatifloxacin is superior to Ceftriaxone in terms of treatment failure in patients with enteric fever, a comparative study will be conducted at Patan Hospital. 300 patients who are diagnosed with enteric fever will be enrolled into the study. The patients will be randomized to one of two groups. One group will receive treatment with Gatifloxacin for 7 days, and the other with Ceftriaxone. The patients will be followed during the treatment courses and at several points of 6 months after initial presentation. The endpoints then will be compared between two groups.</detailed_description>
