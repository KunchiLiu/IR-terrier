	<brief_summary>There are three purposes for this study: I. to establish the construct validity (via factor analysis) of the Inventory for Assessing the Process of Cultural Competence Among Healthcare Professionals - Student Version (IAPCC-SV) II. to determine the responsiveness of the IAPCC-SV III. to investigate demographic predictor variables of the IAPCC-SV It is hypothesized that: I. the variables will load on only one component, with each component being represented by a number of strongly loaded variables II. the IAPCC-SV will demonstrate responsiveness, evidenced by significantly higher post-module IAPCC-SV scores of the experimental group when compared to the control group III. the cultural composite score and race will be significant predictors of IAPCC-SV score</brief_summary>
