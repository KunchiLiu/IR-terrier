	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of brentuximab vedotin as a single agent in patients with CD30-positive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (Part A). The study will also evaluate the safety and efficacy of brentuximab vedotin in combination with rituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (Part B) as well as further evaluate correlation of CD30 expression and response in DLBCL (Part C).</brief_summary>
