	<brief_title>Enhancement of Physical Fitness in Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ageing population leads to an increase of chronic disease and disability and to a decrease of physical activity and ADL performance. This circle can be reversed by physical exercise to increase physical fitness. The goal of this research is to establish the effects of a trainings program on ADL performance, physical fitness and nocturnal cramps. Furthermore the characteristics from participants who benefit from the program will be investigated by the research. The study design is a randomized intervention study. Participants are elderly people, age 65 years and older, without cognitive impairment. Intervention: The intervention is a physical trainings program. The intensity is moderate, the frequency is daily and the total duration is 6 weeks. The control group will be provided with an education program. Main parameters are: physical fitness, nocturnal cramp severity and frequency.</detailed_description>
