	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of bone marrow and blood from patients with cancer who failed treatment may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer resistance. It may also help doctors find better ways to treat cancer. PURPOSE: This research trial studies biomarkers in samples from adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia who failed standard-of-care treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers in Samples From Adult Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia Who Failed Existing Standard-of-Care Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Define a "non-response" signature that will help up-front identification of cases of intermediate-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) destined to fail existing standard-of-care therapy. - Identify biological pathways in the "non-response" group that can provide targets for novel therapeutics. OUTLINE: DNA and RNA extracted from cryopreserved bone marrow cells and/or blood cells are analyzed for mutations and gene expression signatures (genome-wide methylation, mRNA and miRNA expression, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis) by microarray assays.</detailed_description>
