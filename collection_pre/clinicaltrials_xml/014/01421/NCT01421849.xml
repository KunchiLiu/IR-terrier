	<brief_summary>Study hypothesis: that there would be no difference in patient satisfaction among institutionalised older people before and after treatment with a mandibular single implant-retained overdenture. In a preliminary phase, a new denture is made or the old denture is adapted to provide a well-fitting denture. Eight weeks after insertion of the new denture a single implant is placed in the centre of the mandibula. If the level of primary stability is sufficient to enable the implant to resist micromovement, the implant is immediately loaded . If not, the implant is loaded after 6 to 12 weeks. Primary stability is assessed by the final seating torque and by the clinician's interpretation and tactile sense of primary stability. Before, during and after the treatment patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes are evaluated by a 20 item questionnaire and a clinical examination.</brief_summary>
