	<brief_summary>This study was designed to determine whether participation in an online social network intervention increases perceived social support for physical activity versus a minimal education control group by conducting a randomized controlled trial with 140 female undergraduate students. The investigators hypothesize that participants in the physical activity centered online social network intervention group will have greater increases in perceived social support for physical activity compared to minimal web based physical activity education controls.</brief_summary>
