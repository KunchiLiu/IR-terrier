	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, open-label, two way crossover study designed to test the bioequivalence of 2 different oral forms of TKI258, FMI capsule and FMI tablet in patients with advanced solid tumors, excluding breast cancer. The aim of this test is to demonstrate that those 2 formulations are considered to be the same for all intents and purposes by making sure they are acting on the body with the same strength and are absorbed in similar amounts by the body. During the bioequivalence phase, patients will take orally at a daily dose of 500 mg one formulation of TKI258 during the first 3 weeks of treatment on a 5 days on/2days off dosing schedule, after which time, patients will switch to the alternate formulation for one additional week. After the bioequivalence phase, all patients may continue to take orally at a daily dose of 500 mg only TKI258 FMI capsule formulation until disease progression (assessed by RECIST 1.1), unacceptable toxicity, death or discontinuation from the study treatment for any other reason.</brief_summary>
