	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this first in human study with CC-122 is to assess the safety and action of a new class of experimental drug (Pleiotropic Pathway Modulator) in patients with advanced tumors unresponsive to standard therapies and to determine the appropriate dosing level and regimen for later-stage clinical trials.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of CC-122 to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Effectiveness for Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors, Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, or Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial is enrolling additional Multiple Myeloma (MM) subjects in a separate cohort defined as MM-2 to evaluate tolerability, safety and preliminary efficacy of CC-122 formulated capsule alone or in combination with DEX on intermittent dosing schedule (5 of 7 days of the week) in Pomalidomide-naïve subjects. Preliminary efficacy data in Multiple Myeloma subjects, warrants further exploration of CC-122 in MM on intermittent schedules to assess if dose intensity and tolerability can be improved. Initially, patients will be treated with oral CC-122 for one month. During this time, various tests (involving blood and urine collections, ECGs, etc) will be performed. Those whose tumors stabilize or regress may continue receiving treatment for as long as they benefit from CC-122. Different dose levels of CC-122 will be tested in a dose-rising study design.</detailed_description>
