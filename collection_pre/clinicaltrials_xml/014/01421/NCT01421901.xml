	<brief_summary>The acute appendicitis (AA) is a very common disease with a life time risk 7-8% and the highest incidence in the second decades . The aetiology of AA is still poor understood: the commonest hypothesis refers to appendix obstruction followed by impairment of wall appendix barrier and thus wall perforation and/or abscess formation1. However some studies suggest that no-complicate and complicate appendicitis are different entities allowing a different treatment. The study aims to test the no inferiority in terms of efficacy of antibiotic treatment compared to surgery in a population with high probability to suffer of 1st episode of AA.The study aims to test the no inferiority in terms of efficacy of antibiotic treatment compared to surgery in a population with high probability to suffer of 1st episode of AA.</brief_summary>
