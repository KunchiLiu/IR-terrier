	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effect of an intracervical lidocaine injection versus topical lidocaine gel on the pain experienced by patients undergoing tenaculum application to the cervix during office gynecologic procedures. This study will also evaluate how satisfied women are with the method of pain control used. The researchers hypothesize that: 1. There is less pain perceived by patients undergoing placement of a tenaculum on the cervix when a lidocaine injection is used compared to a topical lidocaine gel. 2. Patients are more satisfied with pain control during the overall experience of undergoing tenaculum placement on the cervix when a lidocaine injection is used compared to a topical lidocaine gel.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tenaculum Pain Control Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects who have already scheduled an IUD insertion or endometrial biopsy will be asked to join this study assessing two pain control interventions at the time of tenaculum application to the cervix during office gynecologic procedures. Only healthy women ages 18 and over with an indication for endometrial biopsy or IUD placement will be recruited. The participants will be randomized to one of two arms: an intracervical lidocaine injection versus topical lidocaine gel. They will be asked to indicate their level of pain and level of satisfaction using a Visual Analog Scale. The primary outcome, pain with tenaculum placement, and the secondary outcome, satisfaction with the experience of tenaculum placement, will be compared between the study groups.</detailed_description>
