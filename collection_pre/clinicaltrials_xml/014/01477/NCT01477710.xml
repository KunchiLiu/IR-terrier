	<brief_summary>This study will compare three methods of delivering mechanical ventilation using a test lung. Ventilation will be delivered using (1) a mask held in place by a caregiver, (2) a mask strapped to the model using a securing device, and (3) a supraglottic airway. Endpoints include respiratory rate and tidal volume.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To evaluate the ability of caregivers to provide adequate ventilation (respiratory rate and tidal volume) in a model of the upper airway and lungs. Ventilation will be delivered while the mask is held in place by the caregiver, with the mask strapped to the model using the securing device provided with the ventilator, and following placement of a supraglottic airway.</detailed_description>
