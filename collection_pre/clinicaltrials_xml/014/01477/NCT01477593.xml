	<brief_summary>Circumcision, a removal of the foreskin, is performed commonly at any age in male worldwide. Globally over 25% of men are circumcised. In the Middle East, circumcision is even performed routinely in every male newborn. The benefits from it vastly outweigh the risks. Gradually, more and more Chinese male are willing to undergo it with themselves and their sons. But there are also some complications with circumcision, such as pain, edema, infection, and hemorrhage. Considering of that, physicians continually manage to improve their surgical methods and analgesic techniques. In the study of Peng, a disposable minimally invasive circumcision anastomosis device named Shenghuan (China Wuhu Snnda Medical Treatment Application Technology Co. Ltd.) (ShD) was introduced to be applied in circumcision. And they concluded that method was quicker, safer and less pain than the conventional techniques of incision. In present study, we carry out a randomized controlled trail, using a different method as Peng introduced with this device in children's circumcision (Yan's), compared with the method as Peng used and the conventional technique in our hospital, and then observe the outcomes.</brief_summary>
