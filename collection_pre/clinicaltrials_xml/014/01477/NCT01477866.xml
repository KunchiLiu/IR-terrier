	<brief_title>Utility Of Citogenex Administration In Patients With Colon-Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CITOGENEX is a dietary supplement of insoluble polysaccharides, of Lactobacillus Casei (specific type) and of Bifidobacterium Lactis (specific type). These subspecies of probiotics bacteria have been shown to be effective in improving the immunity. Several trials are currently underway, in order to evaluate the effects of probiotics as potential novel therapies in addition to traditional therapeutic approaches. Although probiotics do not play an anti-tumor action per se, these agents may significantly contribute to decrease the typical side effects due to traditional anti-tumor treatments, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, immunity deficit, as well as the alterations in the gut lymphoid tissue. It is therefore expected that CITOGENEX may have several significant beneficial effects in patients under anti-tumor treatments. In order to test this hypothesis, we will perform a randomized, single-blind, two-arms, prospective study in patients with colon-rectal cancer.</detailed_description>
