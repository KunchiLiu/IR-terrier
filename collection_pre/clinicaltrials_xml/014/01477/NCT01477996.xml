	<detailed_description>Purpose: To evaluate the influence of the type of the needle on pain scores after intravitreal therapy (IVT). Design: Randomized clinical trial Methods: A total of 200 patients, treated with an IVT for exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or a vascular retinal disease, will be included and randomly assigned to be treated with either a 27-gauge needle (group 1) or a 30-gauge needle (group 2). After IVt the patient has to fill out a standardized questionnaire including pain scores on the visual analog scale after the surgical procedure. Regression analysis of the scaled questionnaires should allow for a standard recommendation regarding the optimal needle size for minimal subjective pain during IVT.</detailed_description>
