	<brief_summary>To demonstrate that sipuleucel-T can be successfully manufactured for subjects with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) at a European manufacturing facility.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sipuleucel-T Manufacturing Demonstration Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was an open-label, uncontrolled, multi-center study. Study participants will underwent screening procedures to ensure that they met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects underwent a standard 1.5 to 2.0 blood volume leukapheresis, followed approximately 3 days later by an infusion of sipuleucel-T. This process was be repeated at approximately 2-week intervals for a total of 3 infusions. In Austria, The Netherlands, and France, a study completion visit occurred between 30 and 37 days post-final infusion, or between 30 and 37 days post-final leukapheresis for subjects not receiving at least 1 infusion. In the UK, a follow-up visit occurred 30 days after the subject's final infusion and a study completion visit occurred 6 months after the subject's final infusion.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the prostate Metastatic disease as evidenced by soft tissue and/or bony metastases on bone scan and/or computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis at any time prior to registration Castrate resistant prostate cancer Serum PSA ≤ 5.0 ng/mL Castration levels of testosterone (≤ 50 ng/dL; ≤ 1.74 nmol/L) achieved via medical or surgical castration. Surgical castration must have occurred at least 3 months prior to registration. ECOG performance status ≤ 1 Adequate hematologic, renal, and liver function Negative serology tests indicating no active infection with human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 (HIV1/2), human T cell lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2 (HTLVI/II), and Hepatitis B and C viruses. The presence of known brain metastases A requirement for systemic immunosuppressive therapy for any reason Treatment with any investigational vaccine within 2 years prior to registration Any previous treatment with sipuleucelT Any previous treatment with ipilimumab (Yervoy[TM], MDX010, or MDX101) or denosumab (Xgeva[TM]) Pathologic longbone fractures, imminent pathologic longbone fracture (cortical erosion on radiography &gt; 50%), or spinal cord compression Known malignancies other than prostate cancer that are likely to require treatment within 6 months of registration A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to sipuleucelT or GMCSF More than 2 chemotherapy regimens at any time prior to registration Treatment with any chemotherapy within 90 days of registration Received granulocyte colonystimulating factor (GCSF) or GMCSF within 90 days prior to registration Treatment with any of the following medications or interventions within 28 days of registration: Systemic corticosteroids. Use of inhaled, intranasal, intraarticular, and topical steroids is acceptable, as is a short course (i.e., ≤ 1 day) of corticosteroids to prevent a reaction to the IV contrast used for CT scans. Nonsteroidal antiandrogens (e.g., bicalutamide, flutamide, or nilutamide) External beam radiation therapy or major surgery requiring general anesthetic Any other systemic therapy for prostate cancer including secondary hormonal therapies, such as megestrol acetate (Megace®), diethylstilbestrol (DES), and ketoconazole. Medical castration therapy is not exclusionary. Immunosuppressive therapy Treatment with any other investigational product Any infection requiring parenteral antibiotic therapy or causing fever (temperature &gt; 100.5°F or 38.1°C) within 7 days prior to registration. Any medical intervention or other condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator or the Dendreon Medical Monitor, could compromise adherence with study requirements or otherwise compromise the study's objectives.</criteria>
