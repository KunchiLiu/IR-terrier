	<detailed_description>The primary aim is to evaluate whether 5 weeks of computerised working memory training improves working memory capacity. Secondary aims are to explore whether improvements in working memory capacity will be transferred to improvements in learning abilities and fluid intelligence. Also, far transfer effects on executive functioning, ADHD symptoms, psychosocial functioning and quality of life will be explored. Finally, it will also be assessed to what extent improvements gained from 5 weeks of working memory training will be maintained 3 and 6 months post-study, respectively.</detailed_description>
