	<brief_summary>The purpose of this multi-center, open-label, safety and tolerability study was to assess the addition of oral treprostinil (UT-15C sustained release [SR] tablets) to subjects currently receiving Tyvaso (treprostinil) inhalation solution. During the 24-week evaluation period, the study evaluated the changes in the following assessments: hemodynamics, 6-minute walk test (6MWT), Borg dyspnea score, N-Terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), World Health Organization (WHO) Functional Class, and safety assessments. Eligible subjects had a diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), currently were receiving Tyvaso, and may have been receiving other approved PAH specific oral therapies (endothelin receptor antagonists [ERAs] and/or phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor [PDE5-I], if at a stable dose for ≥30 days). At Baseline, subjects received the first dose of 0.125 mg UT-15C SR.</brief_summary>
