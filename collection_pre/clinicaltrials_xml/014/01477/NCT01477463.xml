	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the signaling pathways and changes in gene expression in melanocytes of subjects with a history of non-melanoma skin cancer who are exposed to oral vitamin D. If vitamin D is found to inhibit a signaling pathway involved in the development of melanoma such as BRAF, a protein involved in cell proliferation, then oral vitamin D could be explored further as a chemoprevention for melanoma skin cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background: Vitamin D is an important hormone that has multiple genetic effects in different tissue types that are mediated by signaling through the vitamin D receptor. Recent studies have shown that vitamin D signaling results in decreased innate immunity and increased adaptive immunity. Multiple epidemiologic studies have suggested that vitamin D may play a role in decreasing the risk of developing multiple types of cancer, including skin cancer. In the context of the relative success of novel immune-related therapies including PD1 inhibitors, which improves immuno-surveillance, and ipilimumab, which suppresses T cell response, there is increased promise for treatment strategies that activate innate immunity. This led us to ask the question of whether vitamin D could increase immune surveillance for melanoma via increased activity of the adaptive immune system. Prior studies performed by our group and others have suggested that vitamin D may play a role in decreasing melanoma risk. An epidemiologic study from the Women's Health Initiative showed that women with a prior history of NMSC who received calcium and vitamin D supplementation had a lower risk of subsequently developing melanoma. At the same time, women with a lower serum vitamin D level had a higher risk of developing melanoma. Furthermore, a recent clinical study showed that vitamin D supplementation increases serum vitamin D levels and ultimately results in increased vitamin D receptor signaling in benign nevi. Taken together, this findings led us to ask whether oral vitamin D supplementation could impact immune signaling in benign nevi and potentially underpin a theoretical chemo-preventive role for vitamin D in melanoma.</detailed_description>
