	<brief_summary>Rates and causes of maternal mortality in Mexico have dropped only slightly; thus, reaching the internationally established Millennium Development Milestones (MDM) is still a distant goal. A fundamental part of reducing maternal and infant mortality is ensuring an adequate and timely response to obstetric emergencies. PRONTO2: Obstetric and Neonatal Emergency Training Program is an innovative training strategy based on simulations designed to train hospital personnel to respond to obstetric emergencies. The objective of this study is to implement PRONTO2 in selected hospitals to measure the effectiveness of the intervention in influencing key behaviors in hospital practices, as well as measuring maternal and neonatal outcomes in intervention versus control hospitals.</brief_summary>
