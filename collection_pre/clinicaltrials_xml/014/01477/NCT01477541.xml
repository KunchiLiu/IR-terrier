	<brief_summary>Rates and causes of maternal mortality in Mexico have dropped only slightly; thus, reaching the internationally established Millennium Development Milestones (MDM) is still a distant goal. A fundamental part of reducing maternal and infant mortality is ensuring skilled attendance during pregnancy and delivery. This project uses an innovative strategy of integrating professional midwives and licensed obstetric nurses into rural medical centers in the states of Guerrero and Oaxaca, Mexico, to provide prenatal care, delivery services, and puerperium care. The goal of the research is to increase use of best practices in intake, labor, delivery, and puerperium care; decrease the use of unnecessary or harmful care; and improve maternal and neonatal outcomes. We posited that medical centers receiving the intervention would provide better care and have better maternal and neonatal outcomes than those that did not receive the intervention.</brief_summary>
