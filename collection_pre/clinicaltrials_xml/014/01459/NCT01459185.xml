	<brief_summary>The investigators confirm the feasibility of 1-year administration of oral fluoropyrimidine S-1 as an adjuvant chemotherapy for the patient who received complete resection of non-small cell lung cancer. The investigators presume they can achieve high completion rate with low toxicity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Feasibility Study of Oral Adjuvant Chemotherapy With S-1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chemotherapy comprised eight courses (4-week administration, 2-week withdrawal) of S-1 (FT, gineracil, oteracil potassium; Taiho Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) at 80-120 mg/body/day according to body surface area (BSA): BSA &lt;1.25 m2, 80 mg/day; BSA &gt;1.25 m2 but &lt;1.5 m2, 100 mg/day; and BSA &gt;1.5 m2, 120 mg/day. S-1 was administered orally, twice daily after meals, starting within 4 weeks after surgery.</detailed_description>
