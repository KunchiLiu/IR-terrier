	<criteria>1. At Visit H1 (start of the treatment period), the participants must have endoscopically confirmed erosive esophagitis of Grade A to D, as defined by the LA classification grading system, and the target number of participants who are clearly Grade C or D is 15% or more of the total participants. 2. Outpatients (including inpatient for examination) 3. Participants must have successfully completed the treatment period and have endoscopically healed EE at Week 2, 4, or 8 in the treatment period. Endoscopically healed EE is defined as those participants who have endoscopically confirmed EE of Grade O as defined by the LA classification grading system. 1. Participants with an esophagusrelated complication (eosinophilic esophagitis, esophageal varices, scleroderma, viral or fungal infection, esophageal stenosis, etc.), a history of radiotherapy or cryotherapy of the esophagus, a caustic or physiochemical trauma (esophageal sclerotherapy, etc.). However, participants with Schatzki's ring (mucosal tissue ring around inferior esophageal sphincter) or Barrett's esophagus are allowed to be included. 2. Participants who have received surgery or treatment affecting gastroesophageal reflux (cardioplasty, dilation of esophageal stenosis [excluding Schatzki's ring], etc.), or who have a history of surgery of stomach or duodenum (excluding removal of benign polyp under endoscopy) 3. Participants who have acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding, gastric or duodenal ulcer (mucosal defect with white coating) within 30 days prior to Visit H1 (initiation of study drug administration). However, participants with gastric or duodenal erosions are allowed to be included. 4. Participants with a previous or current history of ZollingerEllison syndrome, or other gastric acid hypersecretion disorder</criteria>
