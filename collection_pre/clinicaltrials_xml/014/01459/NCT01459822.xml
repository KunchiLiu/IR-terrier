	<brief_summary>Sepsis is a common cause of death in intensive care unit, timely and accurate diagnosis and treatment directly affect the survival rate. MiRNA is a post-transcriptional small RNA which regulate mRNA expression. The present study was designed to observe the selected miRNA expression which evaluate the sepsis prognosis in the progression of sepsis in order to be a new target for the treatment of sepsis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MiRNAs Evaluate the Prognosis of Sepsis by Dynamic Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a non-intervention observational study. Purpose of this study is to observe some selected miRNA expression which evaluate the sepsis prognosis in the progression of sepsis . The investigators will collect serum samples from patients with sepsis in SICU, RICU and EICU on the 1st、3rd、5th、7th、10th、14th day of 301 Hospital since November 2011 , and then use mirVana PARIS kit extract total RNA and use qRT-PCR detect miRNAS expression in serum which can evaluate the prognosis of sepsis, and statistical analysis the miRNAS expression correlation with SOFA score.</detailed_description>
