	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to describe drug concentrations in blood plasma, rectal fluid, rectal tissue, and seminal fluid in HIV negative men following single and multiple doses of an investigational HIV medication known as GSK1349572 (dolutegravir).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GSK1349572 Exposure in Blood, Seminal Fluid, and Rectal Fluid and Tissue in Healthy Male Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine first dose and steady-state concentrations of GSK1349572 in seminal fluid, rectal mucosal fluid, and rectal tissue compared to blood plasma (BP) in HIV-1 negative males. GSK1349572 is an investigational next generation integrase inhibitor currently in Phase III trials. Understanding the concentrations of GSK1349572 in multiple male biological compartments will inform its role in preventing HIV infection by making an HIV-infected person less likely to transmit the virus, and protecting uninfected persons from acquiring the virus.</detailed_description>

Subject who is unwilling to refrain from rectal insertion of medical/recreation devices and products and from receptive anal intercourse, for 72 hours before study visit Day 0 and through 7 days after the last biopsy. History of febrile illness within 14 days prior to the first dose. Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy). A positive urine drug screen. A positive result for HIV, Hepatitis B surface antigen or Hepatitis B core antibody screening tests or antihepatitis C virus serology A positive test for syphilis, rectal gonorrhea, chlamydia, or HSV2 (active lesions) at screening.

History of regular use of tobacco or nicotinecontaining products exceeding an equivalent of 5 cigarettes per day within three months prior to screening or unwilling to abstain from cigarette smoking completely during visits. Treatment with an investigational drug within 4 months preceding the first dose of trial medication. Participated in a rectal biopsy study in the 12 months preceding the first dose of trial medication. Use of clinically significant prescription or nonprescription drugs within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication Blood donation of approximately 1 pint (≥473 mL) within 56 days prior to dosing.

Clinically significant abnormalities to pulse or conduction observed on ECG Unwilling or unable to comply with dietary restrictions Any other reason or condition that would make participation in the study unsafe, complicate interpretation of study outcome data, or interfere with achieving the study objectives.</criteria>
