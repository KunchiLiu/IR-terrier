	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate if a 12-week total regimen of telaprevir in combination with pegylated interferon alfa 2a (Peg-IFN-alfa-2a) and ribavirin (RBV) (T12/PR12) is safe and effective in subjects who have the interleukin-28B (IL28B) CC genotype. The subjects enrolled in this study will have chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and will not have cirrhosis of the liver.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male and female subjects, 18 to 70 years of age, inclusive Treatmentnaive OR subjects (prior relapsers) may be included who did not achieve sustained viral response 24 weeks after last planned dose of study drug (SVR24) after at least 1 prior course of PegIFN/RBV therapy of standard duration and had a documented undetectable HCV RNA level at the planned end of treatment of at least 42week duration Subjects have IL28B CC genotype determined during screening Subjects have genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C and laboratory evidence of HCV infection for at least 6 months, defined by (1) documented HCV serology test at least 6 months before the first screening visit demonstrating the presence of antiHCV antibody, or (2) documented presence of HCV RNA by a sensitive and specific assay at least 6 months before the first screening visit, or (3) documented histologic evidence of chronic hepatitis C demonstrated by fibrosis on a standardized histologic grading system at least 6 months before the first screening visit. If only inflammation is present in the liver histologic report, then 6 months of laboratory evidence is required Subjects have received previous treatment with telaprevir or any other protease inhibitor(s) for chronic hepatitis C Subjects who did not achieve SVR24 after at least 1 prior course of PegIFN/RBV therapy of standard duration and never achieved undetectable HCV RNA while on treatment Subjects have evidence of hepatic decompensation Subjects have evidence of cirrhosis Subjects have diagnosed or suspected hepatocellular carcinoma Subjects have any other cause of significant liver disease in addition to hepatitis C, which may include but is not limited to malignancy with hepatic involvement, hepatitis B, drug or alcoholrelated cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or primary biliary cirrhosis. Steatosis is allowed if clinically asymptomatic</criteria>
