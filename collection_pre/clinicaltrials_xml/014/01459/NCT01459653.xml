	<brief_summary>This international, prospective, observational, open-label, pharmaco-epidemiologic study observes cancer patients at risk for chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia (FN) who are receiving filgrastim biosimilar (EP2006) for primary or secondary FN prophylaxis to better describe the patient population at risk for FN and treated prophylactically in physician's best clinical judgement with filgrastim biosimilar (EP2006), to describe prophylaxis patterns involving filgrastim biosimilar (EP2006), and to evaluate hematology levels and variability in hematological outcomes, impact on chemotherapy delivery, radiotherapy, surgery, and mortality. Additionally the study aims to identify patient cohorts who are vulnerable to poor response to FN prophylaxis and experience break-through episodes of FN, understand the differences between prophylaxis responders and non-responders, and describe the degree to which prophylaxis of FN is in congruence with guideline recommendations.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female adults (age &gt; / = 18 years) Diagnosed with one of the following types and stages of tumors: stage III or IV breast cancer; stage III or IV ovarian cancer; stage III or IV bladder cancer; stage III or IV lung cancer; metastatic prostate cancer; stage III or IV diffuse large Bcell lymphoma; multiple myeloma. Planned to receive primary prophylaxis with filgrastim biosimilar (EP2006) at the first cycle of chemotherapy (regardless of line of chemotherapy); or receiving secondary prophylaxis with filgrastim biosimilar (EP2006) irrespective of chemotherapy cycle. Treated with commercially available filgrastim biosimilar per physician's best clinical judgment and per current European filgrastim biosimilar (EP2006) label. Female patients must be either postmenopausal for one year or surgically sterile or using effective contraceptive methods such as barrier method with spermicide or an intrauterine device. Oral contraceptive use is allowed. Informed written consent to participate in the study by patients or their legal guardian. Patients with myeloid malignancies, with the exception of multiple myeloma. Sensitivity to filgrastim biosimilar or any other CSF. Hypersensitivity to E. coliderived proteins. Radiotherapy to â‰¥ 20% of total body bone. Infection within two weeks of starting current line of chemotherapy. Patients with several medical condition(s) that in view of the investigator prohibits participation in the study. Patients with willfully negligent nonadherence to their cancer treatment. Use of any investigational agent in the 30 days prior to enrollment. Women of childbearing potential not using the contraception method(s) described above. Women who are breastfeeding.</criteria>
