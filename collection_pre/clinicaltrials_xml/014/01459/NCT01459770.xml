	<brief_title>Medication Intervention in Transitional Care to Optimize Outcomes &amp; Costs for CKD &amp; ESRD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with CKD and ESRD have more co-morbidities, are hospitalized more often and for longer lengths of stay, and incur greater healthcare costs than patients with other chronic conditions. Enhanced hospital to home transitional care interventions have been shown to improve medication information transfer, reduce hospital readmissions, and slow the progression of declining health in the general population of hospitalized patients. What is not known is the impact enhanced transitional care can have for a very high-risk population, such as those with CKD and ESRD. Interventions that prevent or slow CKD progression, i.e. blood pressure control and intensive glycemic control in patients with diabetes, are all highly dependent on meticulous medication management. For hospitalized patients with CKD or ESRD who are transitioning to home, accurate and comprehensive information transfer is essential to optimal medication management. CKD and ESRD patients are in critical need of improved transitional care that includes accurate and comprehensive medication information transfer. The main objective of this application is to pilot-test the effectiveness of a medication information transfer intervention to improve clinically-relevant outcomes. To this end, the following Specific Aims will be achieved: 1. Evaluate the impact of transitional care interventions on acute care utilization following hospital discharge among patients with CKD or ESRD. 2. Evaluate the impact of transitional care strategies on management of CKD or ESRD management and complications.</detailed_description>
