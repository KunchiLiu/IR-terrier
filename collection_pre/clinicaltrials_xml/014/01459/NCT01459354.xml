	<brief_summary>Post-operative sore throat, cough, and hoarseness of voice are common, uncomfortable, distressing sequelae after tracheal intubation. It was postulated that these effects are because of irritation and inflammation of the airway. Bimanual laryngoscopy is known to improve visual field during intubation. This procedure might reduce laryngeal trauma during intubation and therefore reduce the incidence or degree of post-operative sore throat. This is the first prospective, double-blinded, controlled study, which is focused on the effects of bimanual laryngoscopy on first 24-houred post-operative sore throat (POST).</brief_summary>
