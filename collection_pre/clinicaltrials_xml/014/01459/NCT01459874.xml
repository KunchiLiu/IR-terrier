	<brief_summary>The purpose of the registry is to evaluate an organizational model fixing roles and behaviors of subjects involved in the remote monitoring of patients implanted with pacemakers and defibrillators. The evaluation will estimate the clinical efficiency and the impact on health service resources of the organizational model when this is implemented in the daily clinical practice.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of an Organizational Model for Remote Monitoring of Pacemaker and Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After a number of studies which assessed technical reliability and clinical implications of remote monitoring systems, a further step should approach the issue of how remote monitoring can be implemented as a part of routine activities of a cardiology outpatient clinic. A clear definition of roles and workflow to timely manage information and properly react to adverse events is required. The HomeGuide Registry proposes an organizational model specifying roles and procedures for outpatient clinics using a specific remote monitoring system in routine follow-up. The HomeGuide model is essentially based on an interaction between one or more allied professionals (expert and trained nurses or technicians) and a responsible physician. The main objective of the HomeGuide Registry is to evaluate: 1. Clinical efficiency of remote patient management; 2. Health service resources required by a remote patient management.</detailed_description>
