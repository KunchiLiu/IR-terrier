	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis is a progressively degenerative disease resulting in increasing pain, impairment and ultimately disability. While the available treatments seek to ameliorate pain or improve mobility, these treatments rarely modify the course of the disease, but rather attend to its consequences. For early stage osteoarthritis, treatment is largely limited to addressing the symptoms of inflammation with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These drugs do not stop the progression of the condition or regenerates damaged cartilage. This is a randomized and open labelled study aimed to determine the efficacy of intra-articular implantation of autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in patients with mild to moderate osteoarthritis.</brief_summary>
