	<brief_summary>The main objective of the study is to assess the survival in patient with non metastatic osteosarcoma of the extremities treated with different chemotherapy protocols, according to the expression of ABCB1/P-glycoprotein</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ABCB1/P-glycoprotein Expression as Biologic Stratification Factor for Patients With Non Metastatic Osteosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Primary objective is: * Overall survival in patient with non metastatic osteosarcoma of the extremities treated with different chemotherapy approach (5 drugs vs 3 drugs), according to the expression of ABCB1/P-glycoprotein The Secondary objectives are: - to assess the survival in patient who over express ABCB1/P-glycoprotein, with chemotherapy protocol based on all the 5 available active drugs (Methotrexate, cisplatinum, doxorubicine, ifosfamide and mifamurtide) - to assess the survival in patient who do not over express ABCB1/P-glycoprotein</detailed_description>
