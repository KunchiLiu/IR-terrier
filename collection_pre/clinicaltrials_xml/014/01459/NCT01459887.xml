	<brief_summary>CD20, the protein which is expressed on the surface of all mature B cells, is active in many B-cell lymphomas that express this molecule such as Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), the most frequently occurring subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. In clinical practice, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, and Prednisone combination chemotherapy (CHOP) is still considered one of the standard treatment to DLBCL. CMAB304(Retuxira), the chimeric monoclonal antibody is designed to targeted against CD20 for treatment of lymphoma diseases. This trial aimed to observe the safety and efficacy of CMAB304, by added CMAB304 to CHOP chemotherapy regimen compared with CHOP chemotherapy alone.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rituximab, a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has been proved valuable treatment for CD20-positive DLBCL. The combination of rituximab with CHOP has been shown to increase both survival and response rate, in comparison to CHOP alone. CMAB304(Retuxira), a biosimilar of rituximab, was developed by Shanghai CP Guojian Pharmaceutical Co.,Ltd. Previous Phase I study showed that CMAB304 was well tolerated as monotherapy and the pharmacokinetic data exhibited a non-linear profile over the dose range of 250 to 500 mg/m2. In this study, efficacy and safety of CMAB304 were evaluated in DLBCL patients.</detailed_description>
