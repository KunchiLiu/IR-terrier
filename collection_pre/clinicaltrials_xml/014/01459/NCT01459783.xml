	<brief_summary>Dementia is a condition that is growing in prevalence and which harms not only the afflicted individual but also adversely affects the health of their family and other informal caregivers. New methods for delivering comprehensive assistance to persons with dementia and their caregivers are known to be effective and can delay nursing home placement, but this study will discover 1) whether more face-to-face involvement rather than telephone delivery of this assistance will work better among poor patients in Los Angeles, and 2) if one method is better than the other, what are the differences in costs between them. These data will enable administrators in public health care settings around the US and non-profit foundations addressing dementia patient and caregiver needs to decide what method provides the best value and the best outcome relative to its cost.</brief_summary>
