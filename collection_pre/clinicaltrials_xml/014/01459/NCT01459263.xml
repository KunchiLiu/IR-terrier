	<brief_summary>More than 25 percent of the general population suffers from varicose veins, which has a considerable impact on quality of life. Nowadays endovenous treatment modalities for great saphenous incompetence are widely accepted. Mechanochemical endovenous ablation is a new tumescent-less technique, that combines mechanical endothelial damage using a rotating wire with the infusion of a liquid sclerosant. The current study aims at evaluating short and long term outcome after mechanochemical endovenous ablation.</brief_summary>
