	<brief_summary>Neurologically-impaired individuals may have significant neurologic morbidity related to epilepsy and seizure disorders. Finding safe, noninvasive methods of decreasing seizures, and potentially reversing the epileptogenic process, is of paramount importance in improving the lives of those with epilepsy. During a 3-year randomized, pilot clinical trial, twenty-seven subjects were randomly assigned to receive nightly exposure to music at periodic intervals between the hours of 9:00 PM and 8:00 AM. A significant effect was observed from the auditory stimulus exposure (p&lt;0.006).</brief_summary>
