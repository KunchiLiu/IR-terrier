	<brief_summary>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents receive anticipatory guidance about how to discipline their children as part of the well child visit. However, physicians provide counseling only 25-40% of the time. In regard to the type of discipline, the AAP recommends that primary care providers encourage parent to use non-physical forms of discipline and discourage parents from using physical punishment. Educational resources are needed to help physicians routinely provide these important anticipatory guidance messages. In this study, consecutive parents were exposed to routine anticipatory guidance messages before the well child visit with the physician. After the clinic visit, parents were invited to participate in a research study to assess their attitudes about physical punishment and other discipline strategies. The key research question of this study is: Can a brief multimedia program (i.e. Play Nicely program) affect parents' attitudes about the use of physical punishment? The time frame of the study was June through August of 2010. Data was collected immediately after the clinic visit and 2-4 weeks post clinic visit.</brief_summary>
