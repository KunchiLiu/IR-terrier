	<detailed_description>Comparison of two non-invasive methods for measuring tissue oxygenation. One is TCPO2 and the other is the new method of NIRS - near infrared spectroscopy in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) undergoing invasive treatment (surgical or endovascular). The NIRS probe has been used to measure tissue oxygenation in the cerebral circulation up to now. While TCPO2 is the established method for measuring tissue oxygenation in patients with CLI to evaluate the potential for wound healing.</detailed_description>
