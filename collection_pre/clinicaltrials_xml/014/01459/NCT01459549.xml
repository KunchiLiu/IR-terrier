	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial of Treating Hepatolithiasis (Accompanied With SOL) With Choledochojejunostomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatolithiasis (HL) is prevalent in East Asia, especially in China. While this condition results from multiple etiological factors, obstructive cholangitis is usually the main cause. In our clinical experience, the investigators have found few cases with obstruction of the common bile duct or sphincter of Oddi; to the contrary, almost half of our clinical cases showed sphincter of Oddi laxity (SOL). SOL results in reflux of duodenal fluid and Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection, which lead to the formation of stones in the biliary tract. Thus, HL tends to recur in SOL patients. For these patients, Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy(choledochojejunostomy with an anti-reflux ansa intestinalis) may be the most promising therapy.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>diagnosed as hepatolithiasis sphincter of oddi laxity is diagnosed during operation sign the informed consent form voluntary can cooperate well with the followup anticipated to be tolerant of RouxenY choledochojejunostomy already underwent choledochojejunostomy at past, which make the function of Sphincter of Oddi unable to be evaluated a lot of stones remain in biliary tract after operation, which make the recurrence or progression of hepatolithiasis unable to be evaluated</criteria>
