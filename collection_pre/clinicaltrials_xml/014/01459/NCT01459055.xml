	<brief_summary>Acrofacial vitiligo is a clinical form of vitiligo characterized by macules in distal digits, periorificial-facial and ano-genital areas. Vitiligo European Task Force classifies vitiligo as generalized or localized; generalized vitiligo may be further sub-divided into acrofacial, vulgaris and universalis, and localized vitiligo, into segmental and focal. Some authors do not believe that acrofacial is a real vitiligo clinical form, considering it as an initial form of vulgaris vitiligo. The aim of this study is to follow early- diagnosed acrofacial patients during ten years in order to define if these patients will maintain this clinical form or will evolute to a more severe clinical form.</brief_summary>
