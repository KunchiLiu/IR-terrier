	<brief_summary>The goal of this research is to conduct a pilot clinical study to image Celiac disease characteristic mucosal lesions and compare Optical Frequency Domain Imaging (OFDI) images to histologic evaluation in children, adolescents and young adults with suspected Celiac disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluate the Use of Optical Frequency Domain Imaging (OFDI) for Celiac Disease in Children, Adolescents and Young Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Optical Frequency Domain Imaging(OFDI) catheter will be used in conjunction with a standard pediatric endoscope. The endoscopist will introduce the OFDI imaging catheter through the biopsy channel of the endoscope already in place. The catheter will be passed into the view of the endoscope so that the tip of the catheter can be directly visualized throughout the procedure. The catheter will be placed adjacent to the bowel wall in the vicinity of the target locations. Once the OFDI probe is in place, OFDI imaging will start and data will be continuously collected during helical pullback scanning of the inner catheter drive shaft over a predetermined length of approximately 3 cm. It is expected that the total experimental procedure including the insertion of the OFDI catheter, OFDI imaging, and removal of the catheter will add approximately 10 minutes to the total length of the procedure.</detailed_description>
