	<brief_summary>Estrogens are implicated in the development of ovarian cancer and estrogen receptors (ER) alpha and beta are present in 20-100% of ovarian cancer patients. For this reason, antihormonal therapy with anti-estrogens or ER-antagonists is potentially an attractive treatment option. However, only a small proportion of patients (5-19%) will respond to antihormonal therapy. ER-expression in ER-positive breast cancer can be assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]fluoroestradiol (FES). In this study the investigators will evaluate whether FES-PET can be used to visualize and quantify ER-expression in ovarian cancer. If these results are positive, this would warrant further exploration of FES-PET imaging in ovarian cancer.</brief_summary>
