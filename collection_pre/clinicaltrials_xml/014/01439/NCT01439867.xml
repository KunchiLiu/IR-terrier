	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, 26-week, single-arm, open-label, safety study. Subjects will remain on study for 26 weeks or until time of kidney transplantation, whichever comes first. All subjects, in addition to receiving cinacalcet, will receive standard of care, which may include vitamin D sterols (25 OH vitamin D and/or 1-25 OH vitamin D and its analogs). Subjects who complete the 26-week study may be eligible to participate in an extension study (Study 20140159).</brief_summary>
