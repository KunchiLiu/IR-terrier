For men: Must be surgically sterile or compliant with a contraceptive regimen during and for 6 months after the treatment period. estimated life expectancy of at least 12 weeks written informed consent prior to any studyspecific procedures able and willing to learn to selfadminister LY2510924, or have a caregiver who is willing to learn and able to administer LY2510924 by subcutaneous (SC) injection currently enrolled in, or discontinued within the last 30 days from, a clinical trial involving an investigational product or nonapproved use of a drug or device, or concurrently enrolled in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study prior treatment with carboplatin/etoposide or LY2510924 any concurrent administration of any other antitumor therapy diagnosis of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or mixed NSCLC and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) no prior malignancy other than SCLC, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or nonmelanoma skin cancer, unless that prior malignancy was diagnosed and definitively treated 5 or more years prior to study entry with no subsequent evidence of recurrence. Patients with a history of low grade (Gleason score ≤6) localized prostate cancer will be eligible even if diagnosed less than 5 years prior to study entry serious concomitant systemic disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the patient's ability to adhere to the study requirements active or ongoing infection during screening requiring the use of systemic antibiotics serious cardiac condition, such as myocardial infarction within 6 months, angina, or heart disease as defined by the New York Heart Association Class III or IV clinical evidence of central nervous system (CNS) metastases or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, except for individuals who have previously treated central nervous system (CNS) metastases, are asymptomatic, and have had no requirement for steroid medication for 1 week prior to the first dose of study drug and have completed radiation 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. known or suspected allergy to any agent given in association with this trial pregnant or lactating women</criteria>
