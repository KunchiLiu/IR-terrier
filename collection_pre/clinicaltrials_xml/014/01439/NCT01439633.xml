	<brief_summary>The specific aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of marking target pathologic locations identified on Optical Frequency Domain Imaging (OFDI) datasets using superficial cautery marks of the esophagus that are visible by endoscopy for subsequent guidance of biopsy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optical Frequency Domain Imaging (OFDI) Surveillance and Image Guided Biopsy of the Esophagus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty four consenting patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) surveillance following a confirmed diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus will be recruited at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) . Along with Optical Frequency Domain Imaging (OFDI) imaging and cautery marking for targeted biopsy, the patients will undergo a standard of care clinical Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) procedure including endoscopic random biopsy. This study requires the use of a balloon catheter which is a commonly used technique and is accepted in clinical practice for dilation of esophageal and colonic strictures and for photodynamic therapy. Once in position, the OFDI tissue marking laser will be activated by the physician. The physician will control the marking and make two marks of a duration of 2 seconds each. The 2 seconds time period will limit the tissue effects to only the superficial layers of the esophageal mucosa. It is expected that the total experimental time including insertion and inflation of the OFDI balloon catheter, OFDI imaging, tissue marking, and removal of the OFDI balloon will add approximately 15 minutes to the total length of the EGD.</detailed_description>
