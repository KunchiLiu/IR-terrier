	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of GSK Biologicals' influenza candidate vaccine GSK2321138A when compared to non-influenza vaccine comparators in children 6 to 35 months of age. Recruitment will encompass at least 4 independent cohorts: a first cohort in the Northern Hemisphere (2011-2012), a second cohort in subtropical countries (2012), third cohort in the Northern Hemisphere (2012-2013) and a fourth cohort and additional independent cohorts possibly in NH countries (end 2013) and subtropical countries (beginning 2014).</brief_summary>
