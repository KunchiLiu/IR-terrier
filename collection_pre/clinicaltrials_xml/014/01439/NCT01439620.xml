	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to evaluate the potential of comprehensive biliary Optical Frequency Domain Imaging (OFDI) for assessing common bile duct or common hepatic duct strictures, determining cholangiocarcinoma margins, and evaluating primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optical Frequency Domain Imaging (OFDI) for Biliary Stricture Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be conducted in approximately 20 patients with known or suspected common bile duct or common hepatic duct stricture scheduled for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with duodenoscope-assisted cholangiopancreatoscopy (DACP) and biopsy. Following initial fluoroscopic evaluation, the study experimental procedure will begin. The catheter will be passed through the auxiliary channel of the duodenoscope, across the papilla and into the common bile duct. The extra-biliary portion of the catheter will be visible by the duodenoscope at all times. The intrabiliary portion of the catheter will be visible by fluoroscopy, and will be positioned across the biliary stricture. Rotational cross-sectional images of the bile duct will be obtained using the OFDI imaging catheter while pulling back the internal optical components over a pre-determined length. OFDI imaging will be conducted approximately from 1 cm distal to 1 cm and proximal to the stricture margins identified by fluoroscopy.</detailed_description>
