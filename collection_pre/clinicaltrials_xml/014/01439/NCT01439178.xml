	<brief_summary>Purpose: To evaluate the acute changes in intraocular cytokines after intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) in proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Design: Prospective, open-label, controlled, randomized interventional clinical trial. Participants: Twenty eyes of 28 consecutive patients who are scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy (ppV) for proliferative diabetic retinopathy were prospectively enrolled. Methods: All patients were randomly assigned to receive IVB either at 2 or 7 days before ppV. Aqueous humor samples were taken from anterior chamber just before IVB and at the time of surgery. Multiplex cytokine array were used to assay various cytokines</brief_summary>
