	<brief_summary>GSK2336805 is a hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A inhibitor being developed for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC). This study will assess the safety, antiviral activity, and pharmacokinetics of GSK2336805 alone and in combination with peginterferon alfa 2a and ribavirin in subjects with chronic hepatitis C (CHC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety, Antiviral Activity, and Pharmacokinetics of GSK2336805 With Peginterferon and Ribavirin in Chronic Hepatitis C Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HCV infection is a major public health problem globally and a leading cause of chronic liver disease. New medications are needed that are better tolerated and offer a greater chance of achieving sustained viral clearance compared to currently available therapy. GSK2336805 is a HCV NS5A inhibitor being developed for the treatment of subjects with CHC. This Phase II, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study will assess the safety, antiviral activity, and pharmacokinetics of GSK2336805 alone and in combination with peginterferon alfa 2a and ribavirin in subjects with CHC. Subjects will be randomly allocated on a 2:1 basis to GSK2336805 or matching placebo and will be stratified by IL28B status and HCV viral genotype (genotype 1 or 4). The study consists of 2 parts. In Part 1, GSK2336805 or matching placebo will be given as single-dose monotherapy (Day 1). In Part 2, GSK2336805 or matching placebo will be co-administered with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin through 4 weeks of treatment (Days 2 to 28). After completion of Part 2, GSK2336805/matching placebo will be discontinued and subjects will be offered continued standard-of-care anti-HCV therapy.</detailed_description>
