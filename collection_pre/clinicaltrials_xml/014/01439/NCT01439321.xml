	<brief_summary>Chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is characterized by low platelet counts and the risk of severe bleeding complications. The two recently introduced TPO-RA drugs, namely, eltrombopag and romiplostim, have shown efficacious sustained response with continuous administration. Both drugs are indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopia in patients with chronic ITP who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, or splenectomy. While these trials address important clinical questions they were not intended to evaluate what happens in the real-world settings with actual patient living daily lives. The purpose of this health outcomes study is to understand how the two TPO receptor agonists (TPO-RA) currently available in the US are being used in clinical practice and how their use impacts chronic ITP patients' daily lives. The study hypothesis is that patients who switched to eltrombopag report a better health-related quality of life than those who switched to romiplostim. This study utilized a hybrid design of retrospective chart review study and cross-sectional patient survey. A customized Patient Case Report Form (CRF) will be used to retrospectively collect clinical data from patient medical charts where the primary cohorts consist of patients who have switched from other ITP medication to eltrombopag or romiplostim. A cross-sectional survey will be employed to collect patient reported outcomes (PRO) data, including health-related quality of life and treatment satisfaction, using a compository questionnaire. Analyses of cross-sectional survey data and retrospective medical chart review data in patients who switch to either eltrombopag or romiplostim from their prior primary therapy will be conducted.</brief_summary>
