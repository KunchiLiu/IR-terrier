	<brief_title>Copper Intrauterine Device (IUD) Insertion at Cesarean Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a prospective clinical study with 90 patients undergoing cesarean section. After delivery of the placenta, a ParaGardÂ® copper T380A IUD was inserted through the hysterotomy site. IUD placement was confirmed by visualization of the strings at the cervical os or via ultrasound at the 6 week postpartum visit. Subjects also received a phone call 6 months after IUD placement to ascertain physician follow-up and patient satisfaction. This telephone call was to ensure that each subject attended her postpartum visit, had an evaluation of IUD placement and then we performed a survey. This survey used a Likert Scale to measure each subject's satisfaction. The fields included very satisfied, satisfied, somewhat satisfied, neutral, somewhat unsatisfied, unsatisfied and very unsatisfied.</detailed_description>
