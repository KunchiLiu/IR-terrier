	<brief_summary>Acute low back pain is a common disorder in general practice. Some general practitioners (GPs) treat acute low back pain (LBP) with acupuncture, despite lacking evidence of its effectiveness for this condition. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether a single treatment-session with acupuncture can reduce time to recovery when applied in addition to standard LBP-treatment according to the Norwegian national guidelines. Analyses of prognostic factors for recovery and cost-effectiveness will also be carried out. The investigators hypotheses are: 1. Acupuncture treatment contributes to faster pain-recovery in acute LBP compared to standard treatment in general practice provided in accordance with the Norwegian national guidelines. 2. Acupuncture treatment for acute LBP improves function, and reduces drug use and sick leave, compared to the standard treatment in general practice provided in accordance with national guidelines. 3. Acupuncture treatment for acute LBP is a cost-effective treatment in general practice. The investigators intend to include a total of 270 patients, 135 in the intervention group and 135 in the control group. The investigators planned to do an interim analysis when reaching inclusion of 150 patients. However, this might lead to reduced overall significance level, and as a result of slow inclusion rate (by December 2015), the investigators plan to extend the inclusion time with one year and then complete the study in March 2017.</brief_summary>
