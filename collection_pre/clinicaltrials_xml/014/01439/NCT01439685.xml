	<brief_summary>This study entails retrospective and prospective review of data from a database protocol. Data gathered will be then analyzed for a set amount of patients. In this study, the investigators will compare biliary stenting vs. biliary stenting plus photodynamic therapy (PDT) and assess if PDT can improve quality of life and prolong survival.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Biliary Stenting Alone vs. Stenting With Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) During ERCP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Successful palliation of biliary obstruction is the main goal for reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with biliary disease and biliary obstruction related to cholangiocarcinoma. Surgical biliary bypass is unfortunately complicated by a 30-day postoperative mortality rate of between 7 and 24%. Moreover, because of recovery time the quality of life following surgery is only improved in a minority. At present endoscopic insertion of a plastic or metal stent is the method of choice to relieve obstructive jaundice without the high morbidity and mortality associated with surgery. But this relief is unfortunately temporary since stents tend to become obstructed and the fact that effective biliary drainage in the proximal lesion is challenging. Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) is a new therapeutic approach that specifically targets neoplastic cells. This therapy involves the intravenous administration of a photosensitizing agent followed by activation of the agent by illumination with non-thermal light of a specific wavelength, resulting in cell death from direct cytotoxicity and ischemic necrosis. Cytotoxicity is directly proportional to tissue oxygenation. A prospective, randomized and controlled trial study by Ortner et all confirmed the significant advantage of PDT with regard to relief of jaundice, quality of life, and survival. The improvement of survival in the randomized PDT group was so impressive that it was believed unethical to continue with randomization after the first 39 patients (20 and 19 in each group).Previously, the principal investigator conducted such a study (and also conducted Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography with PDT) at the University of Virginia, and would continue to conduct these procedures, as well as the study at WCMC.</detailed_description>
