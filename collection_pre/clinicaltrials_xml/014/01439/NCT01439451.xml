	<brief_summary>The proposed project is a prospective experimental Randomized Control Trial study design. Independent old adults (age 70 years old and older) who do not suffer from balance problems willing to participate in the study will be tested before and after Peturbation balance training during walking to explore whether there are differences in balance control and balance reactions as a result of training.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Perturbation Training on Balance Control in Elderly Persons</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 48 old adults will be enrolled, evaluated and trained. They will be randomly assigned to two groups: one exercise group (perturbation training) and one group without perturbation. No gender based differences are expected for the recovery outcome measures so we will be able to pool male and female individuals for this analysis. Each subject of the experimental and of the control groups will be trained on 24 occasions over a period of 10-12 weeks (20-30 minutes, 2-3 times/week). This regimen was based on previous balance training study that demonstrated improvements in balance control with similar training duration and frequency. Gait and balance function and physical activity level will be tested in both groups before, immediately after, 3 and 6 months after completion of the training period to explore the benefit and carryover of training. In addition using monthly phone calls, falls, their severity, functional activity limitations in the home and community setting and health status will be monitored 12 months after the training period.</detailed_description>
