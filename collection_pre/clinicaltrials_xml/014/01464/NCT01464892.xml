	<brief_summary>Imagery Rescripting (IR)is a promising treatment for PTSD in adult survivors of early, chronic, interpersonal trauma (e.g. Smucker &amp; Dancu, 1999). So far, this protocol has not been investigated within a controlled setting with patients with PTSD following early, chronic, interpersonal trauma. The aim of the proposed study is to 1. investigate the efficacy of Imagery Rescripting and 2. check whether the efficacy of Imagery Rescripting can be improved by adding a stabilization phase (Skills training in affective and interpersonal regulation, STAIR) prior to this treatment. In a randomized controlled trial three conditions will be compared: 1. Imagery Rescripting 2. STAIR + Imagery Rescripting 3. Wait-list control</brief_summary>
