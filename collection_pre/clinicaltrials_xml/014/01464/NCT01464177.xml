	<brief_summary>Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor in adults. The treatment comprises maximal safe resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Despite appropriate management, 90% of the patients will develop relapse or progression. After progression, the median survival is 5.2 months (Stupp, 2009). The treatment of GBM relapse remains investigational. Reirradiation is an option in selected cases. The objective of this study is to compare 2 schemes of stereotactic hypofractionated radiotherapy in the management of recurrent GBM.</brief_summary>
