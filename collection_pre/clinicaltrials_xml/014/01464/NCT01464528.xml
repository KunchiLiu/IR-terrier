	<brief_title>Safety Study of Use of Hyaluronic Acid Gel To Prevent Intrauterine Adhesions In Hysteroscopic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Operations in the uterus are currently possible using a hysteroscopic approach. Intrauterine procedures include; polypectomy, myomectomy, removal of lost IUD,removal of a septum and more. One serious though rare complication of operative hysteroscopy is the development of intra-uterine adhesions. Such adhesions, also known as asherman's syndrome, can cause serious consequences such as infertility and miscarriage. The hypothesis is that the removal of the endometrium and the exposure of ra uterine wall to each other can cause attachment and adhesions. the treatment is to mechanically break the adhesion. recurrence is however common. There currently are no methods to prevent adhesions following curettage or hysteroscopy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety of using hyaluronic gel after hysteroscopic surgery. At a later research, the efficacy of barrier gel will be measures.</detailed_description>
