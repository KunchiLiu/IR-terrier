	<detailed_description>The investigators hypothesized that increasing the cardiac output by use of atropine in children might result in a reduction of the intubation time needed to facilitate tracheal intubation. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine TimeEI with a low dose of esmeron (rocuronium) (0.3 mg.kg-1) for achievement of successful tracheal intubation conditions during intravenous (i.v.) anaesthesia using propofol and alfentanil in children and to determine whether administration of i.v. atropine (atropine sulphate) (10 Î¼g.kg-1) during anaesthesia induction reduced these times.</detailed_description>
