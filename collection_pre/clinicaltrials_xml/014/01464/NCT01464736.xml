	<brief_summary>On the following tests, there would be a greater increase in the functionality of COPD patients who underwent combined therapy than in those who only exercised: a set of activities of daily living (ADLs), the six-minute walk test (6MWT), an incremental symptom-limited cardiopulmonary test (CPT), and the physical functioning scale of the Short-Form 36 quality of life questionnaire (SF-36).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Impact of aerobic exercise plus noninvasive ventilation (NIV) on the functionality of patients with COPD. Thirty patients (70.5 - 8.5 years) with COPD (forced expiratory volume in the first second 48.5 - 15.4% of predicted) were randomized into either a physical training group involving aerobic treadmill exercise (PTG, n=12) or an exercise plus bilevel ventilation group (PTGNIV, n=11) with sessions three times a week for six weeks.</detailed_description>
