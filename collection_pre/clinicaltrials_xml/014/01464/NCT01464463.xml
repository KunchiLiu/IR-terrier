	<brief_title>The Impact of Psychological Interventions on Psychometric and Immunological Measures in Patients With Major Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The interest of the investigation is to compare the impact of CBT combined with exercise, CBT combined with euthymic therapy and CBASP on depression and further psychopathological variables (assessed at 5 points). Previous findings indicate increased concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines in depression. A bidirectional relationship between depression and immunological alterations has been suggested: On the one hand pro-inflammatory cytokines may contribute to depression, on the other hand depression-linked changes (e.g. a reduction of activity, increased stress-sensitivity) may lead to increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, this study is also supposed to investigate the influence of above mentioned interventions on pro-inflammatory cytokines. Using a waiting group, potential changes in psychometric and biological parameters without any intervention are controlled. Assessments take place at baseline, after 4 weeks of treatment, after 8 weeks of treatment, after 16 weeks of treatment and 6 months follow up. 200 patients with Major Depression (DSM IV, BDI II at baseline â‰¥18) will be included. Patients will be randomized and assigned to one of the 4 groups.</detailed_description>
