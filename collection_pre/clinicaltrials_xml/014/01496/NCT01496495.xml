	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1 study during which patients with low or intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) will receive investigational study drug ARRY-614. This study has 2 parts. In the first part, patients will receive increasing doses of study drug in order to achieve the highest dose of the study drug possible that will not cause unacceptable side effects. Approximately 50 patients from the US will be enrolled in Part 1 (Completed). In the second part of the study, patients will receive the best dose of study drug determined from the first part of the study and will be followed to see what side effects and effectiveness the study drug has, if any, in treating the cancer. Approximately 30 patients from the US will be enrolled in Part 2 (Completed).</brief_summary>
