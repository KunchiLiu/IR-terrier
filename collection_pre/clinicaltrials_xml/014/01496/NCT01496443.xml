	<brief_title>TAK-875 Glimepiride Drug-Interaction Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TAK-875 is being developed at Takeda Global Research and Development, Inc. as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in participants with T2DM. This study will determine whether administration of glimepiride alters the pharmacokinetics (PK) of TAK-875, and whether TAK-875 affects the PK of glimepiride.</detailed_description>

The participant has a normal creatinine clearance of &gt;60 mL/min using the CockcroftGault formula at Screening and Checkin (Day 1). 1. The participant is participating in another investigational study or has taken any investigational drug within 30 days prior to Checkin (Day 1). 2. The participant has received TAK875 in a previous clinical study. 3. The participant's QTcF (Fridericia's correction) is &gt;450 msec (for both male and female participants) at Screening or at Checkin (Day 1) as read on the printout of the ECG produced by the ECG equipment or manually calculated and then evaluated by the investigator. 4. The participant has a resting pulse or heart rate &lt;45 bpm or &gt;100 bpm at Screening or Checkin (Day 1). 5.
