	<brief_summary>Study objectives are to compare - influenza antibody levels in infant sera and maternal colostrum or breast milk at delivery, 2, and 6 months women who receive influenza immunization in early pregnancy, late pregnancy, or no influenza immunization during pregnancy and their infants - immune response to infant influenza immunization in infant sera at 6 and 7 months in infants with and without preexisting influenza antibody. Study hypotheses are that infants born to pregnant women who receive influenza immunization in late pregnancy will have - higher levels and a longer serum influenza antibody duration in sera (hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers) and colostrum/breast milk (influenza-specific IgA and IgG by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) than infants of women immunized in early pregnancy or not immunized - fewer infants with preexisting antibody will have protective influenza antibody levels after they are immunized against influenza at 6 and 7 months compared with those without preexisting influenza antibody</brief_summary>
