	<brief_summary>This research trial studies biomarkers in tumor tissue samples from younger patients with rhabdomyosarcoma. Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer</brief_summary>
