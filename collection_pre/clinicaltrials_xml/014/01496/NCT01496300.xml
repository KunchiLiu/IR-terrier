	<brief_summary>This study was initiated to investigate the impact of the computer based image free navigation on the precision of the cup implantation. The implantation of the acetabular component (cup) is known to be a critical step in hip endoprosthetics. The cup position influences significantly the function, the absence of pain and the longevity of the artificial hip joint. The image free navigation system OrthoPilot is used to control the positioning of the cup during surgery.</brief_summary>
