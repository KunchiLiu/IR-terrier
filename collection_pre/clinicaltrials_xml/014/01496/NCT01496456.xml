	<brief_title>Radiographic Progression of Infiltrated Caries Lesions In-vivo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A 3-year longitudinal, prospective, randomized control clinical trial (RCT) is designed incorporating a split-mouth intra-oral design. Young volunteers (14-35 years old) with at least two early lesions in posterior teeth will be enrolled into this clinical trial to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of arresting lesion progression by infiltrating the lesions. The infiltration protocol included application of on-market materials and applicators, and was performed in one session.</detailed_description>
