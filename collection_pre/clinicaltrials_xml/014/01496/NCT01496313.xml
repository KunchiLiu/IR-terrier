	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to give patients with medullary thyroid cancer either 300mg/day or 150mg/day vandetanib and compare how well each dose affects how their cancer responds. It will also help the investigators understand the side effects of different doses in these patients.</brief_summary>
