	<brief_summary>This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of RO5490258 (MetMab) in combination with either of two backbone chemotherapy regimens in the first-line setting in patients with incurable Stage IIIB or IV non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. In Cohort 1, patients will be randomized to receive 4 cycles of bevacizumab (Avastin) 15 mg/kg iv, paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 iv, platinum (cisplatin/carboplatin) iv plus either MetMab 15 mg/kg iv or placebo on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. In Cohort 2, patients will be randomized to receive pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 iv, platinum (cisplatin/carboplatin) iv plus either MetMAb 15 mg/m2 iv or placebo on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Patients who have not progressed after 4 cycles will be offered maintenance therapy with their assigned treatment of bevacizumab plus either MetMAb or placebo (Cohort 1) or pemetrexed plus either MetMAb or placebo (Cohort 2). Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.</brief_summary>
