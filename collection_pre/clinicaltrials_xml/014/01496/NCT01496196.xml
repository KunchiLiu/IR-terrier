	<brief_summary>Hemoptysis is defined as the expectoration of blood from respiratory tract, a spectrum that varies from blood-streaking of sputum to coughing up large amounts of pure blood. Massive hemoptysis variably defined as the expectoration of 100-600 ml over 24-h period. The most common site of bleeding is the tracheobronchial tree, which can be affected by inflammation (acute or chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis) or by neoplasm ( bronchogenic carcinoma, endobronchial metastatic carcinoma, bronchial carcinoid tumor). The bronchial arteries, which originate either from aorta or from intercostal arteries, and are part of the high-pressure systemic circulation, are the source of bleeding in bronchitis or bronchiectasis or endo bronchial tumors.</brief_summary>
