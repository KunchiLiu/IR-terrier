	<brief_summary>Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) has been widely used as a diagnostic and treatment techniques of gastrointestinal small lesions. Para-procedure bleeding is one of the common complication following EMR. Several endoscopic hemostasis methods are currently in use including metallic hemoclip. EndoClotÂ® absorbable polysaccharide hemostat (PAPH) as a new hemostasis material was previously used for surgical hemostasis, but the therapeutic effect and safety in endoscopic application remains unknown. This randomized controlled study has been designed to compare PAPH with metallic hemoclip in their hemostatic effect of intra-procedure bleeding control and rebleeding prevention during and after EMR.</brief_summary>
