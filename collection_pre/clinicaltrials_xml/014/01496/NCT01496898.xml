	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to examine changes in the bacterial ecology and inflammatory markers of the female genital tract with levonorgestrel intrauterine device placement. The specific research objectives of this project include: 1. Characterization of vaginal, cervical and uterine bacterial species and communities prior to and after LNG IUD placement using bacterial DNA microarray analysis. Samples will be collected up to 1 week before and 2 months after IUD insertion. 2. Characterization of vaginal, cervical and uterine inflammatory cytokine milieu prior to and after LNG IUD placement using human RNA microarray analysis. Samples will be analyzed from up to one day before and three weeks after IUD insertion. 3. Establish a tissue bank of vaginal, cervical and uterine specimens for future research.</brief_summary>
