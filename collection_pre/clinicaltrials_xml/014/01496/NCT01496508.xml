	<brief_summary>Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is common in preterm infants born at less than 32 weeks gestation; surfactant and mechanical ventilation have been the standard treatment. However, despite advances in neonatal respiratory care, a considerable number of preterm infants develop chronic lung disease, termed bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which is associated with neonatal death, prolonged neonatal intensive care stay, and impaired neurodevelopment. High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) was developed as a new ventilation technique in the late 1970s. It was expected to result in less BPD and death as a primary model of ventilation compared to conventional ventilation (CV) in the treatment of RDS. However, there is disagreement concerning the advantage of HFOV over CV in the treatment of RDS in preterm infants regarding the prevention of death, BPD, intraventricular hemorrhage, and periventricular leucomalacia in the short term. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of HFOV and CV in preterm infants with severe RDS.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patients were monitored including blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, ventilator settings, and arterial blood gases pre- or during mechanical ventilation. PaO2/FIO2 was calculated. After 2 hours ventilation, if PaO2/FIO2 &lt;200, patients were given rescue surfactant therapy (Curosurf 200mg/kg). A subsequent dose (100mg/kg) was administered when PaO2/FIO2 &lt;200 12 hours after the previous dose. Surfactant was administered with use of in-line catheters. Suctioning was performed 6 hours after surfactant administration, except for some patients needed suction soon, with use of an in-line suction catheter. Ventilation continued during the administration of surfactant and suctioning.</detailed_description>
