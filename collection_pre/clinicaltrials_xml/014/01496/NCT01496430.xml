	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antihypertensive and antiglycemic effects, as well as the safety and tolerability of TAK-491 (azilsartan medoxomil), once daily (QD), in stage 1 hypertensive, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) participants whose glycemic control was inadequate on metformin alone.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study included a Screening Period of up to 4 weeks, which coincided with a 2-week single-blind, placebo Run-in Period, a 24 week Treatment Period, and a 2-week Follow-up Period. The duration of the study was approximately 30 weeks. The planned number of participants (n=450) was not reached; actual enrollment consisted of 105 particpants. Due to low enrollment this study was terminated early by Takeda.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Was male or female and ≥18 years. 2. Had type 2 diabetes mellitus with HbA1c of ≥7.5 to ≤9.5% at Screening. 3. Was treated with metformin alone (no treatment with any antidiabetic agents other than metformin within the 3 months prior to Screening) and was experiencing inadequate glycemic control. The participant should have received metformin monotherapy for ≥8 weeks prior to Screening at a stable dose ≥1500 mg). Participants with a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) that was documented to be less than 1500 mg of metformin could also be enrolled if this dose had been stable for 8 weeks prior to Screening. 4. Was treated with antihypertensive therapy and had a mean, trough, sitting clinic systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥135 and &lt; 160 mm Hg on Day 1 (after washout of prior antihypertensive therapy) or the participant had not received antihypertensive treatment within 28 days before Screening and had a mean sitting clinic SBP ≥135 and &lt; 160 mm Hg at the Screening Visit and on Day 1. 5. Had clinical laboratory evaluations (including clinical chemistry, hematology, and complete urinalysis) within the reference range for the testing laboratory or results that were deemed not clinically significant in this participant population for inclusion in this study, by the investigator. 1. Had a mean, trough, sitting clinic diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 100 mm Hg at Day 1. 2. Had type 1 or poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (HbA1c &gt;9.5%) at Screening. 3. Was taking or expected to take an excluded medication. 4. Had a history of myocardial infarction, heart failure, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass graft, percutaneous coronary intervention, hypertensive encephalopathy, cerebrovascular accident, or transient ischemic attack. 5. Had clinically significant cardiac conduction defects (for example, 3rd degree atrioventricular block, left bundle branch block, sick sinus syndrome, atrial fibrillation). 6. Had hemodynamically significant left ventricular outflow obstruction due to aortic valvular disease. 7. Had secondary hypertension of any etiology (e.g., renovascular disease, pheochromocytoma, Cushing's syndrome). 8. Had renal dysfunction defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at Screening. 9. Had albuminuria defined as &gt;200 mg/g at Screening. 10. Had known or suspected unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis. 11. Had unexplained microhematuria ≥3 RBCs/HPF or macrohematuria at Screening and confirmed on repeat testing. 12. Treatment with antidiabetic agents (sulfonylureas, glucagonlike peptide1 (GLP1) analogues, dipeptidyl peptidase4 (DPP4) inhibitors, glinides, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), and/or insulin) other than metformin during the 3 months prior to Screening. 13. Had hyperkalemia as defined by central laboratory normal reference range at Screening.</criteria>
