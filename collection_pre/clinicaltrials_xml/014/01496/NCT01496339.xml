	<brief_title>Human Menstrual Blood-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Transplantation in Treating Type 1 Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus is chronic metabolic diease caused by absent or rejection insulin from pancreatic b cells.The traditional treatment strategies for diabetes are daily injections with insulin and transplantation of islets from cadaver. However, daily injuection is very inconvenient and there is a shortage of organs and life long immunosuppression. Therefore, such therapy can be offered to a very limited number of patients only. MSC-based therapeutic intervention has become an emerging strategy for the replacement of injured tissues. MSCs also have been noted to possess immunomodulatory effects in vivo. Thus, their potential for clinical use as a cell-based therapy should be focused and observation.</detailed_description>
