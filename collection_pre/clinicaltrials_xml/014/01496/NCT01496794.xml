	<brief_summary>The intent of this surveillance study will be to obtain written permission from patients with bacterial endophthalmitis in order to compare sterilization rates of their cultured bacterial isolates to standard therapy (vancomycin and ceftazidime) versus combination therapy with vancomycin, ceftazidime, and moxifloxacin. Research hypothesis: 1. Cultured bacterial isolates will demonstrate faster in vitro sterilization rates with combination treatment (vancomycin, ceftazidime, and moxifloxacin) compared to "standard therapy" with vancomycin and ceftazidime. 2. Longitudinal analysis of resistance patterns of cultured isolates will show increasing rates of multi-antibiotic resistance.</brief_summary>
