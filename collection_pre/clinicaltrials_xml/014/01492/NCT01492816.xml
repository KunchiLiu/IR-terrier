	<brief_summary>The proposed study seeks to continue Connect to Protect® (C2P) community mobilization efforts that have developed coalitions that plan for and bring about structural changes for purposes of reducing HIV incidence and prevalence among youth in targeted communities at nine sites.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhancement of Connect to Protect® (C2P)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Earlier phases of C2P have been outlined in ATN Protocols 016a, 016b, 040/040b. The C2P community mobilization model entails: determining a geographic area and population of focus for the coalitions to prioritize their planning and action (accomplished in an earlier phase of C2P); coalitions establishing a shared vision and mission; development of a strategic plan focused on structural changes to reduce risks associated with HIV; process documentation; and feedback as technical assistance to the coalitions. The National Coordinating Center (NCC), operating under the direction of the Protocol Chair, provides guidance, training, technical assistance and feedback to coalitions. This protocol continues the C2P mobilization effort and includes enhanced strategic planning activities to assist the coalitions in identifying necessary and relevant structural changes. The evaluation of C2P includes both process evaluation (i.e., documentation of coalition actions and achievements of structural changes; and outcome evaluation to qualitatively assess (via Key Informant (KI) interviews) if and how C2P efforts, including completed structural changes, have influenced the risk environment within each community. In addition, local health surveillance data and HIV testing data will be used to evaluate changes in HIV testing patterns and HIV/Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) morbidity among youth.</detailed_description>
