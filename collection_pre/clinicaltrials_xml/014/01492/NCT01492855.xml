	<brief_summary>The knee menisci are two semicircular fibrocartilaginous structures located between the articular cartilage surfaces of the femur and tibia in the medial and lateral joint compartments. The main functions of the menisci are shock absorption and load transmission in the knee, mainly through distribution of mechanical stress over a large area of the joint cartilage. The hypothesis is that primarily older age, meniscal lesion and high pain score at baseline are associated with poorer outcome.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Meniscal lesions are the most common source of disability of the knee with a reported incidence rate of up to 18 meniscal lesions per 10.000 subjects per year in Denmark. The meniscus may tear as a result of knee trauma or it may tear spontaneously due to aging and degenerative processes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly used in the diagnosis of meniscal lesions with documented high sensitivity and specificity. Meniscal lesion symptoms vary from reduction in knee function with decreased muscle strength and difficulties in performing strenuous activities involving knee flexion and rotation to pain, effusion locking and, giving way.</detailed_description>
