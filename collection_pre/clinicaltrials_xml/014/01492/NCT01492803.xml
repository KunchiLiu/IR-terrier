	<brief_title>Trial of Probiotics to Lower Microbial Translocation and Immune Activation in HIV-Infected Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double masked randomized placebo-controlled trial to examine if once daily probiotic therapy will lower serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels and immune activation among HIV-infected youth. The study will enroll two cohorts: (1) a cohort of subjects who are not receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) and have absolute CD4 T-cell count greater than 350 cells/ul and quantitative HIV-1 plasma RNA (viral load) less than 50,000 copies/ml; and (2) a cohort of subjects who are receiving ART and have absolute CD4 T-cell count greater than 350 cells/ul and and quantitative HIV-1 plasma RNA (viral load) less than 400 copies/ml.</detailed_description>
