	<brief_summary>"Blank" has designed a medical diagnostic system in the form of an unvalidated online questionnaire and drawing tool used to describe and identify the location of knee pain, respectively. A component of the survey includes the patient inputting their diagnosis as the etiology of their knee pain. Dr. Ivo Dinov's team has used the data from 100,000 patient surveys to construct a probabilistic model to diagnose those who fill out the questionnaire and knee pain map but do not have a diagnosis. However, the validity of the online survey and the accuracy of the probabilistic model has not been confirmed in patients with known diagnoses. Therefore, the purpose of this study will be to recruit patients with knee pain at UCLA orthopedic clinics to complete the online survey which will then be applied to the probabilistic model to output possible diagnoses. The results will be compared to the actual diagnosis assigned to that patient in the clinic. If validated, the online survey may serve as a tool for diagnostic and research purposes.</brief_summary>
