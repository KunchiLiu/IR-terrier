	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate if cholecystectomy first (studied group) versus sequential common bile duct imaging/cholecystectomy (control group) result in a decrease of hospital stay, morbidity/mortality and costs in the management of patients with a suspicion of gallstone migration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cholecystectomy First vs Sequential Common Bile Duct Imaging + Cholecystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emergency cholecystectomy is nowadays an accepted surgical procedure routinely performed worldwide. The main indications include acute cholecystitis, cholangitis and gallstone migration. Abnormal liver function tests upon admission and suspicion for accompanying common bile duct (CBD) stone can delay the surgical management due to the need for further investigations and/or therapeutic maneuvers. These procedures include magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP). While useful to detect or exclude potential CBD stones, these procedures include inherent risks, delay the surgical treatment, extend hospital stay and as a result, increase the overall medical costs. They can also potentially increase the morbidity and/or mortality by delaying emergency cholecystectomy (due to the presence of more local inflammation and adherence). Finally, more and more centers perform systematic intra-operative cholangiogram during cholecystectomies (laparoscopic or open), which allow an accurate assessment of the CBD and potentially lead to its subsequent exploration (endoscopic or surgical). In this study, the investigators will assess the following hypotheses: - Patients with a SUSPICION of gallstone migration (with or without associated cholecystitis) should undergo emergency cholecystectomy with intra-operative cholangiogram (IOC) first - "Cholecystectomy first" strategy will decrease both the length of hospital stay and the morbidity/mortality by decreasing the number of unnecessary EUS, MRCP and ERCP and therefore decreasing the overall number of their complications, as well as decreasing the complications related to delayed cholecystectomy (increased adherences due to inflammation, especially in case of associated cholecystitis, which increase the risk of bleeding, CBD lesion, duodenal lesion, gastric lesion, colon lesion, gallbladder perforation and intra-abdominal gallstones spillage with potential</detailed_description>
