	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to analyze the pathophysiological implications of glucagon and the incretin hormones in patients with liver disease (Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or cirrhosis) with and without diabetes compared with healthy controls. The present study will contribute significantly to the understanding of the pathophysiology of liver disease and glucose metabolism. The final goal is that the results could pave the way for new treatment modalities for patients with liver disease.</brief_summary>
