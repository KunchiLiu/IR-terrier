	<brief_title>R-21 Colorectal Cancer Screening (CRCS) Pilot Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Baseline Visit: If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete a questionnaire that asks demographic questions (such as your age and sex) and questions about colorectal cancer. It should take about 10-15 minutes to complete. You will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. If you are in Group 1, you will view a colorectal cancer program. If you are in Group 2, you watch a program on Essential Hypertension. You will watch the program on a laptop in the clinic. The program is about 30 minutes long. After you watch the program, you will complete a questionnaire that asks what you thought about the program and some questions about understanding medical information. It should take about 5-10 minutes to complete the questionnaire. You will be called 1-3 weeks after your baseline visit to complete a questionnaire by phone. The call should last about 20-25 minutes. You will be asked if you discussed colorectal cancer screening tests with your doctor, your preferences for colorectal cancer screening tests, and if any colorectal cancer screening tests were ordered. At Month 3, your medical record will be reviewed by the study staff. Length of Study: You will be off study after your medical record is reviewed at Month 3. This is an investigational study. Up to 180 participants (90 Hispanic and 90 African-American) will take part in this study. All participants will be enrolled from the Harris County Hospital District and Kelsey-Seybold outpatient clinics.</detailed_description>
