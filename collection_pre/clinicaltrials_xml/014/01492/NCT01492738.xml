	<brief_summary>This study endeavors to examine the relationship between acupuncture, anxiety, and performance on a test of working memory. In the study, all participants will complete the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) survey to determine how anxious they are at the moment and how anxious they tend to be in general. Then ½ of subjects will receive acupuncture for 20 minutes and ½ will rest quietly for 20 minutes. After this period, all subjects will again complete the STAI survey. Then all subjects will complete the Automated Operations Span Task (AOSPAN) which is a computerized test of working memory. Statistical analysis will be performed to determine if acupuncture had any effect on State-level anxiety and on performance on the AOSPAN.</brief_summary>
