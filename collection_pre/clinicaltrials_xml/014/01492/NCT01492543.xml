	<brief_title>Study of TS-1 as 2nd Line Treatment in Patients With Advanced Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tegafur Gimeracil Oteracil Potassium Capsule is a novel oral derivative of the 5-fluorouracil(5-FU) prodrug tegafur combined with two modulators. Recent clinical trial has reported the promising effect of Tegafur Gimeracil Oteracil Potassium Capsule in metastatic breast cancer. The innovative drug, S-1, has obtained the approval of treatment of advanced breast cancer in Japan, meanwhile, Generic drug is only approved for the indication of gastric cancer in China mainland by Chinese authority, SFDA, and no Chinese clinical study data of TS-1 in breast cancer so far.</detailed_description>
