	<brief_summary>This trial will comprehensively evaluate the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in cancer survivors between 9 and 26 years of age by (1) determining the prevalence of HPV vaccine initiation among young cancer survivors, and (2) determining the immune response to and safety/tolerability of the quadrivalent and nonavalent HPV vaccine in young cancer survivors.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Using a cross-sectional survey approach, estimate the prevalence of HPV vaccine non-initiation: a) Examine sociodemographic, behavioral, and medical determinants of HPV vaccine non-initiation. II. Using a single-arm, phase II, open-label, prospective longitudinal trial design, to evaluate the 3-dose HPV quadrivalent (HPV4) and nonavalent (HPV9) vaccine series and measure the following endpoints: a) Determine immunogenicity following the third and final vaccine dose; b) Identify clinical/host factors influencing immunogenicity; c) Determine the safety/tolerability of the HPV vaccine in cancer survivors. III. Evaluate the persistence of antibody response at 2 years post vaccine initiation and identify clinical/host factors influencing response persistence. OUTLINE: AIM 1 (SURVEY): Patients (ages 18-26 years) or their parents (for patients ages 9-17 years) complete a survey regarding the patient's HPV vaccination status, knowledge of HPV-related disease, and factors important in making decisions regarding vaccination. AIM 2 (VACCINE EVALUATION): Patients not previously immunized against HPV receive quadrivalent human papillomavirus recombinant vaccine (HPV-6, -11, -16, -18, for patients enrolled on or before 3/1/16) or the nonavalent human papillomavirus recombinant vaccine (HPV-6, -11, -16, -18, -31, -33, -45, -52, -58, for patients enrolled after 3/1/16) intramuscularly on day 1, at 8-12 weeks, and at 24-32 weeks.</detailed_description>
