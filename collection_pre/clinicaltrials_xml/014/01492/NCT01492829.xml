	<brief_title>A Community-health Worker Delivered HIV/STI Prevention Intervention for Internally Displaced Women in Leogane, Haiti</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will develop and field test a multi-component intervention that includes (1) solar-powered tablets with brief video-based educational messages and (2) 6 weekly peer-group sessions. The tablet will be programmed to analyze the data and to indicate incorrect HIV knowledge responses so the community health worker can immediately provide correct responses. This intervention involves 6 weekly women's health meetings that will cover a variety of issues pertinent to women's sexual health: HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, interpersonal relationships, communication and decision making, mental health and coping, creating social change.</detailed_description>
