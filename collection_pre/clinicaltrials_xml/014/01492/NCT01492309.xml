	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) will alleviate symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) in pregnant women. TMS uses electromagnetic impulses to encourage neurons in the brain to communicate more effectively with one another. Effective neuron communication is thought to lead to the lessening of depressive symptoms. In this study subjects require daily TMS treatment for approximately four weeks.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We hypothesize that there will be a decline in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HDRS-17) scores from the beginning to end of treatment. We expect that this decrease will be significantly greater in subjects receiving active transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) compared to those receiving placebo TMS. Treatment response will be defined as greater than 50% reduction in HDRS-17 score. We also hypothesize that levels of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a protein thought to regulate mood and cognitive functioning, will increase in subjects who respond to TMS treatment. We expect BDNF levels to increase by greater than or equal to 20% in those who respond to TMS. As previously stated, TMS response will be defined as a significant decrease (50% or greater) in the HDRS-17 from baseline to end of treatment.</detailed_description>
