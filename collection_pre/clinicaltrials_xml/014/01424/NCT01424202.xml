	<brief_summary>Weaning protocols that include the use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV), decreases the incidence of re-intubation and ICU length of stay. However, the role of NIV in post-extubation failure is still not clear. Impaired airway clearance is associated with NIV failure. Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation (MI-E) is an assisted coughing technique that has been proven to be very effective in patients under NIV. In this study the investigators assess the efficacy of MI-E as part of a protocol for patients that develop respiratory failure after extubation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation in Preventing Respiratory Failure After Extubation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients under mechanical ventilation (MV) for more than 48 hours with specific inclusion criteria, who successfully tolerated an spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) were randomly allocated before extubation, either for (A) conventional extubation protocol (control group) or (B) MI-E extubation protocol (study group). Re-intubation rates, ICU length of stay and NIV failure rates were analyzed. Inclusion of MI-E in post-extubation failure may reduce re-intubation rates with consequent reduction in post-extubation ICU length of stay. This technique seems to be efficient in improving the efficacy of NIV in this patient population.</detailed_description>
