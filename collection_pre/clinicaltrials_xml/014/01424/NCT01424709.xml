	<brief_summary>Gemcitabine, docetaxel, CPT-11 and cisplatin are effective in 1st line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Platinum-based doublets including gemcitabine, docetaxel or CPT-11 are standard 1st regimens. BRCA1 and RRM1 expression levels are reported to be associated with sensitivity of the tumor cells to cytotoxic agents. Some Phase II or III trials did prove feasibility of customized chemotherapy based upon expression levels of one or two biomarkers in the NSCLC patients. The investigators think customized chemotherapy may further improve efficacy of chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC. But there is no randomised trial to compare efficacy of standard chemotherapy with individualized chemotherapy in this setting. So, the investigators plan to initiate this phase II trial to compare efficacy between standard chemotherapy of gemcitabine/cisplatin versus customized chemotherapy in chemonaive NSCLC patients.</brief_summary>
