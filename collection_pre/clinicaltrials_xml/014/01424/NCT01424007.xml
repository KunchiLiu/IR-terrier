	<brief_summary>The purpose of the MENU Study is to examine whether there is a differential weight loss response to different dietary macronutrient composition (higher carbohydrate and lower fat versus lower carbohydrate and higher monounsaturated fat [MUFA] or lower carbohydrate and walnut-rich higher fat diets) in a weight loss intervention in healthy obese women, depending on insulin resistance status. Blood samples will be collected to enable analysis of potential mechanisms and differential response across subgroups.</brief_summary>
