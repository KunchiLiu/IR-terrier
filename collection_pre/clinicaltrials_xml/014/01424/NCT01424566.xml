	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of Sativex, compared with placebo, an adjunctive medication in relieving persistent chronic pain (not breakthrough pain) in patients with advanced cancer, who have this pain even when they are on optimized/maximized chronic opioid therapy. This multi-center study will be conducted in two parts. All participants enrolled into the trial will receive Sativex during one of two parts of the study, but they will not know which part. Eligible patients will not be required to stop any of their current treatments or medications.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria (abbreviated): The patient has advanced cancer for which there is no known curative therapy The patient has a clinical diagnosis of cancer related pain, which is not alleviated with their current optimized opioid treatment The patient is receiving an optimized maintenance dose of Step III opioid therapy, preferably with a sustained release preparation, but also allowing a regular maintenance dose of around the clock use of immediate release preparations The patient is receiving a daily maintenance dose Step III opioid therapy of less than or equal to a total daily opioid dose of 500 mg/day of morphine equivalence (including maintenance and breakthrough opioids) The patient is using no more than one type of breakthrough opioid analgesia Exclusion Criteria (abbreviated): Have any planned clinical interventions that would affect their pain (e.g., chemotherapy or radiation therapy where, in the clinical judgment of the investigator, these would be expected to affect pain) The patient is currently using or has used cannabis or cannabinoid based medications within 30 days of study entry and is unwilling to abstain for the duration of the study Has experienced myocardial infarction or clinically significant cardiac dysfunction within the last 12 months or has a cardiac disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator would put the patient at risk of a clinically significant arrhythmia or myocardial infarction Has significantly impaired renal function Has significantly impaired hepatic function Female patients of childbearing potential and male patients whose partner is of childbearing potential, unless willing to ensure that they or their partner use effective contraception, for example, oral contraception, double barrier, intrauterine device, during the study and for three months thereafter (however, a male condom should not be used in conjunction with a female condom as this may not prove effective)</criteria>
