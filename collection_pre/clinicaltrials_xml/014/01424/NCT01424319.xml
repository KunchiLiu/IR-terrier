	<brief_summary>Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, 12-week, multicenter study. The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once daily administration of atrasentan tablets compared to placebo in reducing residual albuminuria in Japanese Type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy who are treated with the maximum tolerated labeled dose for hypertension of a RAS (renin angiotensin system) inhibitor.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient has Type 2 diabetes and has been treated with at least one antihyperglycemic medication within the 12 months prior to the screening period. Patient is receiving a maximum tolerated labeled dose of an ACEi (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitor) or ARB (Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker)(Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) inhibitor). Estimated GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) is greater than or equal to 30 and less than or equal to 75 mL/min/1.73m2 by the CKD (chronic kidney disease) Epidemiology Collaboration (EPI) formula. UACR (Urinary Albumin to Creatinine Ratio) is greater than or equal to 200 mg/g as determined by the geometric mean of the three morning void urine specimens obtained at Runin period. Serum albumin is greater than or equal to 3.0 g/dL. BNP (Btype Natriuretic Peptide) is less than or equal to 200 pg/mL. SBP (Systolic Blood Pressure) is greater than or equal to 110 mmHg and less than or equal to 160 mmHg. HbA1c (Glucosylated Hemoglobin A1c) is less than or equal to 12% and serum potassium is less than or equal to 5.5 mEq/L. Patient has a history of moderate or severe edema, facial edema unrelated to trauma, or a history of myxedema in the prior 6 months to screening. Patient is receiving loop diuretics greater than or equal to 120 mg QD (Once Daily) of furosemide or greater than or equal to 3.0 mg QD (Once Daily) of bumetanide or greater than or equal to 150 mg QD (Once Daily) of ethacrynic acid or greater than or equal to 60 mg QD (Once Daily) of torasemide. Patient has a documented history of Stage C or Stage D heart failure, defined ACC/AHA (American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association Practice Guidelines). Patient is receiving any of a combination of an ACEi (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitor) and ARB (Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker) or rosiglitazone or aliskiren or an aldosterone antagonist and patient is receiving pioglitazone and edema is present.</criteria>
