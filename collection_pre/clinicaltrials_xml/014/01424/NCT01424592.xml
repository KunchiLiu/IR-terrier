	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: Portable sleep testing of hospitalized medical inpatients suspected of having OSA is accurate in determining the need for positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy when compared to outpatient laboratory-based polysomnography. - Hospitalized medical inpatients referred for suspected OSA will be tested with a portable sleep apnea testing device during hospitalization. - These patients will then undergo an outpatient laboratory-based attended polysomnography after hospital discharge. - Results of the inpatient portable sleep apnea test will be compared to the outpatient laboratory-based polysomnography in terms of diagnostic accuracy.</brief_summary>
