	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Trial of Delamanid for 6 Months in Patients With Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of delamanid administered orally as 100 mg twice daily (BID) for 2 months followed by 200 mg once daily (QD) for 4 months in combination with an optimized background regimen (OBR) versus placebo with OBR during the 6-month intensive phase of MDR TB treatment. This trial is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, stratified, placebo-controlled trial conducted globally in 2 parallel groups at approximately 18 sites in 7 countries qualified to treat MDR TB. In addition, a subtrial comprised of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients who will be on antiretrovirals (ARVs) during the trial and will be randomized to OBR plus placebo or OBR plus delamanid will be conducted sites in South Africa that have been prequalified as having an integrated approach to TB and HIV treatment and management and a sufficient population of MDR TB patients co-infected with HIV for enrollment.</detailed_description>
