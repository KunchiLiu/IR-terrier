	<brief_summary>A growing body of evidence suggests that individuals with chronic lung disease have important deficits in balance control that may be associated with an increased risk of falls. The main purpose of this study is to examine the effects of a balance training program on measures of balance and fall risk in people with chronic lung disease.</brief_summary>
