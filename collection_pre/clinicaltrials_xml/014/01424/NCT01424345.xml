	<brief_title>The Role of ImmuKnowÂ® in the Management of Immunosuppressants in the Renal Transplant Patient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: The management of renal transplant recipients is challenging in keeping a delicate balance of immunosuppression to avoid either infection (overimmunosuppression), or rejection (under-immunosuppression). Conventional clinical parameters are not adequate enough. ImmuKnow (Cylex Inc, Columbia, MD) is an FDA-cleared assay for the detection of cell mediated immune response in populations undergoing immunosuppressive therapy for organ transplant. There have been limited retrospective studies discussing the effectiveness of the ImmuKnow assay. There is no prospective head-to-head trial showing the benefits of periodic ImmuKnow testing. Objective: To demonstrate whether there are any outcome benefits of a serial ImmuKnow assays in de novo renal transplant recipients Patients and Methods: A prospective, randomized, pilot, controlled 12-month study to compare the outcomes of 2 cohorts of de novo renal transplant patients will be conducted. The outcomes that will be investigated include a combined infection rate (primary end-point), separate infection rates and episodes, acute rejection rate and episodes, quality of life, graft and patient survivals (all secondary end-points). Biopsy of the transplanted kidney is used to confirm rejection whenever possible. Among the study cohort, the patients' immunosuppressants will be adjusted according to the results of a serial ImmuKnow assay besides using conventional clinical parameters; whereas among the control cohort the patients' immunosuppressants will be adjusted according to conventional clinical parameters. Expected Results: At the end of this study we will be able to learn whether the study cohort patients have less infection, less acute rejection, better allograft function, better quality of life, and better graft or patient survivals.</detailed_description>
