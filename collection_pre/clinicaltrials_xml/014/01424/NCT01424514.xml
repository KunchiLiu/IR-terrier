	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects (Total Symptom Score (TSS) and its individual components: rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion, post-nasal drip) of intranasal, repeat dose SB-705498 in non-allergic rhinitis (NAR) patients elicited by a cold dry air challenge in an environmental exposure chamber (EEC). SB-705498 is a selective antagonist of the transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) ligand gated ion channel. TRPV1 is a cation permeable ion channel that can be activated by several physiological factors, such as heat, protons (pH), osmotic stress, eicosanoid derivatives, anandamide, and by products of inflammation, such as histamine, prostaglandins and bradykinin. In the nose, the local TRPV1 expressing sensory C-fibres are thought to play a key role in the development of nasal hyper-responsiveness to environmental provocateurs. It has been proposed that blocking the nasal sensory nerve stimulation may control nasal hyper-responsiveness and therefore prevent the induction of rhinitis symptoms. In this context, preclinical evidence supports that targeting TRPV1 by SB-705498 may be an attractive option. In this study NAR patients will be randomised, in a double blind, placebo controlled cross over design to receive 14 day repeat doses of 12mg intra-nasal SB-705498 once daily. Whilst dosing at home, subjects will record symptom scores to document their symptoms. In addition, during visits to the clinical unit, acoustic rhinometry, quality of life questionnaires and safety assessments will be monitored.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Deviations from inclusion criteria are not allowed because they can potentially jeopardize the scientific integrity of the study, regulatory acceptability or subject safety. Therefore, adherence to the criteria as specified in the protocol is essential. A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following criteria apply: 1. Diagnosis of NAR, as determined by the presence of perennial rhinitis symptoms that last for several months per year, for more than 1 year and are not attributed to allergy, infections or nasal abnormalities. Positive history of rhinitis symptoms triggered by environmental provocateurs (e.g. weather changes, irritants, air pollution etc), but not allergens. 2. Normal levels of total plasma IgE and negative allergy skin or Rast tests to common aeroallergens. 3. Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive. 4. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a \documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;147 pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 24 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method. Childbearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1 for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until 84 days postlast treatment administration. 5. Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until 84 days postlast treatment administration. 6. Body weight ≥ 50 kg (males) and ≥45kg (females) and BMI within the range 19 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive). 7. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. 8. Available to complete all the required study measurements. 9. Single QTc, &lt; 450 msec; or QTc &lt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block. 10. The subject must demonstrate at screening TSS ≥ 4 (on a 9 point scale) at screening visits 1 and 2. 11. AST and ALT &lt; 2xULN; alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%). Deviations from exclusion criteria are not allowed because they can potentially jeopardise the scientific integrity of the study, regulatory acceptability or subject safety. Therefore, adherence to the criteria as specified in the protocol is essential. A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria apply: 1. Nasal abnormalities likely to affect the outcome of the study, i.e. nasal septal perforation, nasal polyps, other nasal malformations. 2. History of frequent nosebleeds. 3. A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 months of screening 4. Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones). 5. Positive prestudy drug/alcohol/smoking screen. A minimum list of drugs that will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates, cannabinoids, benzodiazepines and methadone 6. A positive test for HIV antibody. 7. History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: • An average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks for males or &gt;7 drinks for females. One drink is equivalent to 12 g of alcohol: 12 ounces (360 ml) of beer, 5 ounces (150 ml) of wine or 1.5 ounces (45 ml) of 80 proof distilled spirits. 8. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer). 9. Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day. 10. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety. Subjects who are using some of the medications below on an as needed basis, may participate in the study if they remain free of medication for the following periods of time prior to each visit: Nasal antihistamines: 48 hours Oral antihistamines A (cetirizine, fexofenadine, loratadine, desloratadine): 7 days Oral antihistamines B (all others): 7 days Nasal decongestants: 24 hours Oral decongestants: 24 hours Nasal glucocorticosteroids: 4 weeks Inhaled glucocorticoids: 4 weeks Oral glucocorticosteroids: 12 weeks Oral leukotriene receptor antagonists: 7 days Oral 5lipoxygenase inhibitors: 7 days Oral methylxanthines: 7 days Subjects with recent upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) will be allowed in the study only if their nasal symptoms have been completely resolved for more than 3 weeks prior to screening. 11. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. 12. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period. 13. Pregnant females as determined by positive serum or urine hCG test at screening or prior to dosing. 14. Lactating females. 15. Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol. 16. Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated.</criteria>
