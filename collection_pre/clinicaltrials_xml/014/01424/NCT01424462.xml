	<brief_summary>This study will investigate how 3 new types of drug formulations are absorbed by the body. This study is termed 'open-label', which means volunteers will be aware of which treatment they are receiving. The study involves all volunteers receiving all 3 different formulations, as a single dose, and there is no placebo (dummy-drug; no active ingredient) in this study. Volunteers will also receive a single dose of a formulation used in previous trials (reference formulation), so as a proper comparison with the new formulations can be made. One of the new formulations will also be administered along with food, to assess if the drug performs or is absorbed differently.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Healthy Volunteer Pilot Study Using 3 Types of Modified Release Formulations of Firategrast to Investigate How Quickly Absorption From the Digestive System Takes Place.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study will investigate the tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single oral doses of firategrast administered as the existing immediate release tablet formulation and as three modified release tablet formulations designed to release drug over differing relase rates. The range of release rates is expected to give preliminary information on the performance of a matrix modified release formulation for use in future efficacy studies. Subjects will receive each formulation in the fasted state in a randomised 4-part single dose crossover fashion. Based on the review of pharmacokinetic data from at least the first two study sessions, subjects may also receive a fifth dose of firategrast, administered after a high fat meal. The formulation administered with food will be chosen based upon pharmacokinetic data from previous dose sessions. Doses administered will be different with respect to gender; the doses are expected to result in similar exposures across the genders.</detailed_description>
