	<brief_summary>The first objective of this protocol is to assess the tolerability and safety of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in patients with connective tissue disease related interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial for CTD-ILD Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will assess tolerability and safety at scheduled intervals via standard of care physical exam findings, monitoring complete blood count, serum chemistry, and pulmonary function tests, along with patient reports of medication intolerance and change in symptoms of dyspnea.</detailed_description>
