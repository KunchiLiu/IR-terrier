	<brief_summary>Lowering LDL cholesterol by statins has been proven to be associated with reduction of proinflammatory regulators e.g. activation of the transcription factor NF-ĸB. Up to now the effects of newer cholesterol lowering agents such as ezetemibe with respect to their anti-inflammatory potential are less intensively studied. Therefore the investigators analyzed whether equipotent LDL-lowering therapy with simvastatin alone and in combination with ezetimibe have comparable effects on NF-ĸB-activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
