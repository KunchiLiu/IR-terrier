	<brief_title>Respiratory Outcome at Adolescence of Very Low Birthweight Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>EPIPAGEADO is a multicenter observational study:- to evaluate respiratory symptoms and lung function at adolescence in very low birthweight (VLBW) children, to identify perinatal risk factors for persistent symptoms or impaired lung function tests at adolescence, to assess the exercise tolerance in VLBW children and to search for genetic susceptibility markers associated to impaired lung function. The main criteria for analysis will be the forced expiratory volume in one seconde (FEV1) The study duration will be 36 months the number of centers will be 4 centers in France (Paris-Necker, Nantes, Lille, Rouen) The number of patients to be included will be 400, including 260 VLBW children without BPD, 40 VLBW children with BPD, 100 control children with birth at term.</detailed_description>
