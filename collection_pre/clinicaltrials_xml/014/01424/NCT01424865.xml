	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research trial studies biomarkers as a predictor of response to trastuzumab in samples from patients with breast cancer previously treated in the NSABP-B-31 trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cancer Stem Cell Biomarkers as a Predictor of Response to Trastuzumab in Samples From Patients With Breast Cancer Previously Treated in the NSABP-B-31 Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine if stem cellness identifies a poor prognostic subgroup of women with early-stage breast cancer who have been uniformly treated with either adjuvant doxorubicin hydrochloride &amp; cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel (the "control arm" of B31), or the same chemotherapy plus trastuzumab. Secondary - To conduct exploratory analyses to assess, to the extent possible, if co-localization of stem cellness, as determined by ALDH1 positivity, and HER2 identifies a group of patients previously considered to have HER2-negative cancers (using classical definitions) who benefit from adjuvant trastuzumab. OUTLINE: Archived breast cancer stem cells samples and terminally differentiated cells from tissue samples are analyzed for HER2 and ALDH1 expression by dual-staining quantitative immunofluorescence using Automated Quantitative Analysis (AQUA) , IHC, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).</detailed_description>
