	<brief_summary>This study will assess the safety and immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals' investigational tuberculosis (TB) vaccine (GSK 692342) compared to placebo when administered at 0, 1 months to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative adults who have received treatment for TB disease (denoted TB-treated cohort) or are currently receiving treatment for TB disease (denoted TB-treatment cohort). For comparative purposes, subjects who have never had TB disease (denoted TB-naïve cohort) will also be enrolled.</brief_summary>

Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject: has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series. Seronegative for HIV 1 and 2 antibodies. No history of or current extrapulmonary tuberculosis TB. Additionally, based on medical history, Subjects in the TBnaive cohort must have no active pulmonary disease as indicated by chest Xray. have no signs and symptoms of TB. have no history of chemoprophylaxis or treatment for TB. Subjects in the TBtreated cohort must have a history of successful treatment for pulmonary TB (completed at least 1 year prior to vaccination). have no active pulmonary disease on chest Xray. Subjects in the TBtreatment cohort must have documented treatment for pulmonary TB (smear or culture confirmed) ongoing for 24 months prior to vaccination. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Administration of a registered live vaccine not foreseen by the study within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine and administration of a registered inactivated vaccine within 14 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose. Any chronic drug therapy to be continued during the study period, which in the opinion of the investigator could adversely interfere with the vaccine. History of previous administration of experimental TB vaccines. History of previous exposure to components of the investigational vaccine within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine. Administration of any immunoglobulins, any immunotherapy and/or any blood products within the 3 months preceding the first dose of study vaccination, or planned administrations during the study period. Planned participation or participation in another experimental protocol during the study period. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition based on medical history and physical examination. History of chronic alcohol and/or drug abuse. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. Major congenital defects. Pregnant female, lactating female or female planning to become pregnant or discontinue contraceptive precautions during the active phase of the study (from study start till 2 months after dose 2). Additionally, for the TB naïve and TB treated cohorts: Acute or chronic clinically relevant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal function abnormality as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests Additionally, for the TB treatment cohort: Acute or chronic clinically relevant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal function abnormality as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests. Individuals with grade 3 levels will be excluded. Failure to convert while on antiTB treatment at the end of the second month of antiTB therapy.</criteria>
