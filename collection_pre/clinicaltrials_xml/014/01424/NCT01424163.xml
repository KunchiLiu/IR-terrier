	<brief_title>Dexpramipexole Japanese PK Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is designed to evaluate the influence of ethnic factors on dexpramipexole safety, tolerability, and PK. Subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit on Day -1 (the day prior to first dosing) and will remain in the clinical unit under observation until discharge. All subjects will have a final follow up visit. Whilst resident in the clinic, subjects will receive 4 treatments: The first 3 treatments comprise Part A of the study and the final treatment group comprises Part B. Part A: Treatment 1: Dose 1 (reduced) of dexpramipexole; a single dose Treatment 2: Dose 2 (standard) dexpramipexole; a single dose Treatment 3: Dose 3 (standard) dexpramipexole; 5 doses administered at 12 hour intervals Part B: Dose 4 (standard) dexpramipexole; 5 doses administered at 12 hour intervals There will be a minimum washout of 3 days between treatments. For all subjects, prior to proceeding to the next treatment group, safety and tolerability data will be reviewed. Caucasian subjects will be matched individually (on a 1:1 basis) to Japanese subjects with respect to gender and age and if possible BMI.</detailed_description>
