	<brief_title>The Natural History of Congenital Trigger Thumbs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trigger thumb is a stenosis tenosynovitis of the flexor pollicis longus tendon of the thumb1. The eitiology of congenital trigger thumb is unclear with many authors proposing both hereditary and acquired causes2-4. Surgical release of congenital trigger thumbs has been recommended as definitive treatment, though controversy exists over the natural history of congenital trigger thumbs5-8. There have been a number of studies looking at the natural history of congenital trigger thumbs with spontaneous resolution rates ranging from 0-96% over a median duration of follow up that ranged from 6 months to 48 months9-14. Based on our clinical experience, the investigators do not feel that congenital trigger thumbs resolve spontaneously and that definitive treatment requires surgical release. However, the investigators need to do further scientific research into the natural history of trigger thumbs to determine how often trigger thumb resolves without needing surgical intervention.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of congenital trigger thumb based on physical exam and history, no previous treatment history (either operative or nonoperative), no pain associated with the deformity, no functional disability due to the trigger thumb. Previous operative treatment for the congenital trigger thumb, deformity of the thumb that causes pain, triggering that causes secondary deformity of the thumb, and deformity that prevents normal use of the thumb and hand.</criteria>
