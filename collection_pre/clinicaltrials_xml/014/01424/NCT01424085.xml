	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of antibiotics (i.e. Kefzol) before percutaneous gastrostomy performed in interventional radiology. Patient will be randomized to receive antibiotics or placebo before the procedure, and the rates of skin infection after the procedure will be determined between the two groups. This has never been studied in our population of patients undergoing the procedure. However, antibiotics are routinely given despite the lack of evidence. The investigators hypothesize that patient receiving prophylactic antibiotics will have a decreased number of infections compared to placebo.</brief_summary>
