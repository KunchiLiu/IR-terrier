	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate using intraosseous vascular access and intravenous vascular access to give patients the necessary medications to perform rapid sequence intubation, for patients with airway difficulties. The investigators think the device operator will find the intraosseous and intravenous routes equal for drug delivery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Observational Study of Rapid Sequence Intubation (RSI) Drug Delivery Using Intraosseous (IO) and Intravenous (IV) Access.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This observational study will evaluate the intubating conditions of patients receiving rapid sequence intubation when receiving paralytic drug delivery via intravenous or intraosseous vascular access from the perspective of the medical professional performing rapid sequence intubation. The investigators believe that medical professionals will find equal intubating conditions for intravenous and intraosseous drug delivery.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Requires rapid sequence intubation Succinylcholine is chosen paralytic agent IV or IO access has been established for rapid sequence intubation For IV access patients, their rapid sequence intubation case is the next occurring IV rapid sequence intubation case following an enrolled IO RSI case. Vascular access other than IV or IO has been established</criteria>
