Following a 14 day run-in period, approximately 504 subjects will be randomly assigned to double-blind treatment for 52 weeks. After the 52 weeks treatment period, subjects in both treatment arms will follow-up 52 weeks. The primary measure of efficacy is the frequency of exacerbations and spirometric values (e.g. FEV1). Secondary efficacy measures include Dyspnea (MMRC), Quality of life ( CAT,SF-36), Exercise Capacity( 6MWD). Safety will be assessed through the collection of adverse events. There will be a total of 5 study visits ( randomization, and after 13, 26, 39 and 52 weeks of treatment). A follow-up contact for collection of effect and adverse event will be conducted approximately 52 weeks following the last study visit.</detailed_description>
