	<brief_summary>Grass pollen and house dust mites (HDM) are the most common allergens causing allergic rhino-conjunctivitis (RC) and/or asthma (A). Subcutaneous allergen specific immunotherapy (SCIT) reduces symptoms and use of medication. The purpose of SABAL is to assess the effect of SCIT on disease severity classifications in terms of number of days affected- and sick days on patients with grass pollen and/or HDM induced disease. These outcome measures will be gathered in one single measure: Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY)</brief_summary>
