	<brief_title>Identifying and Overcoming Barriers to Diabetes Management in the Elderly: A Cost-effective Intervention Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a study to evaluate whether short term focused intervention by a geriatric diabetes team to help overcome barriers to diabetes care in older adults will result in improved clinical, functional, and quality of life measures compared to usual care in a cost effective manner. In addition, we will assess whether the support network formed during intervention by the geriatric diabetes team will empower patients, resulting in long lasting improvement in parameters after intervention is completed.</detailed_description>
