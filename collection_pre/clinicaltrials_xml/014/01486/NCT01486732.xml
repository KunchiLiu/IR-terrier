	<brief_title>FLT-PET Activity Change After Allogeneic Umbilical Cord Blood (UCB) Therapy in Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>FLT(3'-Deoxy-3'-[F-18]Fluorothymidine) has been developed as a cell-proliferation tracer. In animal study, FLT-PET was used as a tool that enables imaging and measuring of proliferation in the brain, thus it detects activity of endogenous neural stem cells noninvasively. This study aims to assess cell proliferation activity changes in the brain after Umbilical Cord Blood (UCB)Therapy for Cerebral Palsy patients using FLT-PET.</detailed_description>
