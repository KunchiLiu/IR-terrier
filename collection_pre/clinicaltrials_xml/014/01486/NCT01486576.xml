	<brief_title>Hydroxyethyl Starch and Renal Function After Hip Replacement Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) is widely used in hospitals to maintain circulation in critically ill patients. In recent years studies have raised suspicion that HES is nephrotoxic. So far acute kidney injury has been diagnosed based on creatinine measurements, but new technology allows for earlier diagnosis using measurements of biomarkers in urine. The purpose of this project is to investigate HES's potential toxicity and effects on the circulation and kidneys using measurements of biomarkers specific for toxicity and for the sodium/water balance in the urine and by measurements of vasoactive hormones in the blood after administration of HES 130/0.4</detailed_description>
