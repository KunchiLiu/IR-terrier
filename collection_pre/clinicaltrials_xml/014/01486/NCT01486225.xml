	<brief_title>Tolerance Study of the Silicone Bands on Medical Compression Stockings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To identify the nature of lesions the investigator will analyse results of the biopsys, microbiological analyses, dermatological tests.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subjects who notified a health care professional (doctor or pharmacist) of an incident with a griptop bands compression stocking, regardless of brand and model. Subjects presenting skin lesions caused by the contact with siliconecontaining griptop bands of medical compression stockings (all brands combined).

Phototherapy or sun exposure in the 30 days preceding the skin tests (on the back). Patient having concomitantly used compression stockings and a topical corticosteroid on the thighs in the 48 hours preceding lesion onset. List of diseases which will prevent a subject from participating in the study: acquired, infectious or druginduced congenital immunosuppression (systemic corticosteroid therapy, immunosuppressives, chemotherapy), Congenital bullous disorder (congenital epidermolysis bullosa) or acquired bullous disorder (pemphigus, pemphigoid, dermatitis herpetiformis, linear IgA dermatosis, etc.).

If the patient accepts the biopsy proposed in the study: Patient for whom a skin biopsy is contraindicated or requiring antibiotic prophylaxis, Anticoagulant taken during the 24 hours before inclusion. Subject with history of allergy to natural or synthetic latex, chlorhexidine, known healing disorder and/or viral diseases transmissible through the blood documented by the preliminary clinical exam.</criteria>
