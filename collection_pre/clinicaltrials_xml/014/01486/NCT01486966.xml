	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Asia. The aim of this trial is to compare efficacy and safety of insulin detemir plus insulin aspart and NPH insulin plus human soluble insulin both in a basal bolus regimen with or without metformin in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes. The trial adopts a group sequential design, where the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed at the interim analysis, in addition to the final formal analysis. The decision to continue or stop the trial will be based on the result of the interim analysis.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (diagnosed clinically) for at 12 months or longer Currently treated with basal insulin once daily or premixed insulin twice daily for at least 3 months with or without OAD(s), and total daily insulin dose less than 1.4 IU (U)/kg (If treated with metformin, unchanged total daily dose of at least 1000 mg for at least 3 months) Body Mass Index (BMI) equal to 40 kg/m^2 or below HbA1c (glycosylated haemoglobin A1c) between 7.0% and 10.0% by central laboratory analysis Plan to be admitted for optimising glycaemic control at least 2 days prior to the randomisation Treatment with thiazolidinediones (TZD) or GlucagonLike Peptide1 (GLP1) receptor agonists within the last 3 months prior to the screening Anticipated change after the randomisation in concomitant medication known to interfere with glucose metabolism, such as systemic corticosteroids, betablockers and mono amine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors Previous participation in this trial (participation is defined as randomised. Rescreening of screening failures is allowed only once within the limits of the recruitment period.)</criteria>
