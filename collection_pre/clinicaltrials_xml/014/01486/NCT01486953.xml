	<brief_title>Pulmonary Mechanics During Minimally Invasive Repair of Pectus Excavatum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The minimally invasive technique for pectus excavatum repair was introduced by Nuss and colleagues using a metal bar to lift the depressed chest wall. This surgical procedure is usually done under general anesthesia with tracheal intubation. After inserting metal bar into the chest wall, decreased lung compliance was shown. Previous studies demonstrated that administering desflurane during anesthesia resulted in marked increases in respiratory mechanical parameters, especially in the children with airway susceptibility. Our primary hypothesis was that desflurane would cause an increase in respiratory resistance and a decrease in lung compliance compared to sevoflurane during repair of pectus excavatum.</detailed_description>
