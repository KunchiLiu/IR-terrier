	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics and Pharacodynamics of GW642444 in Paedetric Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will investigate the effect of dosing with 25 μg GW642444, an orally inhaled long-acting agonist of the β2-adrenoceptor, in asthmatic subjects aged 5 to 11. GW642444 is currently under development as the long-acting beta-agonist component of a combination product containing an inhaled corticosteroid and a longacting beta-agonist. Subjects will receive a single dose via a novel dry powder inhaler, then 7 days once-daily repeat dosing following a washout period. The study will be a randomized two-way crossover, with a placebo control. Approximately 26 subjects will be recruited to this study, with the aim that 20 will complete the study. Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and glucose and potassium levels will be investigated.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male and premenarchial female subjects aged 511 years on the last planned treatment day are eligible for this study. Premenarchial females are defined as any female who has yet to begin menses and is considered Tanner Stage 2 or less. Diagnosis of asthma at least 6 months prior to screening. Patients must be controlled on their existing asthma treatment at Screening as defined by a Childhood Asthma Control Test score of &gt;19 and PEF (Peak Expiratory Flow) &gt;75 % predicted. Subjects must be taking a stable regimen of fluticasone propionate (≤200 μg (micrograms) twice daily or equivalent) and short acting betaagonist inhaler on an asneed basis for at least 4 weeks prior to screening. Apart from asthma, eczema and rhinitis, subjects should be healthy and suffer from no other significant medical conditions. Subjects must weigh at least 15 kg (kilograms). Subjects must demonstrate ability to accept and effectively use the GW642444 device using the demonstration kits provided to the site. The subject and parent or guardian are able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions, and protocolstated restrictions. The parent or guardian must have the ability to read, write and record diary information collected throughout the study. The parent or guardian must also have the ability to manage study drug administration and PEF assessments. At least one parent or guardian has signed and dated the written informed consent prior to admission to the study. This will be accompanied by informed assent from the subject. Subjects currently receiving (or have received within 4 weeks of screening) any of the following asthma therapies: theophyllines, longacting inhaled betaagonists, oral betaagonist. Subjects who have changed their asthma medication within 4 weeks of screening. Clinical visual evidence of oral candidiasis at screening. Any clinically relevant abnormality identified on the screening medical assessment Any medical condition or circumstance making the subject unsuitable for participation in the study (e.g. history of lifethreatening asthma) Asthma exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids (oral, intramuscular, intravenous) or Emergency Room attendance within 3 months or asthma exacerbation requiring hospitalization within 6 months prior to the screening visit. Culturedocumented or suspected bacterial or viral infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract which is not resolved within 4 weeks of the screening visit. Any adverse reaction including immediate or delayed hypersensitivity to any betaagonist therapy. Known or suspected sensitivity to the constituents of the novel dry powder inhaler (i.e., lactose or magnesium stearate), for example, history of severe milk protein allergy. The parent or guardian has history of psychiatric disease, intellectual deficiency, substance abuse, or other condition (e.g., inability to read, comprehend or write) which will limit the validity of consent to participate in this study. A subject will not be eligible for this study if he/she is an immediate family member of the participating Investigator, subInvestigator, study coordinator, or employee of the participating Investigator. Children who are wards of the state or government. Evidence of clinically significant abnormality in the 12lead ECG (electrocardiogram) at Screening</criteria>
