	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying biomarkers of tissue samples from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes the occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research trial studies biomarkers in samples from patients with rhabdoid tumor of the kidney and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarker Study in Samples From Patients With Malignant Rhabdoid Tumor of the Kidney or Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine if there are molecular differences between rhabdoid tumor of the kidney (RTK) and the atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT). OUTLINE: Archived tumor tissue samples are analyzed for gene expression profile and microRNA profile.</detailed_description>
