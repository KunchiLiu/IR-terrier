	<brief_title>Study to Assess the Safety and Effects of Autologous Adipose-Derived SVF Cells in Patients With Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be an open-label, non-randomized multi-center patient sponsored study of Adipose-Derived Stromal Cells (ASC) implantation using a catheter delivery system. ASCs will be derived from the patient's adipose-derived tissue. Liposuction using local anesthesia and syringe collection will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen for subsequent processing to isolate the stem cells. The cells will be delivered via catheter into the Vertebral Artery and intravenously.</detailed_description>

Patients known to have tested positive for HIV, HTLV, HBV, HCV, CMV (IgM &gt; IgG) and/or syphilis will be evaluated by an expert as to patient eligibility based on the patient's infectious status Any illness which, in the Investigator's judgement, will interfere with the patient's ability to comply with the protocol, compromise patient safety, or interfere with the interpretation of the study results Patients on chronic immunosuppressive transplant therapy Systolic blood pressure (supine) â‰¤90 mmHg; Resting heart rate &gt; 100 bpm; Active clinical infection being treated by antibiotics within one week of enrollment. Known drug or alcohol dependence or any other factors which will interfere with the study conduct or interpretation of the results or who in the opinion of the investigator are not suitable to participate. History of cancer (other than nonmelanoma skin cancer or insitu cervical cancer) in the last two years. Unwilling and/or not able to give written informed consent.</criteria>
