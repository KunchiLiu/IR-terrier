	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to compare a standard coronary CT angiography scan protocol with conventional image reconstruction with a scan protocol using reduced tube current and a new image reconstruction algorithm. The investigators hypothesize that the image quality of the new scan protocol is not inferior, while radiation dose estimates are reduced by around 30%. Secondary endpoints of the study include quantitative image quality parameters, prevalence of non-diagnostic studies, prevalence of coronary artery plaques and plaque characteristics (calcified, non-calcified, mixed) and prevalence of follow-up examinations.</brief_summary>
