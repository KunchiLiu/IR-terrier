	<brief_summary>Activation of G protein-coupled receptor GPR119 stimulates glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)release from the intestinal L-cells. Previously, administration of 2-oleyl-glycerol (2-OG) to humans significantly increased plasma GLP-1. In the present study we want to test the effect in patients with type 2 diabetes. The hypothesis is that we will expect to find a significant increased plasma GLP-1 following a meal containing of 2-OG when compared to meals containing of olive oil or carbohydrates alone.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Activation of G protein-coupled receptor GPR119 stimulates glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)release from the intestinal L-cells. Previously, administration of 2-oleyl-glycerol (2-OG) to humans significantly increased plasma GLP-1. In the present study we want to test the effect in patients with type 2 diabetes. The hypothesis is that we will expect to find a significant increased plasma GLP-1 following a meal containing of 2-OG when compared to meals containing of olive oil or carbohydrates alone. The aim of the study is to elucidate the effect of 2-OG, 'diet oil' on GLP-1 secretion in patients with type 2 diabetes and to explain the mechanism behind the known stimulation of GLP-1 release by dietary fat.</detailed_description>
