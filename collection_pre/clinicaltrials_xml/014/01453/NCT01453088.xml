	<brief_title>Auto Transplant High Dose Melphalan vs High Dose Melphalan+Bortezomib in Pts With Multiple Myeloma Age 65 Years or Older</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study the investigators are comparing this standard regimen to the newly established regimen of melphalan and bortezomib. Conditioning Regimens: Treatment arm A Melphalan is administered at a dose of 200mg/m2 by rapid intravenous infusion via a central or peripheral vein over 30 minutes to one hour. Melphalan will be given as a single dose (not split over 2 or more days) and given on day-1. Dosing will be based on body surface area calculated using actual body weight Stem cell infusion: Stem cell infusion will occur on day 0 and will be at least 20 hours after the infusion of melphalan. The infusion of peripheral blood stem cells will be done in accordance with the Blood and Marrow Transplant program standard operating procedures. Filgrastim will be administered at a dose of 5 mcg/kg (rounded to vial size) every other day starting on day+3 then daily starting on day 9 until engraftment (at least). Treatment arm B Bortezomib: Bortezomib is administered by rapid I.V. push (over 3-5 seconds) via a central or peripheral vein into a flowing saline line. Bortezomib will be administered any time on day -4 and at least 20 hrs after the start of the melphalan infusion on day -1. Dosing will be based on actual body weight. Dexamethasone is administered at a dose of 20 mg IV prior to each bortezomib infusion. Melphalan: Melphalan is administered at a dose of 200mg/m2 by rapid intravenous infusion via a central or peripheral vein over 30 minutes to one hour. Melphalan will be given as a single dose (not split over 2 or more days) and given of day-2. Dosing will be based body surface area calculated using actual body weight Stem cell infusion: Stem cell infusion will occur on day 0 and will be at least 18 hours after the infusion of the bortezomib. The infusion of peripheral blood stem cells will be done in accordance with the Blood and Marrow Transplant program standard operating procedures. Filgrastim will be administered at a dose of 5 mcg/kg (rounded to vial size) every other day starting on day+3 then daily starting on day 9 until engraftment (at least). Post-transplant Supportive Care will be administered in accordance to the Blood and Marrow Transplant program standard operating procedures.</detailed_description>
