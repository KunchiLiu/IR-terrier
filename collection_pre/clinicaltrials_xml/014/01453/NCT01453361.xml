	<brief_summary>Preliminary studies with a variety of vaccines suggest target accessibility (potential immunogenicity) in a variety of solid tumors to immune directed approaches. In an effort to overcome limitations of immunostimulatory cancer vaccines, the investigators have designed a novel autologous vaccine to address inability to fully identify cancer associated antigens, antigen recognition by the immune system (i.e. antigen to immunogen), effector potency, and cancer-induced resistance. In an effort to overcome limitations of immunostimulatory cancer vaccines, the investigators designed a novel dual-modulatory autologous whole cell vaccine, Vigil™ (bi-shRNA furin and GMCSF Autologous Tumor Cell Vaccine), incorporating the rhGMCSF (recombinant human GMCSF) transgene and the bifunctional shRNAfurin (to block proprotein conversion to active TGFb1 and b2) to 1) address the inability to fully identify cancer associated antigens, 2) effect antigen recognition by the immune system (i.e. antigen to immunogen), 3) enhance effector potency, and 4) subvert endogenous cancer-induced immune resistance. The investigators have also completed the Phase I assessment of Vigil™ vaccine in 27 advanced solid tumor patients (1.0 x 10e7 or 2.5 x 10e7 cells/injection/month for a maximum of 12 vaccinations) who have not experienced any significant adverse effects following 131 vaccinations, including 4 patients with melanoma. Plasmid functionality, immune biomarker response, and preliminary evidence of anticancer activity have been observed. This is a Phase II study of intradermal autologous Vigil™ cancer vaccine (1.0 x 10e7 cells/injection; maximum of 12 vaccinations) in patients with stages IIIc and IV melanoma with biopsy accessible lesions to document blood and intratumoral immune responses and assess correlation with survival.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Histologically confirmed Stages IIIc and IV melanoma. 2. Has been informed of all alternative ≥ secondline therapies that are the current standard of care. If no conventional frontline therapy indicated or acceptable by patient, patient may participate after review by sponsor. 3. Clinically (medically) indicated procedure (i.e. biopsy of lesions of recurrent disease, palliative management via resection, thoracentesis, etc.) to collect viable tumor in sufficient quantity ("golf ball size" estimated weight ~ 30 grams, pleural and/or ascites fluid estimated volume ≥ 500mL) for vaccine processing. 4. Recovered to ≤ Grade 1 (excluding alopecia) from all clinically relevant toxicities related to prior therapies. 5. Patients will be allowed to participate following single prior CNS treatment with stereotactic radiotherapy whole brain irradiation and stable without steroid requirement for ≥2 months or following ≥2 prior CNS treatments with stereotactic radiotherapy whole brain irradiation and stable without steroid requirement for ≥4 months. 6. Patients must be off all "statin" drugs for ≥ 2 weeks prior to initiation of therapy. 7. Age ≥18 years. 8. ECOG performance status (PS) 01. 9. Estimated &gt;4 month survival probability. 10. Normal organ and marrow function as defined below: Absolute granulocyte count ≥1,500/mm3 Absolute lymphocyte count ≥500/mm3 Platelets ≥100,000/mm3 Total bilirubin ≤2 mg/dL AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2x institutional upper limit of normal Creatinine &lt;1.5 mg/dL 11. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. 12. Negative pregnancy test. 1. Surgery involving general anesthesia, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, steroid therapy, or immunotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study. Collection of lumenal tissue must be avoided. 2. Patient must not have received any other investigational agents within 30 days prior to study entry. 3. Patients with known active or symptomatic brain metastases. 4. Patients with compromised pulmonary disease. 5. Short term (&lt;30 days) concurrent systemic steroids ≤ 0.25 mg/kg prednisone per day (maximum 7.5 mg/day) and bronchodilators (inhaled steroids) are permitted; other steroid regimens and/or immunosuppressives are excluded. Patients requiring steroids following previous CNS radiation for metastatic disease are excluded. 6. Prior splenectomy. 7. Prior malignancy (excluding nonmelanoma carcinomas of the skin) unless in remission for 2 years. 8. Kaposi's Sarcoma. 9. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. 10. Patients who are pregnant or nursing. 11. Patients with known HIV. 12. Patients with chronic Hepatitis B and C infection. 13. Patients with uncontrolled autoimmune diseases.</criteria>
