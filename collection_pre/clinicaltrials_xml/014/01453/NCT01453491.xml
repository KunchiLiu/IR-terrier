	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to: - 1) Test the safety and tolerability of 2 different oral doses of SRT2104 in subjects with ulcerative colitis - 2) Determine the amount of SRT2104 measured from a single blood sample in addition to colon and/or rectal tissue samples (biopsies) - 3) Determine whether SRT2104 has any anti-inflammatory effect on the colon and/or rectum when taken orally for 8 weeks - 4) Determine whether SRT2104 causes any detectable changes to specific biomarkers. A biomarker is a biological marker (or substance such as a protein) that is used as an indicator of changes in a biological state that corresponds to the risk or progression of a disease.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis as evidenced by Mayo score 610 (inclusive) with rectal bleeding score ≥1, endoscopy score between 23 (inclusive), and physician's rating of disease activity &lt;3 at Day 5 Colonic inflammation extending proximal to the rectum (i.e., greater than 15 cm in extent) on baseline sigmoidoscopy at Day 5 Confirmed diagnosis of ulcerative colitis for at least 3 months prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1) Male or female between 18 and 75 years, inclusive Body weight &gt;50 kg and BMI ≥18 kg/m^2 at Screening (Visit 1) Capable of giving written informed consent, and willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use reliable contraception from Visit 1 through the followup visit (Day 70) Suspicion of Crohn's disease, indeterminate colitis, microscopic colitis, segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis, ischemic colitis, or radiationinduced colitis based on medical history, endoscopy, and/or histological findings Presence of infectious colitis as evidenced by positive stool culture for enteric pathogens or positive stool Clostridium difficile cytotoxin assay at Visit 1 Presence of chronic liver disease, with the exception of known Gilbert's syndrome A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C antibody or HIV at Visit 1 Past or present disease that is judged by the investigator to have the potential to interfere with the study procedures or compromise the subject's safety History of malignant neoplasm within the past 5 years, other than localized basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or carcinoma in situ that has been resected or definitively treated with standard approaches Prior diagnosis of flat colonic dysplasia or unresected raised colonic dysplasia (adenomalike lesion or mass) History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the Screening (Visit 1) defined as an average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks (one drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of 80 proof distilled spirits) or presence of recreational drug abuse or dependence Known bleeding disorders Bowel surgery within 12 months prior to Visit 1 History of colectomy or partial colectomy Treatment with oral aminosalicylates at doses &gt;4.8 g per day or aminosalicylate dose modification (except transient shift lasting up to 3 days) within 4 weeks prior to study Day 5 (Note: if on this type of treatment, the dose must remain constant throughout the study treatment period) Treatment with rectal aminosalicylates at any dose within 2 weeks of study Day 5 Treatment with systemic or rectal corticosteroids within 4 weeks of study Day 5 Treatment with TNFα inhibitors or other biologics within 2 months prior to study Day 5 Treatment with other immunosuppressants (azathioprine or 6mercaptopurine), if initiated within 3 months prior to study Day 5, or if changed in terms of dose within 3 months prior to study Day 5 (Note: if on this type of treatment, the dose must remain constant throughout the study treatment period) Regular use of probiotic or prebiotic preparations within 4 weeks of study Day 5 visit Regular use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatories (NSAIDS) or aspirin, except low dose (cardioprotective ≤325 mg/day) aspirin, within 7 days prior to study Day 5 Participation in a clinical trial and treatment with an study drug within 3 months prior to Visit 1 Have a clinically significant finding on a chest Xray performed at Visit 1 or within 3 months of Visit 1 Have an abnormal 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) with one or more changes considered to be clinically significant on medical review Renal or liver impairment based on laboratory values obtained at Visit 1 and defined as: serum creatinine level of ≥1.4 mg/dL for females and ≥1.5 mg/dL for males, or AST and/or ALT ≥2x upper limit of normal (ULN), or bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN (an isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin is &lt;35%) Hemoglobin less than 8.5 g/dL at Visit 1 Have any other reason which, in the opinion of the investigator, would confound the conduct or interpretation of the study</criteria>
