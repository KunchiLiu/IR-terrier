	<brief_summary>Phase 1B: Open label (all patients receive PEGPH20+gemcitabine), dose escalation, safety and tolerability study to determine the safe dose of PEGPH20 to use in combination with gemcitabine in Stage IV previously untreated pancreatic cancer patients. Phase 2: Randomized, double blind study to compare the effect of overall survival of gemcitabine plus PEGPH20 vs gemcitabine plus placebo in Stage IV previously untreated pancreatic cancer patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PEGPH20 is a PEGylated version of human recombinant PH20 hyaluronidase that, in preclinical studies, has been shown to remove HA from the extracellular matrix surrounding tumor cells by depolymerizing this substrate. 87% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDA) overexpress HA. PDA tumor tissue may be especially sensitive to the HA-degradation properties of PEGPH20 and thus more responsive to the cytotoxic effects of a given dose of gemcitabine. Modifying the extracellular environment to increase the penetration and efficacy of anti-cancer agents represents a novel approach to treating pancreatic cancer and may provide important therapeutic outcomes in patients with Stage IV Previously Untreated Pancreatic Cancer. This Phase 1B/2 study will assess safety, tolerability, treatment effect, and various PK/PD endpoints.</detailed_description>
