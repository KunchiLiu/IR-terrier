	<brief_summary>The hypothesis for this study is that the regimen consisting of fludarabine, melphalan and bortezomib improves the progression free survival and the response rate compared to historical controls of fludarabine and melphalan alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple myeloma is the second most prevalent blood cancer (10%) after non-hodgkin's lymphoma. It represents approximately 1% of all cancers and 2% of all cancer deaths. Although the peak age of onset of multiple myeloma is 70 years of age, recent statistics indicate both increasing incidence and earlier age of onset. The historical control 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) is assumed to be 35%. The proposed therapy of fludarabine, melphalan and bortezomib is expected to improve the PFS by 20%.</detailed_description>

Confirmation that the subject is not pregnant must be established by a negative serum betahuman chorionic gonadotropin (BhCG) pregnancy test result obtained during screening. Pregnancy testing is not required for postmenopausal or surgically sterilized women. Documented hypersensitivity to fludarabine or melphalan or to bortezomib, boron or mannitol or any components of the formulation Patients unable or unwilling to provide consent Patient has a sustained platelet count of &lt;30 x 10 9/L within 14 days before enrollment Patient has a sustained absolute neutrophil count of &lt;1.0 x10 9/L within 14 days before enrollment Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment or has New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities. Prior to study entry, any ECG abnormality at screening has to be documented by the investigator as not medically relevant Patient has received other investigational drugs with 14 days before enrollment Serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation in this clinical study</criteria>
