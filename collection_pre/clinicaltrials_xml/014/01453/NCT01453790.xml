	<detailed_description>Maternal depression is a common problem, debilitating for mothers and affecting parenting practices with negative effects on the behavior, development, and physical health of children. The value of identifying and treating maternal depression for child development and well-being is well documented. Unfortunately, there are multiple barriers to the recognition and treatment of maternal depression. This is particularly problematic in younger women, as they are less often seen for health care. The overall objective of this project is to test whether the uptake of follow-up recommendations for potential depression by mothers identified by screening in clinical settings is improved by parent-specific targetting of depression education and motivational advice.</detailed_description>
