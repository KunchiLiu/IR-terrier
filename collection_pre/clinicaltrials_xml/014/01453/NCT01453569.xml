	<brief_title>Safety, Efficacy and Dose Titration of Sodium Oligo-mannurarate Capsule on Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alzheimer's disease is known for placing a great burden on caregivers which includes social, psychological, physical or economic aspects. Research indicates that the disease is associated with plaques and tangles in the brain. Currently used treatments offer a small symptomatic benefit. No treatments to delay or halt the progression of the disease are, as of yet, available. The investigators suppose sodium oligo-mannurarate capsule to be effective to halt the progression of the disease.</detailed_description>
