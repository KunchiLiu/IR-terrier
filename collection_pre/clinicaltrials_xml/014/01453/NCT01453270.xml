	<brief_title>Emergency Department Management of Sepsis Patients: A Goal-Oriented Non-Invasive Sepsis Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe sepsis is a syndrome where the body develops organ dysfunction secondary to uncontrolled inflammatory response to infection. Various resuscitation bundles have been formulated and practised to treat severe sepsis, such as early goal-directed therapy (EGDT). EGDT involves the insertion of invasive catheters in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock using serial measurements to guide therapy and achieve hemodynamic goals, such as mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP) and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) by 6 hours. The drawbacks include the invasive nature of inserting these catheters with its complications and tedium to set up the equipment. A non-invasive approach using the Non-Invasive Cardiac Output Monitor (NICOM) and passive leg raising (PLR) maneuver to guide fluid and vasoactive agent therapy targeting fluid responsiveness and MAP may be able to achieve better outcome, measured by lactate clearance at 3 hours and at a lower hospitalization cost.</detailed_description>
