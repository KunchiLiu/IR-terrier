	<brief_title>Safety and Effects of Autologous Adipose-Derived Stromal Cells in Patients With Diffuse Lesions in the Brain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be an open-label, non-randomized multi-center patient sponsored study of Adipose-Derived Stromal Cells (ASC) implantation using a catheter delivery system. ASCs will be derived from the patient's adipose-derived tissue. Liposuction using local anesthesia and syringe collection will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen for subsequent processing to isolate the stem cells. The cells will be delivered via catheter into the internal carotid artery and intravenously.</detailed_description>
