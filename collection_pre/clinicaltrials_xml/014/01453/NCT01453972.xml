	<brief_summary>The main purpose of our study is to examine the physiological adaptations in oxygen transport chain for high-intensity exercise and moderate exercise in overweight and obese humans. The main goals are: 1. To investigate the most effective short-and long-interval training in terms of VO2max, pulmonary diffusion, cardiac output, endothelial function and mitochondrial function. 2. How these physiological adaptations affect the aerobic endurance and performance, and how this training can reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases related to overweight and obesity.</brief_summary>
