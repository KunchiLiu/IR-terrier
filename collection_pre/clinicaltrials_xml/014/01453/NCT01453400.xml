	<criteria>Healthy, ambulatory, male and female subjects ≥ 18 years of age Presence of sore throat due to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) Onset of sore throat pain within six days of the screening period Baseline sore throat pain intensity score ≥ 60 mm on the Sore Throat Pain Intensity Scale Have a score ≥ 5 on the Tonsillopharyngitis Assessment Female subjects of childbearing potential who are currently sexually active must be using a medically acceptable form of birth control for at least one month prior to screening (three months on oral contraceptives), e.g., oral or patch contraceptives, intrauterine device, Nuvaring, DepoProvera, or doublebarrier and have a negative pregnancy test at screening/treatment period. Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential must be amenorrheic for at least two years or had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy. Understand the pain rating assessments History of hypersensitivity to aspirin, salicylates, other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, opioid analgesics, and similar drugs Use of any "cold medication" (i.e. decongestants, antihistamines, expectorants, antitussives) within four hours preceding administration of the investigational product Use of any immediate release analgesic/antipyretic within four hours or use of any sustained release or longacting analgesic/antipyretic within twelve hours preceding administration of the investigational product Consumption of alcoholic beverages, or foods and beverages containing xanthines within two hours prior to administration of the investigational product Use of any sore throat lozenges, sprays, cough drops, mentholcontaining products within one hour preceding administration of the investigational product Presence of cough that causes throat discomfort Presence of mouthbreathing or any respiratory condition that, in the Investigator's judgment, could compromise breathing Evidence of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic diseases, or malignancies for which aspirin or acetaminophen is contraindicated Relevant concomitant disease such as medically uncontrolled asthma (exercise induced asthma is permitted), chronic sinusitis or nasal structural abnormalities causing greater than fifty percent obstruction History of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation related to previous nonsteroidal antiinflammatory therapy. Current or past history of a bleeding disorder Self reported alcoholism or drug abuse within two years prior to screening or routine consumption of three or more alcohol containing beverages per day Habituation to analgesic drugs or tranquilizers (i.e., routine use of five or more times per week for greater than three weeks) Acute illness, local infection, or disease (other than URTI with pharyngeal infection) that can interfere with the conduct of the study Current use of blood thinning (anticoagulant), low dose aspirin, or steroid drug Has initiated treatment for depression within the past thirty days Females who are pregnant or lactating</criteria>
