	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators are proposing to treat patients with steroid-refractory Graft-versus-host Disease (GVHD) in a manner designed to promote CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs. The profound immune suppression which follows the most common salvage treatment for GVHD have unfortunately lead to very poor outcomes because of high infection rates. A more targeted approach based on the promotion and stabilization of Tregs is hoped to allow GVHD control without the profound immunosuppression usually seen. High-dose cyclophosphamide and sirolimus have been successfully used for the prevention of GVHD and have shown to enhance the Tregs subpopulation. The addition of low dose IL-2 and a demethylating agent such as azacitidine will also be studied in an attempt to promote and stabilize the FoxP3 expression of Tregs.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must have a documented clinical diagnosis of grade IIIV acute graftversus host disease defined as GVHD occurring within the first 100 days of transplantation Patients must be steroidrefractory defines as progression after 3 days of corticosteroid therapy or no response after 5 days of corticosteroid therapy. Progression is defined as upgrading No response is defined as no downgrading Progression after 3 days requires patients to have received at least 2 mg/mg/day for a total of 6 mg/kg of methylprednisolone or its equivalent. No response after 5 days requires patient to have received at least 2 mg/kg/d for a total of 10 mg/kg of methylprednisolone or its equivalent. Patients with exacerbation of GVHD during steroid taper will require retreatment with 2mg/kg/d of corticosteroids and will need to meet the criteria Age 1870 Patients must have received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant within 100 days of study enrollment. Serum creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dL Patients cannot have active CNS disease. Patients must not have received cyclophosphamide for GVHD prophylaxis Patients must not have pneumonia requiring oxygen supplementation Unable or unwilling to sign informed consent.</criteria>
