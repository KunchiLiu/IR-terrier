	<brief_title>Study to Assess the Safety and Effects of Autologous Adipose-Derived Stromal Cells in Patients After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adipose-Derived Stromal Cells (ASCs) are a novel therapy for patients suffering from stroke. By injecting ASCs either into the internal carotid artery, these regions may become populated with the ASCs, thereby potentially restoring brain function. ASCs are a patient-derived ("autologous") cell transplantation technology that is delivered to the patient into the internal carotid artery and intravenously. The therapy is composed of cells derived from a patients' own adipose tissue that are isolated within approximately 1 hour and immediately delivered back to the patient.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males and Females between Age 18 and 80 years. Symptoms and signs of clinically definite ischemic stroke or hemorrhagic stroke DWIMRI has reliably shown relevant ischemic lesions Extracranial duplex/transcranial Doppler must confirm intra/extracranial arteries permeability The stroke is severe (NIH Stroke Scale &gt;= 8 before procedure) Up to date on all age and gender appropriate cancer screening per American Cancer Society. Females who are pregnant or nursing or females of childbearing potential who are unwilling to maintain contraceptive therapy for the duration of the study Life expectancy &lt; 6 months due to concomitant illnesses. Exposure to any investigational drug or procedure within 1 month prior to study entry or enrolled in a concurrent study that may confound results of this study. Active infectious disease and/or known to have tested positive for HIV, HTLV, HBV, HCV, CMV (IgM &gt; IgG) and/or syphilis will have expert consultation to determine eligibility based on the patient's infectious status Any illness which, in the Investigator's judgment, will interfere with the patient's ability to comply with the protocol, compromise patient safety, or interfere with the interpretation of the study results Patients on chronic immunosuppressive transplant therapy Systolic blood pressure (supine) â‰¤90 mmHg or greater than 180mmHg Resting heart rate &gt; 100 bpm; Active clinical infection being treated by antibiotics within one week of enrollment.
