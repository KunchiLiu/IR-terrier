	<brief_summary>The intent of this clinical study is to answer the questions: 1. Is the proposed treatment safe 2. Is treatment effective in improving the disease pathology of patients with Renal Failure and clinical outcomes</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Assess the Safety and Effects of Autologous Adipose-Derived Stromal Cells Delivered in Patients With Renal Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adipose-Derived Stromal Cells (ASCs) are a novel therapy for patients suffering from Renal failure. By injecting ASCs, these regions may become populated with the ASCs, thereby potentially restoring kidney function. ASCs are a patient-derived ("autologous") cell transplantation technology that is delivered to the patient. The therapy is composed of cells derived from a patients' own adipose tissue that are isolated within approximately 1 hour and immediately delivered back to the patient.</detailed_description>
