	<brief_title>Travoprost 3-Month Safety and Efficacy Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consisted of six visits conducted during two sequential phases. The Screening/Eligibility phase included one screening visit and two eligibility visits. A washout period based on previous ocular medication preceded Eligibility Visit 1. Subjects who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria at both eligibility visits were randomized (1:1) at the second eligibility visit. The Treatment phase consisted of three on-therapy visits (Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3).</detailed_description>
