	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of the booster vaccine dose of 2 new formulations of DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib administered between 12 and 15 months of age, and the immune persistence following the primary series. All children in this booster study received a primary vaccination at 2, 3 and 4 months of age in study 113948 (NCT01248884). No new subjects will be enrolled in this booster study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects who participated in the study 113948 (NCT01248884) and received three doses of the new or licensed DTPaHBVIPV/Hib study vaccine. A male or female child between, and including, 12 and 15 months of age at the time of the booster vaccination. Subjects who the investigator believes that parent(s)/ Legally Acceptable Representative(s) (LAR(s)) can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol (e.g. completion of the diary cards, return for followup visit). Written informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Child in care. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccines within 30 days preceding the booster dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the booster dose. Administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 days prior to vaccination, or planned administration during the study period. Participation in another clinical study within three months prior to enrolment in the present booster study or at any time during the present booster study, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product (pharmaceutical product or device). Evidence of previous or intercurrent diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and Hib vaccination or disease since the conclusion visit of study 113948 (NCT01248884). Serious chronic illness. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required). History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccines. History of any neurological disorders or seizures. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months preceding the booster dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period. Occurrence of any of the following events following previous administration of the study vaccine constitutes an absolute contraindication to further dosing. Anaphylactic or other hypersensitivity reaction. Encephalopathy defined as an acute, severe central nervous system disorder occurring within 7 days following vaccination and generally consisting of major alterations in consciousness, unresponsiveness, generalized or focal seizures that persist more than a few hours, with failure to recover within 24 hours. Temperature of ≥ 40.0°C (axillary) or 40.5°C (rectal) within 48 hours of vaccination, not due to another identifiable cause. Collapse or shocklike state (hypotonichyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours of vaccination. Persistent, inconsolable crying occurring within 48 hours of vaccination and lasting ≥ 3 hours. Seizures with or without fever occurring within 3 days of vaccination. The following condition is temporary or selflimiting, and a subject may be vaccinated once the condition has resolved if no other exclusion criteria is met: • Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment. Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C on oral, axillary or tympanic setting, or ≥ 38.0° on rectal setting. Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever may, be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.</criteria>
