	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this feasibility study is to determine whether it is possible to conduct a study of the ClearView scan among patients under evaluation for acute cardiovascular events, as well as give insight into the performance of the ClearView scoring algorithm with respect to this patient population. The EPICâ„¢ scan is a bio-electrographic tool that may assist the health care provider in rapid assessment of the systemic origin of the patient's presenting symptom(s). The EPIC ClearView is a potentially valuable resource that may benefit an emergency department (ED) by offering expedited "chest pain" etiologic differentiation capabilities. The subsequent results have the potential to include more rapid "chest pain" patient diagnosis and appropriate disposition of non-cardiac chest pain (rule out MI); optimized precious resource expenditure (nursing, physician, inpatient or observation bed, etc.); lower costs to facility, patient and insurance company; and greater patient satisfaction rates due to decreased ED wait time.</brief_summary>
