	<brief_title>Respiratory Complications After Laparoscopic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to describe change in pulmonary function and incidence of respiratory complications after laparoscopic surgery. The investigators will include 60 women scheduled for laparoscopic hysterectomy or cholecystectomy. The investigators will measure the pulmonary function by different methods during and for 2 hours after surgery. Moreover, the incidence of respiratory complications including pneumonia, respiratory failure and radiologically verified atelectasis will be registered.</detailed_description>
