	<brief_summary>Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is a challenging, chronic, refractory illness with the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric condition. Advances in the neuroimaging, genetics and neurobiology of AN has led to a greater understanding of its underlying pathophysiology, although few significant advances in treatment have been made in the last half-century. The central features of AN, which include an intense fear of gaining weight, a refusal to maintain a normal weight, as well as significant anxiety, anhedonia and dysphoria surrounding food, have been linked to dysfunction in key brain structures and circuits. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical procedure that involves the insertion of electrodes into structures believed to drive pathological behavior. The procedure is approved for the management of movement disorders, such as Parkinson's Disease, and has shown promising early results in the management of some psychiatric conditions, such as Major Depression. The purpose of this study is to explore the safety and initial efficacy of DBS, in patients with treatment resistant AN.</brief_summary>

A pattern of three year's duration of relentless unresponsiveness to repeated voluntary hospitalizations, characterized by failure to complete treatment of immediate weight relapse following treatment; 2. pattern of increasing medical instability accompanied by refusal to participate in/lack of responsiveness to intensive expert treatment and increasing medical acuity, lasting at least two years and involving at least two episodes of involuntary feeding; 3.
