	<brief_summary>The investigators investigate the impact of an encapsulated fruit, berry and vegetable juice powder concentrate on oxidative stress, inflammation and blood flow before and post exercise in overweight, middle-aged, women. Main hypotheses (H1): - The nutraceutical has an impact on oxidative stress reduction. - The nutraceutical has an impact on inflammation. - The nutraceutical has an impact on blood flow and microcirculation. - Walking exercise for 30 minutes has an impact on oxidative stress- and inflammation markers. - Walking exercise for 30 minutes has an impact on blood flow and microcirculation - The combination of nutraceutical supplementation + walking exercise for 30 minutes has an impact on oxidative stress- and inflammation markers, and on blood flow/microcirculation.</brief_summary>
