	<criteria>Smoking Status: Current cigarette smokers who have smoked regularly for at least a year and smoke their first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up. Allergy/Intolerance: Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to nicotine (or closely related compounds) or any of the stated ingredients in formulation. Prior Concomitant Medication: a. Treatment with known enzyme altering agents (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin, cimetidine, sodium valporate) within 30 days of the craving provocation visit. b. Use of any prescription psychoactive medication (such as but not limited to antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics) within 14 days of the craving provocation visit. c. Use of any overthecounter (OTC) medication that affects central nervous system such as antihistamines, sedating agents, or any compound that would have a sedating effect within 24 hours of the craving provocation visit. d. Use of any nicotine replacement therapy or any other treatment for smoking cessation (e.g. bupropion or varenicline) within one month of screening visit. e. Use of any nicotine containing products at any time during the Provocation/Treatment visit. f. Use of any medications noted in the exclusion criteria, or use of any product that would, in the opinion of the investigator, jeopardize the safety of the subject or impact on the validity of the study results. Any disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the absorption, metabolism or excretion of the study product. A medical history that, in the opinion of the investigator, might jeopardise the safety of the subject or the validity of the study results. For example, recent myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident (within 12 weeks of the screening visit), phenylketonuria, unstable or worsening angina pectoris, Prinzmetals angina or severe cardiac arrhythmia. Expired Carbon Monoxide (CO): Any subject whose CO level rises during the sequestration period (i.e., the subject's expired CO assessments immediately prior to the provoked craving paradigm are higher than the mean baseline CO assessment) and, in the opinion of the investigator, may have smoked during that time. Alcohol: Consumption of any alcoholic beverage within 24 hours of the craving provocation visit, as indicated by a positive breath alcohol test.</criteria>
