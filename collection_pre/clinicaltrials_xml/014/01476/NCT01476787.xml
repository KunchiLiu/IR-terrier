	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the combined treatment of lenalidomide and rituximab in controlling the Follicular Lymphoma disease and also increase the length of response compared to the available standard combination chemotherapy treatment for Follicular Lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined Rituximab and Lenalidomide Treatment for Untreated Patients With Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Follicular Lymphoma (FL) is a cancer of a B lymphocyte, a type of white blood cell. FL is typically a slowly progressing but incurable disease. Follicular lymphoma cells produce a specific defect in the patient's immune system impairing their ability to control their cancer. Lenalidomide has been shown to reverse the specific immune defect caused by FL in the patient. By including lenalidomide, the RELEVANCE study aims to eliminate the cancer while restoring the patient's immune competence. The 'Relevance' cooperative group trial is being conducted as two companion studies: RV-FOL-GELARC-0683 (N=750) and RV-FOL-GELARC-0683C (N=250); the combined total of 1000 Follicular Lymphoma patients enrolled in both studies will be analyzed.</detailed_description>
