	<detailed_description>Primary Aim: To conduct a dose response pilot trial of low (30 min/day) or high (60 min/day) dose exercise in men and women at increased risk of colon cancer. The major outcomes are changes in serum levels of four risk-related biomarkers: insulin, C-peptide, IL-6 and PGE-2. Secondary Aim. To compare changes in the secondary outcome of physical activity over three months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>aged 50 to 80 no personal cancer history found to have an adenomatous polyp upon colonoscopy at BJH/WUSM in the previous six months no contraindications to beginning an exercise program no previous diagnosis of familial polyposis syndromes no previous diagnosis of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease; Participants who are regular NSAID users will be excluded as this may interfere with the measurement of inflammatory marker outcomes. Regular use is defined as taking 80mg or more per day of aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen or other NSAID 5 or more days of the week.</criteria>
