	<brief_summary>Development of a second neoplasm (SMN) during or after therapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a rare event generally associated with a poor prognosis. In this international study we analyze subtypes of SMN in relation to their initial leukemia characteristics and treatment, and their subsequent overall survival.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Second Malignant Neoplasms After Childhood ALL Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To explore epidemiology, potential risk factors and survival rates of second cancers occurring as the first event in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia the involved study groups will collect anonymous data on all such cases diagnosed within the last decades to form a common database with predefined variables comprising the clinical, biological, and cytogenetic characteristics (myeloid neoplasias only) as well as outcome. Furthermore, we will register the clinical, biological, and cytogenetic characteristics of the acute lymphoblastic leukemia as well as type of treatment given.</detailed_description>
