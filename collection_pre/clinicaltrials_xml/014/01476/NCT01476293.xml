	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study to to monitor the peripheral intravenous (PIV) site on subjects receiving continuous IV fluids for infiltration and extravasation events. Infiltration is an indication that the PIV is leaking fluids outside of the vascular system. The study hypothesis is to demonstrate that changes in the optical signals of the non-invasive monitoring medical device will detect infiltration and extravasation events.</brief_summary>
