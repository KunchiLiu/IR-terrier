	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine whether the finger tip images captured by the EPIC ClearView device, when analyzed via the ClearView software, produce a Response Scale that characterizes trends consistent with known diagnoses identified by medical doctors. Specifically, the investigators hypothesize that the organ system involving any of a series of known active diagnoses will be identified in the EPIC ClearView Response Scale report with the intention of providing potential triage capabilities.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Five Diagnosis Group: 1. Sex: Male or Female 2. Age range: 18 to 85 3. Qualifying medical diagnoses (5 diagnosis groups) For potential subjects presenting with one of the five qualifying diagnoses, the patient presents with confirmed active medical diagnoses affecting the following systems or organs: Cardiovascular system: coronary artery disease, left sided congestive heart failure with EF &lt;50%, valvular heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension Kidney: pyelonephritis, acute renal failure, or chronic renal failure stages IIV Liver: viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, steatohepatitis, or cirrhosis Pulmonary system: asthma, COPD, bronchitis, emphysema, or pneumonia Gastrointestinal/Endocrine: inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or diverticulitis), peptic ulcer disease, IBS, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or malabsorption disorders (including Celiac Sprue); diabetes (Type 1 and Type 2) 4. The patient or legal representative is able to understand and provide signed consent for the procedure. 5. Every effort will be given to balance subjects by gender, age, and race. At least 60 subjects from each of the 5 diagnostic groups and the 1 control group will be recruited. Control Group: 1. Sex: Male or Female 2. Age range: 18 to 85 3. Freedom from qualifying medical diagnoses (control group) For potential subjects for the control group, the subject is free from active medical diagnoses affecting the following systems or organs: Cardiovascular system: coronary artery disease, left sided congestive heart failure with EF &lt;50%, valvular heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension Kidney: pyelonephritis, acute renal failure, or chronic renal failure stages IIV Liver: viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, steatohepatitis, or cirrhosis Pulmonary system: asthma, COPD, bronchitis, emphysema, or pneumonia Gastrointestinal/Endocrine: inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or diverticulitis), peptic ulcer disease, IBS, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or malabsorption disorders (including Celiac Sprue); diabetes (type 1 and type 2) 4. The patient or legal representative is able to understand and provide signed consent for the procedure. 5. Every effort will be given to balance subjects by gender, age, and race. At least 60 subjects from each of the 5 diagnostic groups and the 1 control group will be recruited. Patients &lt; 18 years in age or &gt; 85 years in age. Inability or unwillingness to provide informed consent. Patients with pacemakers or another electrical device implanted somewhere in their body. Pregnant women. Patients currently undergoing therapy for cancer of any kind.</criteria>
