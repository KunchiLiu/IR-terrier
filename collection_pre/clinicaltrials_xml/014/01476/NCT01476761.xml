	<brief_title>MicroCutter in Surgical Stapling - European Trial I</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective, open label, multi-center non-inferiority safety study with an all-comers enrollment of patients requiring surgical stapling of the stomach and/or intestine according to the labeled indications contained in the approved labeling. Up to 178 subjects consented for a 1-month clinical follow-up evaluation will be enrolled. Primary endpoint is to statistical non-inferiority of composite major adverse event rate (composite of infection (non-dermal), dehiscence, bleeding, and strictures) in study patients when compared to composite major adverse event rate (composite of infection (non-dermal), dehiscence, bleeding, and strictures) as derived from a comprehensive analysis of the medical literature. The comparison will be performed for cumulative events up to 30 days postoperatively.</detailed_description>
