	<brief_title>Is There A LIfe for Drug Eluting Stent (DES) After Discontinuation of Clopidogrel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of drug-eluting stents has resulted in a significant reduction in the restenosis rate and in the need for repeat angioplasty of the stented lesion. However, the occurrence of late stent thrombosis has resulted in an increase in the duration of dual antiplatelet treatment. According to the guidelines of the ESC, the current recommended duration of dual antiplatelet treatment is 12 months. A relationship has been demonstrated between the occurrence of late stent thrombosis and aspirin resistance. Furthermore, dual anti-platelet treatment is associated with an increase in bleeding, the severity of which has been well documented. In addition, the patients involved, and especially those over 70, have significant co-morbidities often requiring extra-cardiac surgery which cannot easily be carried out in patients on dual antiplatelet treatment or clopidogrel. The objective of this study is to determine whether, after a period of 6 months following Drug eluting stent (DES) implantation in patients regarded as sensitive to aspirin, dual antiplatelet therapy may be replaced by aspirin alone. The original Italic Trial is a multicenter, randomized study evaluating the non-inferiority of aspirin as a single treatment versus dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin 6 months after drug-eluting stent implantation, including a 12-, 24- and 36-month follow-up analysis.</detailed_description>
