	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out how much a trocar might slide during a typical laparoscopic hysterectomy. We also want to find out if there is a difference between how much three commonly used trocars slide and if a device called LaproStop has an effect on the slippage. Patients will be randomly assigned into the different trocar groups. After this assignment has been made, we will then assign the Laprostop to one of the two trocars by chance.</brief_summary>
