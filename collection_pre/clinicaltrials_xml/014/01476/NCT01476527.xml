	<brief_summary>Bipolar Disorder (BD) is among the most comon and challenging conditions in psychiatry. Although episodes of mania and hypomania define the different types of the disorder, the clinical picture is one dominated by depressed mood and agitation. The mainstay of BD treatment has thus far been pharmacologic, but many patients remain severely disabled by their condition, despite the best available medical treatment. The successful use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in movement disorders, and its promising results in major depressive disorder (MDD), has led researchers to consider its use in highly selected refractory cases of BD. Evidence form the imaging and circuitry literature suggests that similar underlying dyfunctional anatomic structures subserve both MDD and BD, indicating that modulation of key structures, can lead to an amelioration of symptoms and mood stabilization. Here, we propose a phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety of DBS in BD.</brief_summary>
