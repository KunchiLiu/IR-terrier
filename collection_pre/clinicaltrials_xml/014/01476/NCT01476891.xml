	<brief_summary>For people with cancer, in-person Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) participation can decrease stress symptoms, mood disturbance, and fatigue, as well as enhance personal growth and spirituality, and improve quality of life and sleep. Online MBSR may improve the accessibility of MBSR programs to underserved cancer patients who are unable to attend available in-person groups. This study will examine whether patients are willing to participate and complete the program, and also whether the online program improves mood and stress.</brief_summary>
