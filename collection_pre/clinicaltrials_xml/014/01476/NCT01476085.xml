	<brief_title>Evaluating the Utility of the Apoptosis Imaging Biomarker 18F]ML10 in Patients With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma(NHL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Apoptosis or programmed cell death mechanisms are disrupted in cancer cells allowing them to live longer and grow faster than normal cells. Apoptosis is a key target for several novel anti-cancer agents. A biomarker that could permit imaging levels of ongoing apoptosis could be a powerful tool in associated drug development programs by providing relevant data to support proof of concept. In addition, use in the clinical setting may permit the tailoring of treatment for individual patients balancing efficacy of treatment with known toxicity levels. This study aims to evaluate the potential of 2-(5- Fluoro pentyl)-2-methyl malonic acid ([18F]ML10), as an apoptosis imaging biomarker and its potential to predict response in patients with Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma. All patients will have a baseline [18F]ML10 PET-CT scan and a post-treatment scan after the initiation of the first course of intravenous chemotherapy. The study aims to enrol unto 16 subjects with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma.</detailed_description>
