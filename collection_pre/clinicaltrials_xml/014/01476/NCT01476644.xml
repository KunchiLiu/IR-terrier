	<brief_summary>Hypothesis 1: Self-reported health-related quality of life decreases as vision impairment worsens in subjects with glaucoma. Hypothesis 2: Changes in health-related quality of life are associated with changes in clinical measures of vision and performance-based measures of visual function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>How Has Glaucoma Affected Your Quality of Life?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>You are being asked to participate in this research study because you have glaucoma, which is the second leading cause of blindness in the world and accounts for 15% of blindness worldwide. Vision loss caused by glaucoma can significantly worsen your health-related quality of life. Despite the fact that glaucoma has such a big impact on a large number of people, research examining the long-term effects of glaucoma-related vision loss on one's quality of life is scarce. The purpose of this study is to look at the long-term effect of this condition on your quality of life so that we may gain valuable information about what factors influence the quality of life of people with glaucoma. To participate in this study, you will need to allow us to perform clinical tests on your eyes, to self-report your well-being and health-related quality of life, and to let us know how well you perform your daily life activities.</detailed_description>
