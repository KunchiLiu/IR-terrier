	<brief_title>Effect of Remote Ischemic Perconditioning on Acute Kidney Injury in Adult Valve Replace</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods: Patients meeting the requirement will be randomized into 2 groups: the treatment group consisted of three 5-minute cycles left lower limb ischemia, induced by inflating a blood pressure cuff on the lower limb to 600 mmHg with an intervening 5 minutes of reperfusion, during which time the cuff was deflate; the control group consisted of placing an uninflated cuff on the left lower limb for 30 minutes. The postconditioning protocol was applied after the aortic cross-clamping. The clinical data of inotropes requirement, drainage, ventilation and intensive care time will be recorded. Venous blood samples will be taken perioperatively for detecting concentration of troponin I (cTnI), Myocardial enzyme, Renal function, Cystatin c, and High-sensitivity c-reactive protein(HS-CRP).</detailed_description>
