	<brief_summary>The main purpose of the study is to see how safe GSK1995057 is and how well it is tolerated after dosing. The study will also investigate how GSK1995057 is taken up, metabolised (chemically broken down), distributed through the body and excreted, and what some of the effects of the study drug are.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study of GSK1995057 Given as Single and Repeat Intravenous Doses in Healthy Subjects.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be the first investigation of GSK1995057 in humans and is primarily designed to investigate safety and tolerability of single and repeat intravenously infused doses. The study will enrol healthy male subjects and healthy female subjects of non-child bearing potential and will also investigate immunogenicity, GSK1995057 distribution (pharmacokinetics), and potential impact on indicators of host immunity and normal immunological function. Safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from this trial may facilitate further clinical investigations in healthy subjects dosed with GSK1995057 via the inhaled route, and ultimately clinical trials in patients with acute lung injury.</detailed_description>

Male or female between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation, hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea and elevated FSH as per the local laboratory guidelines. Normal creatinine clearance values at screening Male subjects must agree to use one of the study specific contraception methods Body weight â‰¥ 50 kg and BMI within the range 19 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive). Normal lung function at screening. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. Available to complete all study assessments. Able to read, comprehend and write English at a sufficient level to complete study elated materials. A history of Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C or HIV infection and/or a positive prestudy HIV, Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 months of screening Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities. (With the exception of known Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones). A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen. Evidence of previous or active mycobacterium tuberculosis complex infection Recent history of and/or a positive test for Toxoplasma consistent with active oxoplasmosis infection. A positive test for influenza A/B taken within 7 days before dosing. Current evidence or history of an influenzalike illness. Corrected QT interval (QTcF) &gt;450msec from ECG readings. History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as an average weekly intake of &gt;21 units for males or &gt;14 units for females. One unit is equivalent to 8 g of alcohol and the following can be used as a guide: a halfpint (~240 ml) of beer, 1 glass (125 ml) of wine or 1 (25 ml) measure of spirits. The subject is unwilling to abstain from alcohol consumption from 24 hr prior to dosing until discharge from the clinic, and for 24 hr prior to all other outpatient clinic visits. Subjects with a smoking history of &gt;10 cigarettes per day in the last 3 months. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 90 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer) or exposure to more than four new chemical or biological entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day. Subjects having received any type of vaccination within 3 weeks of the anticipated dosing start or are expected to be vaccinated within 3 weeks after the last dose. Current evidence of ongoing or acute infection, history of repeated or chronic significant infections or history of serious infection within three months of dosing. Subjects who have asthma or a history of asthma, COPD, other respiratory conditions or recurrent infections (a subject who suffered from childhood asthma but not as an adult may be included provided they fulfil other entry criteria). Subjects who have a known history of migraine headaches or are frequently suffering from other types of headaches which require medication (frequent defined as more than one headache in a fortnight). Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs (except simple analgesics), including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and sponsors Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy including severe allergic reaction, angioedema or anaphylaxis that, in the opinion of the investigator or sponsors Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. History of malignancy, except for adequately treated noninvasive cancer of the skin (basal or squamous cell) or cervical carcinoma in situ (&gt;2 yrs prior to dosing). Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products in excess of 500 mL within a 3 month or 90 day period. Subject is unable to refrain from travelling to countries with a high prevalence of TB or other areas of prevalent infectious disease as judged by the investigator or the sponsors medical monitor from the start of screening until the final followup visit. Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated.</criteria>
