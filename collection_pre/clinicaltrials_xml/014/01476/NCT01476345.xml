	<brief_summary>The purposes of this study are to determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of LY2963016 compared to those of basal insulin. The study will also gather information on the safety and tolerability of LY2963016 in healthy participants. Each study period will be approximately 8.5 days (1.5 days for treatment and 7 day washout period). There are 4 study periods.</brief_summary>
