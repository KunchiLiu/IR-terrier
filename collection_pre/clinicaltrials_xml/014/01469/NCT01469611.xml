	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to: - determine the maximally-tolerated dose (MTD) and/or maximum-feasible dose (MFD) of JX-594 administered by biweekly intravenous (IV) infusion. - determine the safety of JX-594(TK- GM-CSF+ Wyeth strain vaccinia) administered by biweekly IV infusion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial of JX-594 in Refractory Colorectal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1b, open-label, dose-escalation trial in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma (CRC) that have failed both oxaliplatin based and irinotecan based prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease. Patients will receive treatment at one of three dose levels in a sequential dose-escalating design. Three patients will be treated at each dose level unless a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed. Enrollment will proceed to the next dose level if 0 of 3 patients experiences a DLT; if one of the first 3 patients experiences a DLT, additional patients will be enrolled until a second patient experiences a DLT (which defines the toxic dose) or until six total patients have been treated at that dose level, whichever comes first. If a second DLT is not experienced within that cohort, dose escalation may continue. Patients will be enrolled a minimum of 14 days after the first treatment of the immediately preceding patient for the first patient in any cohort or all remaining patients in a cohort with DLT. If 2 DLTs are observed within a cohort, enrollment into the cohort will cease and the dose level immediately preceding that dose will be determined to be the MTD. Regulatory Authorities and the IRB will be notified as required if any patient dies within 28 days of product administration due to a serious and unexpected ADR that is determined by the Investigator to be possibly or probably related to JX-594. Once the MTD and/or MFD is defined, an additional 3-6 patients may be enrolled at that dose level. Note: once the MTD and/or MFD is defined, treatment of additional patients at this dose level will no longer require inter-patient delays of 14 days.</detailed_description>

Tumor(s) invading a major vascular structure (e.g. carotid artery) Tumor(s) in location that would potentially result in significant clinical adverse effects if posttreatment tumor swelling were to occur (e.g. tumors impinging on the upper airway or affecting biliary tract drainage, etc.) Clinically significant and/or rapidly accumulating ascites, pericardial and/or pleural effusions Severe or unstable cardiac disease, including (for example) coronary artery disease requiring increased doses of antianginal mediation and/or coronary angioplasty (including stent placement) within the preceding 24 months Current, known CNS malignancy (history of completely resected or irradiated brain metastases by WBRT or stereotactic radiosurgery allowed) Received anticancer therapy within 4 weeks prior to first treatment (6 weeks in case of mitomycin C or nitrosoureas) Use of antiviral, antiplatelet, or anticoagulation medication [Patients who discontinue such medications within 7 days prior to first treatment may be eligible for this study.] Low dose aspirin (approximately 81 mg) allowed.
