	<brief_summary>This will be a 2-week oral dose study of PF 04991532, performed in patients with type 2 diabetes. Safety, pharmacokinetics (how the drug is distributed in the body), and pharmacodynamics (how the drug works in the body) will be studied. Patients may be asked to wash off their diabetes medication for 4-6 prior to study drug administration, and they will remain in the clinical research unit for a total of 20 days for baseline tests, 2 weeks of dosing, and some follow up tests.</brief_summary>

HbA1c &gt;/=6.5% and &lt;/=9% if the patient requires to be washed off an OAD. Evidence or history of diabetic complications with significant end organ damage. History of stroke or transient ischemic attack. History of myocardial infarction. History of coronary artery bypass graft or stent implantation. Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease.
