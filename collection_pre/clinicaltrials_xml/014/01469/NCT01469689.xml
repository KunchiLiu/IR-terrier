	<brief_summary>Web based cognitive behavioural therapy (webCBT) for depression is recommended by NICE but analysis of the geographic distribution of one webCBT site showed 15-fold variation in use across Britain. Such variation is unlikely to be from differences in prevalence. Raising awareness of webCBT could benefit many people with depression but it is not clear how direct-to-patient promotion online or via the media, compares with GP centred methods. This pilot cluster randomised controlled trial will explore the use of online methods to raise awareness in preparation for subsequent study comparing different approaches. In a pilot cluster randomised trial the investigators will explore the feasibility and likely impact of online methods of raising awareness of webCBT, assessing how many people with depression respond to geographically restricted Google and local website advertisements. The investigators will explore costs of recruitment and define and document the best online methods that might subsequently be used in a definitive trial comparing online with mass media and GP centred methods for raising awareness. The investigators will compare intervention with control areas to estimate impact on registration levels and compare rate of completion of webCBT of these 'additional' registrants with other registrants. Recommendations will be made for a subsequent trial comparing online with other methods.</brief_summary>
