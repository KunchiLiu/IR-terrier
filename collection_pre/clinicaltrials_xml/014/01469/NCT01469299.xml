	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of this evaluation are: 1) To attempt to refine the current clinical understanding of "balance" 2) To determine if patients with quantifiably balanced knee joints exhibit improved clinical outcomes versus patient with residual imbalance, as measured by the VERASENSE™ Knee System Secondary objectives: - Determine whether a difference in inter-compartment loads and soft tissue tension exists between the physicians intra-operative feel compared to the quantifiable data measured by the VERASENSE™ Knee System - Determine which ligament releases are performed by the surgeon to improve soft tissue balance while utilizing the information from the VERASENSE™ Knee System - Evaluate range of motion, pain, physical function, activity level, and patient satisfaction between baseline (pre-operative) and post-operative follow-up as well as radiographic success and survivorship of the knee implants</brief_summary>
