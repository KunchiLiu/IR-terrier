	<detailed_description>Newborns (treatment-group E) and infants at the age of 6 months (treatment-group L) shall be treated with 1 x 1 ml ECN-SUSPENSION for 10 days and observed until the age of 12 months.Treatment-group E (newborn) will receive EcN-Suspension on the first 10 days of life and will be observed for the next 12 months. Treatment-group L (infants at the age of 6 months) will receive EcN-Suspension on the first 10 days of their seventh month of life and will be observed for the next 6 months.The corresponding control group will remain untreated and will be observed only for 12 months. According to the hospitals daily routine the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be checked. All newborns meeting the inclusion criteria will be included into the trial. Patients' anamnestic data and general health status are recorded at the initial control.Controls are performed according to the time schedule normally used in the hospital functioning as a trial site. According to this, during each monthly control data on the efficacy and safety are recorded. The final control for assessing the tolerance and efficacy of the trial medication is conducted along with a physical examination after an observation period of 12 months.In this study, diarrhea is defined as increase of stool frequency to &gt;3 watery or loose stools in 24 hours on at least two or more consecutive days.The prophylaxis against gastrointestinal infections with EcN-Suspension is expected to result in a decrease of the number episodes of diarrhea in comparison to the untreated control.
