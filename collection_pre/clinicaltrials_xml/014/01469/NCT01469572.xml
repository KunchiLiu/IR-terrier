	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see the safety and activity of using pasireotide, everolimus and radioembolization (Selective Internal Radioembolization Therapy-SIRT) in the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors (carcinoid) that has spread to the liver. Both everolimus or radioembolization are considered "standard of care" regimens in patients with liver lesions from neuroendocrine tumors. However, the use of the combination of everolimus and radioembolization has not been formally evaluated in the setting of a clinical trial. Pasireotide is a medication that is intended to block the hormonal secretions from the neuroendocrine tumors. This study is divided into two parts. In the first part, the aim of the study is to determine the safety of combining everolimus, pasireotide, and radioembolization. For this part of the study the investigators will enroll up to 18 patients. After the investigators confirm the safety of the combination, they will conduct the second part of the study which will focus on evaluating the effectiveness of the combination. For this part of the study the investigators intend to enroll a total of 37 patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Liver metastasis remain a major challenge in the care of patients with Neuroendocrine Tumors (NET). This study is evaluating the combination of systemic therapies plus radioembolization for the treatment of liver metastasis from NET. The study allows pancreatic and intestinal NET that have spread to the liver.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Confirmed low to intermediate grade neuroendocrine tumors with unresectable liver metastasis 2. Patients must have evidence of disease progression by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) despite optimal octreotide therapy (octreotide long acting release [LAR] 30 mg every month) 3. Prior treatment permitted include: surgery, prior systemic therapies (≤ 2 prior lines of chemotherapy), or radiation therapy 4. Patients must have measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria 5. For the patients in the phase Ib study, neuroendocrine tumor must involve both liver lobes 6. Minimum of four weeks since any major surgery, completion of radiation, or completion of all prior systemic anticancer therapy (adequately recovered from the acute toxicities of any prior therapy) 7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2 8. Adequate bone marrow function as shown by: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelets greater than or equal to 100 x 10^9/L Hb greater than 9 g/dL 9. Adequate liver function as shown by: Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5x ULN (≤ 3x ULN in patients with liver metastases) 10. International normalized ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 (anticoagulation is allowed if target INR ≤ 1.5 on a stable dose of warfarin) 11. Patient receiving low molecular weight (LMW) heparin on stable therapeutic dose for more than 2 weeks or with factor Xa level &lt; 1.1 U/mL can be enrolled if LMW heparin can be safely discontinued at least 24 hours prior to invasive vascular procedures (angiography and SIRsphere administration) 12. Adequate renal function: serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN 13. Fasting serum cholesterol ≤ 300 mg/dL OR ≤ 7.75 mmol/L AND fasting triglycerides ≤ 2.5 x ULN. NOTE: In case one or both of these thresholds are exceeded, the patient can only be included after initiation of appropriate lipid lowering medication. 14. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days of the administration of the first study treatment. Women must not be lactating. Both men and women of childbearing potential must be advised of the importance of using effective birth control measures during the course of the study. 15. Signed informed consent to participate in the study must be obtained from patients after they have been fully informed of the nature and potential risks by the investigator (or his/her designee) with the aid of written information. 1. Evidence of ascites, cirrhosis, portal hypertension or portal vein thrombosis 2. Prior radiation to the upper abdomen 3. Contraindications to angiography 4. Patients with extensive tumor replacement of the liver defined as tumor volume &gt; 50% of liver 5. Lung shunt ≥ 20% 6. Prior treatment with any investigational drug within the preceding 4 weeks 7. Patients receiving chronic, systemic treatment with corticosteroids or another immunosuppressive agent. Topical or inhaled corticosteroids are allowed. 8. Patients should not receive immunization with attenuated live vaccines within one week of study entry or during study period. Close contact with those who have received attenuated live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with everolimus. Examples of live vaccines include intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, bacillus CalmetteGuerin (BCG), yellow fever, varicella and TY21a typhoid vaccines. 9. Uncontrolled brain or leptomeningeal metastases, including patients who continue to require glucocorticoids for brain or leptomeningeal metastases 10. Other malignancies within the past 3 years except for adequately treated carcinoma of the cervix or basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin 11.
