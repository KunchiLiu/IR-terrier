	<brief_summary>The main objective of the study is to explore and map brain areas involved in sensory perception and multisensory integration in patients with central or peripheral neurological damage. The investigators hypothesize for example, that a change (compare to healthy subjects) in the perceptual maps and body representation could be detected and characterize in patients suffering from impairments of peripheral nerve conduction.</brief_summary>
