	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if lubiprostone may change the rate of movement of food and activities in the stomach and intestines in subjects whose gastrointestinal (GI) tract is slower due to constipation. To be able to measure the time difference in the duration of transit of the FDA approved SmartPill capsule in all segments of gastrointestinal (GI) tract before and after exposure to lubiprostone. The investigators anticipate to capture the possibility to reduce/eliminate the small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in chronically constipated patients after administration of study drug- lubiprostone.</brief_summary>
