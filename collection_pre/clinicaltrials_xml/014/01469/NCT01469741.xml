	<brief_summary>Cognitive impairment is common among non-demented individuals with Parkinson disease (PD) and is a significant source of disability and reduced quality of life. Unfortunately, there are no successful interventions to address these impairments. Prospective memory impairment is a particularly functionally- and clinically-relevant problem in PD. The investigator's project will determine if a targeted intervention strategy improves PD participants' prospective memory. The investigator's goal is to improve PD patients' everyday prospective memory so they can successfully perform desired activities and roles.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rehabilitation of Everyday Memory Impairment in Parkinson Disease: A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive impairment is common among non-demented individuals with Parkinson disease (PD) and is a significant source of disability and reduced quality of life. Unfortunately, there are no successful interventions to address these impairments. Prospective memory impairment is a particularly functionally- and clinically-relevant problem in PD. The investigator's project will determine if a targeted intervention strategy improves PD participants' prospective memory. The investigator will use a randomized controlled design and a laboratory-based assessment of prospective memory to test the effect of the strategy in a controlled environment. The investigator will also see if PD participants, with support from an occupational therapist (OT), can generalize the strategy to their complex, real-world environments and tasks. Our goal is to improve PD patients' everyday prospective memory so they can successfully perform desired activities and roles.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants will be males and females over age 50 who meet criteria for idiopathic typical PD, are Hoehn &amp; Yahr39 stage IIII (mildmoderate disease) and are treated with levodopa/carbidopa. Possible dementia, treatment with certain medications that interfere with cognition (e.g., anticholinergics), change in medications over the study period, other neurological disorders, brain surgery (e.g., STN DBS), history of psychotic disorder or significant current psychiatric disorder, or any condition that would interfere with testing (e.g., vision problems).</criteria>
