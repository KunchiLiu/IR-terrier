	<brief_title>Parenting a Child With Autism Spectrum Disorder and Marital Status</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are lifelong neurodevelopmental disorders involving a triad of impairments in communication and social reciprocity and increases in repetitive/restricted interests and behaviors. ASD includes: autistic disorder, Asperger's syndrome, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), Rett's syndrome, and childhood disintegrative disorder as pervasive developmental disorders (American Psychiatric Association [DSM-IV-TR], 2000). Few disabilities appear to be more taxing on parents than ASDs.Parents of children with ASD fare worse on a variety of measures of well-being than parents of children without disabilities as well as parents of children with other types of disabilities. Studies investigating the impact of a child with disabilities, specifically ASD, are inconclusive. However, parents of children with ASD may be at increased risk for divorce due to a variety of personal and disability related factors. In Israel the relationship of having a child with autism on the probability of divorce has not been tested yet. The aim of this study is to profile this relationship and determine the magnitude and directionality of the effect raising ASD children has on the resilience of the institution of marriage and the satisfaction both partners derive. This will be tested using a short telephone survey.</detailed_description>
