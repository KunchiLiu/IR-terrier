	<brief_summary>A pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics study to complement the current knowledge of tacrolimus prolonged release (Advagraf速) in the immediate post-transplantation period and at steady-state (M3 post transplantation) and to improve the optimal dose of Advagraf速 based on tacrolimus AUC estimated by two Limited Samples Strategies during the first 3 months after renal transplantation. Data obtained with tacrolimus prolonged release will be compared with those of tacrolimus immediate release (Prograf速)</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multicentre open-labeled randomized pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacogenetic (PG) study to compare Advagraf and Prograf immediate post-transplantation (Day 8) and steady-state (Day 84) systemic exposure. Tacrolimus PK profile, tacrolimus systemic exposure assessed by Limited Samples Strategies (LSS) (i.e.: Bayesian estimators (BE) and Multilinear Regressions (MLR)), and impact of CYP3A5 and ABCB1 genetic polymorphisms on tacrolimus PK will also be determined to improve the optimal dose of Advagraf速 for kidney transplant patients.</detailed_description>
