	<brief_summary>This study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of multiple interferon-free treatment regimens of sofosbuvir (Sovaldiâ„¢; GS-7977; PSI-7977) and GS-0938 (PSI-352938) alone and in combination, with and without ribavirin (RBV). Each regimen was to be evaluated over 12 and 24 weeks to identify the optimal duration of therapy to maximize the benefit (sustained virologic response [SVR]) versus risk (safety and resistance).</brief_summary>
