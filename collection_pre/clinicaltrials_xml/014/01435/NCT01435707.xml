	<brief_summary>There has been no reports of the effect of various kinds of steroid or various dose of steroid which are commonly used in the clinical setting. Previous studies have simply shown that the blood glucose level is elevated in diabetes patients and did not show or suggest the adequate strategy of epidural steroid injection in diabetes patients regarding steroid type, dosage or injection interval. Therefore, the investigators tried to evaluate the effect of different dosage of triamcinolone, which is a commonly used steroid in epidural steroid injection, on the blood glucose level.</brief_summary>
