CD4+ lymphocyte cell count obtained within 28 days prior to study entry at a DAIDSapproved laboratory. Certain laboratory values, as defined in the protocol, obtained within 14 days prior to study entry. Cardiac ejection fraction of greater than or equal to 50% obtained within 14 days prior to study entry. Female study volunteers of reproductive potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL performed within 24 hours before initiating the protocolspecified medications. All participants must agree not to participate in a conception process (active attempt to become pregnant or to impregnate, donate sperm, in vitro fertilization). If participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, participant must agree that two reliable forms of contraceptives will be used simultaneously while receiving protocolspecified medications, and for 6 weeks after stopping the medications.

Ability to swallow oral medications and adequate venous access. Karnofsky performance status ≥ 60 within 28 days prior to entry. Ability and willingness of participant or legal guardian/representative to provide informed consent. Exclusion Criteria for Step 1: Current chronic, acute, or recurrent serious infections for which the participant has not completed at least 14 days of therapy prior to Step 2 entry and/or is not clinically stable. Serious illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization within 14 days prior to entry. Current or history of known pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, bronchiectasis, or diffuse or significant local radiographic interstitial infiltrates on chest xray (CXR) or computed axial tomography (CAT). Oxygen saturation less than 90% and/or exercise desaturation greater than 4% within 14 days prior to study enrollment. Grade ≥3 peripheral neuropathy (PN) at entry. Breastfeeding. Receipt of ART for more than 28 days immediately prior to entry. Prior or current systemic or locally administered chemotherapy. Prior or current radiation therapy. Prior or current immunotherapy, e.g., interferon alfa. Corticosteroid use at doses above those given as replacement therapy for adrenal insufficiency within the last 30 days prior to study entry. Any immunomodulator, HIV vaccine, live attenuated vaccines, or other investigational therapy or investigational vaccine within 30 days prior to study entry. Known allergy/sensitivity or any hypersensitivity to components of study drugs or their formulation. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that would interfere with adherence to study requirements. Current or anticipated receipt of any of the prohibited medications listed in section 5.5.2 of the protocol.
