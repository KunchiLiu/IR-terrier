	<brief_summary>Patients attending the University Hospital Coventry UK with a broken wrist requiring an operation, will be invited to enter the study. At the first visit, they will have an xray of the wrist and will be asked to complete a number of questionnaires. The questions are to determine if they normally have pain in the wrist and how well they can perform their daily activities. The patient will then have an operation, and the fracture in the wrist will be held in the correct position with either a metal plate and screws or wires. At 6 weeks following the operation the patient will be reassessed and an xray will be taken. At 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after the operation patients will perform tests to assess the strength of their grip, pinch and movement of their wrist. In addition they will complete the the same questionnaires from their first visit. At the 12 month visit patients will have another xray.</brief_summary>
