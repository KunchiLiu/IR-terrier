	<brief_title>Intravenous Iron in Gynecologic Cancer Patients Receiving Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anemia is a common condition during chemotherapy administration. Treatment options usually include oral iron supplementation and blood transfusion. However, oral iron has gastrointestinal side effects, which affects patient compliance, and only a small amount of oral iron can be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Intravenous iron may overcome a block of iron absorption and iron recycling induced by hepcidin. Therefore, it may increase hemoglobin level and reduced blood transfusion in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
