	<brief_summary>Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is potential curative therapy for adult acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Based on our previous study, the condition with iv-busulfan (iv-BU) and cyclophosphamide (CTX) is feasible with low toxicity and transplantation mortality and long-term survival is comparable to most data reported with slightly higher relapse rate particularly for patients in CR2. In this study, the investigators aim to further improve the conditioning with Fludarabine + iv-BU and to use CTX after stem cell transfusion as consolidation for ALL and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fludarabine/Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide Conditioning for Adult ALL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with adult acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) received conditioning with Fludarabine + iv-BU. The GVHD was consisting of D+3 and D+4 CTX after stem cell transfusion. CSA will be added for all patients after D+5.</detailed_description>
