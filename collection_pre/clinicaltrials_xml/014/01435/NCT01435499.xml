	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of administering an allogeneic GM-CSF-secreting lethally irradiated whole melanoma cell vaccine ("melanoma GVAX"), alone or in combination with low dose cyclophosphamide (CPM), for the adjuvant treatment of patients with surgically resected stage IIB-IV melanoma. Secondarily, the investigators will assess in vitro correlates of anti-melanoma immunization by melanoma GVAX, including serological and cellular immune responses in patients treated with either the vaccine alone or the vaccine given with low dose CPM.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Any patient age â‰¥18 years with melanoma of cutaneous or mucosal origin, and with clinicopathologic stage IIB, IIC, III or IV that has been completely resected Patients must be able to provide informed consent. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Life expectancy of at least 6 months. Adequate hematologic function. Adequate renal function Adequate hepatic function Patients of both genders must agree to practice effective birth control during the study period and for at least 4 weeks after the last treatment. Patients whose primary site of melanoma is ocular. Are undergoing or have undergone in the past 4 weeks any systemic treatment for melanoma. Are undergoing or have undergone in the past 2 weeks any surgery or focal radiation therapy. Have active systemic infections, coagulation disorders (including therapeutic anticoagulation), or other major medical or psychiatric illnesses. Are known to be positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, antiHepatitis C Virus or antiHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) antibody (because of possible immune effects of these conditions). Documented history of autoimmune disease, for example, systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, rheumatoid arthritis, glomerulonephritis, or vasculitis. Any form of primary or secondary immunodeficiency. This would include hereditary disorders such as ataxiatelangiectasia or WiskottAldrich syndrome, or acquired immune deficiencies such as following bone marrow transplantation. Requirement for systemic steroid therapy or immunosuppressive therapy. Have received any type of cancer immunotherapy, including but not limited to interleukin2, interferon alfa or melanoma vaccines. Have been diagnosed with another invasive cancer within the past 3 years. Radiographic evidence of melanoma recurrence. Pregnant or lactating women. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to GMCSF, pentastarch, hetastarch, corn, Dimethyl sulfoxide, fetal bovine serum or trypsin (porcine origin).</criteria>
