	<brief_title>Strength At Home: Veterans' Program (PTSD-Focused Therapy for Anger and Relationship Conflict Among OEF/OIF Veterans)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this project is to develop, standardize, and test an intervention for combat veterans exposed to trauma who engage in intimate partner aggression (IPA). This intervention, formerly labeled PTSD-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Partner Violence (PFCBT), and currently called the Strength at Home, Veteran's Program, incorporates components of interventions for IPA and trauma and will target mechanisms implicated in the relationship between trauma and IPA. This project addresses a number of the research gaps in this area of research including: (a) the development of a novel treatment approach to improve functioning and well-being of affected individuals; (b) tertiary prevention (of repeated IPA) during re-integration; and (c) examination of the efficacy of a program providing support for the families and caregivers of veterans with combat history.</detailed_description>
