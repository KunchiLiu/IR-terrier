	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a Brief Motivational Intervention (BMI), in reducing alcohol consumption among patients with hazardous or harmful drinking admitted in emergency department (ED). Patients aged 16 to 24 and who tested positive for blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.5g/l. or above are enrolled. Patients receive either an information leaflet or an information leaflet plus a referral to a psychologist. BMI is provided by the psychologist. BMI consists in a first face-to-face interview (35-45 minutes) plus a telephone interview, at 1 and 2 months. Minors' parents are also invited to attend the BMI session. If necessary, patients can be referred to relevant care and treatment services for alcohol misuse. In a simple blind, randomised controlled clinical trial of 280 patients, 140 patients are allocated to the treatment group and 140 to the control group. Randomisation is stratified according to patient's age (16-17 or 18-24). Opaque and sealed randomized envelops are used for randomisation. Alcohol consumption is measured by self-report at 3 months. The principal criteria used to assess the reduction of alcohol use at 3 months follow-up is the number of alcoholic drinks in the last week. Other events such as ED readmission, quarrels related to alcohol, drinking and driving, sexual intercourse without protection will also be assessed. It is the first clinical trial in France comparing these two interventions among young patients in ED with this design.</brief_summary>
