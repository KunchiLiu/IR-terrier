	<brief_summary>Randomized controlled trial using two types of hip stems, SL PLUS MIA (control group) and SL PLUS (study group). We compare primary and secondary stability of both hip stems for radiographic outcome using EBRA (Ein-Bild-Roentgen-Analyse) after a two year follow-up period. Further, we compare all differences in clinical outcome using Harris Hip Score, Oxford hip score and radiographic findings.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of the SL PLUS and the SL PLUS MIA Hip Stem</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a monocentric study, randomized and controlled including two types of hip stems: SL PLUS MIA (control group) and SL PLUS (study group). Each group will include 45 patients where a number of 5 patients for each group calculated extra in case of loss. Patients will be followed after - 6 weeks - 6 months - 12 months - 24 months. Radiographs are taken in a-p and lateral view using a standard protocol. Primary and secondary stability of both hip stems will be analyzed using the EBRA software (Ein-Bild-Roentgen-Analyse, University of Innsbruck, Austria) after the completion of the two year follow-up. Further, we compare all differences in clinical outcome using Harris Hip Score, Oxford hip score and radiographic findings such as radiolucent lines.</detailed_description>
