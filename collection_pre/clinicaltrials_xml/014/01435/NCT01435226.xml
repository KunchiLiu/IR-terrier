	<criteria>Age ≥18 years with chronic HCV infection Liver biopsy results ≤ 3 years prior to screening indicating the absence of cirrhosis. Alternatively, a noninvasive procedure conducted within 6 months of screening is permitted in countries where allowed Monoinfection with HCV genotype (GT) 1a or 1b HCV RNA ≥ 104 IU/mL at screening Prior treatment and adherence with one course of pegylated interferon alfa and RBV The subject's medical records must include sufficient detail of prior treatment with pegylated interferon alfa and RBV (start/stop dates and viral response) to allow for categorization of prior response as either null, partial, breakthrough or relapse. Body mass index (BMI) 1840 kg/m2 inclusive Screening ECG without clinically significant abnormalities and with QTcF interval (QT corrected using Fridericia's formula) ≤ 450 msec for males and ≤ 470 msec for females. Agree to use two forms of highly effective contraception for the duration of the study and for 7 months after the last dose of study medication. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and baseline. Discontinuation of prior treatment with pegylated interferon alfa and RBV due to an adverse event, toxicity reasons or were lost to followup History of significant cardiac disease Exceed criteria delineated in Section 4.2 for laboratory measure thresholds related to leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Diagnosis of autoimmune disease, decompensated liver disease, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, significant psychiatric illness, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatocellular carcinoma or other malignancy (with exception of certain resolved skin cancers), hemoglobinopathy, retinal disease, or are immunosuppressed. Current abuse of amphetamines, cocaine, opiates, or alcohol. Methadone use is not allowed, however stable buprenorphine maintenance treatment for ≥ 6 months is permitted.</criteria>
