	<brief_summary>Different lowing blood pressure strategies have a different clinical efficacies. Blocking the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (Telmisartan) reduces the incidence of episodes of atrial fibrillation in hypertensive patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation during 24 months than 30% compared to Nifedipine( Adalat GITS ). A total of 160 subjects will be included in two study groups. The Group 1 will receive 80-160mg Telmisartan per day, the remaining patients will receive Nifedipine ( Adalat GITS). Follow-up is 24 months. The conventional 12-lead ECG recordings at twice weeks interval and 24hrs holter monitor will determine the cardiac rhythm and asymptomatic episodes of atrial fibrillation. The target of Blood pressure after 3 months is less than 130/80mmHg. Concomitant therapy with B-blocker and acethydrazide are allowed for the target blood pressure during the study.</brief_summary>
