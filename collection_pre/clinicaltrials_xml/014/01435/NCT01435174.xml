	<brief_summary>End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients often develop cardiovascular complications, and cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in this population. Ranolazine's ability to treat angina without reducing heart rate or blood pressure makes it an important option for ESRD patients. The hemodialysis clearance of ranolazine is unknown. A single-dose pharmacokinetic study is needed to characterize ranolazine and its metabolites in ESRD patients on and off hemodialysis. Results of the proposed study will provide initial dosing estimates for a follow-up, multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study in this population.</brief_summary>
