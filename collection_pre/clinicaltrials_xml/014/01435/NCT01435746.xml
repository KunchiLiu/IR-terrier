	<brief_summary>The objective of this trial is to evaluate different transfusion strategies in patients after liver transplantation. Patients in the experimental arm will be given red blood cell (RBC) transfusion according to a liberal strategy, i. e., transfusions should be given, when hemoglobin concentration falls below 10 g/dl, and hemoglobin concentration should be maintained between 10 and 12 g/dl. Patients in the control arm will be given red blood cell (RBC) transfusion according to a restrictive strategy, i. e., transfusions should be given, when hemoglobin concentration falls below 8 g/dl, and hemoglobin concentration should be maintained between 8 and 10 g/dl.</brief_summary>
