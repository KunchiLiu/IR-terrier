	<brief_summary>In this project, the investigators will test the hypothesis that predominant (two to three times a week 60 min) strength training is more effective in reducing visceral fat mass than endurance training in obese patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Different Exercise Training Regimens on Visceral Fat Dynamic and Resting Energy Expenditure in Obese Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Strength training (ST) was shown to be more effective than endurance training (ET) in improving glycemic control in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. However, it is unknown, whether different training strategies have different effects on the preferential visceral adipose tissue reduction and changes in resting energy expenditure in a population with abdominal obesity. We will therefore compare ST and ET (two to three times a week, 60 minutes per training session) in addition to a restricted energy intake of 1500kcal per day for women and 1800kcal per day for men in a prospective study of 200 individuals with abdominal obesity defined by a waist circumference &gt; 102 cm for males and &gt; 88 cm for females and a BMI &gt; 35 kg/mÂ² with regard to: 1. Abdominal visceral adipose tissue area dynamic (MRI studies) 2. Abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue area dynamic (MRI studies) 3. Total body fat mass changes (bioelectrical impedance analysis) 4. Changes in resting energy expenditure (indirect calorimetry) 5. Changes in parameters of glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity and lipid profile 6. Changes in circulating adipokines and markers of inflammation In addition, we will search for novel serum parameters, which predict the individual training response by a serum metabolomics/ proteomics approach.</detailed_description>
