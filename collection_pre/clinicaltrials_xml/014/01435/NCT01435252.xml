	<brief_summary>Sixty patients with advanced squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck will be enrolled in this study. Patients are treated with standard chemoradiation in combination with concurrent add-on cetuximab. Subsequently patients are randomized to cetuximab consolidation therapy (three months, Arm A) versus no consolidation therapy (Arm B). The aim of this study is to investigate if cetuximab consolidation therapy improves the 2-year locoregional control rate. - Trial with medicinal product - Trial with radiotherapy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study In Patients With Advanced Head And Neck Cancer Of Standard Chemoradiation And Add-On Cetuximab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical study translates our preclinical findings that concurrent and consolidation cetuximab improves efficacy of RT into the clinic. It is a phase II, randomized, open-label, single center study in patients with locoregionally advanced stage III-IV and/or total gross tumor volume (tGTV) &gt; 70cc head and neck cancer. This study population is at high risk for locoregional recurrence after chemoradiation alone. Tumor stages to be included are T3-4 Nx, Tx N2b-N3 (N2b only if ≥ 3 ipsilateral nodes involved) M0 and/or tGTV &gt;70 cc (any T, any N, M0) squamous cell cancers of the head and neck (HNSCC). All patients will receive in, the so called 'Induction Phase' standard chemoradiation (RT up to 70 Gy in combination with weekly CDDP 40 mg/m2) and add-on concurrent cetuximab (loading Dose 400 mg/m2, concurrent dose 250 mg/m2 weekly). The patients are randomized to either add-on consolidation cetuximab (500 mg/m2 biweekly x 6 over 12 weeks) (Arm A) or no further treatment (Arm B). Randomization will take place after Induction Phase. The total number of patients to be included into the study is 60 (30 patients per arm). Up to 6 patients may be replaced in case of early drop out to reach that aim. The sample size of 60 patients is considered to be sufficient to collect first information on clinical efficacy and the possible impact of various biomarkers on clinical endpoints. If the results of this study will demonstrate that the novel treatment regimen is safe and efficacious, a randomized multicenter phase III study will follow.</detailed_description>

Exclusion criteria: Cancer of the nasopharynx Any neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to screening Treatment with other investigational drugs within 4 weeks History of malignancy other than basal cell skin cancer unless disease free for a minimum of 3 years. Uncontrolled claudication, bleeding, or thromboembolic disorders at screening Patients receiving heparin, warfarin or phenprocoumon therapy are ineligible Uncontrolled and severe hypertension at screening according to the judgement of the investigator. Current uncontrolled cardiac disease: Unstable angina, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure, history of myocardial infarction within 12 months, significant arrhythmias Left ventricular function &lt; 45 % (determination of left ventricular function required when history of cardiac disease) History of stroke within 6 months Major surgical procedure, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to screening; anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study. Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at screening Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy at screening Pregnant (positive pregnancy test) or lactating Previous organ transplantation Any immune suppressive therapy Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) based upon current CDC definition because study treatment might be immunosuppressive (Note: HIV testing only required if clinically indicated) Any uncontrolled condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the safe and timely completion of study procedures. Preexisting renal insufficiency with impaired creatinine clearance (&lt;60ml/min) and/or increased plasma creatinine (&gt;106 µmol/l) at screening History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra abdominal abscess within 6 months prior to screening Serious, nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture AST, ALT, or bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x normal Preexisting absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1,800 cells/mm3 Platelets &lt; 100,000 103/µl at screening PTT &gt; 1.5 x normal WBC &lt; 4000 103/µl Hb &lt; 11 g/dl at screening (Note: The use of transfusion or other intervention to achieve Hb &gt; 11 g/dl is possible) Contraindication to CDDP Known allergy to cetuximab</criteria>
