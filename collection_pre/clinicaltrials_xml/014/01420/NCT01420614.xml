	<brief_summary>Prospective, randomized, multi-center trial comparing the safety and efficacy in the prevention of net adverse clinical outcomes (NACE) of transfemoral vs. transradial approach for the treatment of patients with ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (STEACS) undergoing primary angioplasty</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RadIal Versus Femoral InvEstigation in ST Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective, randomized, double arm study. The study population will include all consecutive patients presenting with a ST-elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome and candidates for primary percutaneous coronary intervention, who agree and provide written informed consent for the study. Before arterial stick for percutaneous access, patients will be randomized according to sealed numbered envelopes. Subsequently, arterial access will be obtained and the diagnostic/interventional procedure will be performed according to routine clinical practice, leaving ancillary medications, choice of devices and means of hemostasis at the physician's discretion. In the randomization process all participating centers will be equally stratified to avoid statistical unbalance.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subject is &gt;18 years old with recent acute STelevation acute coronary syndrome (STEACS) requiring emergent coronary angiography. 2. Patient has no contraindication to percutaneous arterial access by both and transfemoral route. 3. Subject has been informed of the nature of the study and agrees to its provisions and has provided written informed consent as approved by the Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee of the respective clinical site. 4. Patient and the treating physician agree that the subject will comply with all followup evaluations. 1. Subject's age is &lt;18 years and he has no acute STelevation myocardial infarction (ST elevation of a least 0.1 mV in ≥2 extremity leads or at least 0.2 mV in ≥2 precordial leads). 2.
