	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether re-feeding of gastric residuals reduces the time needed to establish full enteral feedings in premature infants. Infants with gestational ages 23-28 weeks at birth will be randomized within one week to receive either gastric residuals or fresh formula or breastmilk whenever significant residuals during feeding advancement require clinical assessment for continuing feedings. Primary outcome measure is time to establish full enteral feedings (120cc/kg/day).</brief_summary>
