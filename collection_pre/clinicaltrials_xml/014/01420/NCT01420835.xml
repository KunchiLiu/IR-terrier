	<brief_title>Chinese Auriculotherapy on Stress and Quality of Life in Nursing Professionals: Randomized Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based on the positive results achieved in a preliminary study conducted in January and February 2010, entitled "Applicability of auricular needles or seeds for the reduction of stress in nursing professionals" at the University Hospital, emerged from this research project in order to extend the first study, with a more representative sample and with a design that would allow further discussions on the effectiveness of Chinese auricular needles semi-permanent to reduce stress and thereby improving the quality of life of nursing professionals. This clinical trial aims, above all, compare the results of the technique with the use of closed protocol and a group without protocol. The latter, however, shall be based on energy evaluation according to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and the course of treatment will be performed similarly to the clinical practice commonly performed by traditional practitioners, that is, individually, not necessarily repetitive and whose continuation is achieved depending on the answers to each treatment. Discussions are justified about protocol and no protocol research in complementary and integrative practices, since the methodologies proposed and accepted by the scientific community does not always seem to be appropriate tools for evaluating therapies like those coming from the East. The transfer of the Western conception of research according to positivist principles are not always consistent with the principles underlying the complementary and alternative therapies, and in particular the practice from China.</detailed_description>
