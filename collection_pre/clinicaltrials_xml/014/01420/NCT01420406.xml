	<brief_summary>The study will assess the relative bioavailability and bioefficacy of cryptoxanthin (CX) and beta-carotene (BC) from food sources for increasing breast milk carotenoid and retinol concentrations in lactating Bangladeshi women.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin A Bioavailability in Lactating Women With Marginal Vitamin A Status</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aim is to compare the effects of orange-fleshed sweet potatoes and tangerines compared to white-fleshed sweet potatoes and vitamin A as retinyl palmitate on blood and breast milk cryptoxanthin (CX), beta-carotene (BC), and vitamin A (VA) concentrations by randomly assigning lactating Bangladeshi women to one of four treatment groups for 6 days/week for 3 weeks. The investigators will also compare the relative vitamin A (VA) value of BC and CX from food sources by comparing the mean change in breast milk retinol concentrations of the groups that receive tangerines (CX) or orange-fleshed sweet potatoes (BC) with the mean change in breast milk retinol of the group that receives retinyl palmitate.</detailed_description>
