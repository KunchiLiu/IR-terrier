	<brief_summary>The investigators want to examine if specific acetabular liner designs can be a contributing factor to audible squeaking associated with CoC bearings. The aim of the present study is to compare two different designed and well documented acetabular component systems with reference to squeaking and other noises from the hip.</brief_summary>
