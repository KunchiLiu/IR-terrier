	<brief_title>Maxi-Analgesic Osteoarthritis (OA) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis is a significant and disabling disease in the developed world. Published guidelines for medical management of osteoarthritis from expert groups, in general advocate acetaminophen as first line treatment. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) guidelines (1)recommend acetaminophen should be first choice therapy in OA, and that NSAIDs should be reserved for those patients unresponsive to acetaminophen. The American College of Rheumatology Guidelines (2) recommend acetaminophen be considered as reasonable initial therapy in patients with mild to moderate OA pain and that NSAIDs be considered as an initial alternative in moderate to severe OA pain. The Canadian guidelines recommend acetaminophen for mild OA pain and NSAIDs for moderate to severe OA (3). A Cochrane Review of acetaminophen in osteoarthritis concluded that NSAIDs were superior to acetaminophen for improving knee and hip pain in people with OA. However, it was noted that the size of the treatment effect was modest with NSAIDs appearing to be more effective in OA subjects with moderate-to-severe pain (4). There are many situations in clinical practice where either acetaminophen alone or low dose ibuprofen is not sufficiently effective. In these cases the dose of acetaminophen cannot be increased to more than 4000mg/day due to toxicity concerns. In the case of ibuprofen the dose can be increased from 1200mg/day to 2400mg/day. However comparison of low dose ibuprofen with high dose showed gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity increased: the relative risk (RR) of GI complications increased from 1.6 (95% CI 0.8, 3.2) with low dose ibuprofen to 4.2 (95% CI 1.8, 9.8) with high dose ibuprofen (5). Ibuprofen is associated with a low risk of serious gastrointestinal complications, but this advantage is probably lost at doses above 1800 mg/day (6). A simple combination treatment whereby both acetaminophen and ibuprofen can be taken together as one single tablet and at the same time each day would, if effective, have the advantage of increasing analgesia without having to raise the ibuprofen dose above 1200mg/day (1170mg if administered every 6 hours) and lose the improved safety profile associated with a lower dose of ibuprofen. 1.
