	<brief_title>Tai Chi and Aerobic Exercise for Fibromyalgia (FMEx)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic musculoskeletal pain syndrome that causes substantial physical and psychological impairment and costs over $25 billion annually. Current pharmacological therapies may be expensive, cause serious adverse effects, and fail to effectively improve pain and function. Finding new and effective non-pharmacological treatments for FM patients is urgently needed. We propose to conduct the first comparative effectiveness trial of Tai Chi vs. aerobic exercise (a recommended component of the current standard of care) and to evaluate effectiveness under different Tai Chi dosing schedules in a large FM population. We aim to (1) demonstrate that, compared to aerobic exercise, Tai Chi is a more effective intervention for managing the pain and improving the functional limitations that impact quality of life for FM patients, and 2) determine the optimal frequency and duration of a supervised Tai Chi intervention in relation to short and long-term effectiveness. To achieve this goal, we will conduct a single-blind, randomized controlled trial of Tai Chi vs. aerobic exercise in 216 patients who meet the American College of Rheumatology criteria for FM. Patients will be randomized to one of four Tai Chi intervention groups: 12 or 24 weeks of supervised Tai Chi given once or twice per week, or a supervised aerobic exercise control: 2x/week for 24 weeks. All groups will have a 52-week follow-up. The primary outcome will be the FM Impact Questionnaire total score at 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes include the measures of widespread pain, functional performance, psychological functioning, self-efficacy, sleep quality, and quality of life at 12, 24, and 52 weeks. Successful completion of the proposed study will determine the ideal regimen of Tai Chi and demonstrate that Tai Chi can be a simple, effective, and durable treatment for this therapeutically challenging disorder.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 21 years or older. Fulfills the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 classification criteria for FM: (1) a history of widespread musculoskeletal pain on the right and left sides of the body as well as above and below the waist for a minimum duration of 3 months, and (2) pain in 11 or more of 18 specific tender points with moderate or greater tenderness reported upon digital palpation.27 Fulfills the ACR 2010 diagnostic criteria for FM: (WPI ≥7 AND SS ≥5) OR (WPI 36 AND SS ≥9) and does not have a disorder that would otherwise explain the pain28 Willing to complete the 12week or 24week study, including once or twiceaweek exercise sessions. Willing to abstain from Tai Chi or other new formalized exercise programs until completion of the study if randomized to the Aerobic Exercise. Willing to abstain from Aerobic Exercise or other new formalized exercise programs until completion of the study if randomized to Tai Chi Prior experience with Tai Chi or other similar types of Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the past 1 year such as Qi gong and yoga since these share some of the principles of Tai Chi. Dementia, neurological disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, metabolic disease, renal disease, liver disease, or other serious medical conditions limiting ability to participate in the Tai Chi or Aerobic Exercise programs, as determined by the study physicians. Any other diagnosed medical condition known to contribute to FM symptomatology that is not under adequate control for the study period such as thyroid disease, inflammatory arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, myositis, vasculitis or Sjogren's syndrome. Inability to pass the MiniMental Status examination (with a score below 24) 29 Enrollment in any other clinical trial within the last 30 days Plan to permanently relocate from the region during the trial period Positive urine pregnancy test at baseline or planning pregnancy within the study period Not EnglishSpeaking: English is the only language to be used during the exercise training program. Our selfreported outcome measures are obtained from validated Englishversion questionnaires. In addition, using other languages would likely require separate classes, recruitment and instructors which are beyond our current study scope</criteria>
