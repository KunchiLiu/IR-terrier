	<brief_summary>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, degenerative disease described by motors and non-motors symptoms. Changes in swallowing and respiratory dynamics increase risk of tracheal aspiration largely responsible for increased morbidity and mortality in this population. Thus, interdisciplinary rehabilitation strategies can reduce the complications of dysphagia, with consequent improvement of the prognosis of individuals with PD. Objective: To determine the impact of combined oral motor exercises and breathing exercises on swallowing disorders in individuals with PD. Method: Clinical trial, randomized and blinded for the examinator. For all subjects will be given the stage of PD and applied quality of life questionnaire. The swallowing complaints will be investigated through structured questionnaire and functional aspects of swallowing with videofluoroscopy. The Manovacuometry Spirometry will determine measures of respiratory function. The assessment of vocal and speech disorders will be done with perceptive, acoustic, aerodynamic and electroglottographic measures as well as analysis of intelligibility. Three groups of intervention will be defined: one of them doing oral motor exercises for swallowing, one doing breathing exercises and another must do this two interventions combined. Effect of intervention will be assessed through measures of swallowing, breathing, voice and speech. The groups will be compared, according to the principle of "intention to treat" by appropriate statistical tests, according to the distribution of the dependent variables.</brief_summary>
