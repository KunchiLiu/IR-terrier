	<criteria>Patients with symptomatic leg ischemia requiring treatment of SFA artery or proximal popliteal artery located within the following parameters: 1 cm from the femoral bifurcation in the SFA 3 cm from the proximal margin of the intercondylar fossa RutherfordBecker Category 25. In patients with bilateral lesions, the highest Rutherford Category limb should be treated. Only 1 leg can be included. Single lesion which can be covered by one stent. Target vessel reference diameter ≥ 4 mm and ≤ 6 mm (by visual estimate) A patent popliteal artery free from significant stenosis (&gt;50%) with at least one patent vessel runoff as confirmed by baseline angiography Signed informed consent. Pregnancy Previous stenting of target lesion Acute ischemia Untreated inflow disease of the ipsilateral pelvic arteries (more than 50% stenosis or occlusion). Inclusion of a patient is allowed in case inflow lesions are successfully treated during the indexprocedure yielding less than 30% diameter stenosis. Significant gastrointestinal bleeding or any coagulopathy that would contraindicate the use of antiplatelet therapy Known intolerance to study medications or contrast agents.</criteria>
