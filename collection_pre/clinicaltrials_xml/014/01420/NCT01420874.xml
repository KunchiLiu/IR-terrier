	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is for the participant to give their own T cells (a type of blood cell in the body that can fight infections and possibly cancer) to them after they have been removed, grown in a lab, and then coated with an experimental drug. This study will determine the highest dose of EGFR2Bi coated T cells that can be given without causing severe side effects. Initially a group of 3 participants will receive the same dose of study drug. If no serious side effects occur, the next group of participants will receive a slightly higher dose of study agent. The following groups of participants will receive higher doses of the study drug until a dose is reached where there are unacceptable side effects and maximum tolerated dose is found, or the planned highest dose level is reached with no side effects.</brief_summary>
