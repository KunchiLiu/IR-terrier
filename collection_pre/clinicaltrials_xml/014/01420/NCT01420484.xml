	<brief_summary>The role of continuous non-invasive arterial pressure (CNAP) in high risk patients with pronounced variation of arterial pressure will be assessed under analgosedation. Therefore, patients will be analyzed during normo-, hypo- and hypertension with standard IAP undergoing elective transfemoral aortic valve implantation procedures. Systolic, diastolic, and mean invasive arterial pressures (IAP) will be compared to those obtained by CNAP. Data will be analysed in different periods of arterial pressure for agreement of the two methods and for determination of precision (i.e. measurement error) and accuracy (i.e. systematic error). Additionally, we will compare both methods regarding the amplitude and time of very fast changes in arterial pressure during intervals of functional cardiac arrests (rapid pacing).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients admitted for elective transfemoral implantation of the aortic valve in analgosedation will be included. The patients' primary diagnosis was severe aortic stenosis, that was defined as a valve area of &lt;1cmÂ² or a mean pressure gradient &gt;50mmHg. an advanced dysfunction of peripheral perfusion (i.e. pronounced arterial peripheral artery occlusive disease or Raynaud's syndrome) arteriovenous shunts for haemodialysis, and vascular surgery of the upper extremities</criteria>
