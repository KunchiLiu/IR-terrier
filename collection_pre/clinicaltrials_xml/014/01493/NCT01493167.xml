	<brief_title>Study on Wood-plastic Composite for Circumferential Casting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An ecologically friendly and biodegradable wood-plastic composite-cast is studied. The purpose of the study is to verify that WOODCAST Circular system performs safely and effectively in its intended use. Patients, who need immobilization of extremity (including for example scaphoid fracture of the wrist or ankle fracture) will be participating in the study. Various casting techniques with novel WOODCAST material will be studied.</detailed_description>
