	<brief_summary>For centuries, light has been a well-known and effective healing method. In the beginning of the 20th century there was a first attempt to condense light energy and distribute it in higher levels, a use that was successfully applied on many soldiers wounded in the Second World War. The laser, which is based on the quantum phenomenon of stimulated emission, was first demonstrated in the beginning of the 1960s and immediately received many applications in all areas of medicine.Many different studies were carried out in the past decade trying to assess the effect of laser therapy on properties of healing wounds. This study aim to assess the efficacy and safety of Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) in the treatment of non-healing diabetic foot ulcers.</brief_summary>
