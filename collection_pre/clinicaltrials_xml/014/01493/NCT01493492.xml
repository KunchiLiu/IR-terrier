	<brief_summary>As a noninvasive examination, urinary proteomics is a very useful tool to identify renal disease. The purpose of the present study was to find differential proteins among patient with SIRS and sepsis(included survivors and non-survivors), and to screen potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis of sepsis and its prognosis. Urinary proteins were identified by iTRAQ labeling and LC-MS/MS. The bioinformatics analysis was performed with the Mascot software and the International Protein Index (IPI) and the Gene Ontology (GO) Database and KEGG pathway Database. The differentially expressed proteins were verified by Western blot by another sample collected from clinical.</brief_summary>
