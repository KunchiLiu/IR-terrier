	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis of ocular hypertension or openangle glaucoma in at least one eye. Be on either latanoprost 0.005% or bimatoprost 0.01% ophthalmic solution monotherapy (including BAKcontaining generics) for at least four weeks prior to Screening visit. Would benefit from a switch to TRAVATAN® Solution without BAK containing Polyquad® Preservative due to tolerability issues, in the opinion of the investigator. IOP considered to be safe (in the opinion of the investigator), in both eyes, in such a way that assured clinical stability of vision and the optic nerve throughout the study period. Willing to discontinue the use of all other ocular hypotensive medications prior to receiving the study medication for the entire course of the study. Best corrected Snellen visual acuity of 6/60 (20/200, 1.0 LogMAR) or better in each eye Other protocoldefined inclusion criteria may apply. Known medical history of allergy, hypersensitivity, or poor tolerance to any component of the preparations to be used in this study deemed clinically significant in the opinion of the Principal Investigator. Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry in either eye. Severe dry eye or related which has been or currently is being treated with the use of punctal plugs, punctal cautery, Restasis®, or topical ocular corticosteroids. Any clinically significant, serious, or severe medical condition. Intraocular conventional surgery or laser surgery in either eye less than three months prior to Screening Visit. Risk of visual field or visual acuity worsening as a consequence of participation in the study, in the investigator's best judgment. Progressive retinal or optic nerve disease from any cause. Women who are pregnant, lactating. Women not using reliable means of birth control. Use of any systemic medication known to affect IOP which has not been on stable course for at least 7 days prior to Screening Visit. Any clinically significant, serious, or severe medical condition. Participation in any other investigational study within 30 days of Screening Visit. Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
