	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of vitamin A and carotenoids on iron absorption in healthy subjects with low and normal vitamin A status. Vitamin A and carotenoids have been reported to enhance the nonheme iron absorption, but the results from human isotope studies are equivocal. Radio-iron studies in Venezuelan adults have consistently reported an increase in iron absorption, whereas stable and radio isotopes studies conducted in Sweden and Switzerland reported no influence. Differences in vitamin A status of the subjects may be a possible explanation for the contradictory findings. In this study, iron absorption will be measured from an iron-fortified maize bread meal with or without retinyl palmitate or β-carotene by using both stable- and radioactive-isotope techniques in Venezuelan women with a range of vitamin A status.</brief_summary>
