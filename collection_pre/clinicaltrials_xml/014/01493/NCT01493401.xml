	<brief_summary>Female urinary incontinence (UI) can be caused by pure stress UI (SUI), pure urgency UI (UUI) and mixed SUI and UUI (MUI). Clinically it might not be that easy to separate MUI and SUI. Patients might perceive urgency when they have an incompetent urethra and a full bladder. Urinary tract nerve growth factor (NGF)is produced by bladder urothelium and smooth muscle. Increased levels of NGF have been reported in the bladder tissue and urine of patients with overactive bladder (OAB). If the urinary levels of NGF differ among women with pure SUI and MUI, then urinary NGF level might be a biomarker in the differential diagnosis of MUI in women. Also, decreased urinary NGF level was reported in OAB patients of whom the symptoms were improved. So, we might expect that the remnant OAB symptom including urgency incontinence can be improved, if the urinary NGF levels decrease after midurethral slings for SUI in MUI patients. We aimed to explore the value of the urinary NGF as a biomarker for differential diagnosis and as a prognostic marker for predicting the improvement of OAB symptom after midurethral slings.</brief_summary>
