	<brief_title>Combining Lesinurad With Allopurinol in Inadequate Responders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allopurinol is the standard of care for the treatment of gout. Nevertheless, most patients treated with allopurinol do not achieve the recommended sUA target of &lt; 6.0 mg/dL and need additional therapy to achieve the target. Probenecid and benzbromarone are URAT1 inhibitors, generally recommended as second-line agents for patients who are either resistant to or intolerant of allopurinol. However, benzbromarone is not available in the US and probenecid is rarely used. Consequently, there is a clear unmet medical need for a new safe and effective therapy for gout, such as lesinurad, a potent URAT1 inhibitor, that can be used in combination with allopurinol in patients not responding adequately to allopurinol monotherapy so that very high rates of response can be achieved by nearly all gout patients, rather than a minority.The subjects selected for this study will have moderate to severe gout with an inadequate response to allopurinol</detailed_description>

Subject who is taking any other approved uratelowering medication that is indicated for the treatment of gout other than allopurinol within 8 weeks of the Screening Visit. Subject who is pregnant or breastfeeding. Subject who consumes more than 14 drinks of alcohol per week (eg, 1 drink = 5 oz [150 mL] of wine, 12 oz [360 mL] of beer, or 1.5 oz [45 mL] of hard liquor).
