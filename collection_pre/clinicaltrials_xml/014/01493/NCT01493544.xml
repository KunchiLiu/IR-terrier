	<brief_summary>PUMA is an observational, multicentre, multinational, cross-sectional study with primary care physicians (primary care, general and family physicians). Participants will be selected sequentially among patients at risk for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) who attend primary care consultation (primary care, general and family physicians). The inclusion visit will be a regularly scheduled or spontaneous consultation for patients, and this appointment with the physician will not depend on the study. During the appointment, data will be collected from the patient and the physician.</brief_summary>
