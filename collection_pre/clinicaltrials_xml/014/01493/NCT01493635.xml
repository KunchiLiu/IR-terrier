	<brief_summary>The World Health Organization analgesic ladder for cancer pain relief is an internationally used approach to managing cancer pain. Patients generally start on Step 1 of the ladder (paracetamol). As pain increases or is not well controlled on this, they progress to Step 2 which involves a stronger pain killer (weak opioid such as codeine). If pain is still not controlled they progress to Step 3 of the ladder which is a strong opioid (such as morphine). Work to date has suggested that Step 2 may be unnecessary and most patients usually require Step 3 analgesia. The TVT trial aims to examine the standard approach (Step 1-Step2-Step-3) versus a two step approach (Step 1-Step 3).</brief_summary>
