	<brief_title>Folic Acid Supplementation in Eating Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Some authors have identified the presence of increased levels of homocysteine in patients with eating disorders and attempts have been made to find some association between this and the high rates of depression and cognitive function impairment recorded in these patients. It is still not known what causes this increase in homocysteine levels, whether the levels return to normal after the nutritional state is normalised and what strategies must be employed to carry out this normalisation.</detailed_description>
