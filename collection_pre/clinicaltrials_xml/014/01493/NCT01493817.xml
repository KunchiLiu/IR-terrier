	<brief_summary>This research study is studying biomarkers in tissue samples from younger patients with Wilms tumor. Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how patients respond to treatment</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers in Samples From Younger Patients With Wilms Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages is related to clinicopathological factors in Wilms tumor (tumor stage, presence of vascular invasion, tumor progression, and survival). OUTLINE: Paraffin-embedded specimens are analyzed for macrophage markers. Results of each sample are then compared with patient's tumor stage, presence of vascular invasion, tumor progression, and survival.</detailed_description>
