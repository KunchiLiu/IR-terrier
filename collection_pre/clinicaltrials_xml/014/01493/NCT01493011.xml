	<brief_summary>Millions of patients die of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) every year. There are several methods to treat NSCLC, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and bioimmuotherapy. Recently, hyperthermia therapy has played an important role in neoplasm therapy. It has showed some effect in NSCLC both in animal experiment and clinical practice, yet there is little literature about Whole-body Hyperthermia (WBH) with neoplasm. The investigators decides to develop this randomized contrasted multicenter clinical study to testify to the effect of chemotherapy combined with WBH to treat stage IIIB/IV Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).</brief_summary>

At least 4 weeks since prior and no concurrent palliative radiotherapy No concurrent combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV; 10. volunteers who signed informed consent. 1. During Screening period and treatment period, the main target for lesions has been given radiation; 2. The body has metal material, including a metal JieYuHuan/support/operation fixed material within; 3. Existing cerebrovascular diseases and central nervous system tumors, including metastatic carcinoma; 4. Patients with recent or ongoing gastrointestinal bleed may not be transfused to reach the entry hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL Physicians should ensure patients requiring transfusion prior to registration do not have an occult or clinically apparent gastrointestinal bleed No history of bleeding diathesis; 5.
