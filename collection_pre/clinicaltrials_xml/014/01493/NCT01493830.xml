	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research trial studies biomarkers in tumor samples from younger patients with neuroblastoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers in Tumor Samples From Younger Patients With Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine the expression of UBE4B, hrs, and members of the ubiquitination protein complex in previously banked primary neuroblastoma tumor samples from the Children's Oncology Group. - To determine the correlation of expression levels and cellular localization of the UBE4B and hrs proteins with growth factor-receptor tumor cell-surface expression. - To determine the 1p36 deletion status by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis and their association with expression levels of UBE4B and hrs in previously banked primary neuroblastoma tumor samples from the Children's Oncology Group. OUTLINE: Banked tumor tissue samples are analyzed for expression of UBE4B, hrs, members of the ubiquitination protein complex, growth factor receptors, and 1p36 deletion status by immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescent microscopy, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).</detailed_description>
