	<brief_title>Discontinuation Order of Vasopressors in Septic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are little data regarding the discontinuation of vasopressors in patients with septic shock. Therefore, the investigators intend to evaluate the incidence of hypotension based on the discontinuation order of norepinephrine and vasopressin in patients receiving concomitant norepinephrine and vasopressin infusions for the treatment of septic shock.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>patients 20 years of age or older patients of receiving concomitant therapy with norepinephrine and vasopressin for teh management of septic shock patients began to reduce the vasopressor patients who expired or had care withdrawn while receiving norepinephrine and vasopressin patients being transferred into the ICU from an outside facility or the operating room patients who are suspected to have vasopressin deficiency (eg. HPA axis dysfunction, empty sella) acute myocardial infarction or Congestive heart failure (NYHA functional classification III or IV) acute mesenteric ischemia patients who were received other vasopressor except for norepinephrine or vasopressin</criteria>
