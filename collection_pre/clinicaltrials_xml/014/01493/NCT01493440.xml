	<brief_summary>Atosiban, administered at embryo transfer, can improve the implantation rate and the clinical pregnancy rate in patients with repeated implantation failure undergoing IVF-ET (in-vitro fertilization and embryo transfer).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atosiban Improves Implantation and Pregnancy Rates in Patients With Repeated Implantation Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atosiban is a mixed oxytocin and vasopressin V1A receptor antagonist.Combined antagonism at oxytocin and vasopressin V1A receptors reduces uterine contractions with a corresponding decrease in intrauterine production of prostaglandin F2alpha and improved uterine blood supply. These effects are of potential benefit for implantation support during IVF-ET cycles.</detailed_description>
