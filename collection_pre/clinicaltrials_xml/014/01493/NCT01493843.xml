	<brief_summary>This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of carboplatin/paclitaxel and carboplatin/paclitaxel/bevacizumab with and without GDC-0941 in patients with previously untreated advanced or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients will be randomized to receive 4 cycles of carboplatin/paclitaxel and either GDC-0941 or placebo, with (patients with non-squamous NSCLC) or without (patients with squamous NSCLC) bevacizumab. Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression or intolerable toxicity occurs. Patients in placebo arms with disease progression may cross over to open-label active GDC-0941.</brief_summary>
