	<brief_summary>In Denmark, approximately 13,000 operations are carried out every year. Prosthetic infection is a very serious condition and despite extensive prophylactic measures, prosthetic infections appear in 1-2 percent of the operated patients. It is difficult to diagnose prosthetic infection with the techniques applied so far and incorrect diagnosis might imply unnecessary reoperations as well as unnoticed infections might lead to prolonged pain and invalidity. The purpose of this study is to examine the value of these three techniques applied as a supplement to the existing technology and on this basis to prepare an algorithm for the examination of joint prosthesis infection.</brief_summary>
