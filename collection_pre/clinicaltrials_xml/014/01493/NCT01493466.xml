	<brief_summary>Serum proteomics is a very useful tool to identify various disease. The purpose of the present study was to find differential proteins among patient with normal, SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis, death and to screen potential biomarkers for their dynamic changes. Serum proteins were identified by iTRAQ labeling and LC-MS/MS. The bioinformatics analysis was performed with the Mascot software and the International Protein Index (IPI) and the Gene Ontology (GO) Database and KEGG pathway Database. The differentially expressed proteins were verified by Western blot by another sample collected from clinical.</brief_summary>
