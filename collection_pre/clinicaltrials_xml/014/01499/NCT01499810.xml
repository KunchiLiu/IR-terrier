	<brief_summary>Single-center, single group study of the efficacy and safety of transcatheter renal denervation for treatment of patients with essential hypertension uncontrolled despite combined pharmacotherapy including 3 or more hypotensive drugs one of which is a diuretic. Bilateral transcatheter renal denervation will be performed on the top of existed pharmacotherapy. Change in blood pressure (BP), left ventricle (LV) mass, carotid artery thickness, renal artery blood flow and renal function, will be assessed at 6 and 12 months of follow-up.</brief_summary>
