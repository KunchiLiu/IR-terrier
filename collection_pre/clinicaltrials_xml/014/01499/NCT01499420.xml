	<brief_summary>Reconstituted high density lipoprotein used in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) may reduce atherosclerotic plaque burden, thereby reducing the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events. This study is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study in patients with stable atherothrombotic disease in whom the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of CSL112 will be assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Single Ascending Dose Study Examining the Safety and Pharmacokinetic Profile of Reconstituted High Density Lipoprotein (CSL112) Administered to Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Male or female aged 18 years to 80 years. Subjects must have documented evidence of a history of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease/surgical revascularization. Subjects on a stable medication regimen. Body weight 50 kg or greater at screening. Moderate/severe heart failure or renal impairment. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia in subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Receipt of the combination of omeprazole and clopidogrel within 1 month of randomization. Subjects whose medical history, condition or medication regimen may interfere with the evaluation of the safety and tolerability of CSL112 (for example significantly altered electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform, hepatobiliary disease, malignancy, thrombocytopenia, etc.) Known hypersensitivity to the product components</criteria>
