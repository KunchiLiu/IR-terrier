	<brief_summary>This prospective single arm study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of sunitinib given on an individualized dosing schedule as first-line therapy in subjects with metastatic clear cell renal cell cancer. The treatment schedule intent is to maximize dose intensity of sunitinib and minimize time off therapy based on individual tolerability using protocol directed dose modification criteria. A total of 110 subjects will be enrolled. All subjects will continue to receive study treatment until disease progression or withdrawal of consent. The primary outcome for this study is progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the duration from the date a patient first receives Sunitinib until the date of death or confirmed progression according to the RECIST criteria.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Efficacy and Safety of Sunitinib Given on an Individualized Schedule</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-arm, single-stage phase II study investigating the use of an individualized dosing regimen of Sunitinib on patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The intent is to maximize dose intensity of sunitinib and minimize time off therapy based on individual tolerability using protocol directed dose modification criteria. Dose and schedule changes are done if toxicity (hematological, fatigue, skin, GI) is &gt; grade 2. There will be no dosing or schedule changes for hypertension, hypothyroidism, skin color changes, heartburn, etc. unless clinically indicated. Subjects will continue therapy until progression according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. All subjects will be followed for progression free survival until progression but after 2 years on therapy, only grade 3/4 drug related adverse events will be recorded. Fact-G and FKSI-DRS will be used to evaluate PRO/QOL at baseline and every 2 months timepoints. A more detailed pharmacokinetic blood sampling will be done in a subset of patients in an effort to understand if Sunitinib blood concentration has a tendency to go down during treatment, as has been shown to be the case for Sorafenib. Biomarker and genomics blood sampling for correlation with progression free survival, toxicity and pharmacokinetics will be collected at baseline and stored.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed locally recurrent or metastatic renal cell carcinoma of clear cell origin or with a component of clear cell histology. Patients with nephrectomy (partial or total) or without nephrectomy are eligible. Evidence of measurable disease by RECIST criteria version 1.1. Male or female, age ≥ 18 years old Karnofsky performance status ≥ 80 %. Adequate organ functions determined by protocol directed lab values Subject's willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory tests, and other study procedures. Renal cell carcinoma without any clear (conventional) cell component. Prior systemic therapy of any kind for advanced RCC (including targeted therapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal, or investigational therapy). Prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy with cytokines, IL2 or vaccines is only permitted if it did not occur within the preceding 12 months. Prior and/or concurrent bisphosphonate therapy is allowed. Major surgery or radiation therapy within 4 weeks of starting the study treatment. Prior palliative radiotherapy to metastatic lesion(s) is permitted, provided there is at least one measurable lesion that has not been irradiated NCI CTCAE Version 3.0 grade 3 haemorrhage within 4 weeks of starting the study treatment Diagnosis of any second malignancy within the last 5 years, except for adequately treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell skin cancer, or in situ cervical cancer Known brain metastases, spinal cord compression, or evidence of symptomatic brain or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis on screening CT or MRI scan. Any of the following within the 6 months prior to study drug administration: myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, or pulmonary embolism Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of NCI CTCAE Version 3.0 grade ≥2 Prolonged QTc interval on baseline EKG (&gt;450 msec for males or &gt;470 msec for females). Atrial Fibrillation of any grade. Uncontrolled hypertension (&gt;150/100 mm Hg despite optimal medical therapy. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)related illness or other active infection. Concurrent treatment on another clinical trial. Supportive care trials or nontreatment trials, e.g. QOL, and imaging trials are allowed. Concomitant treatment with a drug having proarrhythmic potential Use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers 7 and 12 days before dosing, respectively Pregnancy or breastfeeding. Female subjects must be surgically sterile or be postmenopausal, or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of therapy. All female subjects with reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum) prior to enrolment. Male subjects must be surgically sterile or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of therapy. The definition of effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the principal investigator or a designated associate Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in the judgment of the investigator would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study</criteria>
