	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of a new surgical checklist in the setting of sinus surgery for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and to measure the frequency of compliance by surgical personnel at OHSU with specific daily safety protocols before and after introduction of the checklist. The investigators hypothesized that the use of an ESS specific surgical checklist will improve the frequency of compliance by surgical personnel at OHSU to internal safety concerns and protocols.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A total of 200 unidentified, non-randomized endoscopic sinus surgery cases will be observed and reviewed by research personnel (T.L.S, J.C.) within the Oregon Sinus Center, located within the Center for Health and Healing on the South Waterfront Campus of OHSU, under the direction of Timothy L. Smith, MD, MPH (PI). The first 100 surgical cases will be evaluated as "pre-intervention" cases by research personnel while the second 100 surgical cases will be evaluated as "post-intervention" cases after the introduction and discussion of the surgical checklist to operating room staff.</detailed_description>
