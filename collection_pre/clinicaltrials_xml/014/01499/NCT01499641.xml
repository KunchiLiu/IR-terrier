	<brief_title>Epidural Steroid Following Discectomy for Herniated Disc Reduces Morbidity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methylprednisolone might enhance recovery after discectomy for herniated disc disease without apparent side effect. Convalescence after discectomy for herniated disc disease is dependent on pain and the inflammatory response. In arthroscopic and abdominal surgery steroids reduce the inflammatory response and enhance recovery. 200 patients with herniated disc disease are randomly allocated to receive epidural methylprednisolone 40 mg or none.</detailed_description>
