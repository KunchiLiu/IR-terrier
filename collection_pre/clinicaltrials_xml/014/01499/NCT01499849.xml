	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, active-controlled study of rolapitant in subjects receiving HEC. Rolapitant or placebo will be administered prior to initiation of chemotherapy on Day 1 with granisetron and dexamethasone. Subjects will record all events of emesis and use of rescue medication for established nausea and/or vomiting, and will indicate the severity of nausea they experienced in each of the previous 24 hours in the Nausea and Vomiting (NV) Subject Diary prior to HEC administration through Day 6 of Cycle 1. Health-related quality of life will be measured by the FLIE Questionnaire on Day 6 of Cycle 1. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical review of adverse events (AEs), physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and safety laboratory values. All subjects are expected to complete Cycle 1 and will have the option of participating in up to five additional cycles.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ph3 Safety/Efficacy Study of Rolapitant for the Prevention of CINV in Subjects Receiving Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, active-controlled study of rolapitant in subjects receiving HEC (≥60 mg/m2 of cisplatin-based chemotherapy). Study drug will be administered 1 - 2 hours prior to initiation of chemotherapy on Day 1. Granisetron and dexamethasone will be administered approximately 30 minutes before initiation of chemotherapy on Day 1,except in patients receiving taxanes as part of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Subjects will record all events of emesis and use of rescue medication for established nausea and/or vomiting and will indicate the severity of nausea they experienced in each of the previous 24 hours in the NV Subject Diary prior to HEC administration through Day 6 in Cycle 1. Dexamethasone 8 mg twice daily (part of study regimen) on Days 2 through 4 is NOT considered rescue therapy. Health-related quality of life will be measured by the FLIE Questionnaire on Day 6 of Cycle 1. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical review of AEs, physical examinations including complete neurological assessment, vital signs,electrocardiograms (ECGs), and safety laboratory values including BUN andcreatinine. All subjects are expected to complete Cycle 1 and will have the option of participating in up to five additional cycles. The study will investigate the efficacy of rolapitant for the treatment of CINV during an initial chemotherapy cycle (Cycle 1). Safety analyses will include data from Cycle 1 and from subsequent cycles. At the Screening Visit, blood samples may be collected and stored in this study and maybe analyzed for future biomarker research related to safety and efficacy. Analysis of these samples may include DNA, RNA, or protein markers. The biomarker blood samples will be stored for up to 2 years post study completion. In addition, PK samples will be collected from subjects enrolled in selected sites.</detailed_description>
