	<brief_summary>Getting to the hospital quickly is the key to treating stroke. African Americans suffer more strokes with worse outcomes and receive stroke treatments less often than European Americans. This project will work to reduce these health disparities by creating and testing the feasibility of a peer-led faith-based behavioral intervention in an African American community with a goal to increase calls to 911 so stroke patients can be treated quickly.</brief_summary>
