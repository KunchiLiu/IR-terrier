	<brief_summary>On the basis of different studies the long term oxygen treatment is deemed to be routine treatment in patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at appearance of hypoxaemia. Non invasive ventilation (NIV) is the treatment of choice in hypercapnic COPD patients with respiratory acidosis at acute respiratory decompensation. Several prospective randomized studies have shown a reduction of acute mortality as result. But everyday practice shows that COPD patients with chronic hypercapnia hardly accustom oneself to nocturnal ventilation. Reasons are not known yet, but substantial pulmonary overinflation or the appearance of depressions or rather anxiety disorders are possible causes. On the other hand patients may not notice any subjective improvement of symptoms and won't accept the burden of a tight fitting mask during the night. The aim of the present study is to determine the effect on gas exchange of a nocturnal transnasal application of an oxygen-enriched gaseous mixture via nasal cannula and the subjective acceptance. This is compared to a nocturnal transnasal application of oxygen alone in randomized order for at least 6 hours each night. Thirty hypercapnic COPD GOLD IV patients (PCO2 &gt; 50 mmHg) will be included. The two night Polysomnographies (PSG) will be evaluated with special attention to nasal flow measurements, breathing effort, oxygen saturation and an additional transcutaneous PCO2 measurement. At begin and end of each measurement night a capillary blood gas analysis is made.</brief_summary>
