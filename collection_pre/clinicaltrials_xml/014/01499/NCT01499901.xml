	<brief_title>Comparison of the Bilateral Sequential and Simultaneous Cochlear Implantation in the Deaf Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>French multicentric study. 100 children, profound, congenitally deaf, aged between 10 months and 40 months, with indication of unilateral CI will be included. Randomization: 50 sequential at one year CI versus 50 simultaneous bilateral CI, their results compared. Main measures at 12 and 24 months: speech perception in silence and in noise. Other measures: sound localisation, oral language, vestibular impact, quality of life.</detailed_description>
