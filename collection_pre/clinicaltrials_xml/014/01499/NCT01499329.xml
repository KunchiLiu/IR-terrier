	<criteria>1. Patient is older than 18 years 2. Patient must sign a written informed consent form that is approved by the ethics committee prior to indexprocedure 3. Patient must be compliant with all followup visits 4. Patient suffers from intermittent claudication (Rutherford 13) or critical limb ischemia (Rutherford 4 and 5) 5. Patient's life expectancy is more than 2 years 6. Patient has iliac atherosclerotic de novo lesion(s) type A, B, C &amp; D according to TASCII classification 7. Target vessel diameter is between 5 and 9 mm 8. Target lesion has a baseline diameter stenosis of more than 50% 9. Patient has sufficient infrainguinal runoff with at least a patent common femoral artery and deep femoral artery (both &lt;50% stenosis) 1. Patient has a life expectancy of less than 2 years 2. Patient is refusing to be compliant with all followup visits 3. Patient suffers from acute limb ischemia, defined as any sudden decrease in limb perfusion causing a potential threat to limb viability. 4. Patient is intolerant to anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy such as aspirin, heparin, clopidogrel or ticlopidine drug therapy 5. Patient has already been treated with a stent in the ipsilateral target vessel 6. Patient suffered tissue loss in the target extremities, defined as Rutherford 6 7. Patient is already enrolled in this or another investigational device study 8. Patient had a coronary intervention within the last 60 days before enrolment into this study or there is a planned coronary intervention within 60 days of enrolment into this study 9. Use of alternative therapy (e.g. atherectomy, cutting balloon, laser, radiation therapy) as part of the indexprocedure 10. Any planned surgical intervention within 30 days of the indexprocedure 11. Patient has an abdominal aortic aneurysm that is likely to require repair within the next 2 years. 12. Patient has no sufficient infrainguinal runoff (&gt;50% stenosis). Patient inclusion is only possible if revascularization (endovascular or surgical) is performed in the same procedure with a peroperative angiographic control yielding &lt;30% stenosis. 13. Target lesion is a restenotic lesion. 14. Target lesion is adjacent an aneurysm. 15. Target vessel perforation with documented contrast extravasation during indexprocedure prior to stent placement.</criteria>
