	<brief_summary>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of severe visual impairment in the UK, Europe and N America. Low vision patients with AMD have great difficulty reading, which leads to a loss of independence and reduced quality of life. Magnifiers alone do not compensate for loss of central vision in AMD. It has been proposed that special low vision training can improve reading ability in patients with AMD. Training programmes are widely available in the US and Scandinavia, but not in the UK, partly because there is a lack of evidence from Randomised Control Trials (RCT) showing that they are effective. The investigators are conducting a clinical trial comparing the conventional hospitalâˆ’based low vision service to enhanced rehabilitation programmes that include Eccentric Viewing training. Eccentric viewing training involves teaching patients who have lost their central vision to use a new area of retina for visual tasks. Patients are either taught to improve the use of the part of the retina they naturally start using after their central vision is lost, their so-called preferred retinal locus (PRL), or, alternatively, they are taught to use a different retinal area that is thought to be better suited for everyday visual tasks, the so-called trained retinal locus (TRL). The investigators plan to compare the two types of eccentric viewing training to conventional hospital-based low vision care.</brief_summary>
