	<criteria>Generally healthy adults between 2165 years of age Body Mass Index (BMI) between 25 and ≤40 OGTT (75g glucola) peak value between ≥140mg/dl and ≤199 mg/dl at screening visit Willingness to adhere to the requirements of the protocol, including availability for followup visits and donation of blood samples Willingness and ability to sign written informed consent Women of child bearing capacity who agree to use an acceptable form of birth control during the trial [i.e., oral contraception, reliable use of a doublebarrier method (e.g., condom and diaphragm, condom and foam, condom and sponge), IUD or tubal ligation] Active diabetes mellitus [fasting blood glucose of ≥7.0 mmol/L (≥126 mg/dL) or ≥11.1 mmol/L (≥200 mg/dL) after OGTT] Current coronary artery/ cardiovascular disease or history of a cardiovascular event (stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting, angina pectoris) or have undergone a cardiovascular intervention within the past three months Seizure disorder Blood disorders, including anemia (i.e., hemoglobin levels less than 13 g/dL in men and less than 12 g/dL in women) Active infection, including HIV, hepatitis, etc Participants on Estrogen replacement must be on a stable dose for at least 3 months Serious illness requiring ongoing medical care or medication Gastrointestinal disorders or prior gastrointestinal surgeries (including gastric bypass or lapband) that might cause complications or influence motility or satiety (e.g.,diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, intestinal narrowing or obstruction, difficulty swallowing) Any congenital spinal cord deformities or traumatic spinal cord injuries Uncorrected hypothyroidism Other significant metabolic endocrine disease Active liver disease or liver function impairment as evidenced by a history of liver disease or liver enzyme elevations &gt;three times the upper limit of normal Current cancer Significant kidney disease (calculated by eGFR &lt;60 mL/min) History or clinical manifestations of significant metabolic, hepatic, renal, hematological, pulmonary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urological, neurological,or psychiatric disorders which in the opinion of the investigator would be expected to interfere with the study or increase risk to the subject Use of anticoagulants such as warfarin Use of medications that might affect weight or food absorption (e.g., diuretics,glucocorticoids, anorexigenic agents, Orlistat, laxatives) Treatment within the previous 6 months with any medication that is known to affect glucose levels (such as insulin with or without an amylin analogue, sulfonylureas,meglitinides, biguanide metformin, thiazolidinediones, alphaglucosidase inhibitors,oral dipeptidylpeptidase4 inhibitor, Sitagliptin, Incretin mimetic) Regular use of natural health products or dietary supplements known to affect glucose levels (such as chromium, zinc, fenugreek, cinnamon). If the participant agrees to stop taking these products 14 days prior to study entry and for the duration of the study, they can participate in the study o Any other natural health products or dietary supplements, with the exception of vitamins and minerals with dose of &lt; 600 mg/day of vitamin E and containing no vitamin K. Natural health products or dietary supplements include products such as, but not limited to, Echinacea, Ginseng, St. John's Wort, Gingko, Glucosamine, Fish Oil supplements, Evening Primrose Oil, Green Tea or other herbal products consumed in the form of pills, extracts, capsules, or tablets.
