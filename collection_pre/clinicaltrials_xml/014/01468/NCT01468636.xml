	<brief_title>A RTC to Examine the Effectiveness of 400 mg of Oral Zinc Gluconate as Adjunctive Therapy for Ano-genital Warts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clients presenting to the BCCDC STI clinic with genital warts will be randomized to either 400 mg zinc gluconate or placebo (200mg BID) for 8 weeks in addition to the standard of care. Clinical assessment of warts and additional standard treatment will occur every 7-10 days for a maximum of 8 weeks. A telephone call will occur at week 20 to determine if any of the warts have cleared or re-appeared. The appearance of new warts will also be noted. The proportion of subjects who have complete clearance of genital warts at 8 weeks will be compared between groups.</detailed_description>
