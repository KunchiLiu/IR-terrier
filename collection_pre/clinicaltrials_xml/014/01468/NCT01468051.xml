	<brief_summary>Patients with chronic renal disease have to be vaccinated as soon as dialysis is forestalled and this could improve seroconversion rate of hepatitis B vaccination. In this study, the investigators aimed to compare seroconversion rates and immune response rates using four doses of 40 μg and three doses of 20 μg of Euvax B recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) vaccine given to predialysis CKD patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Two Schedules of Hepatitis B Vaccination in Predialysis Chronic Renal Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In an open, randomized clinical trial, the investigators compared seroconversion rates in 51 predialysis patients with mild and moderate chronic renal failure using either 40 μg 4 doses or 20 μg 3 doses of Euvax B recombinant hepatitis B vaccine administered at 0, 1, 2, 6 and 0, 1, 6 months respectively.</detailed_description>
