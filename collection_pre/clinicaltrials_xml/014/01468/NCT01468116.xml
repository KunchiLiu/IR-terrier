	<brief_summary>Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery induces resolution of type 2 diabetes, often within days after surgery and before significant weight loss. The aim of this study is to investigate whether changes in mitochondrial function contributes to the early improvement of type 2 diabetes after RYGB.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass on Mitochondrial Function in Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to development of insulin resistance in the muscle and hence to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Mitochondrial function can be studied non-invasively by 31 Phosphor Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (31PMRS). In this study we will investigate changes in mitochondrial function using the combination of 31 PMRS and Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy (NIRS) after gastric bypass.</detailed_description>
