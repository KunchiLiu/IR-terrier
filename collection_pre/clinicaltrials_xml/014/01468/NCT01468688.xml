	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Male or female patients ≥ 18 years of age 2. WHO performance status (PS) of 02 3. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of GIST that is unresectable or metastatic 4. Available tissue specimen: Doseescalation cohorts: patients must have available archival tumor tissue which can be shipped during the course of the study Doseexpansion cohort: patients must have available archival tumor tissue which can be shipped during the course of the study and must agree to a fresh pretreatment biopsy. 5. Failed prior therapy with imatinib followed by sunitinib for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic GIST. Note the following specific criteria for the two phases of the trial: Doseescalation cohorts: patients who failed prior therapy with imatinib and then have failed therapy with sunitinib. Treatment failure may be due to either disease progression on therapy (both imatinib and sunitinib) or intolerance to therapy (sunitinib). Doseescalation cohort patients may have had additional lines of therapy not limited to imatinib and sunitinib. Doseexpansion cohort: patients must have documented disease progression on both imatinib and sunitinib. In addition, patients may have had no more than two lines of prior therapy (i.e. treatment with imatinib followed by treatment with sunitinib). Adjuvant imatinib will not count as a prior course of imatinib for the purposes of this criterion 1. Previous treatment with PI3K inhibitors 2. A medical history of any of the following mood disorders as judged by the Investigator or a psychiatrist: Medically documented history of or active major depressive episode, bipolar disorder (I or II), obsessivecompulsive disorder, schizophrenia, a history of suicidal attempt or thoughts, or homicidal thoughts (immediate risk of doing harm to others) ≥ CTCAE grade 3 anxiety 3. When completing the patient questionnaires at screening: Meets the cutoff score of ≥ 10 in the nine item depression scale of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) or a cutoff of ≥ 15 in the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD 7) mood scale respectively, or Selects positive response of 1, 2, 3 to question number 9 regarding potential for suicidal thoughts or ideation in the PHQ9 (independent of the total score of the PHQ9) 4. Severe and/or uncontrolled concurrent medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator could cause unacceptable safety risks or compromise compliance with the protocol (e.g. acute or chronic liver, pancreatic, severe renal disease considered unrelated to study disease, chronic pulmonary disease including dyspnea at rest from any cause). 5. Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (defined as HbA1c &gt; 8%) Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
