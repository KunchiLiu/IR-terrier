	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of Adalimumab in the Treatment of Hidradenitis Suppurativa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical trial identifier is PIONEER II. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of adalimumab and to determine how well it works in the treatment of adults with moderate to severe HS. HS is a chronic skin disease that creates red, swollen, painful bumps which can break open to combine and form tunnels in the skin and scars. Sometimes these bumps can heal themselves quickly and sometimes they will become much worse and create sores that heal with multiple combined scars, or areas that do not heal. In this study, approximately 300 adults will be enrolled at treatment centers worldwide. Subject participation in this study will be up to 50 weeks. There will be a screening period, which will last from 7 to 30 days, and a study treatment period of up to 36 weeks. Study visits occur at Screening, Baseline, and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32 and 36 (or sooner if subject leaves the study before Week 36). The study is divided into two treatment periods. The first period (Period A) will last 12 weeks and the second period (Period B) will last 24 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults must have a diagnosis of HS for at least 1 year prior to Baseline. HS lesions must be present in at least two distinct anatomical areas, one of which must be at least Hurley Stage II or Hurley Stage III. Subject must have stable HS for at least 60 days prior to Screening visit and at Baseline visit. Subject must have experienced an inadequate response to at least a 90day treatment of oral antibiotics for treatment of HS. Subject must have a total AN count of greater than or equal to 3 at baseline. Subject was previously treated with adalimumab or another antitumor necrosis factor (antiTNF) therapy (e.g., infliximab or etanercept). Subjects on permitted oral antibiotic treatment for HS who have not been on a stable dose for at least 28 days prior to the Baseline visit. Subject received oral concomitant analgesics (including opioids) for HSrelated pain within 14 days prior to Baseline visit. If entering the study on concomitant oral analgesics for nonHS related pain: Subject on opioid analgesics within 14 days prior to Baseline visit; Subject not on a stable dose of nonopioid oral analgesics for at least 14 days prior to the Baseline visit ("as needed" is not considered a stable dose).</criteria>
