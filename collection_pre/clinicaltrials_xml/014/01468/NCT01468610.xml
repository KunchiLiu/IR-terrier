	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the relationships between subjective cognitive complaints, neurocognitive deficits, and work productivity in participants with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), before and after 8 weeks of treatment with an antidepressant medication. Our hypothesis is that, in working participants with MDD of at least moderate severity, neurocognitive deficits will predict poorer work functioning and productivity.</brief_summary>
