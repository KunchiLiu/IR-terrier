	<brief_title>Autologous Bone Marrow Stromal Cell and Endothelial Progenitor Cell Transplantation in Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a multi-center, single-blind, randomized, parallel controlled trail. Patients with acute cerebral infarcts within the middle cerebral arterial territory and with severe neurological deficits will be enrolled and randomly allocated into 3 groups: autologous BMSCs transplantation group, autologous EPCs transplantation group and Placebo control group. Randomization codes were established by the study statistician and were revealed only to the stem cell laboratory technician responsible for separating the cells into aliquots or preparing the placebo material. All patients will undergo a Bone Marrow aspiration procedure at 7 days after symptom onset. BMSCs and EPCs will be expanded ex vivo and then intravenously infused into own body, respectively. The control group will not receive cell therapy. Observe will followed for up to 1 year after the onset. Neurological score, neuroimaging, mortality of any cause, side effects, and new-onset comorbidities will be monitored and compared between each groups.</detailed_description>
