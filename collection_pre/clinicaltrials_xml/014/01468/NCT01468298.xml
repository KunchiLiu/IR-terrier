	<detailed_description>It was selected 40 patients, from 40 to 59 years old, with chronic low back pain from CESUMAR Physiotherapy Clinic-Schoo. These were evaluated before and after treatment regarding posture by SAPO computer program; flexibility for lumbar Schober testing, sit and reach; muscle strength by dynamometry for trunk extensors and the maximum repetition test in a minute to abdominal and trunk extensors; functional capacity by Rolland-Morris Questionnaire; pain by visual analog scale; heart rate(HR) by polar frequencymetric; peripheral oxygen saturation by Finger Pulse Oximeter; and systolic and diastolic blood pressure with a Sphygmomanometer. The sample was divided in two groups (1-GPR with 11 patients, 2-Isostretching with 10 patients). All patients were accompanied by an individual treatment program composed by 12 sessions of 45 minutes, twice a week. It was considered statistically significant p values &lt;0.05 obtained from the Student's t test.</detailed_description>
