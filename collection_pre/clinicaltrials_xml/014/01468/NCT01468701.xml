	<brief_summary>In this part of the Registry Program patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) at risk for stroke are enrolled to characterize the target population and to collect real world data on important outcome events. For administrative purposes the study is divided into two protocol numbers: 1160.129 for all non-EU (European Union) and non-EEA (European Economic Area) countries, and 1160.136 for EU and EEA countries. The total number of patients enrolled in both protocols is estimated to be 48,000 patients, and all these patients will be included in the data analysis for study 1160.129.</brief_summary>
