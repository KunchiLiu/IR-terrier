	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well paclitaxel when given together with or without pazopanib hydrochloride works in treating patients with ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cavity cancer that is persistent or has come back. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor or by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether paclitaxel is more effective when given with or without pazopanib hydrochloride in treating ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cavity cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel With or Without Pazopanib Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Persistent or Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial, Fallopian Tube, or Peritoneal Cavity Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the progression-free survival hazard ratio of the combination of weekly paclitaxel and pazopanib (pazopanib hydrochloride) compared to weekly paclitaxel and placebo in patients with persistent or recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). II. To estimate and compare the proportion of patients responding to therapy by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), cancer antigen 125 (CA125) response, the overall survival (OS), and the duration of response in each arm. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore the association between plasma cytokines and angiogenic markers and progression-free and overall survival. II. To explore the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and progression-free and overall survival. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and placebo orally (PO) daily on days 1-28. ARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel as in Arm I and pazopanib hydrochloride PO daily on days 1-28. In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have recurrent or persistent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma; histologic documentation of the original primary tumor is required via the pathology report Patients must have measurable disease or nonmeasurable (detectable) disease Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded); each lesion must be greater than or equal to 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or greater than or equal to 20 mm when measured by chest xray; lymph nodes must be greater than or equal to 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI Nonmeasurable (detectable) disease in a patient is defined in this protocol as one who does not have measurable disease but has at least one of the following conditions: Ascites and/or pleural effusion attributed to tumor Solid and/or cystic abnormalities on radiographic imaging that do not meet RECIST 1.1 definitions for target lesions Patients with measurable disease must have at least one "target lesion" to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by RECIST 1.1;

if patients were treated with paclitaxel for their primary disease, this can have been given weekly or every 3 weeks Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, two additional cytotoxic regimens for management of recurrent or persistent disease, with no more than 1 nonplatinum, nontaxane regimen; treatment with weekly paclitaxel for recurrent or persistent disease is NOT allowed Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, biologic/targeted (noncytotoxic) therapy as part of their primary treatment regimen Patients must have NOT received any biologic/targeted (noncytotoxic) therapy targeting the VEGF and/or plateletderived growth factor (PDGF) pathways for management of recurrent or persistent disease For the purposes of this study, poly (ADPribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors will be considered "cytotoxic";
