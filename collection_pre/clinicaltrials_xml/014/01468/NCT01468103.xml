	<brief_summary>This is a randomized controlled clinical trial to compare laser peripheral iridotomy(LPI) and surgical peripheral iridectomy. Subjects of primary angle closure suspect, primary angle closure will be randomized to undergo LPI or SPI. Subjects are proposed to be followed up for 3 years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laser Iridotomy Versus Surgical Iridectomy in Early Angle Closure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The following will be studied: 1. To evaluate the safety of these two techniques for the treatment of angle closure. 2. To compare the anterior chamber reaction and IOP changes post surgery. 3. TO establish the UBM/ASOCT chamber angle parameters changes pre and post surgery. 4. To assess the development of PAS.</detailed_description>
