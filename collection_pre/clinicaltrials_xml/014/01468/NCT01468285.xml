	<brief_summary>Betahistine may provide benefit by enhancement of Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF). This placebo-controlled pharmacodynamic treatment study will primarily explore the effect of betahistine on cerebral blood flow measured by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI imaging, in a patient population with MRI evidence of cerebrovascular compromise. Also it will be measured if CBF changes correlate with gait and cognitive changes.</brief_summary>
