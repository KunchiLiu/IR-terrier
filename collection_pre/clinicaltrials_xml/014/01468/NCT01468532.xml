	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of pasireotide and to see how well it works when given together with docetaxel and prednisone in treating patients with metastatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and prednisone, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Pasireotide may inhibit the secretion of hormones. Giving pasireotide together with docetaxel and prednisone may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel, Prednisone, and Pasireotide in Treating Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) level of SOM 230 (pasireotide) in combination with docetaxel and prednisone. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). II. To evaluate preliminary efficacy of the combination of SOM 230 and docetaxel and prednisone as defined by response rates (measurable and prostate-specific antigen [PSA]), time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS). III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the combination. IV. To assess the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of the combination as seen by baseline levels of and changes in insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, serum chromogranin A (SCA), and neuron specific enolase (NSE), and to associate them with TTP and OS. V. To assess the pretherapy circulating tumor cell (CTC) counts and change in CTC after therapy, and to associate them with TTP and OS. OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of pasireotide followed by a phase II study. Patients receive pasireotide intramuscularly (IM) on day 1, docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour, and prednisone orally (PO) twice daily (BID) continuously. Courses with docetaxel repeat every 21 days and courses with pasireotide repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days and then every 3 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
