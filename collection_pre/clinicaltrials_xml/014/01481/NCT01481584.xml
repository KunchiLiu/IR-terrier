	<brief_title>Nutritional Evaluation of Canola Protein in Comparison With Soy Protein</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The physiological effects of a single administration of two different industrially manufactured canola proteins (hydrolyzate, isolate) were investigated compared to soy protein. Twenty-eight healthy men (ø 25 years) completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups (group A: canola protein isolate and soy protein isolate and group B: canola protein hydrolyzate and soy protein isolate). After a three-day run-in period, on the intervention day, the subjects consumed a protein drink containing 30.0 g protein powder added to a final volume of 500 mL tomato juice. Half of the subjects in each group consumed a protein drink containing 30.0 g canola protein, the other half received the soy protein. After taking of fasting blood samples in the morning of the intervention day, blood samples were drawn at regular intervals for a period of eight hours. At the end of the run-in period and on the intervention day, a 24-hour urine collection took place. Within a second experiment (after 4 weeks), the protein source was crossed within the four subgroups for the second intervention.</detailed_description>
