	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to assess whether human subjects can be made tolerant to intravenously administered Crotoxin and achieve higher and more therapeutically effective doses levels without the previously reported adverse effects associated with bolus i.m. administration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open Label Clinical Trial of Intravenous Crotoxin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crotoxin has been shown to induce neurotoxic tolerance in animals allowing them to receive high doses associated with effective anti-tumor activity in the absence of adverse side effects. The study plans to demonstrate this effect in human subjects using two dose escalation protocols; slow and fast. It is believed that this approach will prevent toxic side effects to subjects. The route of administration has not been employed clinically and is designed to avoid the myonecrotic effects of intramuscular injections. The target maximum dose is almost double that off the previously reported MTD. The protocol also incorporates an active suppression of the allergic reaction by pre-treatment administration of antihistamines.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Be adult patients with histologically confirmed advanced solid tumors who have progressed despite standard therapy, or for whom no standard therapy exists. 2. Have an ambulatory PS (ECOG 01). 3. Have tumour evaluation made within 28 days before study drug administration (patients with non measurable lesions according to the RECIST guidelines not previously irradiated are allowed to enter the trial). 4. Have completed radiotherapy or chemotherapy or any other anticancer therapy (including experimental therapy) more than 4 weeks prior to enrolment into the trial and must have recovered from all acute side effects of these treatments 5. Have a life expectancy greater than 3 months 6. Have an age between 18 and 75 years 7. Have normal marrow function with the following haematological parameters normal; Hb ≥10g/dl, WBC ≥4.0 x109/L, neutrophil count ≥ 2.0 x 109/L and platelets ≥100 x109 /L 8. Have no medically significant impairment of cardiac or respiratory functions 9. Have adequate hepatic function with Total bilirubin lower or equal to 1.5 x N and Transaminases lower or equal to 2.5 x N (lower or equal to 5 x N in case of liver metastasis). 10. Have no history of prior severe allergic reactions to venoms 11. Have Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min. 12. Be on stable doses of any drugs which may affect hepatic drug metabolism or renal drug excretion (e.g.nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, barbiturates, narcotic analgesics, probenecid). Such drugs should not be initiated while the patient is participating in this study. 13. Will agree to participate in the study prior to starting with any specific study procedure, after having signed written informed consent. 1. Pregnant or planning to become pregnant 2. Known to have brain metastases or leptomeningeal involvement. CTscan or MRI is not required to rule this out unless there is clinical suspicion of central nervous system involvement 3. Have pleural effusion/ ascites, cystic lesions or bone metastases, as the only assessable lesions 4. Receiving any other experimental or anticancer therapy within 30 days before first study drug administration (except antalgic radiotherapy and hormonotherapy) 5. Have a history of other malignancies, except for patients with a cancer free interval of &gt; 5 years after treatment completion, patients with prior history of adequately treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix 6. Have had recent major surgery (within 21 days). 7. Have a recent history of weight loss &gt; 10% of current body weight. 8. Have serious intermittent medical illnesses which would interfere with the ability of the patient to carry out the treatment program. 9. On chronic steroid medication (&gt; 20mg/day) 10. Have primary or paraneoplastic myasthenia gravis 11. Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and followup schedule</criteria>
