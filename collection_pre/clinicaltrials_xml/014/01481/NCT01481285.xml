	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to generate normal ranges for φ, BIVA and BCC. The calculation of FMI and FFMI is based on the results of two other clinical investigations: "Generation of prediction equation to analyze body composition of adults based on Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA)" (BCA-01) and "Application and adaption of device specific body composition formulas to various ethnic groups" (BCA-02). The aim of BCA-01 was to develop prediction equations for calculating FFM, TBW, ECW and SMM based on the gold standard reference methods ADP, DXA, MRI, D2O and NaBr on the one hand and measurement data of the BIA devices on the other hand. The equations are necessary to use the device as a Body Composition Analyzer with an acceptable accuracy level for clinical practice. The aim of the study BCA-02 was to apply and adapt device specific body composition formulas to various ethnic groups.</brief_summary>
