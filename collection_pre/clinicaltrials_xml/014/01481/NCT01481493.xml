	<brief_title>Dose-finding of Multiple Dose of BT061 in Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis Incompletely Controlled on Stable Methotrexate (MTX)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients showing active rheumatoid arthritis according to ACR criteria despite at least 6 months of treatment with methotrexate fulfilling all other inclusion criteria including written informed consent and none of the exclusion criteria (see below) have the opportunity to be randomised to either treatment with BT061 or placebo, both given subcutaneously in a double-blind set-up.</detailed_description>
