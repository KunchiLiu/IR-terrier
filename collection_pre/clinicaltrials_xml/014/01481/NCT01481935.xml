	<brief_title>Enhanced Room Cleaning in Intensive Care Units to Reduce Gown and Glove Contamination With Multi-drug-resistant Bacteria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hospital infections are often caused by bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or multi-drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB). Hospital infections increase the cost of health care, length of hospital stay, and mortality compared to infections with antibiotic-susceptible organisms. Many of these antibiotic-resistant bacteria are transmitted by patient-to-patient contact. Healthcare workers are one possible vector of patient-to-patient transmission. Transient colonization of hands, clothing and protective equipment can leads to the colonization and infection of other patients. The surfaces of patient rooms are also frequently contaminated with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. A number of recent studies have concluded that patient rooms are not cleaned thoroughly or frequently enough to keep commonly touched surfaces free of bacterial contamination. Given the frequency of contact between the healthcare worker and the patient's environment, bacteria that contaminate environmental surfaces while the patient is in the room are a significant potential reservoir for patient-to-patient transmission via the hands of healthcare workers. In this study, the investigators will examine rooms of intensive care unit patients colonized with MRSA or MDRAB. The investigators will randomize these rooms to receive either standard room cleaning plus a cleaning of high-touch surfaces ('enhanced cleaning') or to receive only standard room cleaning plus a sham cleaning of high-touch surfaces ('sham enhanced cleaning'). The investigators will then culture healthcare workers' disposable isolation gowns and gloves as they exit the enrolled room after routine patient care activities. The investigators will examine the cultures for the presence of MRSA or MDRAB to determine whether additional cleaning significantly reduces the proportion of healthcare workers with contaminated gloves and gowns, and therefore may reduce the risk of transmitting these bacteria to other patients. The results of this trial will help guide future efforts to decrease patient-to-patient transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.</detailed_description>
