	<brief_summary>Previous research regarding the use of phenylephrine has excluded obese subjects (BMI &gt;35). This subgroup of patients represents a large portion of the obstetric patient population locally and nationally. It is unclear whether previous research should be extrapolated to the obese patient population. This study is being done to compare the incidence of hypotension, intraoperative nausea and vomiting, and neonatal acidosis between obese patients who receive a prophylactic phenylephrine infusion versus those who receive phenylephrine boluses for the treatment of established hypotension. This study will help us determine whether using a phenylephrine infusion or a phenylephrine bolus is the best way to prevent/treat spinal induced hypotension during cesarean deliveries in obese patients.</brief_summary>
