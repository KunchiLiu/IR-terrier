	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of sequential therapy, i.e. 5 days of PPI + amoxicillin followed by 5 days of PPI + two antimicrobial drugs( clarithromycin and tinidazole ) versus quadruple drug regimen( i.e.-14 days of PPI+ bismuth + metronidazole + tetracycline ) as second line treatment of H. pylori .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sequential Therapy Versus Quadruple Therapy as Second Line Treatment After Failure of the Standard Triple Therapy for H Pylori Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>a total of 101 patients were randomized to 2 groups : 50 in sequential group and 51 patients in quadruple group . mean age was 43 in both groups. In sequential therapy group 42 patients(84%) completed the treatment , 39 patients returned to follow up . In quadruple group only 33 patients (64.7%) completed the treatment , 29 of them returned to follow up. Compliance to the treatment was significant better in sequential group comparative to quadruple .Sides effects connected to gastro-intestinal tract were reported in 27(65.9%) of quadruple group patients and in 19(43.2%)of sequential group. The H pylori was eradicated in 23 of 39 patients in sequential group(59%), and in 19 of the 29 patients in quadruple group(65.5%). no comorbidities like smoking, diabetes or other influenced the efficacy of eradication. Sequential therapy showed the same eradication rate as second line treatment of H pylori as quadruple one, but was associated with better compliance and less adverse effects. Both treatments protocols failed to show an appropriate eradication rate in population of Southern Israel .</detailed_description>
