	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to assess the safety profile of a quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) and to demonstrate that 3 different industrial lots of QIV induce an equivalent immune response in children/adolescents (9 to 17 years of age) and adults (18 to 60 years of age). Primary Objective: - To describe the safety profile (injection site reactions and systemic events) of each vaccine during the 21 days following vaccination, and serious adverse events (including adverse events of special interest) throughout the study in all adult and child/adolescent participants. Secondary Objectives: - To demonstrate that the 3 different industrial lots of quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) induce an equivalent immune response at 21 days post-vaccination in both age groups (lot consistency) - To describe the compliance of the immunogenicity of QIV to the European Medicines Agency Note for Guidance (NfG) (CPMP/BWP/214/96) in each age group.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All participants will receive a single injection of their assigned vaccine during Visit 1. They will be followed up for safety and immunogenicity through Day 21 post-vaccination (Visit 2), and also monitored for safety for up to 6 months post-vaccination.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Aged 9 to 11 years (children), 12 to 17 years (adolescents), or 18 to 60 years (adults) on the day of inclusion For child/adolescent subjects, informed consent form has been signed and dated by the parent(s) (and subject, if applicable by local regulations), or another legally acceptable representative (and independent witness, if required by local regulations), and the assent form has been signed and dated by the subject (if applicable by the local Ethics Committee or country regulations). For adult subjects, informed consent form has been signed and dated by the subject (and an independent witness, if required by local regulations). Subject/subject and parent/legally acceptable representative is/are able to attend all scheduled visits and to comply with all trial procedures Covered by health insurance, if required by local regulation. Subject is pregnant, or lactating, or of childbearing potential (to be considered of nonchildbearing potential, a female must be premenarche or postmenopausal for at least 1 year, surgically sterile, or using an effective method of contraception or abstinence from at least 4 weeks prior to vaccination and until at least 4 weeks after vaccination) Participation at the time of study enrollment or planned participation during the present trial period in another clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical procedure Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding trial vaccination or planned receipt of any vaccine in the 3 weeks following trial vaccination Previous vaccination against influenza with the 2012 Southern Hemisphere formulation or the 20112012 Northern Hemisphere formulation in the previous 6 months with either the trial vaccine or another vaccine Receipt of immune globulins, blood or bloodderived products in the past 3 months Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy, such as anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy, within the preceding 6 months; or longterm systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months) Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a lifethreatening reaction to the vaccines used in the trial or to a vaccine containing any of the same substances Selfreported thrombocytopenia, contraindicating intramuscular vaccination based on investigator's judgment Bleeding disorder, or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion, contraindicating intramuscular vaccination based on investigator's judgment Deprived of freedom by an administrative or court order, or in an emergency setting, or hospitalized involuntarily Current alcohol abuse or drug addiction (for adolescent and adult subjects) Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, is at a stage where it might interfere with trial conduct or completion Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to investigator judgment) on the day of vaccination or febrile illness (temperature ≥ 38.0°C). A prospective subject should not be included in the study until the condition has resolved or the febrile event has subsided Identified as an investigator or employee of the investigator or study center with direct involvement in the proposed study, or identified as an immediate family member (i.e., parent, spouse, natural, or adopted child) of the investigator or employee with direct involvement in the proposed study.</criteria>
