	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of TAK-875 Compared to Glimepiride When Used With Metformin in Participants With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has increased dramatically throughout the world over the past decades despite the availability of several different treatment options. Current pharmacologic treatments include insulin, thiazolidinediones, sulfonylureas, metformin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) mimetics. A number of these treatments are associated with clinically important side effects such as low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), weight gainflud retention, exaggeration of pre-existent heart failure, and gastrointestinal side effects. These side effects and the disadvantages associated with many of the currently available antidiabetic agents can reduce compliance and limit their long-term use. Insulin is a hormone that is produced by the body to regulate blood sugar (glucose). In individuals with T2DM, the insulin produced by the body does not effectively control the amount of sugar in the bloodstream. If not properly managed, T2DM may cause elevated blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) and ultimately result in serious health problems. In response to this problem, Takeda is developing TAK-875 (an investigational drug) as an addition to diet and exercise to improve blood sugar control in patients with T2DM. TAK-875 may affect the production of insulin and may improve how the body uses the sugar in the blood. The aim of this study is to find out if TAK-875, when taken for approximately 2 years in combination with current diabetes medicine (called metformin), is safe and effective at helping people with T2DM control their high blood sugar when compared to glimepiride (a type of medication called a sulfonylurea). The study is being done to find out if the combination of TAK-875 plus metformin works as well as the combination of glimepiride plus metformin. Approximately 2430 patients worldwide aged 18 or over with T2DM, will take part in this study and will be involved in the study for up to 110 or 120 weeks. TAK-875 is being developed at Takeda Global Research and Development, Inc. as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in participants with T2DM. This study will investigate TAK-875 in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar level is inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy. Due to potential concerns about liver safety, on balance, the benefits of treating patients with fasiglifam (TAK-875) do not outweigh the potential risks. For this reason, Takeda has decided voluntarily to terminate the development activities for fasiglifam.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. In the opinion of the investigator, the participant is capable of understanding and complying with protocol requirements. 2. The participant or, when applicable, the participant's legally acceptable representative signs and dates a written, informed consent form and any required privacy authorization prior to the initiation of any study procedures. 3. The participant is male or female and 18 years of age or older with a historical diagnosis of T2DM. 4. The participant meets one of the following criteria: 1. The participant has an HbA1c level ≥7.0 and &lt;10.0%, and has been on a stable daily dose of ≥1500 mg (or documented MTD) of metformin for at least 2 months prior to Screening. This participant will immediately enter the Placebo Runin Period, or; 2. The participant has an HbA1c level ≥ 7.5 and &lt;10.5%, and has been on a stable daily dose of &lt;1500 mg of metformin without documented MTD for at least 2 months prior to Screening. After completing the Screening Visit, this participant will have their metformin dose immediately increased to ≥1500 mg (or MTD) for an 8week Titration Period. Following this 8week period, the participant must qualify for entry into the Placebo Runin Period by completing the Week 3 procedures and having an HbA1c concentration ≥7.0 and &lt;10.0%. 5. The participant has had no treatment with antidiabetic agents other than metformin within 2 months prior to Screening (Exception: if a participant has received other antidiabetic therapy for ≤7 days within the 2 months prior to Screening). 6. The participant has a body mass index (BMI) of ≤45 kg/m2 at Screening. 7. Participants regularly using other, nonexcluded medications, must be on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to Screening. However, PRN (as needed) use of prescription or overthecounter medications is allowed at the discretion of the investigator. 8. The participant is able and willing to monitor glucose with a home glucose monitor and consistently record his or her own blood glucose concentrations and complete participant diaries. Additional Inclusion Criteria Prior to Randomization 1. The participant has an HbA1c concentration ≥7.0% and &lt;10.0%, and a FPG ≤270 mg/dL (15.0 mmol/L) at the Week 1 Visit. (If the subject does not qualify for randomization based on these criteria, the assessment may be repeated weekly, for a maximum of 2 additional weeks). 2. The participant's compliance with the singleblind study medication during the Placebo Runin Period is at least 75% and does not exceed 125% based on tablet/capsule counts performed by the study staff. 3. A female participant of childbearing potential must have a negative urine hCG pregnancy test at Baseline (Day 1) prior to Randomization and prior to administration of the first dose of doubleblind study medication. 1. The participant has received any investigational compound within 30 days prior to Screening or has received an investigational antidiabetic drug within the 3 months prior to Screening. 2.
