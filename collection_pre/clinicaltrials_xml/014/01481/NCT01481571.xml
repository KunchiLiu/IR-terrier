	<brief_title>Performance Study of New Media for Vitrification of Human Oocytes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multi-center prospective sibling oocyte vitrification trial where, in the first phase, half of the patients' oocytes will be vitrified and warmed (experimental group). The remaining oocytes will not be vitrified and will serve as the control group. In the second phase all of the patients' oocytes will be vitrified and the embryo transfer will be performed in a following cycle. This simulates the situation of a normal cryopreservation embryo transfer. The study population consists of 20 women who will undergo a fresh IVF cycle during the study period. The primary objective in the first phase is to assess survival, fertilization and embryo development after oocyte vitrification/warming with the new media. The results will be compared with results from sibling oocytes which have not been vitrified. Secondary objectives are to assess the clinical results such as implantation, miscarriage and pregnancy rate as well as delivery rate and neonatal outcome. The primary objective in the second phase is to assess the delivery rate after oocyte vitrification/warming with the new media. Secondary objectives are to assess survival, fertilization, embryo development, utilization rate, pregnancy rate and neonatal outcome on the previously vitrified and warmed oocytes. The results will be compared with results from a control group of patients, treated at the same clinics within the same time period, using the same inclusion and exclusion criteria. All patients who undergo embryo transfer will have a serum beta-hCG test conducted 14 days after oocyte retrieval. If positive, repeat beta-hCG testing will be conducted 2-4 days later. If appropriate, a pregnancy ultrasound will be conducted between 6-8 weeks gestation (menstrual age) to record gestational sac(s) and fetal heart beat. The delivery outcome will also be recorded. For patients with an unsuccessful treatment, there will be a follow-up period of 6 months after study completion. From this follow-up, data from frozen cycles, i.e. from embryos after oocyte vitrification, can be evaluated as well.</detailed_description>
