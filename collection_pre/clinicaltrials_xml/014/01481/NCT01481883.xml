	<brief_summary>The aim of this project is to investigate the effect of Raloxifene 120mg in men with schizophrenia. This trial will adopt a 12 week randomised controlled model. Hypotheses 1: That the men receiving adjunctive selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM) will have a significantly greater reduction in psychosis symptoms over the course of the study than men receiving adjunctive placebo. Hypotheses 2: That the men receiving adjunctive SERM will have a significantly greater improvement in cognitive function than men receiving adjunctive placebo</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs) - A Potential Treatment for Psychotic Symptoms of Schizophrenia in Men?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With the recent advent of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMS), such as raloxifene hydrochloride, there is the potential to harness the positive estrogenic effect on central nervous system (CNS) neurotransmitter systems. While the CNS effects of raloxifene have not been fully studied, its actions are mediated through binding to estrogen receptors and can thereby regulate gene expression that is ligand, tissue or gene specific. By inference then, raloxifene would be expected to impact on dopamine and serotonin pathways in a similar fashion to unconjugated estrogen. This study aims to examine the impact of adjunctive SERM (120mg oral Raloxifene daily) treatment on the psychopathology and cognition of men with schizophrenia and related disorders</detailed_description>
