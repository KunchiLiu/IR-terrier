	<brief_summary>With Contrast Enhanced UltraSound (CEUS) cancer induced neovascularisation can be visualised with the potential to improve ultrasound imaging for prostate cancer detection and localisation significantly. The past years numerous studies have been performed with CEUS, all basing their results on subjective judgement of the investigator. CEUS image interpretation is difficult and requires a well-trained expert. To overcome these difficulties CEUS quantification techniques can be of use. The techniques used in this protocol have been developed in cooperation with the Technical University in Eindhoven (TU/e) and BRACCO, Geneva. The investigators hypothesize improvement of the PCa detection rate with quantification, compared with subjective CEUS interpretation and known numbers in literature. Also a comparison between quantification results and tumour differentiation grade (Gleason score) will be made, the investigators hypothesize a positive correlation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Population: All patients already scheduled for biopsy because of a raised ProstateSpecific Antigen (PSA) and/ or abnormal Digital Rectal Examination (DRE) in the Academic Medical Centre (AMC), excluding patients who do meet the exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria: age â‰¥ 18 years signed informed consent Exclusion criteria: Has documented acute prostatitis or urinary tract infections. History of any clinically unstable cardiac condition including class III/IV cardiac failure or righttoleft shunts. Has had severe cardiac rhythm disorders within the last 7 days. Has severe pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery pressure &gt;90 mmHg) or uncontrolled systemic hypertension or respiratory distress syndrome Has received a biopsy procedure within 30 days before admission into this study Has any medical condition or other circumstances which would significantly decrease the chances of obtaining reliable data, achieving study objectives, or completing the study.
