	<brief_summary>To explore biomarkers predictive of clinical response to sorafenib in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma using the Prometheus Platform To analyze expression and activation status of receptor tyrosine kinases in signal transduction pathways in FNA samples and circulating tumor cells. To identify negative predictive markers to sorafenib. To elucidate signal transduction pathway attributable to sorafenib resistance. To monitor changes in the RTK activation status during sorafenib treatment using circulating tumor cells. To analyze correlation between the quantity of circulating tumor cells and circulating endothelial cell precursors and treatment response to sorafenib.</brief_summary>
