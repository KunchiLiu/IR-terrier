	<brief_title>Bevacizumab With Pelvic Radiotherapy And Primary Chemotherapy in Patients With Poor-Risk Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine the pathological complete response (pCR-TRG1) rate in patients treated with 2 different schedule of bevacizumab plus primary chemotherapy and radiotherapy of the pelvic region when optimal surgery is applied. Bevacizumab will be given by intravenous infusion at the dose of 5 mg/kg concurrent with chemotherapy and radiotherapy every 2 weeks for 4 cycles from -14 days to start chemo-radiotherapy (classical schedule) or 4 days before the concurrent administration of chemotherapy and radiation therapy for 2 cycles if the number of TRG1 was not reached in the first stage with the classical schedule Simon's methods will be used to calculate sample size.Setting a and b errors as 0.05 and 0.20, respectively, and defining as minimum activity of interest (p0) a TRG1 rate=30%. In order to demonstrate a TRG1 rate ≥50% (p1), at least 6 TRG1 on the first 15 patients, and at least 19 TRG1 on a total of 46 patients should be reported in the first and second stage, respectively.</detailed_description>

History of inflammatory bowel disease and/or acute/subacute bowel occlusion Serious, nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy. Uncontrolled hypertension Clinically significant (i.e. active) cardiovascular disease, for example cerebrovascular accidents (≤ 6 months), myocardial infarction (≤ 6 months), unstable angina, New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade II or greater congestive heart failure, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication Current or recent (within 10 days prior to study treatment start) ongoing treatment with anticoagulants for therapeutic purposes. Chronic, daily treatment with highdose aspirin (&gt;325 mg/day) or other medications known to predispose to gastrointestinal ulceration. Treatment with any investigational drug within 30 days prior to enrolment. Patients with known allergy to Chinese hamster ovary cell proteins, or any of the components of the study medications Other coexisting malignancies or malignancies diagnosed within the last 5 years with the exception of basal and squamous cell carcinoma or cervical cancer in situ Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to study treatment start, or anticipation of the need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study.
