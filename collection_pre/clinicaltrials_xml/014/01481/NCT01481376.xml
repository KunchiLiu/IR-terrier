	<brief_summary>The objective of this retrospective study is to evaluate the postoperative clinical outcomes at discharge, 1 month and 12 months, associated with the use of Parietex™ ProGrip™ in Laparoscopic Transabdominal preperitoneal inguinal hernia repair. Results from this study will be used to support the short- and long-term clinical outcomes of Parietex™ ProGrip™ when used in inguinal hernia repair by laparoscopic approach. - Single center study - Population: All subjects have undergone Laparoscopic Transabdominal preperitoneal surgical treatment for inguinal hernia repair with Parietex™ ProGrip™ without additional fixation between September 2008 and March 2010 (inclusive) with at least 12 months of follow-up. The primary outcome: • Proportion of subjects who experience hernia recurrence (defect treated initially with Parietex™ ProGrip™) within 12 months post-surgery. Recurrence is defined as a clinically manifest bulge or a protrusion exacerbated by a Valsalva maneuver in the operated groin. The recurrence symptoms are assessed by phone based on the Symptoms Questionnaire and the recurrence diagnosis is confirmed during a physical examination by a physician and defined as a clinically manifest bulge or a protrusion exacerbated by a Valsalva maneuver in the operated groin. If subject has a surgical repair of the hernia within the 12 month postoperative period, it will be documented as evidence of hernia recurrence. The secondary outcome: - Incidence of Groin Pain (pain score 0-10) and analgesic use at discharge, 1 month and 12 month postoperatively - Incidence of postoperative complications including, wound infection (any infection of the incision), mesh infection (an infection of the mesh), bleeding, mesh migration, mesh erosion, fistula, small bowel obstruction, seroma, hematuria, hematoma, inflammation, chronic pains/ inguinodynia, infection, visceral adherence, allergic reactions to the components of the product at discharge, 1month and 12 month post-operatively - Patient satisfaction - Operative time - Hospital length of stay</brief_summary>
