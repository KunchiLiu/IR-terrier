	<brief_summary>This research is being done to study the effect of incorporating acupuncture into the management of migraines. The primary aim is to determine in a randomized, controlled study whether individuals experiencing migraines have fewer occurrences and less intense migraines when acupuncture is integrated with nonprescription pharmacological treatment. Nonprescription pharmacological treatment in this study refers to the use of the following over the counter medications: Aspirin, Ibuprofen, Naproxen, Acetaminophen (with or without caffeine). Aspirin, Ibuprofen, and Naproxen are members of a class of drugs known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>70 men and women between the ages of 18-65 diagnosed with migraines by a medical doctor. Participants must be using only nonprescription medication to treat their head pain. Once initial eligibility has been determined and informed consent obtained, a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) differential diagnosis will be carried out to determine the underlying cause of the migraines experienced by the participant. If the migraines are due to Liver Qi stagnation with Liver Yang rising they will be eligible for participation in the study. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: Group 1 will continue taking their current nonprescription migraine medication as needed and will receive acupuncture once a week for 8 weeks. Group 2 will continue with their current nonprescription migraine medication as needed but will not receive acupuncture. The same set of predetermined acupuncture points will be used at each session. All participants will complete a daily headache and medication use diary for four weeks on two separate occasions. In addition all participants will complete the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) survey on three separate occasions.</detailed_description>
