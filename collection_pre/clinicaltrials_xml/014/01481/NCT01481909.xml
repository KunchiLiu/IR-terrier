	<brief_summary>Study title: An exploratory, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled crossover study to assess the efficacy of 20 mg Rupatadine on the treatment of mastocytosis symptoms. Study code: SMART-2010-1 Principal Investigator, Co-Investigator, sponsor, and study centre (acc. to § 40 Abs. 4 AMG) Dr. med. F. Siebenhaar, Prof. Dr. Med. M. Maurer, Allergie-Centrum-Charité, Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Charitéplatz 1, D-10117 Berlin Biometry and biostatistical analyses Division of Biostatistics and Clinical Epidemiology, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Charitéplatz 1, D-10117 Berlin Monitoring Coordination Centre for Clinical Studies (KKS), Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Charitéplatz 1, D-10117 Berlin Clinical phase Phase II Primary objective: Reduction of wheal and flare type skin reaction after standardised provocation testing assessed by volumetric and thermographic measurements. Secondary objectives: Improvement of additional related symptoms (e.g. pruritus) and subjective affliction as assessed by symptom score, DLQI, Itchy-QoL and VAS. Study design: An exploratory, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled crossover study Type and number of patients: Male and female patients (n = 30) with cutaneous mastocytosis and indolent systemic mastocytosis with skin involvement Main criteria for inclusion: Mastocytosis patients aged 18-65 years, signed written consent, no systemic corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapy, no permanent severe diseases Test product, dose and mode of administration 20 mg Rupatadine or placebo before provocation testing, oral administration (tablets) Duration of treatment: 28 days (testing will be done at the day of last treatment) Assessment of efficacy: 1. Assessment of wheal and flare development by planimetric analyses of digital photographic, volumetric, and thermographic imaging (time lapse) before and after treatment with study medication, 2. Additional assessment of symptoms, 3. Assessment of life quality Main criteria of evaluation: Efficacy</brief_summary>
