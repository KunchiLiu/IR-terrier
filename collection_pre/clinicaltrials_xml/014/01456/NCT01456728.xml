	<brief_title>Lactobacillus Reuteri ProGastria in Helicobacter Pylori-infected Adult Subjects on Proton Pump Inhibitors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Helicobacter pylori colonises an estimated 50% of the worldÂ´s population. Despite clear clinical guidelines on the treatment of this infection there is a drive to find alternative ways to control this infection in a wider perspective without the complications of induction of antibiotic resistance in the pathogen. A good alternative is to use probiotics. Lactic acid bacteria and in particular lactobacilli have been studied for their effects in humans infected with H. pylori with some success in reducing the infection load. Studies using supplementation with L. reuteri in both symptomatic and non-symptomatic H. pylori-infected subjects show a clear reduction of infection load after 4 weeks of use and this was concomitant with a reduction in symptoms associated with the infection. Further, dietary supplementation with L. reuteri during and after the period of H. pylori eradication therapy has also been shown to reduce the side effects of this therapy without affecting the degree of eradication.</detailed_description>
