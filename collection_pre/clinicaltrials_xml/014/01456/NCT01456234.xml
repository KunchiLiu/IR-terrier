	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to see if patients with the flu would receive oseltamivir treatment more quickly if it were prescribed by a pharmacist as compared to a physician, and to see if there is any difference in the effect of treatment on flu symptoms and overall health. Another reason for doing the study is to see how accurately pharmacists can diagnose the flu as compared to physicians. Viruses that are exposed to antiviral medications (like oseltamivir) sometimes develop a resistance to the medication. This means that the medication is no longer as effective in treating the symptoms caused by the virus. The development of viral resistance to oseltamivir will also be followed in this study.</brief_summary>

Individuals presenting at the pharmacy with an oseltamivir prescription who themselves do not currently have a diagnosis of influenza (e.g., individuals filling a prescription for someone else who is currently infected with influenza; individuals filling a prescription that they or someone else will use for prevention of influenza infection or for treatment of a future influenza infection) 3.
