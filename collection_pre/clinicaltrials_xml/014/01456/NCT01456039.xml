	<brief_title>A Japanese Phase 1/2 Study to Assess the Efficacy, Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Romidepsin in Patients With Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma (PTCL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1/2, non-randomized, open-label, single-arm trial with two phases. The first phase is a 3 + 3 dose escalation phase to determine a recommended dose for treating patients with Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma (PTCL) or Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL) based on the assessment of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs).The second phase will assess efficacy at the recommended dose by measuring objective response [Complete Response (CR), Unconfirmed Complete Response (CR(u)) or Partial Response (PR)] and determining best overall response of each patient. Phase 1 will enroll a maximum of 12 patients and Phase 2 will enroll up to approximately 40 patients</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must fulfill all of the following criteria to be eligible for study participation and have: Histologically confirmed Peripheral T cell Lymphoma (PTCL) Not Otherwise Specified (NOS), Angioimmunoblastic Tcell Lymphoma, enteropathy type Tcell lymphoma, subcutaneous panniculitislike Tcell lymphoma, cutaneous Tcell lymphoma (excludes mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome) , hepatosplenic Tcell lymphoma, Anaplastic Large cell lymphoma (ALCL) [anaplastic lymphoma kinase1 (ALK1) negative], patients with ALK 1 expressing ALCL (ALK1 positive) who have relapsed disease after Autologous StemCell Transplantation, Transformed mycosis fungoides (MF), or Sézary syndrome (SS); Age ≥20 years; Written informed consent; Progressive Disease following at least one systemic therapy or refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 02; Sufficient functions of bone marrow or other organs as evidenced by Hemoglobin ≥8.0 g/dL (The value after the 7th day of transfusion) Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.0×10^9/L (The value after the 7th day of GCSF) Platelet counts ≥100 x 10^9/L, or, if bone marrow infiltration is recognized, ≥75 ×10^9/L Total bilirubin (TotalBil) ≤2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (≤3.0 x ULN in the presence of demonstrable liver metastasis) Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)/Serum GlutamicOxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT) ≤2 x Upper Limit Normal (ULN) (≤3.0 x ULN in the presence of demonstrable liver metastasis) Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)/Serum GlutamicOxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT) ≤2 x ULN (≤3.0 x ULN in the presence of demonstrable liver metastasis) Serum creatinine ≤ 2 x ULN Serum potassium ≥ lower limit of normal (LLN) and magnesium Patients for whom at least 1 measurable lesion is confirmed in the lesion assessment before enrollment; and Negative urine or serum pregnancy test on females of childbearing potential. Confirmation should be made before enrollment, and the subjects corresponding to the criteria should not be enrolled. 1. Subjects in whom central nervous lymphoma is recognized during the screening period (If brain metastasis is suspected clinically, CT should be performed.) 2. Subjects undergoing chemotherapy or immunotherapy for the purpose of treatment of the target disease within 22 days before C1D1 (including C1D1) (using antibody drugs only within 3 months before C1D1) 3. Subjects receiving local application of steroids within 15 days before C1D1 (including C1D1) Use of steroids for the purpose other than that of treatment of the target disease should be allowed (Only CTCL subjects) 4. Subjects receiving systemic application of steroids within 22 days before C1D1 (including C1D1) (It is acceptable to continue the use of the steroid for the purpose of treatment of the target disease,which administered in doses ≤ 10mg/day prednisolone or equivalent dose of other glucocorticoid. However increase of steroid dose cannot be allowed during the study period) 5. Subjects undergoing radiation therapy, PUVA therapy or TSEB for the purpose of treatment of the target disease within 22 days before C1D1 (including C1D1) 6. Subjects using other investigational products within 22 days before C1D1 (including C1D1) (using antibody drugs only within 3 months before C1D1) 7. Subjects undergoing blood transfusion and using GCSF within 8 days before C1D1 (including C1D1) 8. Subjects with the following abnormalities in the cardiac function 1. Congenital QT prolongation syndrome 2. QTc interval &gt;480 msec 3. Myocardial infarction within 6 months before C1D1. Subjects with a history of myocardial infarction between 6 and 12 months prior to C1D1 who are asymptomatic and have had a negative cardiac risk assessment (treadmill stress test, nuclear medicine stress test, or stress echocardiogram) since the event may occur 4. Significant ECG abnormalities including atrioventricular (AV) block type II, 3rd degree AV block, or bradycardia (ventricular rate less than 50 beats/min) 5. Symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) (e.g., Angina Canadian Class IIIV). 6. An ECG recorded at screening showing significant ST depression (ST depression of ≥2 mm, measured from isoelectric line to the ST segment at a point 60 msec at the end of the QRS complex). If there is any doubt, the subject should have a stress imaging study and, if abnormal, angiography to define whether or not CAD is present. 7. Congestive heart failure (CHF) that meets New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II to IV definitions and/or ejection fraction &lt;40% by MUGA scan or &lt;50% by echocardiogram and/or MRI 8. A known history of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), torsade de pointes, or cardiac arrest unless currently addressed with an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) 9. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or restrictive cardiomyopathy from prior treatment or other causes (if there is any doubt, see ejection fraction criteria above) 10. Uncontrolled hypertension, i.e., systolic blood pressure (BP) is greater than or equal to 160 mmHg or diastolic BP is greater than or equal to 95 mmHg; subjects who have a history of hypertension controlled by medication must be on a stable dose (for at least one month) 11. Subjects with cardiac arrhythmia requiring an antiarrhythmic drug 9. Concomitant use of a drug which may induce significant QT prolongation (refer to 9.2. Prohibited Concomitant Medications and Procedures.) 10. Concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors which include grapefruit juice 11.

Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody positive, HBs antigen positive or HCV antibody positive. If negative for HBsAg but HBcAb and/or HBsAb positive status, a HBV DNA test will be performed and if positive the subject will be excluded. 15. Subjects undergoing a wide range of radiation therapy in ≥30% of the bone marrow (such as all parts of the pelvic area or a half of the spinal cord) in the past. The subjects undergoing systemic radiation (including systemic electron therapy) as previous treatment for ASCT will be excluded. 16. Subjects undergoing a surgery within 15 days before C1D1 (including C1D1); however, even if more than 15 days have passed since the surgery, subjects without evidence of wound healing will be excluded. 17. Subjects who are during recovery process from severe wound or fracture. 18. Subjects with a history of allogeneic stem cell transplantation 19. Patients who are breastfeed during period of the IP administration or within 28 days after the end of the IP administration. 20.
