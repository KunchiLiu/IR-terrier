	<brief_summary>This is a prospective non-randomized multicenter clinical trial performing endobronchial and esophageal ultrasound for mediastinal lymph node staging of operable and resectable cT1-T2-selectedT3 cN1 cM0 NSCLC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of Invasive Mediastinal Staging in cN1 Lung Cancer.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Provided no mediastinal lymph node metastases are proven by echoendoscopy, all patients will subsequently undergo surgical staging. Patients without tissue proof of mediastinal nodal disease at surgical staging will undergo a thoracotomy with systematic lymph node dissection. Provided mediastinal lymph node metastases are proven by echoendoscopy, the patient goes off study protocol and can further be assessed/treated according to local clinical practice.</detailed_description>
