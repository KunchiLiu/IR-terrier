	<brief_summary>Background: Hypo- and hypernatremia are common in hospitalized patients. The differential diagnosis of dysnatremia is challenging. Osmotically inadequate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is the predominant mechanism in most dysnatremic disorders. ADH measurement is cumbersome. It is derived from a larger precursor peptide along with copeptin, which is a more stable peptide directly mirroring the production of ADH. Objective: To evaluate the additional value of copeptin to improve a currently used algorithm in the differential diagnosis of (A) severe hypoosmolar hypo- and (B) severe hypernatremia. Design: Prospective observational study.</brief_summary>
