	<brief_summary>This trial will assess the tolerability and safety of AFX-2 over a range of five dose levels in adults with low-, intermediate- or high-risk Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). The trial will also determine the impact of dose on quality of life indices and on biological and immune responses, and will assess if there is a maximum tolerated dose and/or dose-limiting toxicity in this study population.</brief_summary>
