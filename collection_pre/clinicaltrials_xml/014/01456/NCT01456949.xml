	<brief_summary>The Post-Approval Study (PAS) is a prospective multi-center, non-randomized, single arm, controlled,unblinded clinical study designed to provide long-term safety and effectiveness of the Arctic Front® Cardiac CryoAblation System.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sustained Treatment of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation Post-Approval Study (STOP AF PAS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Safety and effectiveness will be evaluated against pre-specified performance criteria as determined by the sponsor and FDA. The criteria set in this study have been previously used to demonstrate safety and effectiveness in cryoablation and radio-frequency ablation for the treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The analyses of the primary effectiveness objective will take place once all the subjects with a study cryoablation procedure attempt have reached 36 months of follow-up post-cryoablation procedure. The analysis of the primary safety objective will take place once all the subjects with a study cryoablation procedure attempt have reached 12 months of follow-up post-cryoablation procedure. The analyses for the secondary objectives will take place once all subjects with a study cryoablation attempt have reached 36 months of follow-up post-cryoablation procedure.</detailed_description>
