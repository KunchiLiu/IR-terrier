	<brief_summary>The study addresses the question if a therapy with bendamustine plus rituximab is comparable (non inferior) with the well-tried combination of fludarabine plus rituximab with regard to event free survival (EFS) in recurrent low malignant Non-Hodgkin and mantle cell lymphomas.</brief_summary>
