	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Efficacy of the AIM (Adult Identity Mentoring) 4 Teen Moms Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study uses a randomized controlled design to evaluate the efficacy of AIM (Adult Identity Mentoring) 4 Teen Moms in reducing the incidence of rapid repeat pregnancies and associated sexual risk behavior. The AIM 4 Teen Moms program is a combination of individual and small group sessions intervention that encourages parenting young women ages 15-19 years old to delay rapid repeat pregnancies for 24 months or later. It consists of seven individual 1-hour long sessions (generally conducted in the participant's home) and two 90-minute group sessions delivered over a 12 week period. Study participants will be adolescent mothers receiving services from California's Adolescent Family Life or Cal-Learn programs in the Los Angeles County area. There will be no intervention delivered to members of the control group. This study is being conducted as part of the national Evaluation of Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Approaches funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Adolescent Health.</detailed_description>
