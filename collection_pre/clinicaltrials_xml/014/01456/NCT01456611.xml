	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical equivalence and safety of the Test formulation of diclofenac sodium topical gel 1% (Anchen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) compared to the marketed formulation Voltaren® Gel (diclofenac sodium topical gel) 1% (Novartis) in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. The efficacy of both the Test and Reference formulations will also be compared to the Placebo gel to determine Superiority.</brief_summary>

History of osteoarthritis in the contralateral knee requiring medication (OTC or prescription) within 12 months of screening. 4. After a 7 day wash out of all pain medication has baseline pain on movement score of ≥ 20mm on a 100mm Visual Analogue Scale for the contralateral knee immediately prior to randomization. 5.
