	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Teen Options to Prevent Pregnancy (T.O.P.P.) Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The risk for teen pregnancy is especially high among teen mothers, leading, in some cases, to unsafe intervals between teen births. The Teen Options to Prevent Pregnancy (T.O.P.P.) program is an 18-month clinic-based program that aims to reduce repeat pregnancies among pregnant and parenting adolescents by providing telephone-based care coordination and mobile contraceptive services to this high-risk population. This study uses a randomized controlled design to compare the effectiveness of T.O.P.P. versus usual care provided to patients at participating clinics. Study participants will be adolescent mothers between the ages of 10 to 19 recruited through seven OhioHealth women's health clinics and three OhioHealth hospitals covering seven counties in central Ohio. This study is being conducted as part of the national Evaluation of Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Approaches funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Adolescent Health.</detailed_description>
