	<brief_summary>Recent evidence supports detrimental effects of advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) on vascular function (VF). Though, the effect of AGE-modified proteins alone on vascular function remained unknown. Therefore, the aim of our study is to investigate the effects of heat-treated, glycated beta-lactoglobulins (BLG) on vascular function in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and to compare it to non-glycated, heat-treated BLG.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In a double-blind, controlled, randomized, cross-over manner, 19 subjects with T2DM will receive on 2 different days beverages containing either glycated, heat-treated BLG or non-glycated, heat-treated BLG. Macrovascular (brachial ultrasound of flow mediated dilatation -FMD) and microvascular function (laser-doppler measurements of reactive hyperemia at the hand) at baseline (T0), as well as 90 (T90) and 180 (T180) minutes after each beverage will be measured.</detailed_description>
