	<brief_title>Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) Insertion With Sevoflurane and Remifentanil</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For practical purposes, opioids with the ability to suppress upper airway reflexes have been used to facilitate insertion of the LMA during anaesthesia induction. To date, however, there have been no published reports addressing the use of remifentanil to facilitate LMA insertion during sevoflurane inhalation induction in adults. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the most suitable effect-site concentration of remifentanil target-controlled infusion (TCI) for the LMA insertion during inhaled induction with 8% sevoflurane in adults.</detailed_description>
