	<brief_summary>This open-label, fixed-sequence, two-period study will assess the effect of multiple dose valproate on the pharmacokinetics of RO4917838 at steady state and vice versa in healthy male volunteers. In Period 1, subjects will receive valproate for 5 days. After a washout period of 5 days to 2 weeks, subjects will receive, in Period 2, RO4917838 for 15 days with concomitant valproate on Days 11-15. Anticipated time on study is up to 12 weeks.</brief_summary>
