	<brief_summary>This study is designed to generate data relating to patient safety, bone generating activity associated with the use of the rhBMP-2/BCP device as compared to autograft and to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a larger clinical trial in a patient population requiring spinal fusion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study of rhBMP-2/BCP in Patients With Spinal Degeneration With Instability Requiring Surgical Fusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Intervertebral Disc Degeneration</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Subject has radiographically documented spinal degeneration with instability as documented by the presence of translation &gt;= 4mm or angulation &gt;= 5Â°. Subject has intractable back pain which does not respond to conservative treatment and in the investigator's opinion, requires surgical spinal fusion. Subject's pain is predominantly associated with the back. Subject has only one level involvement at L3L4, L4L5, or L5S1. Subject is 18 years of age or greater at the time consent is given to participate in the study. Subject is willing to comply with the study plan and sign the informed consent. Subject is male or a nonpregnant, nonnursing female. All females of childbearing age must agree to use adequate contraception for a period of no less than 16 weeks following surgery. Subject has primary spinal diagnosis of a disorder other than spinal degeneration with instability at the involved surgical level. Subject has spinal stenosis or condition which requires a full laminectomy procedure. Subject has had a previous fusion, discectomy or laminectomy procedure at L3L4, L4L5 or L5S1. Subject has received drugs which may interfere with bone metabolism within two weeks prior to the planned date of spinal fusion surgery (e.g., steroids, methotrexate) or has a condition which requires postoperative medications that interfere with fusion (e.g., steroids, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or methotrexate). Subject has overt or active infection near the operative spinal region. Subject has active systemic infection. Subject has history of autoimmune disease (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus or Dermatomyositis). Subject's history includes hypersensitivity to protein pharmaceuticals (monoclonal antibodies or gamma globulins). Subject has received treatment with an investigational therapy within 28 days prior to implantation surgery or such treatment is planned during the 16 weeks following rhBMP2/BCP implantation. The subject requires electrical bone growth stimulation, allograft, or bone substitute as part of treatment. Subject has history of endocrine or metabolic disorder known to affect osteogenesis (e.g. Paget's disease, renal osteodystrophy, Ehlers Danlos syndrome, or osteogenesis imperfecta). Subject has a known diagnosis of diabetes which requires treatment with medication. Subject has received previous radiation therapy at the site to be fused. Subject is unwilling to return for required followup visits. Subject is a prisoner. Subject has insufficient bone mass which precludes surgery (e.g., severe osteopenia or osteoporosis).</criteria>
