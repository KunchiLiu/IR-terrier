	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, phase Ib/ II study (two parts) with patients that have locally advanced or metastatic HER2 negative breast cancer. The first part (phase Ib) will investigate the MTD / Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of the combination therapy of BEZ235 twice daily (b.i.d.) and weekly paclitaxel using a Bayesian model. When MTD/ RP2D is established the second part (phase II) will start. Phase II will evaluate the efficacy and the safety of weekly paclitaxel alone compared to weekly paclitaxel plus BEZ235 bid.</brief_summary>
