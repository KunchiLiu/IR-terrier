	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to admix a radiolabel with albuterol sulphate for incorporation into the Handihaler® device for inhalation studies. This will allow for the investigators to determine the regional lung deposition of drug inhaled from the standard Handihaler® device compared to a novel modification of the device to provide more effective dispersion and aerosolization of the coated albuterol powder. The new mechanism of action for proof-of-concept testing consists of a bead (5.1 mm; expanded polystyrene foam) coated with drug powder, as opposed to the standard lactose formulation-filled capsule.</brief_summary>
