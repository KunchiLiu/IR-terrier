	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies mechanically-manipulated ultrasound in finding tumors during robotic-assisted surgery in patients with prostate cancer. Diagnostic procedures, such as ultrasound, may help find prostate cancer and find out how far the disease has spread during surgery</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS) in Finding Tumors During Robotic-Assisted Laparoscopic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the feasibility and limitations of using a mechanically-manipulated transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) probe for TRUS evaluation during a da Vinci robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP). II. To collect TRUS evaluation data during RALP to guide us in deciding whether and how the mechanical manipulation of the TRUS probe will allow sufficient clarity of ultrasound imaging. OUTLINE: Patients undergo TRUS during RALP. After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 7 days.</detailed_description>
