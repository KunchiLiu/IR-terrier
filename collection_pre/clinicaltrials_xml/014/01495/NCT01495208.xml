	<brief_title>Open Label to Study to Evaluate Effect of Alfilbercept on Patients With (FVPED) Fibrovascular Pigment Epithelial Detachment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label study to evaluate the efficacy of intravitreal aflibercept injection 2mg in patients with a persistent FVPED despite at least 6 consecutive injections with ranibizumab 0.5 mg. Patients being evaluated at VRM New York with neovascular AMD who have persistent sub-foveal FVPED on OCT despite at least 6 consecutive ranibizumab injections will be considered for the study. We aim to recruit 25 patients in the study. There have been no statistical tests to calculate sample size; sample size of 25 patients is chosen, making sure that it is feasible financially to conduct the study and logistically to complete the study within 24 weeks. This is a pilot study to assess the effects of intravitreal aflibercept injection on chronic, persistent FVPEDs; currently there is no data regarding visual and anatomical outcomes for this group of patients. Patients will be reviewed at baseline and then at 4 week intervals (28 ± 7 days). They will receive intravitreal intravitreal aflibercept injection 2mg at each visit. The primary end point of the study is 24 weeks from baseline. Patients who complete the study will have received 6 injections of intravitreal aflibercept injection 2mg.</detailed_description>
