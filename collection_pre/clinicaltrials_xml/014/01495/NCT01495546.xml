	<brief_summary>In Brazil, several hip surgeries performed, especially total knee arthroplasty, which represents 1.5 million procedures (Penedo, New, 2007). The rehabilitation of these individuals is slow with respect to the march because it requires an aid and not to use the operated leg as support for three weeks, according to conventional methods. After the third week, the support becomes part and after that period (sixth week), the support becomes total. Therefore, and in order to provide better quality of life, the goal of this work is to compare the march in 40 patients divided into two groups of 20 subjects each. In the control group, the treatment approach is the traditional, i.e., without immediate loading, while the other charge will be applied immediately in the operated limb. In order to verify the possible gain in the quality of life of these patients, the SF-36 will be applied. The march will be assessed with the Time Up and Go test and the force platform and the Harris Hip score analyze the function of the hip. Individuals will receive such care at the Institute of Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital das Clinicas, Faculty of Medicine, University of São Paulo (IOT - HC - USP). The results of comparisons between the two groups and the clinical findings obtained will be subjected to appropriate statistical tests, guided by the principles of evidence-based clinical practice, seeking to facilitate and improve the lives of these individuals so they can move freely.</brief_summary>
