	<brief_summary>Cancer-related fatigue is by far the most common symptom affecting cancer patients. Combining regular dietary counseling and tailored physical activity is associated with reduced cancer-related fatigue and can improve quality of life and body weight control. We propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial which purpose is to evaluate the effect of an intervention combining physical exercise and nutritional therapeutic education on cancer-related fatigue. To gain behavioral change towards PA and nutrition habits, interventions will take place within hospitals, on the same days of adjuvant treatments.</brief_summary>
