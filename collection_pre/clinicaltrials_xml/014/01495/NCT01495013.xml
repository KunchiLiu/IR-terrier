	<brief_summary>The aim of this 20 week study is to show that glimepiride/atorvastatin fixed dose combination tablet is safe and as effective as atorvastatin + glimepiride combination taken as separate tablets, in improving glycaemic control (glycated haemoglobin, HbA1c) and cholesterol levels (Low-density lipoprotein, LDL) in diabetic subjects, who are inadequately controlled on a stable dose of metformin. Eight dose combinations will be included.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison of Atorvastatin and Glimepiride Fixed Dose Combination and Atorvastatin and Glimepiride Loose Combination in the Treatment of Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) are initially provided with lifestyle advice in order to manage the condition by diet, exercise and weight reduction, followed by treatment with metformin. However, many patients do not gain adequate control of fasting glucose by these methods and other anti-diabetic agents are needed. Furthermore, these patients have an increased cardiovascular risk compared with the general population. Approximately one half of patients with T2D die prematurely of a cardiovascular cause and approximately 10% die of renal failure. Atherogenic dyslipidemia, which is defined as the triad of elevated triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and small low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) particles, is commonly found in individuals with T2D. In diabetic patients, the LDL particles tend to be smaller, denser, and more atherogenic than in the general population. As a result, in patients with diabetes, lowering LDL-C levels may lead to a greater benefit in terms of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction than in patients without diabetes. Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated significant benefits of lipid-lowering (primarily statin) therapy on CVD outcomes for primary and secondary prevention, irrespective of baseline lipid levels. Hence, clinical treatment guidelines recommend that patients with T2D should be treated with both an anti-diabetic agent and a statin. Glimepiride is an established once-daily sulphonylurea for use as first-line therapy, and is often used in patients who are metformin intolerant, or in those who are failing to achieve glucose control on metformin monotherapy. Atorvastatin is an established statin that is indicated for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in diabetic patients, without clinically evident coronary heart disease (CHD), irrespective of whether cholesterol is raised. The risk:benefit of both glimepiride and atorvastatin is well established and described in the approved product labels. There is widespread use of both glimepiride and atorvastatin, prescribed separately, in the T2D population. The available literature indicates that there is no drug-drug interaction risk associated with this combination therapy and no clinical PK interactions between atorvastatin and glimepiride have been recorded. A once-daily combination product which combines both glimepiride and atorvastatin will fulfil an unmet clinical need in simplifying patient treatment regimens in a patient population who have a significant disease burden. Providing concurrent access to a statin in patients with T2D, in addition to medication to manage glucose levels, is a critical requirement for ensuring appropriate management of cardio-metabolic risk. In this study, subjects already on a stable dose of metformin will be randomised to either to receive the glimepiride/atorvastatin fixed dose combination treatment or atorvastatin + glimepiride combination taken as separate tablets. The starting dose for all subjects will be 1mg glimepiride and 10mg atorvastatin. The glimepiride dose will be titrated up if the average fasting glucose is &gt;7.0mmol/L. The atorvastatin dose will be titrated up if LDL is &gt;2.6mmol/L. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of the glimepiride/atorvastatin fixed dose combination compared with glimepiride +atorvastatin taken as separate tablets in reducing HbA1c and LDL.</detailed_description>
