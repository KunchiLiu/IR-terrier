	<brief_summary>Exposure to air pollution is a well established risk factor for the development of heart disease. Firefighters are exposed to excess air pollution in the form of wood smoke during the extinguishing of forest or woodland fires. Heart attacks in on-duty firefighters have been linked to specific duties and in particular fire suppression, but the reasons for this increase in risk are not well understood. Exposure to wood smoke may alter blood vessel function and increase blood clot formation to explain the link between fire suppression and heart attacks. The investigators wish to determine the effect of exposure to wood smoke at concentrations found at the perimeter of a woodland fire on blood vessel function and clotting in healthy non-smoking male professional firefighters or volunteers. Volunteers will be studied before and after inhalation of wood smoke or clean air for one hour in a purpose built whole-body exposure chamber. The investigators will perform comprehensive vascular assessments thereafter. Understanding the effects of wood smoke on the blood vessels and clotting will be an important first step in helping to protect firefighters from heart disease. Through research, the investigators hope to identify methods to minimise the risk of heart attacks in firefighters and understand the health effects of a major source of air pollution that is relevant to the general population.</brief_summary>
