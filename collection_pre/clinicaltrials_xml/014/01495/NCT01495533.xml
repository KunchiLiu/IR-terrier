	<detailed_description>Prospective, controlled, multicenter, randomized, single-blind trial. The aim is to examine the treatment of coronary Bare Metal Stent restenosis with a drug coated AngioSculpt scoring balloon. Patients are randomized to treatment by an AngioSculpt scoring balloon (no drug coating)or a drug coated AngioSculpt scoring balloon (paclitaxel 3.0 µg/mm²). Primary efficacy endpoint is late lumen loss in-segment at 6 months. Key secondary endpoints include procedural Success, MACE (cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, and clinically driven target lesion revascularization at 6 months). Individual clinical endpoints include stent thrombosis (ARC), cardiac death, any death, target vessel myocardial infarction, any infarction, clinically driven target lesion revascularization, clinically driven target vessel revascularization, any revascularization.</detailed_description>
