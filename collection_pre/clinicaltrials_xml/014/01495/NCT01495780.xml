	<brief_summary>Remote Health Monitoring (RHM) is the assessment of one's own symptoms at home between doctor visits, using things like at-home breathing tests, electronic diaries to answer questionnaires, and other monitoring devices. The hypothesis of this study is that the health and quality of life of people with COPD who do RHM for one year will be better than people with COPD who do not do RHM. Subjects who are at least 40 years old, have been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), also known as chronic bronchitis or emphysema, and are current or former smokers will be invited to participate. This study is paid for by eResearch Technology (eRT). Subjects will complete 2 visits at UCLA, separated by one year of RHM. All subjects will participate in RHM. RHM will involve daily monitoring at home using a few electronic devices: blood oxygen levels, symptoms, medication use, breathing tests, and activity monitoring. Visits will include physical exam and medical history, ECG, questionnaires, breathing tests, and exercise tests.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age &gt;40 years. Clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe COPD in accordance with the definition of the American Thoracic Society (ATS).9 Smoking history &gt;10 packyears. Postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC&lt;70% and FEV1&lt;70% based on NHANES III reference values Domestic situation felt to be supportive of remote health monitoring. Ability to give informed consent. Clinical diagnosis of asthma. Pulmonary disease other than COPD (e.g., lung cancer, sarcoidosis, active tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, or alpha1antitrypsin deficiency) or had lung volume reduction. Any other active disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through study participation (e.g. unstable cardiovascular disease, renal failure, stroke). Previously diagnosed cancer is considered a significant disease unless it is in complete remission for 2 years at the initial visit. Any other disease that is lifethreatening and carries a prognosis less than two years that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to influence the clinical course during the conduct of this trial. Myocardial infarction within 6 weeks of enrolment. Use of longterm oxygen therapy (LTOT) prescribed for greater than 12 hours a day. A known or suspected history of drug or alcohol abuse within 2 years prior to the initial visit.</criteria>
