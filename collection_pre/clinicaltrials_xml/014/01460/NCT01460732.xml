	<detailed_description>Eligible patients, as described in Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria, will be instructed to use Microlife WatchBP Home-Nocturnal oscillometric device, in order to measure their BP two times with one-minute interval, in the morning between 6 and 9 am and in the evening between 6 and 9 pm respectively for six days. These six days shall be normal working days, selected be the patient, within a time-frame of two weeks approximately. Patients should be sitting for at least five minutes and calm. During three out of those six days, they will apply and activate the same device, in order to take BP measurements while they will be asleep. Those measurements are going to be taken automatically by the device, the first 2-hours after the activation and another two with one-hour interval. Measurements will be averaged as awake and asleep BP values, with a potential to derive, if so wished, separate averages of awake-morning and awake-evening BP values. Microlife WatchBP O3 Ambulatory Blood Pressure Measurement (ABPM) device will be applied by a doctor to each patient and it will be removed the next day by a doctor. BP measurements will be performed every 20 minutes for 24 hours. BP measurements taken during awake and asleep hours for each patient, will be analyzed separately. Additionally, triplicate sitting Clinic Blood Pressure measurements, with one-minute interval, will be performed with the Microlife WatchBP Home-Nocturnal device during each patient's visit at the Hypertension Center. Patients will visit Hypertension Center three times, one to apply the ABPM device and one to remove it and provide the Microlife WatchBP Home-Nocturnal device and another one to bring it back. This will take approximately two weeks.</detailed_description>
