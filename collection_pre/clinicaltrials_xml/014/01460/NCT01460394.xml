	<brief_title>Normative Data of Brain Network Activation in Adolescents and Young Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently, there is no reliable, practical, and non-invasive method for assessing changes in electrophysiological activity of the brain associated with brain-related pathologies, e.g., concussion, ADHD, autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), etc. Event Related Potentials (ERPs), which are temporal reflections of the neural mass electrical activity of cells in specific regions of the brain that occur in response to stimuli, may offer such a method, as they provide both a noninvasive and portable measure of brain function. The ERPs provide excellent temporal information, but spatial resolution for ERPs has traditionally been limited. However, by using high-density electroencephalograph (EEG) recording spatial resolution for ERPs is improved significantly. The paradigm for the current study will combine neurophysiological knowledge with mathematical signal processing and pattern recognition methods (BNA) to temporally and spatially map brain function, connectivity and synchronization. The need of objective measures that will help the clinician in its decision making in brain-related pathologies is recognized. BNA is a new imaging modality that has been developed to fill this gap.</detailed_description>
