Are currently enrolled in, have completed or discontinued within the last 30 days from, a clinical trial involving an investigational product; or are concurrently enrolled in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study Have known allergies/intolerance to LY2216684 or quinidine, related compounds, or any components of the formulation Are persons who have previously received the investigational product in this study, have completed or withdrawn from this study or any other study investigating LY2216684 within 6 months prior to Screening. Have an abnormality in the 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that, in the opinion of the investigator, increases the risks associated with participating in the study Have a history or show evidence of significant active neuropsychiatric disease or have a history of suicide attempt or ideation Have a history of or current cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, endocrine, hematological, or neurological disorders capable of significantly altering the absorption, metabolism, or elimination of drugs; of constituting a risk when taking the study medication; or of interfering with the interpretation of data Regularly use known drugs of abuse and/or show positive findings on urinary drug screening Show evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and/or positive human HIV antibodies Show evidence of hepatitis C and/or positive hepatitis C antibody Show evidence of hepatitis B and/or positive hepatitis B surface antigen Are women with a positive pregnancy test or women who are lactating Intend to use overthecounter or prescription medication within 14 days prior to dosing or during the study unless deemed acceptable by the investigator and Sponsor's medical monitor. Exceptions include influenza vaccinations, the use of topical medication (provided there is no evidence of chronic dosing with the risk of systemic exposure), occasional use of acetaminophen/paracetamol/ibuprofen, and hormone replacement therapy including thyroid replacement (stable dose for at least 1 month).
