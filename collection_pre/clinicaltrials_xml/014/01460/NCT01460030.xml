	<criteria>Patients who meet any one of the following. Patients with a diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma and corrected serum calcium &gt; 11.3 mg/dL at the latest screening test. Patients with intractable PHPT (defined as follows: impossible to localize parathyroid tumor before initial surgery or in relapse after surgery, or impossible to perform parathyroidectomy (PTx) for complications, and corrected serum calcium is &gt; 12.5 mg/dL at the screening test). Patients who provided their voluntary written informed consent to participate in the study. Patients diagnosed with malignant tumor except for parathyroid carcinoma, nonmelanoma skin cancer, and carcinoma in situ of the cervix within 5 years before enrollment. Patients receiving anticancer chemotherapy except for the treatment of parathyroid carcinoma. Patients diagnosed with hypercalcemia associated with malignant tumors other than parathyroid carcinoma. Patients who had hypersensitivities to cinacalcet HCl preparations or vehicles.</criteria>
