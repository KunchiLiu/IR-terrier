	<brief_summary>This study is a multi-centre retrospective observational research study which will be conducted in UK centres with specialised liver surgical services. The study will involve retrospective review of medical records of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with metastases confined to the liver, defined locally as unresectable without downsizing therapy at first review by a Hepatobiliary Multi Disciplinary Team (HPB MDT). Erbitux is available for use in combination with chemotherapy as a downsizing treatment for patients with previously unresectable metastases. The study aims to examine liver resection rates achieved in normal clinical practice in order to inform National Health Service (NHS) clinical and policy decision making and to further understanding of how cetuximab is used in a standard clinical setting. This study intends to estimate the proportion of patients with unresectable liver metastases who undergo liver resection following downsizing treatment with chemotherapy plus cetuximab.</brief_summary>
