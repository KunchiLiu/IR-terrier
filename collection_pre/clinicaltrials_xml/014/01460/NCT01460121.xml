	<brief_summary>The diagnosis and management of acute vertigo and dizziness is most of the time an easy task for the general practitioner. However, following an acute vestibular disorder and very often with no any overt cause, a considerable number of patients complain on chronic dizziness and subjective disturbance of balance despite normal clinical and laboratory tests. Patients describe that perceptual visual stimulus provoke or aggravate their symptoms that are frequently accompanied by anxiety. These cases have been described in the medical literature as Phobic Postural Vertigo, Visual Vertigo, Chronic Subjective Dizziness and Motion and Space Discomfort (2,3,4,5). Treatment of these conditions includes physical therapy (similar to vestibular rehabilitation exercises) and anti-anxiety or anti-depressant agents such as benzodiazepines and SSRI, however, the effectiveness of these approaches is debatable. Because visual stimuli play a crucial role in space orientation and motion perception, it is reasonable to hypothesize that certain visual stabilizing signals applied on the peripheral visual field (that is involved mainly in the perception of motion) could be of help in patients suffering from dizziness. This is the rationale of a new technology (SMB- Senso Mental Balance Technology) developed to alleviate the feelings of dizziness. Trial is conducted in Meir Medical Center, Israel. Recruitment only in Israel!</brief_summary>
