	<brief_summary>Following surgery for female urinary incontinence and/or pelvic organ prolapse, women are sometimes temporarily unable to empty their bladders and are sent home with a transurethral indwelling catheter attached to a bag which holds urine. The goal of this study is to compare a new type of patient-operated catheter without a bag to the catheter with a bag for ease of use, comfort and quality of life for patients during the postoperative recovery period. This new catheter, the OPTION-vf, is approved by the FDA and is available on the market.</brief_summary>
