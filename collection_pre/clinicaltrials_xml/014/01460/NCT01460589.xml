Detailed goal of study: The primary endpoint: This study is designed to assess whether early commencement of adjuvant chemotherapy improves the 3-year disease-free survival, overall survival and recurrence rate. The secondary endpoint: This study aims to compare short-term cumulative complications between early and conventional commencement of adjuvant chemotherapy after laparoscopic resection of colon cancer. This study will also assess the quality of life and side effects of chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
