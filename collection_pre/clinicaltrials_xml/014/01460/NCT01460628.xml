	<brief_title>Effect of Nuvigil on Fatigue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fatigue is one of the most prevalent symptoms occurring in peri- and postmenopausal women. It is strongly associated with reduced quality of life in this population. Studies have shown a strong association between fatigue and menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, vaginal symptoms, and sexual dysfunction. Because sleep disturbance commonly co-occurs in women with hot flashes as a result of nocturnal hot flashes disrupting sleep, sleep disturbance may explain the association between hot flashes and fatigue in this population. However evidence suggests that fatigue can occur in the absence of sleep disruption, indicating that sleep problems do not exclusively explain the etiology of fatigue in this population. Armodafinil is a wakefulness-promoting agent that acts as a central nervous system stimulant. It is chemically and pharmacologically unrelated to other CNS stimulants, such as methylphenidate and amphetamine. Armodafinil is FDA approved to increase wakefulness in patients with excessive sleepiness due to narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea, and shift work sleep disorder. It has not be studied in menopause-associated fatigue. In the proposed study, the investigators plan to investigate the effect of armodafinil on quality of life and fatigue in a population of peri- and postmenopausal women with fatigue and reduced quality of life who do not have primary sleep disorders, significant levels of insomnia, or depression.</detailed_description>
