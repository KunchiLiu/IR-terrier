	<brief_summary>The study is an open-label extension study, offering patients who participated and completed previous studies 901 and 910 (an extension to 901) to continue treatment with DiaPep277 and clinical follow-up, for up to 3 additional years.The aim of the study is to collect safety and efficacy data of long term treatment effect of Diapep277.Only patients who completed studies 901 or 910 and still have stimulated C-peptide level equal to or above 0.2 nmol/L will be eligible for this extension study</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>OPen Label Study to Evaluate Long Term Treatment Effect of DiaPep277</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is an open-label extension study, offering patients who participated and completed previous studies 901 and 910 (an extension to 901) to continue treatment with DiaPep277 and clinical follow-up, for up to 2 additional years.The aim of the study is to collect safety and efficacy data of long term treatment effect of Diapep277.Only patients who completed studies 901 or 910 and still have stimulated C-peptide level equal to or above 0.2 nmol/L will be eligible for this extension study. The optimal dose and dosing regimen for this study will be the same as applied in the phase 3 study (901) and its extension study protocol (910), namely 1.0 mg DiaPep277® administered every 3 months. These conditions were determined as optimal based on the outcome of the phase 2 studies. For patients who just completed the 2-year 901 study, a 3-year extended treatment will be offered with 13 administrations; patients who completed the 2-year 910 extension study will be offered a 3rd year of treatment with 5 additional administrations.</detailed_description>

Patients on conventional insulin regime that had HbA1c&lt;7% over the last 6 months can be recruited without switching to intensive insulin regime. The subject has any significant diseases or conditions, including psychiatric disorders and substance abuse that, in the opinion of the Investigator, are likely to affect the subject's response to treatment or the ability to complete the study. The subject has a history of any kind of malignant tumor (not including basal cell skin cancer). The subject has clinical evidence of any diabetesrelated complication that in the opinion of the Investigator would interfere with the subject's participation in and/or completion of the study. Subject has history of endogenous allergic reactivity The subject has known allergy to lipid emulsions. The subject has a known immune deficiency from any disease, or a condition associated with an immune deficiency. The subject is receiving immunosuppressive or immunomodulating agents or cytotoxic therapy or any medication that in the opinion of the Investigator might interfere with the study. The subject has any of the following clinically significant laboratory abnormalities:Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than three times the upper limit of the normal (ULN) at the ScreeningExt Visit.Total bilirubin greater than 1.3 times the ULN at the ScreeningExt Visit.Subjects with severe renal failure at the ScreeningExt visit Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, confirmed by repeat measurement,which may interfere with the assessment of safety and / or efficacy of the study drug, other than hyperglycemia and glycosuria at the Screening Ext Visit.Fasting triglycerides &gt;1000 mg/dL (11.3 mmol/L) at the ScreeningExt Visit. Suitable medical therapy for treatment of hyperlipidemia is allowed. The subject is a known or suspected drug abuser. The subject is known to test positive for HIV antibodies. The subject has chronic hematologic disease. The subject has liver disease such as cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis. The subject has received any investigational drug within 3 months prior to Visit 12, other than DiaPep277 that was administered during study 901 or 910. The subject has had a severe blood loss within 2 months before the first dose of the study medication.</criteria>
