	<brief_summary>Two different treatments were given to large angle horizontal strabismus (eso and exotropia) adult patients who agree to participate of the study. Inform consents were required for participants. Group 1 (12 patients) received conventional recess-resect surgery plus intraoperative injection of botulinum toxin A (5U). Group 2 (11 patients) received only conventional recess-resect surgery. The patients were randomly located in one of the groups. The angles of horizontal deviation were compared between the groups before and six months after treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients underwent recess/resection surgery on the non-fixating eye using conventional technique under local anesthesia. The extent of surgery was determined based on our usual amounts. Before re-attaching the recessed muscle to the sclera, 5 units of botulinum toxin in 0.1 ml of hyaline solution were, or 0.1 ml of hyaline solution alone were was injected into the posterior muscle belly by the surgeon who was unaware of the contents of each syringe.</detailed_description>
