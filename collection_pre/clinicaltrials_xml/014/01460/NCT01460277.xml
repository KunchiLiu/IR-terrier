	<brief_summary>The purpose of this current prospective study is to assess and compare the effects of a hydrotherapy exercise programme against a conventional land-based exercise programme in individuals with hemiplegia. Both exercise interventions aim at improving posture, balance and weight-bearing capability. Patients were randomized to the hydrotherapy or conventional therapy groups according to balance function (Berg Balance Scale score) and age (age&lt;59 and &gt;60 years). The physical examination consisted of (1) a lower-limb motor function recovery of the paretic side score according to the 6-stage Brunnstrom scale, (2) the hemiplegic limb strength measured by the Motricity Index, (3) the strength of ankle dorsiflexors and plantarflexors by manual muscle testing, (4) the spasticity of the ankle score by Modified Ashworth Scale, (5) the trunk function through the Trunk Control Test, (6) the postural control assessed by Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke Patients and (7) the functional status measured with the Functional Independence Measure. Postural sway was evaluated with a pressure platform by using the variables of center of pressure (COP) displacements in the mediolateral (ML) and anteroposterior (AP) directions. The results will be collected and evaluated using statistical programme SPSS.</brief_summary>
