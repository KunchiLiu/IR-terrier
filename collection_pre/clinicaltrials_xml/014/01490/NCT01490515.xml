The investigators intended to investigate if embryo assessment using non-invasive metabolomic profiling leads to increased implantation rates compared to routine morphology evaluation alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Embryo Selection Using Non-invasive Metabolomic Analysis Versus Morphology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metabolomics was recently introduced in human IVF for non-invasive identification of viable embryos with the highest developmental competence. The aim of the present study was to determine whether embryo selection using non-invasive metabolomic profiling as an adjunct to morphology leads to increased implantation rates compared to routine morphology evaluation alone.</detailed_description>
