	<brief_title>Medtronic Treat to Range (TTR) Closed-Loop Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a closed-loop "treat-to-range" (TTR) system in an inpatient clinical research center setting. The TTR system only effects insulin delivery when the glucose is projected to be above or below specified target ranges. These initial studies will assess the safety of this algorithm (mathematical equation) under the extreme conditions of a missed meal insulin bolus and meal over-insulinization. This is a "hybrid" system, which allows the research team to deliver insulin boluses manually with the TTR controller only becoming active when blood glucose levels are projected to be out of the specified range.</detailed_description>
