	<brief_summary>Pharmacologic alternatives in statin-intolerant patients include ezetimibe and nutraceuticals (i.e. compounds derived from foods with cholesterol lowering actions). The investigators will compare the efficacy and tolerability of ezetimibe versus a nutraceutical-based protocol in statin-intolerant patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ezetimibe Versus Nutraceuticals in Statin-intolerant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Treatment with statins has a class I indication after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), but is often discontinued by patients due to side effects. Pharmacologic alternatives shown to be useful after PCI include ezetimibe and nutraceuticals (i.e. compounds derived from foods with cholesterol lowering actions). It remains unknown, however, which of these two therapeutic approaches is more effective after PCI. Purpose The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of ezetimibe versus a nutraceutical-based protocol in statin-intolerant patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention.</detailed_description>
