	<brief_summary>Very low dose (VLD) cyclobenzaprine at bedtime has shown promise as a treatment for fibromyalgia, but the chemistry of cyclobenzaprine requires new formulation technology for bedtime use. The present trial is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of TNX-102 2.4 mg (a new formulation of cyclobenzaprine designed to result in increased dosage precision and decreased potential for morning grogginess) and to compare the bio-availability of TNX-102 2.4 mg and cyclobenzaprine 5 mg tablets under fasting or fed conditions.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Very low dose (VLD) cyclobenzaprine at bedtime has shown promise as a treatment for fibromyalgia, but the chemistry of cyclobenzaprine requires new formulation technology for bedtime use. Employing a proprietary mixture of approved lipids with cyclobenzaprine, TNX-102, is designed to provide predictable absorption of cyclobenzaprine and to result in increased dosage precision and decreased potential for morning grogginess. As a first step in the development of TNX-102 in the treatment of fibromyalgia, the present single-center, randomized, open-label, single-dose, three-way-crossover trial is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of TNX-102 2.4 mg (a dose based on the results of a previous Phase 2a, proof-of-concept study - VPI-CY-0001.1) and to compare the rate and extent of absorption of TNX-102 2.4 mg and cyclobenzaprine 5 mg tablets under fasting or fed conditions.</detailed_description>
