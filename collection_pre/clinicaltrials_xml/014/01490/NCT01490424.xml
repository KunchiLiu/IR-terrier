	<brief_summary>Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) is a cell surface receptor expressed on neutrophils and monocytes. TREM-1 acts to amplify inflammation and serves as a critical mediator of inflammatory response in the context of sepsis. Blocking of TREM-1 can protect against sepsis in mice. This study was designed to investigate whether TREM-1 genomic variations were associated with the prognosis of sepsis. We sequenced 30 sepsis patients with TREM-1 gene of four exons by PCR sequencing. When analyzing the results of sequencing, we found two gene polymorphisms located in exon-2 and exon-4, respectively. Compare with the NCBI dbSNP and Hapmap database, one polymorphisms located in exon-2 is non-synonymous variation rs2234237（Ser25Thr）, the other one located in exon-4 is synonymous variation rs2234246. Two common polymorphisms (rs2234237,rs2234246) within the TREM-1 gene were detected in 80 patients with severe sepsis and in 80 healthy control subjects. This study was explored that whether or not polymorphisms detected within the TREM-1 gene may play a major role in the predisposition to prognosis of sepsis in a Chinese Han cohort.</brief_summary>
