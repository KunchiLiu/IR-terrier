	<brief_summary>Pemetrexed has demonstrated a favorable response with minimal toxicity when used as single agent as first-line and second-line treatment for advanced urothelial carcinoma. The response rates were 32% and 28% for the first-line and second-line setting, respectively. Cisplatin is one the most active chemotherapeutic agents in urothelial cancer, frequently used as combination chemotherapy such as GP (gemcitabine plus cisplatin) or MVAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, adriamycin, and cisplatin). Pemetrexed and cisplatin showed favorable activity profile in advanced non-small cell lung cancer with highly favorable toxicity profile. This study is to assess the efficacy and safety of pemetrexed plus cisplatin in advanced urothelial carcinoma.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologic or cytologic diagnosis of urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma with the exception of micropapillary subtype Patients must have recurrent disease (locally advanced or metastatic) that is not amenable to local therapy or newly diagnosed distant metastatic disease Measurable disease defined by RECIST v.1.0 ECOG performance status of 2 or better Adequate organ and bone marrow function defined as Other tumor type than urothelial carcinoma Presence or history of CNS metastasis Prior systemic chemotherapy or immunotherapy (but prior local intravesical chemotherapy or immunotherapy was allowed. And recurrent disease after adjuvant or neoadjuvant cisplatinbased systemic chemotherapy is allowed if the last chemotherapy was administered 1 year or more before the patient enrollment.)
