	<brief_title>FIRE AND ICE: Comparative Study of Two Ablation Procedures in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of isolating the PVs with either the cryoballoon or a RF ablation technique with a ThermoCool catheter, a system which can be regarded as standard for ablation. In total 762 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation has been randomized for either radiofrequency (RF) or cryoballoon. With both techniques, PV isolation will be performed. Primary end point of the trial is the time to first recurrence of atrial arrhythmias or prescription of anti-arrhythmic drugs after a blanking period of three months. Treatment success will be evaluated by using weekly electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring (transtelephonic transmission/Tele-ECG) and using Holter electrocardiograms.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Symptomatic PAF with at least two episodes and at least one episode documented (30 seconds episode length, documented by ECG within last 12 months). Documented treatment failure for effectiveness of at least one antiarrhythmic drug(AAD Type I or III, including βblocker and AAD intolerance). ≥ 18 and ≤ 75 years of age. Patients who are mentally and linguistically able to understand the aim of the trial and to show sufficient compliance in following the trial protocol. Patient is able to verbally acknowledge and understand the associated risks, benefits, and treatment alternatives to therapeutic options of this trial: cryoballoon ablation system or standard RF ablation technique. The patients, by providing informed consent, agree to these risks and benefits as stated in the patient informed consent document. All the details have been presented to him and he has signed the informed consent form for the trial. General exclusion criteria Any disease that limits life expectancy to less than one year.
