	<brief_summary>Investigation of systemic catechin exposure following topically administered Veregen® 15% ointment in patients with external genital and perianal warts and following oral intake of a standardized green tea beverage in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic parameters for the main catechin EGCg used as a marker of overall catechin exposure following dermal administration in the patient group will only be calculated if sufficiently consistent data can be obtained e.g. sufficient plasma catechin concentrations to pharmacokinetically evaluate plasma profiles for plasma catechin concentrations. If applicable, a safety margin for ointment use might need to be established with respect to intolerable systemic exposures of catechins following application of Veregen® ointment. In treatment arm 1, patients with anogenital warts will apply Veregen® 15% ointment 250 mg three times daily: in the morning, at midday, and in the evening on the defined anogenital administration area (total dose of 750 mg/d) for one week . In treatment arm 2, healthy subjects will ingest 500 mL commercially available green tea beverage ("Lipton® Green Limone" distributed by PepsiCo Deutschland GmbH, Neu-Isenburg, Germany), three times daily in the morning, at midday, and in the evening (total dose of 1500 mL/d) for one week. Plasma samples will be collected to aim for a complete pharmacokinetic assessment (over 24 hours) on Days 1 and 2 at Visit 2 and on Days 7 and 8 at Visit 3 (one week after first dosing). To avoid any influence on overall systemic catechin exposure deriving from any other source than Veregen® or Lipton Green Tea, all subjects participating in the trial (patients and healthy volunteers) will be asked to follow a defined diet abstaining from food or beverages known to containing catechins (a list of all prohibited and allowed foods and beverages will be provided to all subjects). For concomitant medication, only paracetamol and oral contraceptives are allowed.</brief_summary>
