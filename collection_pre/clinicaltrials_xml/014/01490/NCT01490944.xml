	<detailed_description>The study is a randomized clinical trial to be conducted on mild or moderately anaemic adolescent girls (11-18 yrs) in a slum in Delhi. Anaemic adolescent girls (n=360) will be randomly divided into two groups. Group 1(n=180) will be given weekly supplementation of Iron (100 mg) and Folic acid (500 mcg) for six months, whereas group 2 (n=180) will be given weekly supplementation of Iron Folic Acid and cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) to assess the impact of Vitamin B12 supplementation on reducing the prevalence of anaemia. For first six weeks, 500 mcg/ week of cyanocobalamin will be given , followed by maintenance dose of 15 mcg/ week for rest of 20 weeks. Anthropometric measurements and dietary information will be collected besides biochemical analysis. IEC sessions will be organized for both the groups.The study hypothesis is that Vitamin B12 supplementation along with iron folic acid (IFA) is more effective in reducing the prevalence of anaemia as compared to IFA supplementation alone.</detailed_description>
