	<brief_summary>The Primary Objective of the study is to develop a customized regimen for oral immunotherapy that reflects what the subject is allergic in a clinically significant way (i.e., the offending food allergen is defined as a food allergen with a positive skin test or positive specific IgE and a positive DBPCFC). Therefore, the investigators prefer that both single and multiple food allergy subjects are included in the study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Moderate to severe peanut and/or egg and/or milk and/or tree nut and/or seed allergic subjects between the ages of 4 to 55 years old. Sensitivity to food allergen will be documented by a positive skin prick test result (see Appendix for details) or allergen specific ImmunoCAP IgE level with 7 kU/L as a lower limit of eligibility. No absolute contraindications are known. However, the risk of serious systemic anaphylactic reactions to food allergens suggests a number of preexisting conditions that should be considered relative contraindications. Among those conditions are acute infections, autoimmune disease, severe cardiac disease, and treatment with betaadrenergic antagonistic drugs (betablockers). Subjects having a history of severe anaphylaxis to food allergens that will be desensitized in this study requiring intubation or admission to an ICU, frequent allergic or nonallergic urticaria, or history consistent with poorly controlled persistent asthma.</criteria>
