	<brief_summary>Despite substantial therapeutic advances, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) remains difficult to treat. One promising new area of research is in post-reactivation pharmacologic intervention, which is based upon the concept of blockade of memory reconsolidation. Recent animal research suggests that reactivation (retrieval) of a stored memory can return it to a labile (alterable) state from which it must be restabilized in order to persist. This process is called "reconsolidation," and various drugs have been found to block it in animals. This blockade may lead to a weakening of the original memory trace. The aim of this study is to pilot the effect of mifepristone on physiologic responding during traumatic imagery. Although mifepristone is widely and safely used to cause a medical abortion, it is also a powerful stress hormone receptor blocker. These stress hormones, called glucocorticoids, may enhance memory (re)consolidation. Indeed, a recent study in animals reported that mifepristone blocked reconsolidation of context-conditioned fear in rats. Reconsolidation blockade is a two-stage process. First, the memory must be destabilized by recalling it. Second, reconsolidation of the memory must be blocked by a drug. Memory traces formed under stressful conditions may resist destabilization and thus are inaccessible to reconsolidation blockers. However, when a reconsolidation blocker was paired with d-cycloserine (DCS) in animals that had been trained under stressful conditions, reconsolidation blockade became successful. These results suggest that DCS promotes the destabilization of resistant memory traces. The traumatic memories of individuals with PTSD may be particularly resistant to destabilization. Therefore, this study will compare mifepristone paired with DCS to placebo controls. The same script-driven traumatic imagery method validated in previous studies of propranolol in this lab will be used. Briefly, subjects with PTSD will describe their traumatic event during a script preparation session, which will reactivate the memory. They will then receive a) mifepristone and DCS or b) placebo. A week later, they will engage in script-driven mental imagery of their traumatic event while physiologic responses (heart rate, sweating, etc) are measured. This is a pilot study so there are no formal hypotheses. The aim is to estimate effect sizes for mifepristone and to compare them with effect sizes for propranolol from this lab's previous work.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criterion: Subject has experienced a traumatic event that meets the DSMIV11 A1. and A.2. PTSD criteria Subject currently meets DSMIV criterion B.5, viz., "physiological reactivity on exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event." Medical condition that contraindicates the administration of mifepristone, e.g., history of adrenal failure; concurrent corticosteroid therapy; hemorrhagic disorders; cardiovascular, hypertensive, hepatic, respiratory or renal disease; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; severe anemia; heavy smoking; porphyria; allergy to mifepristone; concurrent anticoagulant therapy; or medical condition that contraindicates the administration of DCS e.g., hypersensitivity to cycloserine, epilepsy, severe renal insufficiency. Pregnant (as determined by mandatory blood pregnancy testing, or currently breast feeding. (Note: Women who have had a hysterectomy or are postmenopausal (defined as over the age of 50 with no menstrual period for at least 12 months) will be exempted from pregnancy testing. Furthermore, women of childbearing potential will only be included if: a) they are using contraception in the form of barrier methods with spermicide, hormonal methods (e.g. birth control pill), or IUDs, or b) they have not been sexually active for the preceding 60 days.) Contraindicating psychiatric condition, e.g., current psychotic, bipolar, melancholic, or substance dependence or abuse disorder; or currently suicidal. Cognitive Impairment or dementia Initiation of, or change in, psychotropic medication within one month prior to recruitment Current use of medication that may involve potentially dangerous interactions with mifepristone, including certain CYP 3A4 substrates such as calcium channel blockers, azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics, and tricyclic antidepressants. (Note we have not included in this list benzodiazepines or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, because these drugs are frequently used by PTSD subjects, and they have sufficiently wide therapeutic ranges such that any transient increases in blood levels induced by a single dose of mifepristone will not endanger subjects); or current use of medication that may involve potentially dangerous interactions with DCS, including ethionamide, isoniazid, and pyridoxine. Inability to understand the study's procedures, risks, and side effects, or to otherwise give informed consent for participation; Age less than 18.</criteria>
