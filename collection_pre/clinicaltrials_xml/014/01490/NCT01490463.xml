	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence and impact of brain lesions in MRI after coiling and clipping of unruptured intracranial aneurysms on clinical and neurological outcome of patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Lesions Following Endovascular and Surgical Treatment of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Silent ischemic lesions after treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA) might alter patients' clinical and neurological outcome. Furthermore silent brain lesions are not well documented after endovascular and surgical treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms. Therefore, the investigators investigate the incidence and influence of treatment-related ischemic lesions in magnetic resonance / diffusion-weighted-imaging after endovascular and surgical treatment of UIA.</detailed_description>
