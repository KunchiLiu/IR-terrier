Patient is refractory to all lines of standard therapy including biologics, chemo or other therapies, or at least one line of therapy in those patients for whom no standard treatment exists. Patient has measurable disease (defined as at least one lesion whose longest diameter can be accurately measured as &gt;1 cm).
