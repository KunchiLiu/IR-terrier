	<brief_summary>This is a non-randomized, open-label, Phase II trial investigating axitinib as a single-agent maintenance therapy following standard first-line FOLFOX/bevacizumab therapy for patients with mCRC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial of Single Agent Axitinib as Maintenance Therapy for Patients With First Line Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients will receive FOLFOX/bevacizumab for four 28-day cycles (a total of 16 weeks). After 4 cycles, maintenance axitinib will be started. With approval of the Medical Monitor,patients who are having significant benefit from FOLFOX/bevacizumab may continue chemotherapy to a maximum of six 28-day cycles. During trial treatment, all patients will be assessed for response every 8 weeks (2 cycles).</detailed_description>
