	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is to train currently major depressed patients on fundamental aspects of working memory while the investigators administer transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during these training sessions. This working memory training would be performed using adaptive Paced Auditory Serial Addition Tasks (PASAT). The effects after two weeks of working memory training combined with tDCS or sham placebo (10 sessions) will be measured on different variables, each measured at the start and at the end of the two weeks of training. The investigators expect the greatest anti depressant results and cognitive enhancements in the group of depressed patients that received tDCS combined with working memory training.</brief_summary>
