	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of veliparib and dinaciclib in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment. Veliparib and dinaciclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Veliparib and Dinaciclib in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ABT-888 (veliparib) and SCH727965 (dinaciclib) in patients with advanced solid tumors. II. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for ABT-888 in combination with SCH727965, determined by evaluating the feasibility, safety, dose-limiting toxicities, and the maximally tolerated dose(s). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To confirm the safety of the combination of ABT-888 and SCH727965 in patients with known BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutation. II. To characterize the pharmacokinetic parameters of ABT-888 both alone and in combination with SCH727965. III. To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of ABT-888 in combination with SCH727965, both in surrogate tissues and in tumor. IV. To assess preliminary antitumor activity of the ABT-888/SCH727965 combinations in subjects with solid tumors. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of veliparib and dinaciclib followed by expanded doublet cohort studies of non-breast BRCA-proficient patients and BRCA-proficient triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients, a safety doublet cohort for BRCA-deficient patients, and cohorts of BRCA-associated TNBC (PARP inhibitor-naive and PARP inhibitor-resistant). PART 1A: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and dinaciclib intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 8 and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PART 1B: Patients receive veliparib and dinaciclib as patients in Part 1A. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PART 1C: Patients receive veliparib PO BID on days 1-7 of course 0. Patients then receive veliparib PO BID on days 1-21 and dinaciclib IV over 2 hours on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 or days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.</detailed_description>

patients must not have received any radiation within 3 weeks prior to the initiation of study treatment; patients may not have areas of irradiated marrow exceeding 40% of bone marrow volume Prior experimental (nonFood and Drug Administration [FDA] approved) therapies and immunotherapies are allowed; patients must not have received these therapies for 3 weeks prior to the initiation of study treatment and must have full recovery from any acute effects of these therapies Prior exposure to ABT888 or other PARP inhibitors is permitted in all cohorts except the cohort evaluating BRCAmutated PARP inhibitor naive patients, where prior PARP inhibitor treatment will not be permitted; prior exposure to cyclindependent kinase inhibitors other than SCH727965 is permitted Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mm^3 Hemoglobin (Hgb) &gt; 9.0 g/dl Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mm^3 Total bilirubin &lt;

for subjects with known liver metastases, AST and ALT =&lt; 5 times institutional upper limit of normal Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 times institutional upper limit of normal or creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 Prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) =&lt; 1.5 times institutional upper limit of normal Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; additionally, if a man suspects that he has fathered a child while taking study agents, he should also inform his treating physician immediately Eligible patients in the dose escalation phases of the trial must agree to biopsies of normal skin, unless they undergo optional tumor biopsies; the mandatory biopsy requirement can be waived at the discretion of principal investigator in the event of any medical contraindication (e.g. lidocaine allergy); patients enrolled to the expanded cohorts must agree to tumor sampling; patients on anticoagulation must be able to hold warfarin or low molecular weight heparin for a sufficient amount of time to make skin and tumor biopsies safe to perform; PT/INR and PTT should be =&lt; 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal prior to performance of skin or tumor biopsies, with values rechecked after the eligibility screen as medically indicated Patients must be able to swallow pills Patients enrolling in the BRCAdeficient cohorts must have a documented BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutation; alternatively, patients with tumors harboring somatic BRCA mutations may also enroll after discussion with the principal investigator All patients must agree to provide an archival tissue block or paraffin sample from archival tissue block (approximately 10 sections) for use in pharmacodynamic correlative studies; however, patients are not considered ineligible if archival tumor is not available Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document; subjects must be willing to adhere to dose and visit schedules Patients must not receive any other anticancer therapy (cytotoxic, biologic, radiation, or hormonal other than for replacement) while on this study except for medications that are prescribed for supportive care but may potentially have an anticancer effect (i.e. megestrol acetate, bisphosphonates); in addition, men receiving treatment for prostate cancer will be maintained at castrate levels of testosterone by continuation of luteinizingreleasing hormone agonists Patients with known active brain metastases are excluded; patients with a history of central nervous system (CNS) metastases that have been treated must be stable with no symptoms for &gt; 3 months after completion of that treatment and off steroid treatment, with image documentation required prior to study enrollment Any patient requiring chronic maintenance of white blood cell counts or granulocyte counts through the use of growth factor support (e.g. Neulasta, Neupogen) Patients who have previously received SCH727965 Patients with other medical conditions judged by the investigator to be clinically relevant in the setting of this study, which may include active infectious processes, intractable emesis, or chronic diarrheal disease Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ABT888 and SCH727965; these potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study Patients with prior seizure history who have experienced a seizure within the three months prior to enrollment are excluded Subjects with a known allergy to lidocaine Subjects on a potent cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor or CPY3A4 inducer who cannot be changed to another medication are excluded</criteria>
