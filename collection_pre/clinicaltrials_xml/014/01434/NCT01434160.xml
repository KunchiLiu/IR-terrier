	<brief_summary>The study will assess the safety of a sex hormone (levonorgestrel) releasing T-shaped intrauterine contraceptive system in female adolescents under 18 years of age. Approximately 300 generally healthy, post-menarcheal female adolescents with regular menses at the beginning of the study requiring contraception will be enrolled into the study. Duration of study treatment is approximately 12 months with an option to continue the use of the contraceptive system up to three years if the woman is willing to continue the use after the first 12 months. The incidence of adverse events over 12 month treatment period will be the main outcome of this study. Also the efficacy (number of pregnancies), discontinuation rate and pharmacokinetics will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
