	<brief_summary>The investigators propose to study the impact of nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT) screening for acute Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C (HCV) infections and Less-Sensitive Enzyme linked Immunoassay (LS-EIA) or 'detuned' testing Vironostika, Trinity Biotech BED, or Ortho-Clinical Diagnostic Vistros ECi for early HIV infection in conjunction with routine rapid HIV testing at HIV counseling and testing sites and venues in the San Diego county. The overarching goal of this study is to develop and implement a system to identify, notify and engage into care those individuals with recent HIV infection in order to better define the HIV and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) epidemics in the San Diego county and to evaluate and characterize HIV transmission dynamics within the San Diego population.</brief_summary>
