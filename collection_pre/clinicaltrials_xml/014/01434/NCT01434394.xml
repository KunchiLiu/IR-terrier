	<brief_summary>EGFR is a potential target for new anticancer therapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, because blocking the EGFR by a monoclonal antibody results in inhibition of the stimulation of the receptor, therefore, in inhibition of cell proliferation, enhanced apoptosis, and reduced angiogenesis, invasiveness and metastases. The study hypothesis is that neo-adjuvant Erbitux-based chemotherapy followed by surgery and radiotherapy for locally advanced oral/oropharyngeal cancer could benefit the patients on prognosis. The endpoints of this study are the pathological complete response after neo-adjuvant Erbitux-based chemotherapy followed by surgery and radiotherapy, the survival rate, and the safety.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint of this study is the pathological complete response after neo-adjuvant Erbitux-based chemotherapy followed by surgery and radiotherapy. The second endpoint of this study is the disease free survival rates (1, 2, 3, 5 years), locoregional control rates (1, 3, 5 years), overall survival rate (3, 5 years), and the safety.</detailed_description>
