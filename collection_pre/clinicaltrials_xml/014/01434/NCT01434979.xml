	<brief_summary>The investigators goal is to monitor and quantify the differential physiologic and biomarker responses of controls to standardized exercise under thermoneutral and thermally challenged conditions and responses of exertional heat stroke (EHS) subjects under a thermal-challenged environment to develop unique bio-signature panels to predict those at risk for exertional heat illness (EHI) and guide return to duty following an episode of EHS.</brief_summary>
