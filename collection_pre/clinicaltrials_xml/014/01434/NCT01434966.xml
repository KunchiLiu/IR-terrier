	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if interventions applied at a distant site, lumbopelvic region (manipulation and TENS), have a similar effect as interventions applied locally at the knee (TENS) on quadriceps force output and activation as well as reports of pain during common exercises in individuals with PFPS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Changes in Quadriceps Function Following Local or Distant Interventions in Individuals With Patellofemoral Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interventions for PFPS usually focus on strengthening the quadriceps muscle and hip musculature. It is suggest that intervention programs specifically address muscle inhibition beyond typical strengthening exercises. To specifically address decreased muscle activation transcutaneous electrical neuromuscular stimulation (TENS), applied to the knee, has been shown to reduce pain and increase muscle activation in individuals with knee osteoarthritis. Interventions including joint manipulation applied at distant sites, such as the lumbopelvic region have also been shown to increase muscle activation following intervention in individuals with PFPS, but the duration of effect is unknown. It is hypothesized that interventions which alter spinal afferent signals may have an effect on efferent motor output. Since the lumbopelvic region and the knee joint share common nerve root levels it is possible that interventions applied to either site may influence efferent motor output to the quadriceps muscle. The magnitude and duration of this effect is unknown. Both TENS and lumbopelvic manipulation have also been shown to reduce pain during exercise in individuals with knee joint pathology. This study would better determine the magnitude of effective pain reduction between interventions applied at the knee joint and at a distant site, the lumbopelvic region.</detailed_description>
