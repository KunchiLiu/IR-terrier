	<brief_summary>Although endoscopic findings of H. pylori have been reported in the literature, there is still some debate over whether H. pylori-related gastritis can be diagnosed via endoscopic features alone. Most studies concluded that it is not possible to diagnose H. pylori-related gastritis on the basis of endoscopic findings. However, the resolution power of endoscopy has greatly improved in recent years and the exact examination of gastric mucosa was possible.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Detection of Helicobacter Pylori Infection by High Resolution Endoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our study aimed to achieve the following: (1) describe the H. pylori-related mucosal pattern in the gastric corpus using high-definition endoscopy; (2) evaluate the diagnostic accuracy for H. pylori detection; (3) find the optimal biopsy site for rapid urease test (RUT); (4) validate the inter- and intraobserver agreement in the assessment of endoscopic patterns.</detailed_description>
