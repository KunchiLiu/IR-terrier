	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and bone marrow from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how patients respond to treatment. PURPOSE: This research trial studies DNA in samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with overall survival (OS) of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with normal cytogenetics. - To develop and evaluate in an independent validation set a prognostic score for OS based on the identified DMR. - To determine whether the prognostic score can group patients into risk groups based on OS. OUTLINE: Archived blood or bone marrow samples are analyzed for DNA methylation alterations by CHARM array-based genome assay. Each patient's clinical data is also collected.</detailed_description>
