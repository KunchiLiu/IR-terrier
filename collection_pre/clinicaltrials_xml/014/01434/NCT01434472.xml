	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well high-dose yttrium-90 (Y-90)-ibritumomab tiuxetan (anti-cluster of differentiation [CD]20) followed by fludarabine phosphate, low-dose total body irradiation (TBI), and donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) work in treating patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma that has returned after a period of improvement (relapsed) or has not responded to previous treatment (refractory). Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, such as Y-90-ibritumomab tiuxetan, can find cancer cells and carry cancer-killing substances to them with less effect on normal cells. Giving chemotherapy, such as fludarabine phosphate, and TBI before a donor PBSCT helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. However, high-dose radiolabeled antibodies also destroy healthy blood cells in the patient's body. When healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient (stem cell transplant), they may help the patient's body replace these blood cells. Giving high-dose Y-90-ibritumomab tiuxetan followed by fludarabine phosphate, TBI, and donor PBSCT may be an effective treatment for patients with B-cell lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-Dose Y-90-Ibritumomab Tiuxetan Added to Reduced-Intensity Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant Regimen for Relapsed or Refractory Aggressive B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety and efficacy of 1.5 mCi/kg (max 120 mCi) 90Y-Ibritumomab tiuxetan (yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan) (anti-CD20) combined with fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate) (30 mg/m^2 x 3) and 2 gray (Gy) total body irradiation followed by human leukocyte antigens (HLA) matched allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation for patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma. OUTLINE: Patients receive a dosimetry test dose of indium In 111 ibritumomab tiuxetan intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes within four weeks prior to transplant and then receive a therapy-dose of high-dose yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV over 30 minutes on day -14 prior to transplant. Both ibritumomab tiuxetan infusions may be preceded by rituximab IV, depending on results of blood tests to determine rituximab concentration. Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV on days -4 to -2 and undergo TBI followed by allogeneic PBSCT on day 0. Patients also receive cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to 56 with taper to day 180 (related donor) or -3 to 100 with taper over 11 weeks (unrelated donor) and mycophenolate mofetil PO BID on days 0-27 (related donor) or PO thrice daily (TID) on days 0-40 with taper to day 96 (unrelated donor). After completion of study treatment and assessments through ~day 100 following transplant, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
