	<brief_summary>NEMO is a multicentre pan European clinical trial with the aim to develop new treatment strategies for the treatment of neonatal seizures using the loop diuretic bumetanide. There is evidence that bumetanide improves GABAergic function of the current standard drug, phenobarbitone. Bumetanide has been used as a diuretic in term and preterm babies for around thirty years. This trial should confirm that Bumetanide in addition to standard treatment will result in better seizures control.</brief_summary>
