	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Touchless Vein Scanner for Venepuncture and Cannulation in Pediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For application of drugs and liquids a peripheral venous access is necessary in anaesthesiological procedures.The peripheral venepuncture is a painful procedure and induces a higher level of perioperative stress in children. The punction of peripheral veins in children can be made difficult by the often distinctive amount of subcutaneous fat or other medical conditions. The AccuVein ® AV300 vein scanner is a contactless, laser-driven device made for facilitate the search for peripheral veins up to a depth of 7mm. This could lead to a minimization of time until successful puncture and smaller number of failures.</detailed_description>
