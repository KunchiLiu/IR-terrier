	<brief_title>Facial Hair Reduction Using Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) &amp; Alexandrite Laser</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomised (splitface)controlled trial, comparing the use of the Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) system 650 advance handpiece against the Alexandrite Laser for the purposes of female facial hair reduction. Previous studies have shown that the alexandrite laser is superior to IPL in achieving hair reduction. A new handpiece (Lynton, Lumina 650 advance) available for the IPL system is designed to further optimise its use in removing female facial hair (particularly those hair colours previously unresponsive to treatment). This study will compare the alexandrite laser to the IPL system using the new handpiece. This may lead to improvements in the treatment of female patients with male pattern facial hair. Female patients referred to our facial hair reduction service will be recruited to this study. 1/2 their face will be treated with IPL and 1/2 with alexandrite laser. Each participant will receive 6 full treatments at approximately 6 weekly intervals. Participants will be asked to fill in a satisfaction questionnaire and have clinical photographs taken pre treatment and at 1 and 3months post final treatment. All treatments will be carried out in our dedicated laser suite at Glasgow Royal Infirmary.</detailed_description>
