	<brief_summary>There are few randomized controlled trials comparing intraradicular posts used to restore endodontically treated teeth, especially considering cast posts and glass fiber posts. The investigators study will evaluate the clinical success rates of endodontically treated teeth restored with glass fiber posts or cast posts and metal ceramic crown. Individuals included in this study should present any tooth with endodontic treatment and need of intraradicular retention (post) on maxilla or mandible according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Individuals will be randomly allocated into two groups: (1) endodontically treated teeth restored with fiber post and composite resin core and metal ceramic crown or (2) endodontically treated teeth restored with cast post and core and metal ceramic crown. A sample size calculation will be performed to establish the number of posts needed for comparison. All crowns and posts will be cemented with self-adhesive cement. Individuals will be examined by calibrated examiners, in years 1 to 3. The reason of failure will be categorized as root fracture, fracture of the post, post debonding, clinical and/or radiographical evidence of a gap between restoration and tooth or endodontic failure, tooth extraction, secondary caries, or marginal defects. The confidence level will be set in 95%.</brief_summary>
