	<brief_summary>Most researches revealed that volatile anesthetic sevoflurane has a more marked cardioprotective effect against ischemia compared with intravenous agent propofol.However, propofol has been suggested to be more benefit for attenuation of surgery-induced immunosuppression.Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate under the specific OPCAB surgical stress, the influence of 3 established anesthetic techniques: sevoflurane, propofol and combine of sevoflurane and propofol maintained anesthesia on the apoptosis of circulating lymphocytes.</brief_summary>
