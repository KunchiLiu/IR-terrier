	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To assess the efficacy of insulin glargine as measured by changes of HbA1c levels from baseline in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients following GLP-1 failure. Secondary Objective: - To determine the change in glycemic control, safety, and treatment satisfaction in insulin glargine use in patients following GLP-1 failure.</brief_summary>
