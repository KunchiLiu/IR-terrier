	<brief_summary>Concurrent chemoradiation therapy with weekly cisplatin is the current standard treatment for patients with locally advanced cervical cancer. However, weekly cisplatin is related to renal toxicity and not convenient regimen. Recently, carboplatin has proved to be a good radiosensitizer and less renal toxicity. Weekly carboplatin is more convenient regimen for both patients and physicians. Weekly carboplatin may have similar efficacy with weekly cisplatin and may have more favorable toxicity profile. Therefore, the investigators aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of concurrent chemoradiation with weekly carboplatin in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer.</brief_summary>
