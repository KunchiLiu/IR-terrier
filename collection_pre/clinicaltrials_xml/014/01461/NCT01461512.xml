	<brief_title>Heme Arginate in Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ischemia reperfusion injury may be attenuated by HO-1 induction. Heme arginate showed protective effects during prolonged ischemia in animal studies. The investigators previous data confirmed strong HO-1 induction following heme arginate infusion in healthy humans. Therefore, the investigators next approach is to evaluate the direct effects of heme arginate on short time Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury in healthy humans. This will be done by the following surrogate markers of IR injury. Functional blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can measure alterations in tissue oxygenation in a high spatial and temporal resolution. This non-invasive methods therefore represent a promising technique to evaluate the effects of HO-1 induction on energy metabolism and oxygen saturation during ischemic stress and short time reperfusion in skeletal muscle. As additional outcome, levels of myoglobin and creatine-kinase will be measured in plasma according to standard laboratory procedures.</detailed_description>
