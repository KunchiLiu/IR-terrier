	<brief_summary>Colonoscopy is currently most effective procedure used for detecting colon cancer especially in the early stages. Screening colonoscopies are performed in the symptom-free patients at risk of familial colon cancer. During colonoscopy air commonly used to insufflate the bowel may be retained after the procedure causing pain and discomfort to the patients. One of the methods used to reduce pain and discomfort is insufflation of carbon dioxide (CO2) instead of air during colonoscopy. Aim of the study is evaluation of the use of carbon dioxide insufflation during colonoscopy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carbon Dioxide During Screening Unsedated Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was conducted in 200 consecutive patients undergoing screening colonoscopies for the detection of early colon cancer. The examinations were performed with Olympus 165 colonoscopes by seven experienced endoscopists, each of whom performed alone about over 2000 colonoscopies. The patients were randomly assigned to Group I and II with either air or carbon dioxide insufflation. Both study groups were matched by sex, age, duration of the procedure, and BMI. The authors compared for the duration of the procedure, coecal intubation time, complication rate, pulse rates immediately after the procedure, 15 minutes after, and subjective pain evaluation on a Visual Analogue Scale.</detailed_description>
