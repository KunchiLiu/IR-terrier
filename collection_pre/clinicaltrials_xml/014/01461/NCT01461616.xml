	<brief_summary>The objective is to describe the interaction of equal doses of NPH insulin (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn), insulin Detemir and insulin glargine on IGFBP-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein-1) production as well as immunoreactive and bioactive IGF-I (Insulin-like Growth Factor-I) after once-daily injection on three separate visits in type 1 diabetic subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of NPH Insulin, Insulin Detemir and Insulin Glargine on GH-IGF-IGFBP Axis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because of the importance of receptors activation and potential effects on the IGF system, a head-to-head comparison of the eventual differential impact of intermediate-acting human insulin (NPH), insulin detemir and insulin glargine on the growth hormone—insulin-like growth factor—insulin-like growth factor binding protein (GH-IGF-IGFBP) axis is relevant to be conducted for the safety assurance of insulin analogues. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether the serum insulin profile obtained by once-daily injection of long-acting insulin analog, insulin detemir or insulin glargine, has a different impact on IGFBPs production and IGF-I concentrations (total IGF-I) bioactivity and tissue-availability as compared to that seen during treatment with intermediate-acting human insulin, NPH insulin.</detailed_description>
