	<brief_summary>Previous some studies suggested the addition of chemotherapy to radiation therapy after surgery may have survival benefit in patients with high risk endometrial cancer. In addition, docetaxel plus cisplatin regimen may have similar efficacy with paclitaxel plus carboplatin which is currently used in most cases. However, docetaxel plus cisplatin may cause less toxicity compared to paclitaxel plus carboplatin. Therefore, the investigators aimed to analyze the efficacy of docetaxel plus cisplatin regimen followed by radiation therapy after surgery in patients with high risk endometrial cancer.</brief_summary>
