	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the relationship between cognitive impairment, patient self-management, health, and health service use in adults with heart failure (NYHA Class 2 and 3). The research questions are: 1. How is cognitive impairment (memory, attention, global and executive function) related to various aspects of impaired self-management (knowledge of adherence, adherence to sodium restriction and medications, symptom monitoring of weight changes, and decision and action to seek care)? 2. How are these relationships altered when adjusting for medical, demographic, and psychosocial factors? 3. What are the relationships among degree of cognitive impairment, quality self-management, health status, and health service use?</brief_summary>
