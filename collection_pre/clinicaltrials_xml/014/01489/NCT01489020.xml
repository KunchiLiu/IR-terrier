	<criteria>1. Patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis with or without asthma against DPT during a minimum of 1 year prior to study participation. 2. Patients must sign the informed consent form. 3. Patients must be between 18 and 60 years of age. 4. Patients who obtained a prick test result greater or equal to 3 mm diameter and a specific IgE greater or equal to class 2 (CAP/PHADIA) to DPT. 5. Patients will preferably be monosensitized to DPT. In the case of polysensitized patients they can only be included if other sensitizations are caused by seasonal allergens whose pollination do not overlap with the study period. 6. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at Screening visit/Visit 0 7. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use an appropriate contraception method during the study if they are sexually active 1. Stable and continued use of medication for allergic pathology during 2 weeks prior to inclusion. 2. Patients sensitised to other perennial allergens clinically relevant and with specific IgE levels greater or equal to class 2 CAP/PHADIA. 3. Patients who received immunotherapy in the previous 5 years for DPT or for any allergen with cross reactivity or patients that are currently receiving immunotherapy for any allergen. 4. Patients with severe asthma or FEV1 minor than 70% or asthma requiring inhaled or systemic corticoid treatment at the time of study entry or within 8 weeks prior to treatment initiation. 5. Patients with: immunological, cardiac, renal or hepatic illnesses or any other medical condition that the investigator deems relevant so as to interfere with the study. 6. Patients with a previous history of anaphylaxis 7. Patients with chronic urticaria 8. Patients with unstable angina 9. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension 10. Patients with clinically significant arrythmias 11. Patients with neoplasia 12. Patients with clinically relevant malformations of the upper respiratory tract. 13. Other chronic or immunological disease that could interfere with the assessment of the investigational product or that could generate any additional risk for the patients 14. Patients who have participated in another clinical trial within 3 month prior to enrolment. 15. Patients under treatment with tricyclic antidepressives, psychotropics betablockers, or Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEI) 16. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding or women of childbearing potential that do not agree to use an appropriate contraception method during the study if they are sexually active, if they have not been surgically sterilised or present any other incapacity to bear 17. Patient who does not attend the visits 18. Patient's lack of collaboration or refusal to participate</criteria>
