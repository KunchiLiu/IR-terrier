	<brief_summary>People are being asked to participate in this study who have metastatic pancreatic cancer (cancer that has spread to other parts of the body). The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy (effectiveness) of a new combination of drugs, ABT-888 and mFOLFOX-6 (modified 5-Fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin) for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. ABT-888 inhibits an enzyme called "PARP" which helps to fix damaged DNA. By inhibiting this enzyme, ABT-888 prevents cancer cells from repairing the damage caused by the mFOLFOX-6, and will hopefully increase the killing of cancer cells, thus decreasing the tumors in your body.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ABT-888 With Modified FOLFOX6 in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single arm, open-label Phase I/II study to evaluate the clinical activity of the novel inhibitor of Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), ABT-888 with modified FOLFOX-6 (5-Fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin) in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.</detailed_description>
