	<brief_summary>When not using neuromuscular blocking agent, even at optimal dosage, target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol and remifentanil occasionally produce unsatisfactory intubating conditions. Therefore, the investigators evaluated that the effect of tracheal lidocaine on the intubating conditions for tracheal intubation during anesthesia induction of propofol and remifentanil TCI without neuromuscular blocking agent in day-case anesthesia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intubating Conditions During Propofol-remifentanil Anesthesia With Topical Lidocaine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anesthesia was induced with propofol-remifentanil TCI with the effect-site concentration of 5Î¼g/ml and 5ng/ml, respectively. After TCI, 3 ml of normal saline or 3 ml of 4% lidocaine was instilled to larynx and trachea, following intubation was performed.</detailed_description>
