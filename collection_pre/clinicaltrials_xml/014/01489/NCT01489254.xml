	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of GTR in Comparison to Copaxone®</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GTR is being developed by Synthon as a similar version of Copaxone®. GTR has a similar quantitative and qualitative composition as Copaxone®, with regard to active substance and excipients and is presented in the same dosage form (pre-filled syringe containing a solution for injection). Introduction of GTR is anticipated to have a price lowering effect and will give doctors and patients more choice in the pharmaceutical armamentarium for MS. This trial consists of two parts: Part 1 is a multi-country, multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, active and placebo-controlled, equivalence trial comparing the efficacy and safety and tolerability of GTR versus Copaxone® in subjects with RRMS. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive daily 20 mg GTR (Synthon BV), 20 mg Copaxone® (TEVA) or placebo for a period of 9 months. In Part 2, the trial continues as an open-label uncontrolled trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of long-term treatment with GTR. Subjects completing the 9-month double-blind period will be treated with open-label 20 mg daily GTR for another 15 months.</detailed_description>
