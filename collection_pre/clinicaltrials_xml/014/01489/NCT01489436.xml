	<brief_summary>New minimally invasive surgical treatments are often outpatient procedures with low complication rates, promising fast recovery. The traditional physician-reported outcomes such as complication rates, blood loss, and hospital stay are not useful to guide treatment recommendations for one or the other minimally invasive procedure. This study aims to apply patient-reported outcomes developed within the NIH framework for cancer research and chronic disease treatment to the comparative effectiveness research in minimally invasive procedures for benign disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison of Single Port and Four Port Laparoscopic Gallbladder Removal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To establish a pathway for comparative effectiveness using patient reported outcomes in minimally invasive surgery, we propose to use a readily available and easily reproducible model: cholecystectomy. Each year in the United States, approximately 750,000 patients undergo a cholecystectomy. Patients clearly prefer the laparoscopic approach over the open procedure to abdominal surgery. Initial survey data suggest that patients may also prefer even less invasive approaches. Currently, the standard operative procedure for a patient with symptomatic gallstone disease is a laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed under general anesthesia with four small abdominal incisions. Although postoperative pain and cardiopulmonary and wound complications are much less compared to open cholecystectomy, considerable cost is generated from lost productivity in days off of work after the surgical procedure related in part to pain and the physiologic response to the stress of the operative procedure. Anecdotal data suggest that fewer incisions, especially fewer transabdominal incisions, translate into less pain, less need for narcotic pain medication and faster recovery, but randomized trial data are needed. We propose to compare the effectiveness of the novel single-port cholecystectomy with laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the current standard of care.</detailed_description>
