	<brief_summary>Background: - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is transmitted by mosquitoes. It can cause fever, headache, muscle pain, fatigue, and joint pain. The disease usually does not cause death. But the joint pain, which may be directly related to the infecting virus, may be severe and last for several months. CHIKV outbreaks are most common in Africa, India, and Asia. A new experimental vaccine for CHIKV has been developed, and researchers are testing it in healthy adults. Participants cannot develop CHIKV from this vaccine. Objectives: - To test the safety and effectiveness of a Chikungunya virus vaccine. Eligibility: - Healthy individuals between 18 and 50 years of age. Design: - This study, including vaccine doses and followup tests, will last about 44 weeks. Participants will have three vaccination visits, six followup clinic visits, and three telephone contacts during this study. Vaccination visits will take about 4 hours. Most other clinic visits will usually take 2 hours. The telephone contacts will take about 15 minutes. - Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples will also be collected. - Participants will be assigned to one of three dose groups. Information about doses will be provided before the start of the vaccinations. - Vaccine injections will be given at the start of the study, at 4 weeks, and at 20 weeks. Participants will be asked to keep an eye on the injection site for 7 days and to notify researchers if there are any side effects. - Participants will be monitored throughout the study with blood samples and clinic visits.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chikungunya Virus Vaccine Trial in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study to examine the safety, tolerability, and immune response to a Virus-Like Particle (VLP) Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV) vaccine in healthy adults ages 18 to 50 years old. The plan is for 25 subjects to receive 3 intramuscular vaccine injections at weeks 0, 4, and 20. The three groups will be enrolled sequentially starting with the lowest dose of 10 micrograms per injection in Group 1. The hypothesis is that the vaccine is safe and induces immune responses to CHIKV. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the investigational vaccine, VRC-CHKVLP059-00-VP, at three dosages, 10 micrograms (mcg), 20 mcg, and 40 mcg, in healthy adults. The secondary objective is to evaluate the antibody response against CHIKV VLPs four weeks after the third vaccine injection. The exploratory objectives relate to antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses throughout the study.</detailed_description>
