	<brief_summary>Hereditary cerebellar ataxia is a type of autosomal dominant genetic disease, lesions mainly involving the cerebellum, but the spinal cord and cranial nerves may also be some involvement. A total of 20 molecularly diagnosed SCA1 patients divided in two groups. One group accepted for the treatment of stem cell transplantation,the other group will be the control. Purpose of this project to prove that allogeneic umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells are applied to clinical safely, and in the treatment of hereditary cerebellar ataxia is valid.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After admission the patients accepted transplantation would receive physical examination, blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram, electrophysiologic study;evaluation of SCA1 symptoms (balance, walking, dexterity, tremor, memory, mood and concentration),then stem cell therapyï¼šafter stem cell prepared, the patients accepted 4 times stem cell transplantations through lumbar puncture, the time is 3-5days between two treatments. The control only receive evaluation of SCA1 symptoms .</detailed_description>
