	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of giving EGEN-001 together with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride in treating patients with recurrent or persistent ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer. Biological therapies, such as EGEN-001, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving EGEN-001 together with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EGEN-001 and Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of EGEN-001 when administered in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride (PLD; Doxil; Lipodox) every 28 days and the associated DLTs based on adverse events that occur in cycle 1 for this combination in women with recurrent or persistent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. II. To examine the tolerability of the combination at the MTD of EGEN-001 assessed in combination with PLD. III. To determine recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of EGEN-001 in combination with PLD. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the objective response rate (complete and partial) in patients with measurable disease. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the levels and time course of interleukin-12 (IL-12), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) following EGEN-001 treatment. II. Assess the effect of EGEN-001 treatment on the nature of the cellular immune responses by measuring cell-specific ribonucleic acid (RNA) transcripts. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of EGEN-001. Patients receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1 and EGEN-001 intraperitoneally (IP) over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up quarterly for up to 1 year.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologic diagnosis of epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma which is now persistent or recurrent; histologic documentation of the original primary tumor is required via the pathology report Patients with the following histologic epithelial cell types are eligible: highgrade serous adenocarcinoma, endometrioid adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, clear cell adenocarcinoma, mixed epithelial carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified (N.O.S.) Patients must have recurrence documented by elevated CA125 (biochemical recurrence) or clinically evident measurable or nonmeasurable recurrent disease as defined below: Biochemical recurrence is defined as a CA125 greater than or equal to two times the upper normal limit; patients whose CA125 is less than 100 U/mL must undergo a second confirmatory value within a period of not more than 4 weeks; patients with a level greater than or equal to 100 U/mL may be entered without confirmatory measurement; the CA125 assessment for eligibility must be done at least 4 weeks after paracentesis or other surgical procedures Detectable (nonmeasurable) disease is defined as symptomatic ascites or pleural effusions, solid and/or cystic abnormalities on radiographic imaging that do not meet RECIST 1.1 definitions for target lesions and/or biopsyproven recurrence Measurable disease will be defined by RECIST 1.1; measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded); each lesion must be ≥ 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or ≥ 20 mm when measured by chest xray; lymph nodes must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI Patients with measurable disease must have had at least one "target lesion" to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by RECIST 1.1; tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as "nontarget" lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,500/mcl; this ANC cannot have been induced or supported by granulocyte colonystimulating factors Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcl Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 times institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) Bilirubin =&lt;
