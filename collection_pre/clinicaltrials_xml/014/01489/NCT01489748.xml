	<brief_summary>This study is primarily designed to evaluate the impact of AVONEX PEN autoinjector on work capacity of participants with multiple sclerosis (MS) starting on this device. This study will also evaluate as secondary endpoints various patient-reported outcomes over the short-term (1 month), including adherence, treatment satisfaction and convenience, and the long-term (12 and 24 months), including adherence, persistence, quality of life (QOL), treatment satisfaction and convenience. It will also assess health resource utilization by MS participants starting on AVONEX PEN autoinjector, as well as overall safety/tolerability, and will correlate all secondary outcomes with the primary (i.e., work capacity).</brief_summary>
