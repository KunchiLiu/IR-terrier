	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, randomized, study to compare the efficacy of zotarolimus-eluting stent (Resolute Integrity or Resolute Onyx stent) or everolimus-eluting stent (Xience Prime or Xience Xpedition or Xience Alpine stent) for very long coronary lesions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LONG-DES VI (Drug Eluting Stent for Long Lesions in Coronary Artery)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following angiography, patients with significant diameter stenosis &gt; 50% and lesion length (&gt; 50mm) requiring at least 2 multiple long-stent placement by visual estimation and eligible for LONG-DES VI trial inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 to zotarolimus-eluting stent (Resolute Integrity or Resolute Onyx stent) or everolimus-eluting stent (Xience Prime or Xience Xpedition or Xience Alpine stent) by the stratified randomization method.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age more than 20 years Significant native coronary artery stenosis (&gt; 50% by visual estimate) with lesion length of more than 50mm, which requires at least 2 multiple long stent placement without intervening normal segment Patients with silent ischemia, stable or unstable angina pectoris, and NonSTelevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) The patient or guardian agrees to the study protocol and the schedule of clinical and angiographic followup, and provides informed, written consent, as approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board/Ethical Committee of the respective clinical site Any contraindication to any of the following medications: aspirin, heparin, clopidogrel, stainless steel, contrast agents, zotarolimus, or everolimus An elective surgical procedure is planned that would necessitate interruption of antiplatelet drugs during the first 6 months post enrollment Acute STsegmentelevation MI or cardiogenic shock Terminal illness with life expectancy &lt; 1 year Patients who are actively participating in another drug or device investigational study, which have not completed the primary endpoint followup period Instent restenosis at target vessel (either bare metal stent or drugeluting stent segment) However, nontarget vessel Instent restenosis is permitted Patients with EF &lt; 30% Serum creatinine level &gt;=2.0mg/dL or dependence on dialysis Patients with left main stem stenosis (&gt; 50% visual estimate)</criteria>
