	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate Cardiovascular Interactions Between Mirabegron and Tamsulosin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment arm 1 (effect of mirabegron on tamsulosin): Subjects are randomized into one of two sequences. Subjects receive 2 singles doses of tamsulosin, once in the absence of mirabegron and once in the presence of mirabegron. 24-hour Cardiovascular (CV) profiles are taken at both baseline days and after the single dose of tamsulosin /combination dose in each sequence. Regular blood samples are also taken to check for a potential Pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction. Treatment arm 2 (effect of tamsulosin on mirabegron): Subjects are randomized into one of two sequences. Subjects receive 2 singles doses of mirabegron, once in the absence of tamsulosin and once in the presence of tamsulosin. 24-hour CV profiles are taken at both baseline days and after the single dose of mirabegron/combination dose in each sequence. Regular blood samples are also taken to check for a potential PK interaction.</detailed_description>
