	<brief_summary>In this study, the body temperatures of men and women undergoing elective surgery will be measured using the Temple Touch Pro. In the operating room, each patient's temperature will be measured with both the Temple Touch Pro and another one or two of the continuous reference methods used clinically for measuring the core temperature. The Medisim Temple Touch Pro thermometer combines a noninvasive, biocompatible patch and a receiving unit. The former is attached to the skin, while the latter is placed near the patient or the vital signs monitor and receives data from the patch. The core temperature equivalent is displayed. The Medisim Temple Touch Pro is based on the measurements made by conductive sensors that perform skin temperature measurements and then applies a special algorithm in order to calculate the body's temperature.</brief_summary>
