	<brief_title>Bare Metal Stent Versus Drug Coated Balloon With Provisional Stenting in Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the present trial is to assess the efficacy of the standalone use of SeQuent(R) Please coated balloon compared to a bare metal stent (BMS) in patients with NSTEMI. Primary efficacy endpoint will be MACE (cardiac mortality, reinfarction, and target lesion revascularization) after 9 months.</detailed_description>
