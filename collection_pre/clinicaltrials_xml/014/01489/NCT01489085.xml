	<brief_summary>Rational: Intellivent is a ventilation mode completely automated which controls ventilation and oxygenation parameters. Safety and performance of IntelliVent has still been demonstrated in post operative heart surgery for patient with a controlled ventilation on short period (2 to 4 hours). This feasibility study evaluate the use of Intellivent for Intensive care unit patients from intubation to coming off. Primary objective : Compare parameters which have been selected by automated mod (Intellivent) to those selected by clinical practitioner in a conventional mode Secondary objectives: Record oxygenation , gaseous interchange and ventilation parameters. Record complications, number of manual adjustments and prognostic signs. Methodology: Patients in the intensive care unit who need invasive ventilation. They will be included after a detailed information (information note). Oxygenation and ventilation parameters will be recorded 2 times by day from intubation to coming off. The investigator in charge will determine daily at the bedside of the patient the adjustments he should make in a conventional mode. These adjustments will be compared to the IntelliVent automated adjustments. Experimental study, observational, prospective, comparative, opened, monocentric in an intensive care unit. Number of patients: 100</brief_summary>
