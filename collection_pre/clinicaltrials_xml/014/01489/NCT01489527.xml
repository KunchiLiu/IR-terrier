	<brief_summary>Moffitt Cancer Center is the Coordinating Center for this study. The purpose of this study is to develop and test the infrastructure to conduct a future Phase III vaccine efficacy trial to assess trial feasibility, and to assess human papillomavirus (HPV) genotype distribution, data needed to design a Phase III trial. The investigators propose to conduct a Preparedness study among women ages 16-24 years of age residing in a region of South Africa with a high human immunodeficiency (HIV) incidence and prevalence. The specific aims of this study are to: 1. Identify, recruit, enroll, and randomize a cohort of HIV negative women (200 per arm, 400 total) ages 16-24 years to an HPV vaccine against 4 types (HPV 6, 11, 16, 18 [Gardasil]) or placebo vaccine. 2. Determine the cervical HPV prevalence and type distribution at enrollment, and cervical lesion prevalence among young females ages 16-24 years at high risk for HIV infection. 3. Assess the rate of compliance through the 3-dose vaccination series</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study vaccine will be blindly administered as supplied on Day 1, Month 2, and Month 6. Both HPV and placebo vaccines will be in identical bottles, and all treatment codes will be kept under lock and key. All vaccines will be injected intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle by a member of the clinical staff. Each participant will be monitored for systemic and local reactions for 30 minutes postvaccination after each study vaccination for any adverse effects, including allergic reactions. Vaccine adverse events will continue to be monitored throughout the duration of the study period. Vaccine will be shipped to a central pharmacy at Stellenbosch University and stored in a refrigerator monitored and maintained at 2-8 C prior to distribution and local storage at participating clinical centers.</detailed_description>

Informed consent procedures for females &lt;18 years of age: Informed consent and informed assent will be obtained from parents/legal guardians and adolescents respectively, prior to participation. The consent form will include information about the study and individual request for consent of participants to participate in the study. It will be emphasized that participation is voluntary and that participants are free to withdraw from the study at any stage without any disadvantage to them. An assessment of understanding will be conducted at screening to ensure that consent is informed. have a history of severe allergic reaction have a known allergy to any vaccine component (e.g., aluminum, yeast, or BENZONASE) are currently immunocompromised have received a marketed HPV vaccine, or are pregnant and lactating</criteria>
