	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to assess the effect of long-term treatment with prolonged-release fampridine (BIIB041) 10 mg twice daily on the physical component scale (PCS) of the Short Form 36 Health Status Questionnaire (SF-36) as reported by treatment responders. The secondary objectives of this study are to compare the change in the PCS of the SF-36 between treatment responders and non-responders, to evaluate change from baseline in additional quality of life measures among treatment responders as well as changes from baseline in treatment responders versus non-responders and to assess the safety and tolerability of prolonged-release fampridine 10 mg twice daily.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study has 2 components: a 4-week run-in period during which participants are treated with prolonged-release fampridine and undergo subjective and objective assessments of walking ability, the results of which are used to determine who responded to study treatment, and an observational period, during which treatment responders will continue prolonged-release fampridine treatment. The participants who do not meet the criteria to continue study treatment will be offered the opportunity to continue study participation but will not continue prolonged-release fampridine treatment.</detailed_description>
