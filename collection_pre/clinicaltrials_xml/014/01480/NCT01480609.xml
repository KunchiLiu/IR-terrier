	<brief_summary>This in an open-label, single dose, fixed sequence, two treatment period study enrolling 8 patients (to obtain 6 evaluable) with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving haemodialysis. Patients will remain in the unit during each treatment period from admission to the collection of the final PK sample. The doses of ezogabine/retigabine in the two treatment periods will be separated by at least 7 days.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Haemodialysis on the Pharmacokinetics of Ezogabine/Retigabine and Its N-acetyl Metabolite</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment Period 1: Subjects will be admitted on Day -1 when baseline assessments will be performed. On Day 1 subjects will receive a single dose of 100mg ezogabine/retigabine immediate release (IR) and dialysis will start 4 hours post-dose. Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples will be collected up to approximately 68 hours post-dose. Samples of dialysate will be collected in 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, and 3-4 hour (if available) aliquots, timed from the start of dialysis. The volume of dialysate collected in each aliquot will be recorded. Four samples of predialyzer ("arterial" line) blood and four samples of postdialyzer ("venous" line) blood will be obtained during the haemodialysis procedure at approximately one hour intervals starting immediately prior to the start of the procedure and finishing at the end of the procedure. Subjects will be discharged from the unit following the collection of the last PK sample. Treatment Period 2: Subjects will be admitted on Day -1 when baseline assessments will be performed. On Day 1 following the completion of their scheduled dialysis session subjects will receive a single dose of 100mg ezogabine/retigabine IR. PK samples will be collected up to approximately 68 hours post-dose. Subjects will be discharged from the unit following the collection of the last PK sample. In both treatment periods, PK blood samples will be obtained pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 68 hours (or just prior next dialysis session - whichever is sooner) post-dose. Subjects will be discharged after the final post-dose draw.</detailed_description>

Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.
