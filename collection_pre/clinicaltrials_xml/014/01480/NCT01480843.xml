	<detailed_description>As patients with diabetes age, adverse social and medical problems may arise. Because of these problems patients, even those managing their diabetes for many years, find it difficult to continue with complicated insulin schedules. This may lead to errors in treatment and poor glucose control. Simplification of treatment has been found to the decrease risk of low blood glucose, a very dangerous condition at this age. In a previous study, the investigators found that simplifying treatment did not cause the blood sugars to rise out of control. In this study, the investigators plan to simplify insulin treatment and monitor for low glucose episodes with help of a continuous glucose monitor and A1C (measure of average glucose control over 3 months). The investigators will simplify the treatment by adding glucose lowering medications that you can take by mouth, in addition to the injection of long acting insulin called glargine.</detailed_description>
