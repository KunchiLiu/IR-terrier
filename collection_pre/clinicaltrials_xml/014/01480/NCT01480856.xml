	<brief_summary>Cobedding consists of associating twins in a common cocoon in order to maintain links developed in utero and reduce the stress of premature birth. The aim of this randomized, controlled prospective study is to compare efficacy (in term of newborn daily weight gain) and safety of cobedding versus single-bedding of preterm twins.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cobedding in Daily Weight Gain of Neonate Twins</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomization will occur during the first 96 hours after birth.Twins randomized in the cobedding arm will be kept in the same cocoon until maximum 37 amenorrhea weeks. Each day, parameters (weight gain, â€¦) will be registered.At two years old, neuromotor development of twins will be estimated by Brunet-Lezine test.</detailed_description>
