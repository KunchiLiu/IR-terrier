	<brief_summary>In this study the possible changes in airway geometry and function induced by 6 month oral treatment with Daxas® (roflumilast) will be evaluated. The use of functional respiratory imaging (FRI) on the phenotyping of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients will be examined. The study population consists of 40 severe COPD patients, global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease (GOLD) stages III until IV. Imaging parameters will be assessed and the correlation with lung function and health related quality of life will be checked before and after treatment.</brief_summary>
