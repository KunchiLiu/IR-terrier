	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to compare the effects of ciprofibrate versus omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on the vascular structure and function in hypertensive patients with hypertriglyceridemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fish Oil Supplementation and Vascular Function in Hypertensive Patients With Hypertriglyceridemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertensive patients aged 40-65 years, both genders, presenting serum triglycerides levels higher than 150 mg/dl will be randomized into two groups. The first group will be receiving ciprofibrate 100mg/day and the second group will be receiving fish oil 1800mg/day. All patients will be evaluated with brachial flow-mediated dilation and with EndoPAT to assess endothelial function before and after supplementation. SPHYGMOCOR and pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurements will also be obtained.</detailed_description>
