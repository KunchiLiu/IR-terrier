	<brief_summary>Study BEL115123 is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multinational study of belimumab (10 mg/kg) to investigate the efficacy and safety of belimumab in subjects with MG. The study will enroll male and female outpatients (&gt; or equal to 18 years of age) with a diagnosis of MG who are 1) acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive or muscle specific kinase (MuSK) antibody positive, 2) on current standard of care therapy, and 3) continue to exhibit signs of MG. The study will include 3 phases: a 4 week screening period, a 24 week treatment period, and a 12 week follow-up period. IP will be administered intravenously on Days 0, 14, 28 and then every 28 days through and including Week 20. At Week 24, primary outcomes will be obtained. Follow up evaluations will be conducted at Weeks 28, 32 and 36 for all subjects. The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of belimumab as evaluated by the change in the quantitative myasthenia gravis (QMG) score.</brief_summary>
