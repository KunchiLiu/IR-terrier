	<brief_summary>This study is for patients that have Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and he or she will have surgery to remove the tumor. The main purpose of this study is to study how safe and suitable treatment with Afatinib is in participants before surgery to remove the tumor. Another goal of the study is to see if treatment with Afatinib affects the growth and activity of the tumor. Afatinib has not been approved for use by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and is experimental. In some persons, the growth of cancer cells is thought to be stimulated by Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF). This is a protein found in the body which binds to the cell wall to sites called receptors and stimulates cell growth. Some cells have too many receptors and uncontrolled growth and because of this, develop into a cancer tumor. There are several other cancer drugs that bind to these receptors to slow or stop cancer growth such as Gefitinib and erlotinib which are FDA approved and used for the treatment of NSCLC. The drug Afatinib has been shown to inhibit mutated EGF receptors in clinical trials and may be a candidate for the treatment of NSCLC and a variety of early stage cancers. Participants in this study will take Afatinib by mouth, in pill form, for at least 14 days before having their scheduled surgery to remove their cancer tumor. Participants will be observed for side effects and followed for 30 days after surgery to assess the results after surgery.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed NSCLC, who are deemed to be surgical candidates by standard criteria. Patients with all histologies will be allowed to enroll. Patients with Stage IA to IIIA disease ECOG Performance Status 01 Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria Mediastinoscopy and/or Endoscopic Bronchial Ultrasound (EBUS) and/or Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) for complete surgical staging when clinically indicated Total bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/dl, SGOT (AST) and SGPT (ALT)≥ 3 x ULN Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dl Serious, active infections must be controlled. Patients may be enrolled while still on antibiotics as long as clinical signs of active infection have resolved. A signed informed consent document (ICD) Patients 18 years or older Able and willing to take oral medications Known preexisting lung disease. History or presence of clinically relevant cardiovascular abnormalities such as uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure NYHA classification of 3, unstable angina or poorly controlled arrhythmia. Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to randomization. Significant or recent acute gastrointestinal disorders with diarrhea as a major symptom e.g. Crohn's disease, malabsorption or CTC grade ≥2 diarrhea of any etiology. Baseline (&lt;1 month before treatment) cardiac left ventricular function with resting ejection fraction of less than 50% measured by multigated blood pool imaging of the heart (MUGA scan) or echocardiogram Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents. History of allergic reactions to anilinoquinazolins like gefitinib, erlotinib or BIBW 2992 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness that would preclude a patient from undergoing surgery Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Pregnant (positive pregnancy test) or lactating Inability to comply with study and/or followup procedures Patients who are not surgical candidates or refuse surgery</criteria>
