	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of JNJ-39758979 at doses of 10, 30, 100, and 300 mg/day compared with placebo (inactive medical substance) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite concomitant treatment with methotrexate (MTX).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Dose Range Finding Study of JNJ-39758979 in Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis Currently Treated With Methotrexate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind (neither physician nor patient knows if the patient is receiving JNJ-39758979 or placebo), multicenter, randomized (patients are assigned to treatment by chance), placebo-controlled, dose range finding study of JNJ-39758979 in patients with stable methotrexate treatment through Week 24. The study will consist of 4 periods: a screening period, a 24-week placebo-controlled period, a 24-week extension period, and a 5-week safety follow-up period. The duration of participation in the study for an individual patient will be up to 59 weeks (including screening). All patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to receive placebo or JNJ-39758979 10 mg, 30 mg, 100 mg, or 300 mg once daily. At Week 24, all patients remaining in the placebo group will start to receive JNJ-39758979 300 mg/day. Safety assessments and evaluations to determine the efficacy of JNJ-39758979 to reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis will be performed at study visits. The extension and safety follow-up periods of this study will continue through Week 53 in order to assess the safety and for maintenance of efficacy of patients.</detailed_description>
