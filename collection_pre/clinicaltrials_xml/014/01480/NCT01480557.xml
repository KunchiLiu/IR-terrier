	<brief_summary>Objective of this study is the comparative assessment of the impact of torsional and liquefaction technologies on endothelial cells (ECC), corneal edema (CCT) and corneal sensitivity (CCS) in a sample of cataract patients. Participants were recruited from the Cataract Service of the UHA in a consecutive-if-eligible basis. Eligibility criteria included diagnosis of senile cataract with stage 2 nuclear opalescence according to the Lens Opacities Classification System III (LOCS-3) grading scale [10]. By means of a custom computer randomization program all participants randomly populated two study groups according to the cataract-extraction technology used: a) Torsional group (TG) and b) Liquefaction group (LG).</brief_summary>
