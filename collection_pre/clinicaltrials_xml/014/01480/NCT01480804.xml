	<brief_title>Identifying and Overcoming Barriers to Diabetes Management in the Elderly: An Intervention Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a study to evaluate whether short term focused intervention by a geriatric diabetes team, with addition of a care manager, to help overcome barriers to diabetes care in older adults will result in improved clinical, functional, and quality of life measures compared to usual care. In addition, we will assess whether the support network formed during intervention by the geriatric diabetes team will empower patients, resulting in long lasting improvement in parameters after intervention is completed. We will also explore whether improved blood glucose control will improve blood circulation in the brain that is compromised in elderly with diabetes.</detailed_description>
