	<brief_summary>The use of robotic surgery in the management of gynecologic cancers has increased exponentially in the United States since the implementation of technology in 2005. In Canada, access to the system is limited because of a lack of government funding. The government has been reluctant to fund this technology because robust data, on the true impact to patient care, is lacking. This project will prospectively examine outcomes of women, with early stage endometrial cancer, treated surgically. Open surgery will be compared to minimally invasive surgery (MIS) which will include conventional laparoscopy and robotic surgery. The data collected will include detailed assessment of surgical data, peri-operative events, quality of life analysis, health economic evaluation and evaluation of MIS rates.</brief_summary>
