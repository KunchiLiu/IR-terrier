	<brief_summary>Overweight and obesity are highly significant clinical and public health issues, affecting more than two-thirds of adults in this country; however, primary care clinicians often do not document overweight or obesity or discuss weight management with their patients. The objectives of the proposed research are to develop and evaluate a set of tools within electronic health records (EHRs) to assist primary care clinicians with the diagnosis and treatment of overweight and obesity and to help patients manage their weight.</brief_summary>
