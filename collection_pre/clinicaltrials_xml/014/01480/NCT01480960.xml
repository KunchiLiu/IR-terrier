	<brief_summary>Pulmonary rehabilitation has been established as an evidence-based and recommended therapy in patients following lung transplantation. Exercise training has been shown to be a cornerstone of an inpatient rehabilitation program to reduce muscle dysfunction and improve exercise performance. In our study we will investigate the benefit of a whole body vibration training in addition to a standard pulmonary rehabilitation program that includes endurance and strength training. We will include a total of 140 patients (70 patients &lt; 1 year after lung Transplantation and 70 patients &gt; 1 year after lung Transplantation). Our hypothesis is that an addtitional whole body vibration training produces a greater benefit to exercise capacity in lung transplantat patients (LTx).</brief_summary>
