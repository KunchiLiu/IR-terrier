	<brief_summary>This study will compare post-operative pain levels in patients who receive paravertebral block prior to Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL) surgery versus those who do not receive the block. We hypothesize that patients who receive the block will have lower post-operative pain scores and require less narcotics.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paravertebral Block for Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The strategies used to manage nephrolithiasis including medical expulsive therapy, extracorporeal shock wave (ESWL), ureteroscopy, open surgery and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). PCNL in an inpatient procedure performed in two steps. Step 1, is the placement of a drainage line (nephrostomy tube) from the back into the collecting system of the kidney. This step is typically performed by interventional radiologists under conscious sedation. Step 2 is performed by urologists and involves dilating the tract of the nephrostomy tube, placement of an access sheath and actual removal of the stone using endoscopic equipment. The minimally invasive approach of PCNL is well accepted to be as effective as open procedures for stone removal with less morbidity. Post-operative pain management remains challenging and can lead to extended hospital stays. This randomized, double-blinded trial designed to assess the effects of paravertebral block on intra-operative and post-operative pain control.</detailed_description>
