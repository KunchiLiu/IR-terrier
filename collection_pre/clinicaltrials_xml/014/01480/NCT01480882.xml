	<brief_summary>A Malaysian company by name Formedic Technologies SDN BHD has devised a hand held machine which is supposed to mimic the chest percussion performed by professional physiotherapist to mobilize sputum through the respiratory passage. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of this mechanical percussion device in the treatment of airway clearance with conventional chest physiotherapy carried out by qualified physiotherapists in patients suffering from bronchiectasis or Chronic obstructive Pulmonary disease (COPD).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will compare the amount of sputum expectorated during the two procedures and not intended to look at the clinical improvement of the patient.</detailed_description>
