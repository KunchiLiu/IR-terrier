	<detailed_description>sixty qualified samples (initial estimate which will be come more accurate after the pilot study on 6 patients) will be divided randomly in three groups which all of them will have an inferior Alveolar injection and before the beginning of the treatment the primary group will receive an injection of 0.4 mL ( 0.2 mL in mesio buccal and 0.2 mL in disto buccal) of Lornoxicam and the second group will be injected with 0.4 mL of normal saline( 0.2 mL in mesio buccal and 0.2 mL in disto buccal) ,in third group we will only pretend the injection but actually there is no substance injected ,making the patient believe that there was an injection . Then the patients' pain will be evaluated with visual Analogue Scale analysis (VAS) 0-170 mm in time intervals of 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the treatment.</detailed_description>
