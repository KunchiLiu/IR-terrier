	<brief_summary>To compare the development of posterior capsule opacification (PCO) between eyes with and without a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) after single-piece hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lens (IOL) implantation 4 years postoperatively.Diabetes mellitus would not increase the incidence of PCO at 4 years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Posterior Capsule Opacification in Eyes With Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a paucity of available literature that prospectively evaluates the development of PCO with the single-piece hydrophobic acrylic IOL implantation in diabetic versus non-diabetic eyes on a long-term basis. Therefore, this study was designed to compare the degree of PCO after cataract surgery between diabetic and age-matched non-diabetic patients. This prospective, observational case control study comprised patients who underwent phacoemulsification .The patients were asked to return for postoperative follow-up visits at 1 month, 1 year and 4 years. the digital images were analyzed for PCO .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diabetes mellitus was defined as glycosylated haemoglobin (Hb A1c ) levels of 6% or more , use of diabetic medication (oral hypoglycemic agents, insulin injection or diet restriction), or a physician's diagnosis of diabetes. Patients with uncomplicated agerelated cataract who were otherwise healthy constituted the controls (n=75 eyes). patients with glaucoma, high myopia (axial length &gt; 27.0 mm), pseudoexfoliation, traumatic cataract, subluxated cataract, previous ocular surgeries, allergy to dilating drops.</criteria>
