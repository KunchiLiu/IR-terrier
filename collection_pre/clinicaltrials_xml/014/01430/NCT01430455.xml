	<brief_summary>This study seeks to investigate whether tranylcypromine (ParnateÂ®) might be an effective treatment of bipolar depression. New treatments are needed, as there is little evidence that standard antidepressants are effective in treating this condition, and the two antipsychotic medications that have indications for bipolar depression can cause substantial side effects. This study will focus specifically on currently depressed outpatients having a bipolar history for whom at least one standard antidepressant medication was ineffective. Patients will be treated openly with tranylcypromine for 8-10 months, depending on treatment response.</brief_summary>
