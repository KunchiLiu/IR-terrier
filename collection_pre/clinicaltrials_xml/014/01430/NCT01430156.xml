	<brief_summary>This is a blinded, placebo-controlled, randomised controlled trial looking at the effects of Heme arginate (HA) on cadaveric renal transplantation. The investigators know that HA can upregulate HO-1, which has been shown to have a protective effect on animal transplants. The investigators will be giving HA/placebo to participants prior to transplant and repeat again on day 2 post-transplant and compare outcomes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients will be recruited from the East of Scotland transplant waiting list and consent when they arrive in the hospital. The investigators will randomise them to drug or placebo and give the infusion prior to induction for their transplant. A blood sample will be taken prior to infusion and a renal biopsy will be taken before the graft is implanted. These will be used as baseline values. Patients will receive standard care from our unit. The investigators will use the routine blood test results (urea and creatinine) to determine the function of the graft. The investigators will take blood samples 24 hours after infusion of drug/placebo and use this to determine the primary outcome. Blood tests will be taken daily and a renal biopsy taken on day 5 to fulfil secondary objectives.</detailed_description>
