	<brief_summary>The role of Side Branch (SB) predilatation during coronary bifurcation lesion percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is still not established. The predilatation could potentially damage SB ostium by vessel dissection, making subsequent wiring problematic. However, predilatation could eliminate SB ostial stenosis obviating need for further SB treatment after main vessel stent implantation. The aim of the study is to assess in random fashion the periprocedural myonecrosis, complication rates and time for SB rewiring in groups with and without SB predilatation.</brief_summary>
