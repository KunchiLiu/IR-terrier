	<brief_title>Mindfulness-based Personalized Health Planning for Reducing Risk of Heart Disease and Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a need for the development of new preventive strategies to help combat the rising prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and coronary heart disease (CHD). This need is particularly critical for individuals who already show impaired fasting glucose (IFG) which incurs a greater risk of T2D and CHD than those with normal glucose levels. Lifestyle changes are effective in reducing fasting glucose although changes in behaviors are challenging and may be more so among individuals with symptoms of depression. Evidence suggests that elevated symptoms of depression significantly impacts adiposity, levels of inflammatory biomarkers, and other early risk factors of cardiometabolic conditions. With few exceptions, current lifestyle interventions are 'one-size fits all' and pay little or no attention to patients' individual goals, resources, and barriers to making positive behavior changes with no lifestyle intervention addressing patients current mental states. By adopting a 'patient-centered' strategy, this study will test the effectiveness of a Mindfulness-based Personalized health planning (MB-PHP) in persons with prediabetes (e.g., defined by hemoglobin (h) A1c of 5.7%-6.4% and elevated symptoms of depression. The MB-PHP incorporates four primary strategies: (1) individual risk quantification of T2D and cardiovascular disease (CVD) based on hA1c and level of depressive symptoms; (2) group-based education on behavioral and traditional risk factors for CVD and T2D; (3) development of a personalized health plan (PHP) that emphasizes lifestyle areas where the patient is willing and ready to change; and (4) support in PHP implementation and patient engagement through integrative health partnering. To further support the goals of the PHP, mindfulness meditation is used to promote greater awareness of the unity of mind and body and specifically how unconscious thoughts, feelings, and behaviors can undermine achieving healthy lifestyle behaviors. The MB-PHP emphasizes personalize, predictive, and preventive risk management while fostering meaningful subject engagement with the goal of reducing fasting glucose and depressive symptom severity.</detailed_description>
