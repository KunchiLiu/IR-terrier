	<brief_summary>This is a randomised study divided into 2 parts. Part A investigates the effect of prolonged dosing (ten days) with Avibactam and Ceftazidime when given together and how this will effect how much Avibactam and Ceftazidime enters the blood. Part B investigates how much Avibactam (NXL104) and Ceftazidime enter the blood when Avibactam and Ceftazidine are given separately or together intravenously.</brief_summary>
