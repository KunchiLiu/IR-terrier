	<brief_summary>To collect characteristics of patients with ADPKD across a broad population, over time to better understand disease progression (signs, symptoms and outcomes). Association with total kidney volume changes and other measures of disease progression will be determined in order to identify a population at increased risk for disease progression. The economic and quality life impact of ADPKD will be assessed. Subjects who terminated participation early from clinical trials with tolvaptan may also be followed.</brief_summary>
