	<brief_title>Evaluate Heart Failure Patients With Specially Designed Patient Adherence and Monitoring Software on Standard Mobile Devices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure is a common cardiovascular problem which is increasing in both prevalence and incidence and associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The management of heart failure patients is complex and has become a priority world over. Effective methods to keep heart failure patients out of the hospital are essential, both in the interests of the patient's health, as well as to reduce the burden on the health care system. Heart failure patients should be in a position to provide readings of their weight, blood pressure, fluid intake, medications and other important parameters and communicate this data to care providers using wireless technology. This data should be made available to medical personnel regularly and on a periodic basis. In this manner the health care providers can detect and respond to warning signs or alerts before the patient's condition worsens to warrant a visit to the doctor or a hospital admission with features of heart failure decompensation.</detailed_description>
