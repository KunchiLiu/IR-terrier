	<brief_summary>Systemic RV hypertrophy and impaired systolic function occur after atrial switch (AS) in d-transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA). Echocardiography has limitation in the assessment of the right ventricle (RV). In this study the investigators sought to evaluate systemic RV myocardial mass and function after AS for d-TGA and to analyze the role of excessive hypertrophy for ventricular function under special consideration of the interventricular septal (IVS) movement.</brief_summary>
