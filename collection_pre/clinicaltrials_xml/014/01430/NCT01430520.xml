	<detailed_description>Pain is a major problem after TKA, especially in patients with high pain catastrophizing. Newer MR-scan studies indicate that Escitalopram may have an immediate cognitive and emotional effect. Patients with high pain catastrophizing are mentally vulnerable and may be sensitive to the effects of Escitalopram. We therefore investigate the effect of Escitalopram as a perioperative analgesic in this group of patients where the pain problem is pronounced.</detailed_description>
