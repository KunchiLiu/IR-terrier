	<brief_summary>Hysteroscopy is a procedure designed for the diagnosis and the treatment of intra-uterine diseases. The development of smaller hysteroscopes allowed to change the approach to the intra-uterine lesions unifying the diagnostic and operative time. Recently Gubbini et al. developed a mini-resectoscope feasible for "see&amp;treat" hysteroscopy. The objective of the study is to compare the new 16 Fr mini28 resectoscope by Gubbini with Traditional 22 Fr resectoscope and Bettocchi 15 Fr hysteroscope for the treatment of uterine cavitary lesions. The investigators enrolled 401 women affected by endometrial polyps and/or G0 myomas, randomly allocated to receive the treatment with traditional resectoscope (127 women), with mini-resectoscope by Gubbini (142 women) and Bettocchi hysteroscope (132 women). Operating time, distension media delivered, dismiss time and discomfort experienced were recorded.</brief_summary>
