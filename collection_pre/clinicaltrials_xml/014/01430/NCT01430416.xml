	<brief_summary>This study has two parts, dose escalation and dose expansion. For dose escalation, the primary objective is to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AEB071 in patients with uveal melanoma. For dose expansion, the primary objective is to characterize the safety and tolerability of the MTD of AEB071 in patients with uveal melanoma.</brief_summary>
