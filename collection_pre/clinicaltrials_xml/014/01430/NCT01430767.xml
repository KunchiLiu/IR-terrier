	<brief_summary>Poor adherence is a common reason for treatment failure in many fields of medicine, and likely affects common psychiatric treatments as well. Members of the present study team have used Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS®) caps effectively to objectively monitor adherence in skin disease, and have shown that they provide a much more accurate measure of adherence behavior than self-reports, pill counts, or serum drug concentrations. The present study will use MEMS® caps to measure adherence in 10 patients with depression and 10 patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) from a student clinic population. The aims will be to show the usefulness of MEMS® caps in measuring adherence to psychiatric treatment, and gather data on typical adherence rates for depression and ADHD patients on typical treatment regimens. The data obtained will be used to inform future studies that use an intervention to improve adherence behavior and ultimately disease outcomes.</brief_summary>
