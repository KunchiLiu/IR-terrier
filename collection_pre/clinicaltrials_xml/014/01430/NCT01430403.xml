	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to compare the efficacy of 4 to 5 months of three treatments ― omalizumab, corticosteroid therapy boost, and placebo ― in reducing fall exacerbations in inner-city children and adolescents with allergic persistent asthma when initiated approximately 4 -6 weeks prior to the start of the first day of each participant's school year.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preventative Omalizumab or Step-up Therapy for Severe Fall Exacerbations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While the increase in the prevalence of asthma has abated, levels of asthma morbidity and mortality remain near record highs. An asthma exacerbation is a major factor contributing to morbidity, and even mortality in patients with asthma. Although current approaches to treatment have reduced these risks, asthma exacerbations are major problems for inner-city patients and their families, and prevention of these events continues to be a significant challenge. In children with asthma, there are predictable seasonal epidemics of exacerbations, especially during the fall season, otherwise known as the "September epidemic."</detailed_description>

Participants who meet any of the following criteria are not eligible for assumption of care and may not be reassessed except where noted: a current severe hypersensitivity to milk who were enrolled in the previous ICAC trial, InnerCity AntiIgE Therapy for Asthma (ICATA,ICAC08/09) who have any medical illnesses that in the opinion of the investigators would a.) increase the risk the subject would incur by participating in the study; b.) interfere with the measured outcomes of the study; or c.) interfere with the performance of the study procedures. Examples of such diseases are: cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, type 1 diabetes, hemophilia, Von Willebrand disease, sickle cell disease, cerebral palsy, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, psoriasis, hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome, parasite infections, WiskottAldrich Syndrome or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. known hypersensitivity to any ingredients, including excipients (sucrose, histidine, polysorbate 20) of the study medication or drugs related to omalizumab (e.g. monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal gamma globulin) or fluticasone currently have diagnosed cancer, are currently being investigated for possible cancer, or who have a history of cancer do not primarily speak English (or Spanish at centers with Spanish speaking staff) the participant's caretaker does not primarily speak English (or Spanish at centers with Spanish speaking staff); not applicable if participant is able to provide consent. a history of severe(grade 3) anaphylactoid or anaphylactic reaction(s).</criteria>
