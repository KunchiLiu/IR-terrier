	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to look at the efficacy of afamelanotide, when combined with narrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) light, in patients with nonsegmental vitiligo. Afamelanotide is expected to speed up the repigmentation induced by NB-UVB light, leading to reducing frequency and doses of NB-UVB.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Afamelanotide and Narrow-Band Ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) Light in the Treatment of Nonsegmental Vitiligo (NSV)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitiligo is the most common depigmentation disorder. Interventions in the treatment of vitiligo include phototherapy with narrow-band (NB) ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation (NB-UVB). Further therapeutic approaches are desired and currently being evaluated. The investigational product, afamelanotide, is a synthetic analogue of the human alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH). The earliest described function of alpha-MSH is its ability to stimulate melanin synthesis in the skin and therefore stimulate pigmentation.</detailed_description>
