	<detailed_description>Complementary or alternative therapies (incl. nutraceuticals - functional ingredients sold as powders, pills, and other medicinal forms not generally associated with food) for OA are commonly used, and it is therefore important that health care providers are aware of the evidence supporting the claims. One proposed nutraceutical which has shown promising results in OA patients, is the hip powder of Rosa canina. The findings from a previous meta-analysis of rosehip powder from Rosa canina for symptomatic treatment of OA was a small but potentially relevant reduction of pain and a statistically significant reduction in use of analgesics. The present study is undertaken to compare two different products, one of which is tested in two different doses, in a non-inferiority design.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>40 years of age and have clinical evidence (diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology [ACR] criteria) and radiographic evidence of OA. Eligible patients have a selfreported pain level corresponding to at least 40 mm on a 100 mm VAS when screened Patients will not be considered eligible if they are considered morbidly obese having a body mass index (BMI) above 40 kg/m2, concurrent medical or arthritic conditions that could confound evaluation of the index joint, or coexisting disease that could preclude successful completion of the trial. Patients who already take a rosehip powder as a dietary supplement; have inability to speak Danish fluently; or have a mental state impeding compliance with the program will not be considered eligible for inclusion.</criteria>
