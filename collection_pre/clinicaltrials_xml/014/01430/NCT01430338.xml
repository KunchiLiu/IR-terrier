	<brief_summary>Functional brown adipose tissue (BAT) exists in adult humans and can be detected by PET and especially during acute cold exposure. It is conceivable that BAT activity might reduce the risk of developing obesity since fat stores are used for thermogenesis, and a directed enhancement of adipocyte metabolism might have value in weight reduction. So it is important to know the different metabolic characteristics in human adults who have detected BAT. Therefore, the purpose of the investigators study is to compare different metabolic characteristics in the presence of brown adipose tissue in humans.</brief_summary>
