	<brief_title>Efficacy and Complication of Gentamicin Nasal Irrigation in Chronic Rhinosinusitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is characterized by symptoms &gt; 12 weeks Two or more symptoms one of which should be either nasal blockage /obstruction/congestion or nasal discharge (anterior/posterior nasal drip): - facial pain/pressure - reduction or loss of smell) Mainstay of treatment are medical and surgical treatment ( ATB, adenoidectomy, ESS) Adjunctive treatment : normal saline nasal irrigation, nasal corticosteroids, nasal decongestants, mucolytics Topical antibiotic therapy in patients with refractory sinusitis has been shown to improve symptoms, quality of life, and mucosal aspect Nasal lavage with Mupirocin represent an effective and well tolerated alternative treatment of surgically recalcitrant chronic rhinosinusitis In pediatrics allergy clinic at Siriraj hospital since 2006 use Gentamicin nasal irrigation for chronic rhinosinusitis.There have been no studies in gentamicin irrigation in chronic rhinosinusitis.

Complication of gentamicin nasal irrigation usage</detailed_description>
