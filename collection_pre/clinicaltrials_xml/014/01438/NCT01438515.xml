	<brief_summary>MRSA decolonization may reduce the risk of subsequent MRSA infection and further transmission. A recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated that systemic decolonization may be safe and effective among hospitalized patients when compared to no treatment. As a large number of the investigators patients require re-admission and further transmission may take place in the community, the investigators are comparing the standard decolonization protocol for MRSA eradication to the systemic decolonization protocol among an ambulatory population. Standard decolonization protocols, which use only topical agents, are limited in efficacy. The method of systemic decolonization to be studied here appears to have greater efficacy than the standard approach using only topical agents. However, concerns have been raised that the increased use of systemic antibiotics may lead to increased levels of drug resistance adverse effects, without sustained decolonization. This study seeks to provide further data to help answer these questions and provide guidance for further policy development and implementation.</brief_summary>
