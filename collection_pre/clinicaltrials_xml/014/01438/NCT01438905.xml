	<brief_title>Effect of Joint Mobilization in the Treatment of Chronic Ankle Instability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Novel rehabilitation methods, that specifically target decreased muscle activation due to joint pathology prior to strength training, have elicited greater improvements in muscle function and self-reported disability compared to traditional therapies. Preliminary evidence suggests ankle joint mobilization can improve contributions of spinal influences on ankle muscle activation in individuals with ankle joint pathology, but there is a considerable gap in understanding cortical contributions to muscle activation following joint injury. It is unknown how joint mobilization concurrently affects cortical and spinal neural motor pathways, as well as clinical measures of patient function. The overall aim of this grant is to determine the immediate effects of talocrural joint mobilization on cortical and spinal muscle activation of the fibularis longus (peroneus) and soleus muscles in individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI). The secondary aims of this study will examine changes in ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM) and dynamic balance. This innovate approach will provide the necessary scientific knowledge regarding the potential mechanism and efficacy of joint mobilization.</detailed_description>
