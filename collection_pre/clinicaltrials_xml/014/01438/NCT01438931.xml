Patient who requires local or regional anesthesia. 1. Patient who underwent general anesthesia within 7 days, or who received other study drugs within 30 days from the date of consent. 2. Patient with &lt;92% SpO2 at the physical examination prior to the study drug administration, or ventilatory failure which requires intubation or Laryngeal Mask. 3. Patient with central nervous system pathology which may lead to increased intracranial pressure, uncontrolled seizures, psychiatric disorder which may be confused with the response to sedation treatment. 4. Patient who require neurosurgical or cerebrovascular catheter procedures or interventions. 5. Patient who require general anesthesia, epidural anesthesia or spinal anesthesia for surgery or procedure. 6. Patient who receives treatment by alpha2 agonists or alpha2 antagonists within seven days of scheduled surgery or procedure. 7.
