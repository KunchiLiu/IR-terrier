	<brief_summary>Sealants have been shown to be the most effective caries preventive measure in permanent dentition. Sealants of the primary molars soon after they erupt would reduce the total caries experience of the primary teeth of the children and could possibly also postpone the caries process in the permanent dentition. The aim of this study is to measure the caries preventive effect of sealants in primary molars. The specific objectives are: 1) to compare the number of new caries experience teeth and surfaces among the intervention group of 4-years old pre-school children during the 1 year follow-up period, 2) to compare the preventive effect of sealants with fluoride varnish on the caries experience on the occlusal surfaces of the primary molars and on the total caries experience of all the primary and permanent teeth, 3) to test the feasibility of the sealant program in one kindergarten in Kuwait city.</brief_summary>
