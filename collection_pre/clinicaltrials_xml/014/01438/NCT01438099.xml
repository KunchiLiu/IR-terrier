	<brief_summary>This study wants to investigate if ultrasound assisted epidural catheter insertion for labor analgesia is easier and safer to the standard epidural technique.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reliability of Ultrasound Assisted Epidural Analgesia in Obese and Normal Weight Parturients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study has four specific aims: 1. to evaluate congruity between palpatory technique and ultrasound lumbar evaluation to identify the correct spinal space; 2. to compare between ultrasound evaluation and needle measure of skin-epidural space depth; 3. to compare between longitudinal and transverse ultrasound epidural space depth in obese and normal parturients; 4. to check the reduction of complications and failure rates of epidural analgesia with ultrasound assistance.</detailed_description>
