	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) prior to informed consent; 2. Male and female patients on diet and exercise regimen who are drug naive, defined as absence of any oral antidiabetic therapy or insulin for 12 weeks prior to randomization 3. Glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) &gt;/= 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) to &lt;/= 10.0% (86 mmol/mol) at visit 1 (screening); 4. Age&gt;/=18 and &lt;/=80 years at visit 1(screening); 5. Body Mass Index (BMI)&lt;/= 45kg/m2 at visit 1 (screening); 6. Signed and dated written informed consent by date of visit 1 in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation Exclusion criteria: 1. Uncontrolled hyperglycaemia with a glucose level &gt;240 mg/dl (13.3mmol/L) after an overnight fast during screening/placebo runin and confirmed by a second measurement (Not on the same day); 2. Treatment with any oral antidiabetic drug or insulin within 12 weeks prior to randomization 3. Acute coronary syndrome (nonSTEMI, STEMI and unstable angina pectoris),stroke or Transient ischemia attack (TIA) within 3 months prior to informed consent; 4. Indication of liver disease/Impaired hepatic function, defined by serum levels of either Aspartate aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT), alanine aminotransferase (AST or SGOT), or alkaline phosphatase above 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) as determined at visit 1 and/or runin phase, 5. Impaired renal function, defined as eGFR&lt; 60ml/min (moderate or severe renal impairment, modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) formula) as determined during screening or at runin phase 6. Bariatric surgery within the past two years and other gastrointestinal surgeries that induced chronic malabsorption 7. Medical history of Cancer (except for basal cell carcinoma) and/or treatment for cancer within the last 5 years 8. Blood dyscrasia or any other disorders causing haemolysis or unstable Red Blood Cell (eg. malaria, babesiosis, haemolytic anemia) 9. Known history of pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis 10. Contraindications to metformin according to the local label 11. Treatment with antiobesity drugs 3 months prior to informed consent or any other treatment at the time of screening (i.e. surgery, aggressive diet regimen etc) leading to unstable body weight 12. Current treatment with systemic steroids at time of informed consent or change in dosage of thyroid hormones within 6 weeks prior to informed consent or any other uncontrolled endocrine disorder except T2DM 13. Premenopausal women (last menstruation less than 1 year prior to informed consent) who: 1. are nursing or pregnant or 2. are of childbearing potential and are not practicing an acceptable method of birth control, or do not plan to continue using this method throughout the study and do not agree to submit to periodic pregnancy testing during participation in the trial or who do not agree to continue contraception for at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Acceptable methods of birth control include tubal ligation, transdermal patch, intrauterine devices/systems(IUDs/IUSs), oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives, complete sexual abstinence (if acceptable by local authorities), double barrier method and vasectomized partner. 14. Alcohol or drug abuse within 3 months prior to informed consent that would interfere with trial participation or any ongoing condition leading to a decreased compliance to study procedures or study drug intake 15. Participation in another trial with application of any investigational drug within 30 days prior to informed consent 16. Any other clinical condition that would jeopardize patients safety while participating in this trial</criteria>
