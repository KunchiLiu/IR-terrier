	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to investigate the comparative benefit of thrust and non-thrust manipulation on a population of patients with low back pain. The investigators hypothesize that there will be no difference in 4 week outcomes or greater, between the two groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thrust Manipulation Versus Non-Thrust Manipulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thrust manipulation is considered traditional spinal manipulation. Nonthrust manipulation is considered mobilization. The mobilization will be used in a similar manner as in clinical practice and this differs from past studies.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients, age 18 and older, with mechanically producible low back pain, who attend care at a physical therapy outpatient setting, will be screened for eligibility for the study. For patients to meet inclusion requirements, they had to display a within session change in pain and/or range of motion during the assessment phase of the clinical examination. In other words, as the clinician performed their assessment and applied a passive accessory assessment technique, the pain and/or range of motion improved during that session, which suggests a favorable outcome using a comparable treatment technique. This is hallmark clinical finding in the patient response model and has been proposed as both a predictor of a positive outcome and as a prognostic variable toward longterm improvements in impairments. The presence of any red flags (i.e., tumor, metabolic diseases, RA, osteoporosis, prolonged history of steroid use, etc.) Signs consistent with nerve root compression (reproduction of low back or leg pain with straight leg raise at less than 45Â° Muscle weakness involving a major muscle group of the lower extremity, Diminished lower extremity muscle stretch reflex Diminished or absent sensation to pinprick in any lower extremity dermatome) Other exclusion criteria included prior surgery to the lumbar spine and current pregnancy</criteria>
