	<brief_summary>This study will be conducted in approximately 26 subjects in UK to yield 20 evaluable subjects at 3 sites with approximately 5-10 subjects/site. Subjects with acute vascular, surgical and orthopaedic medical care in the elderly admission, with a high risk to develop skin breakdown or subjects with category 1 pressure ulcer can be enrolled in this investigation. The rational for this study is to evaluate the potential for Window in the prevention of pressure ulcers because of its ability to reduce shear and friction forces.</brief_summary>
