	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and the kinetics of the anti-Vi antibody response following secondary vaccination with the Novartis Vaccines Institute for Global Health (NVGH) Vi-CRM197 vaccine in healthy adults previously vaccinated with either the NVGH Vi-CRM197 or Vi-polysaccharide (Typherix) in the H01_04TP study (NCT01193907) and the immunogenicity and the kinetics of the anti-Vi antibody response following primary vaccination with the NVGH Vi-CRM197 vaccine in naïve healthy adults.</brief_summary>
