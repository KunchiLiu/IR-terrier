	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: A screening test, such as My Profile Pediatric Assay, may help doctors predict a patient's risk of relapse and plan better treatment for acute myeloid leukemia. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying using the My Profile Pediatric Assay to see how well it works in predicting risk of relapse in bone marrow cell samples from younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Predict Risk of Relapse in Bone Marrow Cell Samples From Younger Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To validate the accuracy of the My Profile Pediatric Assay to predict risk of relapse in pediatric patients with non-M3 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who responded to cytarabine-based induction chemotherapy. Secondary - To validate the continuous score from the pre-specified classifier as a predictor of relapse after response to induction chemotherapy, while controlling for the simultaneous effects of the following clinical and laboratory variables: age, WBC, ethnicity, cytogenetics, Flt3-ITD, NPM1, MRD, and bone marrow (BM) donor availability. - To validate the accuracy of the prespecified low versus high relapse indicator variable (I_L/H) as a predictor of relapse after induction therapy. - To validate the accuracy of the prespecified I_L/H as a predictor of relapse after induction therapy, while controlling for the simultaneous effects of the following clinical and laboratory variables: MRD, age, WBC, ethnicity, cytogenetics, Flt3-ITD, NPM1, and BM donor availability. OUTLINE: Archived bone marrow mononuclear cells are analyzed by single cell network profile assay, the My Profileâ„¢ AML Risk of Relapse Assay. Molecular markers analyzed include Flt3-ITD, NPM1, and MRA. Results are then correlated with each patient's clinical data including patient's age, race/ethnic background, gender, treatment received, and outcomes.</detailed_description>
