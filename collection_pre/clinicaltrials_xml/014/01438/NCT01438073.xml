	<brief_summary>The investigators are seeking subjects for a study of the role of kisspeptin in the reproductive system. Kisspeptin is a naturally occurring hormone in humans that stimulates the production of reproductive hormones. Continuous administration of kisspeptin paradoxically suppresses the reproductive endocrine axis temporarily. By administering 24-hour infusions of kisspeptin, the investigators hope to learn more about the role of kisspeptin both in normal physiology and pathological conditions. The investigators are initially seeking healthy men, healthy women with regular menstrual cycles, and healthy postmenopausal women. In a later part of the study, the investigators will also enroll subjects with reproductive disorders. Study participation involves 2 outpatient visits and one 38-hour hospital admission when subjects will receive kisspeptin and Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). Individuals interested in learning more may call 617-724-8592.</brief_summary>
