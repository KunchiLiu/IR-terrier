	<brief_summary>The objective of the present study is to characterize the dose-response relationship of PURETHAL® Mites with a nasal provocation test in order to support the optimal dose in terms of clinical efficacy and safety. For this purpose 5 groups of 50 patients, suffering from rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis due to House Dust Mite Allergy will be treated during 1 year. Before start, after 6 months of treatment and at the end of the study patients will be subjected to a nasal provocation test.</brief_summary>
