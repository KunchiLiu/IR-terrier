	<brief_summary>Enterovirus and herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 are the main causative agents of central nervous system infections. Instead, the role of lymphocytic herpesviruses in the etiology of central nervous system (CNS) infections is not clear, even if there is the positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-result for the virus. The aim of this study is to evaluate the presence of DNA from lymphocytic herpesviruses in the CSF obtained from the immunocompetent patients with CSF pleocytosis and from the patients with normal CSF leukocyte count.</brief_summary>
