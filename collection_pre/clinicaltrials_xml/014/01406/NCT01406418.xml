	<brief_title>Assessment of CR6261, a Monoclonal Antibody Against the Influenza A Virus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation study will enroll up to 6 cohorts of healthy subjects. Eight subjects will be enrolled in each cohort (1 to 5) and will receive a single 2-hour intravenous infusion of CR6261 (6 subjects) or placebo (2 subjects) on Day 1. Subjects will be dosed in pairs of two. Once all subjects in a cohort have completed Study Day 8, the preliminary safety data will be reviewed. Provided that no safety issues are identified, dose escalation to the subsequent cohort may be permitted. To obtain additional data at the 30 mg/kg dose level, a sixth cohort will be enrolled after the preliminary safety and tolerability of the 30 mg/kg dose in Cohort 4 is demonstrated. Cohort 6 will be comprised of 24 subjects (randomized 5 : 1 to CR6261 or placebo) following the same visit schedule as subjects in Cohorts 1-5.</detailed_description>

Body mass index between 18 and 30 (kg/m2) by nomogram or calculation; body weight between 50 kg and 100 kg. 3. Has acceptable blood pressure and heart rate parameters within the normal limits (systolic = 88140 mmHg; diastolic = 50 to &lt;90 mmHg; heart rate = 46 to 100 bpm). 4. Healthy as determined by prestudy medical history, physical examination, and laboratory assessments. 5. Able and willing to give written informed consent. 6. Has the ability to complete the followup period of 75 days as required by the protocol. 7. Subjects must agree to abstain from alcohol intake 24 hours before administration of study drug, during the inpatient period of the study and 24 hours prior to all other outpatient clinic visits. 8. Subjects must agree to not use OTC medications (including aspirin, decongestants, antihistamines and other NSAIDs), and herbal medication (including, but not limited to, herbal tea, St. John's Wort), within 14 days prior to study drug administration through the final followup visit, unless approved by the investigator and medical monitor. Occasional use of acetaminophen/paracetamol at recommended doses (≤ 1 gram/6 hours and ≤ 4 grams/day) and continued preexisting use of vitamins or multivitamins at recommended doses is allowed. 9. Female subjects must: Be surgically sterile (have had a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, tubal ligation, or otherwise be incapable of pregnancy), or If heterosexually active, use two effective methods of birth control, including hormonal prescription oral contraceptives, contraceptive injections, contraceptive patch, contraceptive ring, intrauterine device, barrier method (e.g. condoms, diaphragm, or cervical cap), or spermicidal foam, cream, or gel), or Confirm male partner sterilization, or Not be heterosexually active Note: women who are not heterosexually active at screening must agree to utilize two effective methods of birth control if they become heterosexually active during their participation in the study. Women must agree to continue using these methods of contraception throughout the study. 10. Females must have a negative urine pregnancy test at both screening and baseline. 11. If a man who is able to father a child and sexually active with a female of childbearing potential, he must agree to use a double barrier method of birth control (e.g. condom with spermicidal foam, cream, or gel) and to not donate sperm during the study. 12. Subjects must agree to avoid strenuous exercise (e.g. long distance running &gt;5 km/day, weight lifting, or any physical activity to which the subject is not accustomed) while confined to the Clinical Unit and for at least 72 hours prior to study drug administration and follow up visits. EXCLUSION CRITERIA 1. Acute illness at the time of entry into the study (Study Day 1). 2. Temperature &gt;99.5oF (37.5oC) at randomization. 3. Presence of a significant infection or known inflammatory process during screening or at the time of randomization. 4. Presence of acute gastrointestinal symptoms during screening or at the time of randomization (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or heartburn). 5. A diagnosis of influenza infection or any constellation of clinical symptoms consistent with influenza infection (e.g. fever, myalgias, headache, fatigue, nonproductive cough, sore throat, and/or rhinorrhea) within 14 days prior to Study Day 1. 6. Received any live virus or bacterial vaccinations within 3 months prior to screening or are expected to receive any live virus or bacterial vaccinations during the study. 7. Received inactivated influenza vaccines within 2 weeks of Study Day 1 or are expected to receive an inactivated influenza vaccine during the study. 8. Any chronic condition requiring prescription or overthecounter medicine, with the exception of vitamins. 9. Chronic (longer than 14 days) administration of immunosuppressants or other immune modifying drugs within 6 months before administration of the investigational product; oral corticosteroids in dosages of &lt; 0.5 mg/kg/d prednisolone or equivalent and inhaled/nasally/topically administered corticosteroids are permitted. 10. Antibiotic therapy within 7 days before Study Day 1. 11. History and/or presence of any clinically significant disease or disorder such as cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, neurological, gastrointestinal and psychiatric/mental disease/disorders, which, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the study, influence the results of the study or the subject's ability to participate in the study. 12.
