	<brief_summary>In vitro fertilization for infertility has been associated with a significant amount of treatment related stress for patients. In addition,stress levels increase between embryo transfer and pregnancy test, during this waiting period. The investigators evaluated whether or not brief interventions by phone by trained social workers influenced stress levels. Our data showed that these interventions did not change levels, but confirmed that stress did increase during this time and that patients report wanting additional emotional support to improve stress during this period.</brief_summary>
