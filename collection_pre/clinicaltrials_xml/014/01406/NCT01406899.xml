	<detailed_description>This pilot study aims to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of adding a computer based training program in Cognitive Behavior Therapy ("CBT4CBT") for the treatment of addictions in a VA substance abuse outpatient clinic. Key secondary aims are to assess the impact of adding CBT4CBT to standard care on treatment attendance, engagement, retention, and to investigate if certain process measures are associated with substance use outcomes. Approximately 80 patients enrolled in the Newington Outpatient Substance Abuse Treatment Program (SATP) will be randomly assigned to either (A) treatment as usual, or (B) treatment as usual plus exposure to the CBT4CBT program.</detailed_description>
