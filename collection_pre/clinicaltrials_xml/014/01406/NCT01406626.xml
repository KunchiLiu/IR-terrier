	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Peer Navigation to Link Released HIV+ Jail Inmates to HIV Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study has two Primary Specific Aims: 1. To examine individual-level and structural-level barriers to HIV care after release from jail, using formative semi-structured interviews with ex-inmates, case managers, and HIV care providers; and to use the information we obtain to inform the adaptation and tailoring of an intervention designed to improve linkage with and retention to HIV care for HIV+ ex-inmates (Complete); 2. Using a two-group experimental RCT design, to test the adapted health navigation intervention condition for HIV+ inmates upon release from jail compared to a usual care condition, and to evaluate the intervention's effectiveness at improving linkage with and retention in HIV care, self-reported ART adherence, and HIV RNA viral load suppression; We hypothesize that the intervention will result in more rapid linkage to care, a greater proportion completing at least three HIV care visits per year, increased self-reported ART adherence, and decreased levels of HIV RNA viral load compared to the usual care control group. Secondary Aims of the study include assessing the potential moderating effects of substance abuse, the potential mediating effects of substance abuse treatment, and the program's effects on recidivism, and costs. We hypothesize that active substance abuse will moderate the effect of the intervention, so the intervention will be less effective among participants who report substance use.</detailed_description>
