	<brief_summary>This will be an open-label, parallel-group study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of GSK1278863 and metabolites in normal subjects and subjects with impaired renal function, including those who are hemodialysis dependent. GSK1278863 will be administered once daily for 14 days to normal subjects and subjects with Stage 3 and Stage 4 renal function, and 15 days to subjects with Stage 5 renal function. Pharmacokinetic assessments will be made on Days 1 and 14 (normal subjects, subjects with Stage 3 and Stage 4 renal function) or Days 14 and 15 (dialysis and non-dialysis days; Stage 5).</brief_summary>

The subject is mentally and legally able to comply with the requirements and restrictions of the protocol and has provided signed informed consent prior to participation in any protocolspecific procedures, including screening procedures. Additional Inclusion Criteria for Subjects with Normal Renal Function Has normal creatinine clearance (CLCR) via the CockcroftGault equation, using serum creatinine and demographic data, obtained at Screening. Normal subjects should have no greater than trace blood or protein on Screening urinalysis.

A normal subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range may be included only if the investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures, or the integrity of the study. Additional Inclusion Criteria for Subjects with Renal Impairment Has Stage 3 or Stage 4 renal function (not receiving dialysis) as determined by estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) calculated by the abbreviated MDRD equation OR has Stage 5 renal function (endstage renal failure) and has been on stable hemodialysis treatment scheduled three times weekly for 3 months prior to screening and the serum creatinine value at the Day 1 visit must be within +/ 20% of the screening value. Is otherwise considered clinically stable with respect to underlying renal impairment as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and ECG. has clinical laboratory test results that are considered clinically stable in the opinion of the Investigator, especially if the clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter is deemed associated with the subject's underlying renal impairment. has AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt; or = 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%). Meets the following erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) criteria: The subject is ESA naïve OR the subject has a scheduled ESA interval which is ≤ 7 days, ESA treatment must be discontinued for at least 7 days OR the subject has a scheduled ESA interval which is &gt; 7 days, ESA treatment must be discontinued for at least that scheduled interval length (e.g. discontinued ≥ 14 days for a scheduled 14 day ESA interval) AND the subject will not resume ESA treatment until completion of the Followup Visit. Has a hemoglobin value: For ESA naïve subjects: ≤11.0 g/dL or subjects receiving ongoing ESA treatment: ≤12.0 g/dL at screening with a re check value of ≤11.0 g/dL after appropriate ESA discontinuation according to the Inclusion criterion on use of ESAs and prior to commencing investigational product dosing. A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria apply: All Study Participants A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody result at Screening.

History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study as described in the protocol. History of regular use of tobacco or nicotinecontaining products within 6 months of the study in excess of 20 cigarettes per day or equivalent. History of drug abuse or dependence within 6 months of the study. History of sensitivity to any of the investigational products, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an experimental investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer).

Subject is either an immediate family member of a participating investigator, study coordinator, employee of an investigator; or is a member of the staff conducting the study. Additional Exclusion Criteria for Subjects with Normal Renal Function The values of hematological parameters at screening are outside the reference range and deemed clinically significant by the Investigator or GSK Medical Monitor. The values of the following tests at screening are: TIBC: outside the reference range and serum iron: outside the reference range and serum ferritin: outside the reference range. Use or planned use of any prescription or nonprescription drugs that are prohibited as defined in the protocol within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of investigational product until completion of the followup visit unless in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety. Additional Exclusion Criteria for Subjects with Renal Impairment The values of ferritin and transferrin at Screening for renal impaired subjects are: transferrin saturation ≥ 20% and serum ferritin &lt; 100 μg/L Taking a prohibited medication or supplement (with the exception of approved vitamins or minerals within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of investigational product until completion of the followup visit, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and sponsor the medication will not interfere with the study.
