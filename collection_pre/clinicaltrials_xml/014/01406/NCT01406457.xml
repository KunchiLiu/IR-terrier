	<brief_title>Monitoring of Delayed Ischemia After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients who suffer from a bleeding in the brain (stroke or hemorrhage) often experience secondary complications that can occur up to 2 weeks after the initial bleeding. Complications can include decrease of consciousness, weakness or paralysis, difficulty with speech and language, and worsening of brain damage. These decrease a patient's chances for a good recovery. A brain scan will be used to determine the damage caused by the bleeding, and the brain's electrical activity will be monitored to detect abnormal activity. These measures will be analyzed together with routine medical information to better understand and diagnose complications.</detailed_description>
