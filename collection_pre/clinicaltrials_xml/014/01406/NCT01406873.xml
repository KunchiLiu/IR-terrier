	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of mexiletine treatment for 6 months on ambulation, myotonia, muscle function and strength, pain, gastrointestinal functioning, cardiac conduction, and quality of life in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Efficacy Trial of Mexiletine for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will provide data on the long term (6 months) safety and efficacy of mexiletine in: - improving the distance participants are able to walk in six minutes; - reducing myotonia; - improving muscle strength; - increasing lean muscle mass; - decreasing musculoskeletal pain; - improving gastrointestinal function and swallowing); - improving functional abilities; - decreasing cardiac arrhythmias; and - improving disease-specific health related quality-of-life.</detailed_description>
