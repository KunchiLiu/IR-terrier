	<brief_summary>Although endoscopic colonic polypectomy has been an established procedure for two decades, the risk of bleeding is still higher after resecting of pedunculated polyps, because of the presence of a large artery in the stalk. Several preventive methods such as detachable snare and adrenaline injection have been proposed in the management of postpolypectomy bleeding in large colonic polyps. For prophylactic clip, there was no prospective randomized study assessing the efficacy in the prevention of postpolypectomy bleeding for the large pedunculated polyps. So we designed a prospective, randomized study to compares the efficacy of application of prophylactic clip and detachable snare in the prevention of postpolypectomy bleeding in large polyps. Application of prophylactic clip will be as effective and safe method as detachable snare in the prevention of postpolypectomy bleeding for the large pedunculated colonic polyps.</brief_summary>
