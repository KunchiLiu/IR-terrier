	<brief_summary>The Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) in its typical form occurs after a food born infection with a shiga-toxin secreting bacteria, usually Escherichia coli of the O157H7 serotype. An outbreak of bloody diarrhea followed by HUS begun after a collective meal with 120 persons on June 8th, 2011 in BÃ¨gles, a city of Bordeaux urban area (CUB). At least 9 patients, 8 adults and 1 child have been involved in this HUS outbreak, E. coli of the O104:H4 serotype being demonstrated in most patients. This outbreak is remarkable by its preponderance in adults and women, its aggressiveness with multiorgan involvement , i.e. the kidneys, brain, liver, pancreas, and skin. Pathophysiology, prognosis, and treatment of typical HUS are poorly defined, particularly in adults who are usually not involved in typical E. coli O157H7 HUS. The aim of the present study is to gain knowledge on these different aspects of the HUS, including response to therapy.</brief_summary>
