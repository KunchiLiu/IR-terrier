	<brief_summary>This study is designed to investigate the effect of treatment with albiglutide on the cardiac repolarization (corrected QT interval) in healthy male and female subjects. Moxifloxacin, a positive control, or moxifloxacin placebo will be given in order to validate the ability of the study to detect a change in the corrected QT interval.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I, randomized, double-blind study designed to investigate the effect of treatment with albiglutide given weekly over 6 weeks on the cardiac repolarization (corrected QT interval) in healthy male and female subjects. Moxifloxacin, a positive control, or moxifloxacin placebo will be given in order to validate the ability of the study to detect a change in the corrected QT interval.</detailed_description>
