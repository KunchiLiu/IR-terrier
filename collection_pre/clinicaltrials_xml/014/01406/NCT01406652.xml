	<brief_summary>Th study investigates prospectively the cost-savings related to a one-stage bursectomy (debridement, drainage and closure at the same time) versus two-stage bursectomy (debridement, left open and closure at a second time) of severe bursitis among hospitalized patients for surgical treatment of septic bursitis. We suppose that the one-stage bursectomy reveals similar recurrence rates but is associated with a significant shortening of hospital stay, consumption of resources and increased patient satisfaction.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Start as single center interventional study at Geneva University Hospitals Study open for additional centres (electronic CRF) Funding on 24.6.2011 (50,000 Swiss Francs). Further demand for funding ongoing. Spetic bursitis of knee and elbows, for which the patients are hospitalised (a substantial part of patient with failure of conservative treatement) Randomisation 1:1 (one-stage vs. two-stage). Duration of concomitant postsurgical antibiotic therapy fixed to 7 days Exclusion of severely immuno-depressed patients. Assessment of all costs of inpatient treatement and outpatient follow-up of included cases. Interim analysis after ca. 100 cases planified</detailed_description>
