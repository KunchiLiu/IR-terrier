	<criteria>Lumbar Fusion Patient Group Skeletally mature adults between 18 and 70 years old Patients with back and leg pain due to degenerative disc disease, scheduled for TLIF/PLIF approach utilizing an interbody spacer and supplemental posterior fixation at 1, 2 or 3 adjacent levels Unresponsive to conservative care over a period of at least 6 months or has progressive neurological signs and/or symptoms of neurological compromise that mandate urgent surgical intervention Willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol including followup requirements Willing and able to sign a study specific informed consent. More than 3 intervertebral levels to be fused Posterior fixation used at more than 1 level for 1level intervertebral fusion Posterior fixation used at more than 2 levels for 2level intervertebral fusion Posterior fixation used at more than 3 levels for 3level intervertebral fusion Any additional approaches, e.g. anterior, XLIF Active local or systemic infection Prior interbody fusion surgery at the index level Prior fusion at the adjacent levels Previous known allergy to polyetheretherketone (PEEK) or titanium alloy Cervical Fusion Patient Group Skeletally mature adults between 18 and 70 years old Patients with neck and/or arm pain due to degenerative disc disease, scheduled for ACDF approach utilizing an interbody spacer and anterior cervical plate at 1, 2 or 3 adjacent levels Completed at least 6 weeks of conservative therapy or has progressive neurological signs and/or symptoms of neurological compromise that mandate urgent surgical intervention Willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol including followup requirements Willing and able to sign a study specific informed consent More than 3 vertebral levels to be fused Any additional approaches, e.g. posterior cervical fusion Active local or systemic infection Prior interbody fusion surgery at the index level Prior fusion at the adjacent level Previous known allergy to polyetheretherketone (PEEK) or titanium alloy</criteria>
