	<brief_summary>The fluid and electrolyte imbalance (FEI) is pretty common encountered during the clinical process of patients suffered sellar lesions. Moreover, if the patients are undergone the surgery for remove the lesion, FEI happens in all cases without exception. Hypo- and hyper-natremia is the most common electrolyte disorder, which is directly correlated to the patients' outcome. However, in clinical works, different sellar diseases cause variant features of FEI. For example, after the surgery of craniopharyngioma, the hyponatremia and hypernatremia always happen alternatively even without any precursor manifestation. Under this situation, it is quite difficult for fluid supplement. In contrast, the severe FEI will cause poor outcome, even death. So it is necessary to systematically collect and review the clinical data of sellar lesions. Through the analysis of variant FEI patterns of sellar diseases, more precise strategy for clinical fluid replacement will be proposed.</brief_summary>
