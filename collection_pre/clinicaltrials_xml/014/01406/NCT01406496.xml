	<brief_summary>Post-meal glucose excursions may contribute to the development of diabetes-related complications. These glucose excursions are affected by the food content of the meal and the timing of insulin injection (or insulin pump-bolus) before meal. The best timing for insulin bolus (by pump) is controversial. The aim of the study is to examine three different timings of insulin bolus in three types of breakfast meals that contain carbohydrates, carbohydrates + proteins and carbohydrate+ fat. The 3h post-meal glucose excursions will be recorded by continuous glucose monitoring system. The results obtained in the diabetic patients will be compared to those obtained in a group of healthy individuals that will consume similar meals.</brief_summary>
