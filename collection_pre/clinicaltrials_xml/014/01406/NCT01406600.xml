	<brief_summary>Choriogonadotropin alfa (Ovidrel®) is a recombinant hCG (rhCG) preparation derived from genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary cells, which is widely used for final oocyte maturation triggering in assisted reproductive technology (ART).Recombinant hCG has been investigated about its safety and efficacy comparing with urinary hCG, but still the optimal dose of rhCG is questionable. From former studies, there only have been proven that high dose of hCG can make ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in usual condition. On the other hand, we hypothesize that high dose of hCG may improve oocyte maturity in poor responders who cannot easily provoke OHSS. Hence, this study will assess the comparative efficacy and safety of 250mcg and 500mcg of rhCG in ART treatment cycle.</brief_summary>
