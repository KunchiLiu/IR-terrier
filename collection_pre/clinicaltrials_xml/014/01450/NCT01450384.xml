	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of giving pemetrexed disodium and sorafenib tosylate together in treating patients with advanced solid tumors. Pemetrexed disodium and sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Sorafenib tosylate may also stop the growth of solid tumors by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving pemetrexed disodium together with sorafenib tosylate may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pemetrexed Disodium and Sorafenib Tosylate in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine doses for the combination of pemetrexed (pemetrexed disodium) with sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate) appropriate for Phase II study. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety, tolerance, and toxicity of the combination of pemetrexed and sorafenib. II. To observe antitumor effects of the combination. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pemetrexed disodium and sorafenib tosylate. Patients receive pemetrexed disodium intravenously (IV) on day 1 every 2 weeks and sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.</detailed_description>

Patients may begin B12/folic acid supplementation and can be reconsidered for study once levels meet the eligibility requirements Administration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) within 5 days prior to pemetrexed dosing (note: if a candidate routinely takes NSAIDs prior to enrollment, consider transition to alternate nonNSAID for duration of study treatment, if possible). Other condition(s) that in the opinion of the investigator might compromise the objectives of the study</criteria>
