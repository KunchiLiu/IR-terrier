Subject consumes more than 600 mg caffeine/day (200 mL coffee contain approximately 100 mg caffeine, 200 mL black tea approximately 30 mg, and 200 mL cola approximately 20 mg) Subject has a diet which deviates notably from the "normal" amounts of protein, carbohydrate, and fat, as judged by the Investigator (eg, vegetarians or vegans) Subject has taken herbal medicine therapy within 2 weeks prior to the first dosing Subject has a clinically relevant allergy Subject is taking any concomitant medication currently or within 2 weeks prior to the first dosing (with the exception of acetaminophen which is allowed to be taken orally up to 1000 mg per dose up to 48 hours prior to commencement of dosing) Subject has positive tests for alcohol and/or drugs (urine test) at EA and at confinement Subject has a high risk behavior for the HIV Subject is tested to be positive for HIV antibodies (HIV Ab), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag), or hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV Ab) Subject has a history or present condition of hepatic disorders, eg, clinically relevant liver enzyme increase (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase [AP], and gammaglutamyl transpeptidase [GGT]) Subject has a transaminase (either ALT or AST) more than 2 times of the upper limit of normal range (ULN) at confinement Subject has clinically relevant outofrange values for hematology including coagulation parameters, and clinical chemistry, serology or urinalysis parameters Subject has any clinically relevant abnormality in the physical examination or vital signs Subject has a pulse rate at rest less than 45 bpm or more than 100 bpm at EA Subject has a systolic blood pressure lower than 100 mmHg or higher than 160 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure higher than 95 mmHg at EA Subject has clinically relevant findings in the ECG, such as second or third degree atrioventricular (AV) block or PR interval &gt;220 ms, prolongation of the QRS duration to &gt;110 ms, or a QTcB (Bazett corrected) interval over 450 ms or any other clinically relevant ECG finding at EA Subject performed heavy physical exertion 2 days before EA or before confinement Subject has a history or present condition of respiratory or cardiovascular disorders, eg, cardiac insufficiency, coronary heart disease, hypertension, arrhythmia, tachyarrhythmia, or status after myocardial infarction Subject has a history or present condition of malignancy Subject has a history or present condition of seizure disorder Subject has atrial fibrillation/flutter, ventricular tachyarrhythmia (eg, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, aborted cardiac arrest), symptomatic heart block at Eligibility Assessment Visit, or is diagnosed with Brugada syndrome (also known as Sudden Unexpected Death Syndrome)</criteria>
