	<brief_title>Study of Itraconazole in Castrate-resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) Post-chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is also known as "androgen-insensitive" or "hormone-refractory" prostate cancer. While numerous therapies impact biochemical response in the setting of CRPC, there remains unmet medical need, largely expressed as the lack of durable response. New therapies that extend survival of patients beyond that provided by chemotherapy are needed. It is hypothesized that the triazole antifungal drug itraconazole, through its activity as a potent inhibitor of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway via the Smoothened (Smo) pathway, may provide clinical benefit in the treatment of prostate cancer. The Hh signaling pathway is a critical embryonic developmental pathway whose aberrant activity has been implicated in the growth and metastases of a variety of tumor types including prostate cancer. Itraconazole is structurally related to ketoconazole, demonstrated to reduce serum PSA by more than 50% in about 20 to 25% of treated prostate cancer subjects. This study will assess efficacy on the basis of serum levels of PSA, an established surrogate endpoint for efficacy in prostate cancer.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Male aged ≥ 18 years Life expectancy ≥ 6 months Histologically or cytologicallyconfirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate Metastatic disease or prior history of metastases, as documented by positive bone scan or metastatic lesions on CT or MRI Prostate cancer progression, as documented by PSA according to PCWG2 or radiographic progression according to RECIST criteria version 1.1 Progression must have been during or after docetaxel based chemotherapy. Surgically or medically castrated, with testosterone levels of &lt; 50 ng/dL (&lt; 2.0 nM). If the patient is currently being treated with LHRH agonists (patient who have not undergone an orchiectomy), this therapy must have been initiated at least 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 and treatment must be continued throughout the study.
