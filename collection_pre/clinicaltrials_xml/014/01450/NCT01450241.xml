	<brief_title>Short-term Antibiotic Treatment for Unexplained Fever in Solid Cancer Patients With Febrile Neutropenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Febrile neutropenia remains a major cause of morbidity in solid cancer patients. There is an unresolved question regarding the appropriate duration of antibiotic treatment for patients with febrile neutropenia of unknown origin. Current guidelines recommend at least seven days of antibiotic treatment. Several studies have demonstrated the safety of early antibiotic discontinuation in patients with febrile neutropenia. We plan an open label randomized controlled trial to compare early antibiotic discontinuation to the accepted prolonged antibiotic treatment protocol</detailed_description>
