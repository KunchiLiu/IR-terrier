	<criteria>Patient is scheduled to undergo carpal tunnel release surgery. Patient has chronic Carpal Tunnel Syndrome with persistent symptoms despite nonoperative treatment, or refusal of nonoperative treatment, with one or more of the following: splinting, NSAIDs or corticosteroid injections. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome must be confirmed by positive results of Electromyography (EMG) and Nerve Conduction Velocity (NCV) tests. Patient is a male or nonpregnant, nonlactating female. Patient is 1875 years of age, inclusive. Female patients of childbearing potential, including those who have had a tubal ligation, but excluding those who have not experienced a menstrual period for at least two years, must have a negative urine pregnancy test at Screening. Patient must voluntarily provide written, informed consent. Patient has a prior or current musculoskeletal or neurologic condition that limits strength, motion, or sensation in the affected hand. Patient has a medical condition that precludes the use of anesthetic required for surgery. Patient has an ipsilateral injury or other conditions affecting hand function. Patient has acute CTS resulting from an injury (e.g., fracture). Patient has had previous CTR surgery on the affected hand. Patient has psychiatric history, head injury or any other condition which, in the Investigator's opinion, would prevent patient from complying with postoperative hand therapy or followup visits.</criteria>
