	<brief_summary>Neonatal nutritional management consists in reproducing miming uteri growth kinetic. Since the seventies, NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) strategy consists in a high proteidic input (apport) supposed to allow optimal neurodevelopment. However, nutritional practices and strategies have significantly evolved during these last years, influenced by Baker nutritional imprinting concept (2002). Actually, neonatal high proteidic exposition could perturb metabolism and hormonal systems of newborns conducting to a reinforcement of obesity and cardio-vascular pathology prevalence in this target population at adulthood. In this context many studies emerged since 2000 and try to assess the trade-off between neurodevelopment and growth under nutrition conditions. EPIPOD try to focus the link between heterogenous proteic input dispensed in our NICU (described by tercil methods on population) and fat mass phenotype variations at discharge (described by tercil methods); and its consequences on neurodevelopmental growth. Understanding how particular nutritional exposition could determine "fatty" phenotype and impact neurodevelopment is clearly our main goal.</brief_summary>
