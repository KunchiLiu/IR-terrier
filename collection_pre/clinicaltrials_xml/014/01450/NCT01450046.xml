	<brief_summary>The Principal Investigator believes that Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol will slow the progression of pancreatic cancer cells. Therefore, the investigators must determine the safety and tolerability of Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol in healthy participants before administering to cancer patients. The investigators will do this by giving participants a dose of up to1600 mg twice a day, not to exceed 3200 mg total for 14 consecutive days.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol Multiple Dose in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants will be accrued in cohorts of three. The decision to dose escalate will be made by the Cohort Review Committee (CRC) based on safety after the last subject in the current cohort has completed the Study Treatment Period. The study will consist of the following procedures: - Pre-Treatment Period: The screening period must occur within 7 days of dosing. - Study Treatment Period (14 days): Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol will be administered orally twice daily for 14 consecutive days - Post-Treatment Period: Subject will return to the study site 7 days after the dose of Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol for an end-of-treatment assessment. On day 8 (± 2 days) after the last dose of study drug, the investigator will obtain follow-up information. Any serious adverse events (SAEs) present at 7 days after the last dose and possibly related to study drug will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or initiation of treatment that confounds the ability to assess the event.</detailed_description>
