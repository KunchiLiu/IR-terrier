	<brief_summary>This national, multicenter, open-label phase 2 study without any control arm aims to evaluate the activity of cetuximab monotherapy in the treatment of refractory colorectal cancer in subjects with K-RAS mutated and FcγRIIa polymorphism tumors, in which there is no therapeutic alternative for treatment. Failure of the first and second line conventional therapeutic lines was documented.</brief_summary>
