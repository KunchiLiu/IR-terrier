	<brief_summary>The aim of this single centre study is to measure maternal CD4+ t-cells in HiV exposed Newborns after spontaneous birth in comparison to cesarean section. This may have an influence on the risk of vertical HiV transmission.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Maternal-fetal CD4 Microchimerism in HiV Exposed Newborns After Spontaneous Delivery and Cesarean Section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At birth maternal CD4+ t-cells from umbilical cord blood and placenta blood are measured by microchimerism-analysis. After 6 weeks the maternal CD4+ t-cells are measured in the blood of the babies blood. Additionally we look for HiV in maternal CD4+ t-cells.</detailed_description>
