	<brief_summary>The Bispectral Index monitor is used in many operating rooms to provide information to the anesthesiologist about a patient's level of consciousness. The Composite Variability Index, or Composite Variability Index (CVI), is a new index that may provide the anesthesiologist with more information about the condition of the patient. The purpose of this study is to determine if a commonly used anesthetic drug (rocuronium) affects the CVI measurement differently with different doses. Rocuronium is a muscle relaxant routinely used during surgery. It is expected that the group given the highest dose of rocuronium will have diminished CVI values.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Neuromuscular Blockade on the Composite Variability Index (CVI) During Laryngoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will randomize patients to one of four doses of rocuronium: no rocuronium, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 milligrams per kilo of body weight; the last dose is the standard amount for adults. It is expected that the group given the highest dose of rocuronium will have diminished CVI values. By including intermediate doses, information about the function of CVI in states of less than full muscle relaxation, or paralysis, will be obtained. This information is critically important for the development of the composite variability index, because during general anesthesia patients are usually maintained in a state of less than full paralysis. If the CVI response to stimulation in the intermediate groups is similar to the group receiving no rocuronium, the monitor may find wide clinical applicability. If the response is similar to the maximal rocuronium group, the index may only be reliable in states with no muscle relaxant, which will greatly limit clinical utility. Subjects will receive propofol and remifentanil infusions during the case. These are commonly used medications for anesthesia. The subjects will also be randomized to two additional groups. One group will receive a remifentanil infusion of 2ng ml-1 and the other group will receive a 8ng ml-1 remifentanil infusion. Both doses are acceptable and often used during standard clinical care. The propofol infusion will be adjusted to keep the BIS number between 45-60. The anesthesiologist will not be able to see the CVI value. The times of certain intraoperative events, such as intubation and incision, will be recorded. All subjects will receive a morphine bolus (0.10-0.15 mg/kg) towards the end to reduce post-operative pain, as per standard clinical care. As the subject wakes up, time to eye opening and orientation will be recorded. The subject will rate their pain on a numerical pain scale and the quality of emergence will be assessed. Upon arrival in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU), subjects will be asked to rate their pain again using the same pain scale. The pain score will be evaluated every 10 minutes for half an hour, then every hour until they are discharged from PACU.</detailed_description>
