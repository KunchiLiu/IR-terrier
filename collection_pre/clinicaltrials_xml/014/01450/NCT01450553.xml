	<brief_summary>A 15-gene lung signature was created to identify predictive and prognostic biomarkers for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients. The 15-gene signature was validated using a microarray platform with fresh frozen tumor tissue to place NSCLC patients into high risk and low risk cohorts with significantly different survivals. Using fresh frozen tissue can be challenging, so this study attempts simplify the process by migrating the 15-gene signature from fresh frozen to two alternative tissue formats: Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) and RNAlater. The gene expressions of the different tissue formats will be compared to see if the fresh frozen tissue results are similar to the alternative tissue formats.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tissue Collection Study for Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer With Resectable Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with early stage NSCLC will be consented prior to surgery so that any excess tissue collected during surgery can be collected in one of the three tissue formats (Fresh Frozen, FFPE, RNAlater) and sent to the Sponsor for testing.</detailed_description>
