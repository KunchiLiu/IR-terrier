	<brief_summary>The purpose is to compare the prevalence of dry eyes in diabetics and non diabetics. This might help identify a group of patients at greater risk for dry eye complications. Diabetics have been shown to have poor ocular surface healing and might benefit from dry eye therapy earlier if they are shown to be at greater risk for dry eyes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevalence of Dry Eyes in Diabetics Compared to Non Diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dry eye disease is one of the most common eye problems seen in ophthalmology. Diabetics are at high risk for multiple eye problems, including retinopathy and glaucoma. They also have been shown to have poor ocular surface healing. I would like to evaluate the prevalence of dry eye disease in diabetics to see if they are also at greater risk for the known complications of dry eye disease. If so, they might benefit from early intervention.</detailed_description>
