	<brief_summary>Study hypothesis: PillCam SB3 is a new capsule designed to provide an improved image quality, and improved SB and duodenum tissue coverage due to Adaptive Frame Rate (AFR) of 2-6 fps, which will create more images for evaluation, and therefore should improve diagnostic accuracy. Proposed Design: to enroll up to 230 patients with symptoms suggesting the presence of small bowel disease. Preparation for procedure will include 12 hours fasting prior to the capsule ingestion Patients will undergo a standard capsule endoscopy. Patients will be allowed to drink clear liquids 2 hours post ingestion, and eat 4 hours post ingestion. Diagnostic yield of the SB3 will be calculated The Physician's subjective assessment of capsule performance will be captured</brief_summary>
