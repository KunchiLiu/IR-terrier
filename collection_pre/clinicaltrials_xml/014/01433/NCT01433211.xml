	<brief_title>Nutrition and Frailty in Older Persons</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nutrition is regarded as an important etiologic factor in the development of frailty in older adults. To date the relation between nutrition and frailty is only poorly described. Thus, it is the purpose of this study to investigate the association between different nutrition characteristics and frailty in older community-living persons. 206 volunteers aged 75 years or older were included in this cross-sectional study. Nutritional assessment included the Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA), a food-frequency questionnaire and a standardised three-day dietary record. Intake of energy and nutrients was calculated using the German nutrient database BLS II.2. Dietary patterns were described by different dietary scores. Frailty was defined according to Fried et al. based on the following criteria: weight loss, exhaustion, grip strength, walking speed and physical activity. In addition several standardised tests were performed to characterise physical performance (Timed Up &amp; Go, repeated chair stands, balance tests). The association between nutritional aspects and physical performance is evaluated in an explorative manner.</detailed_description>
