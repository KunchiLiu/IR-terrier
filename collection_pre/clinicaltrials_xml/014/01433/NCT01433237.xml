	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research trial studies biomarkers in samples from patients with rhabdomyosarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studying Biomarkers in Samples From Patients With Rhabdomyosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether circulating muscle-specific microRNAs, especially serum miR-206, are potential biomarkers for rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). OUTLINE: Archived serum samples are analyzed for miR-206 expression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 samples from patients with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), 15 from patients with embryonal RMS, and 10 from patients without RMS will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
