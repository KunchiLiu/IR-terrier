	<brief_title>Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Single Oral Doses of MBX-400 in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cytomegalovirus (CMV; herpesvirus 5), a member of the betaherpesvirus subgroup, occurs as a benign infection in the majority of humans, with a 90% prevalence in the adult population1. However, CMV infection continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunosuppressed patients, particularly recipients of solid organ or bone marrow transplants. CMV is also known for its association with severe blinding retinitis, pneumonia and gastrointestinal inflammation in AIDS patients. However, with the successful introduction of HAART (highly active anti-retroviral therapy), the problem of CMV infection in AIDS patients has decreased substantially. CMV remains the most important cause of congenital viral infection in the United States, and CMV infection of neonates is associated with deafness, mental retardation and mortality. In addition, CMV is a suspected pathogenic agent in cardiovascular disease and can persist in large-vessel endothelial cells and infect all cell types involved in cardiovascular lesions. CMV has been implicated in the restenosis of diseased coronary arteries following angioplasty and has been associated with myocarditis. In severely immunocompromised patients with CMV infection, prolonged antiviral therapy is often necessary, which increases the risk of resistant viruses. Currently available therapy has limitations that preclude their long-term use including toxicity, poor oral bioavailability and the development of drug-resistant strains. MBX-400 is a nucleoside analog that is structurally related to ganciclovir and acyclovir and is being developed for the possible use in the prevention and/or treatment of CMV. MBX-400, has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of viral DNA synthesis and therefore may be useful in treating and/or preventing CMV infection.</detailed_description>
