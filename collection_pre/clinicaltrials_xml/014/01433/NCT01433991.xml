	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1b/2 study which will be conducted in two parts: a Phase 1b part comprising a dose escalation and an expansion cohort; and a Phase 2 part which will comprise two cohorts. The purpose of the Phase 1b part is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of E7050 and E7080 (lenvatinib) in combination in subjects with unresectable advanced or metastatic solid tumors. In the subsequent Phase 1b expansion cohort and Phase 2 cohorts, additional subjects with recurrent glioblastoma or unresectable Stage III or Stage IV melanoma and disease progression after prior systemic treatment will be enrolled to confirm the MTD (expansion cohort) and to further explore the clinical activity of E7050 and lenvatinib.</brief_summary>

Phase 1b expansion cohort and Phase 2: Histological confirmed diagnosis of glioblastoma (expansion cohort and Cohort 1) or melanoma (expansion cohort and Cohort 2). Phase 1b expansion cohort glioblastoma subjects, Phase 2 Cohort 1: 3. No evidence of active CNS hemorrhage on baseline scans other than in those subjects with recurrent glioblastoma who are stable Grade 1. 4. Subjects having first or second recurrence documented by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), following primary management with surgical resection or biopsy, radiotherapy and up to two prior systemic treatments. 5. If subject is on corticosteroids, they must be on a stable dose for 1 week prior to first dose of study drug. 6. Measurable disease defined as bidimensionally contrast enhancing lesions with clearly defined margins by computerized tomography (CT) or MRI scan, with a minimal diameter of 1 cm, and visible on two axial slices which are preferably at most 5 mm apart with 0 mm skip. Phase 1b expansion cohort melanoma subjects, Phase 2 Cohort 2: 7.

If there is only one target lesion and it is a nonlymph node, it should have a longest diameter of greater than or equal to 1.5 cm. 2. Lesions that have had external beam radiotherapy or locoregional therapies such as radiofrequency ablation must show evidence of progressive disease based on RECIST 1.1 to be deemed a target lesion. All subjects: 10. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. 11. Adequately controlled BP with or without antihypertensive medications, defined as BP less than or equal to 150/90 mmHg at screening and no change in antihypertensive medications within 1 week before the Screening Visit. 12. Adequate renal function as evidenced by serum creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL or calculated creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 40 mL/min per the Cockcroft and Gault formula (see Appendix 5). 13. Adequate bone marrow function: Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1500/mm3 (greater than or equal to 1.5 x 10^3/uL); Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3 (greater than or equal to 100 x 10^9/L); Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.0 g/dL. 14. Adequate blood coagulation function, as evidenced by an International Normalized Ratio (INR) less than or equal to 1.5. 15. Adequate liver function: Bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) except for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia of Gilbert's syndrome; ALP, ALT, and AST less than or equal to 3 x ULN (less than or equal to 5 x ULN if subject has liver metastases). 16. Males or females age greater than or equal to 18 years at the time of informed consent. 17. All females must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of betahuman chorionic gonadotropin [BhCG] at the Screening and Baseline Visit (a separate Baseline assessment is not required if a negative Screening pregnancy test was obtained within 72 hours before the first dose of study drug). Females of childbearing potential, if not practising total abstinence or having a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia, must agree to use two highly effective methods of contraception: e.g., 1) an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS); 2) a barrier method such as a condom or occlusive cup (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) + spermicide (foam, gel, cream, etc.); 3) oral, injected, or implanted hormonal contraceptives throughout the entire study period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation. Use of a doublebarrier method (i.e., use at the same time of a condom + occlusive cup [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps] + spermicide [foam, gel, cream, etc.]) is accepted as two highly effective methods of contraception. The only subjects who will be exempt from this requirement are postmenopausal women (defined as women who have been amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate age group, without other known or suspected primary cause) or subjects who have been sterilized surgically or who are otherwise proven sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation with surgery at least 1 month prior to dosing, total hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy with surgery at least 1 month prior to dosing). All women who are of reproductive potential and who are using hormonal contraceptives must have been on a stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks prior to dosing and must continue to use the same contraceptive during the study and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation. 18. Male subjects who are partners of women of childbearing potential must use a condom + spermicide and their female partners, if of childbearing potential, must use a highly effective method of contraception (see methods described in Inclusion Criterion #18) beginning at least 1 menstrual cycle prior to starting study drug, throughout the entire study period, and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug, unless the male subjects are totally abstinent sexually or have undergone a successful vasectomy with confirmed azoospermia or unless the female partners have been sterilized surgically or are otherwise proven sterile (see Inclusion Criterion #18). 19. Voluntary agreement to provide written informed consent and the willingness and ability to comply with all aspects of the protocol. Exclusion Criteria Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from this study: 1.
