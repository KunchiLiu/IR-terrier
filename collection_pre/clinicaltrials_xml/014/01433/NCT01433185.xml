	<brief_summary>Early accurate diagnosis is one of the first crucial steps in care for infants born to HIV-infected mothers. Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) relies upon early diagnosis and results in significant reductions in infant morbidity and mortality. There is little information on evidence-based interventions that specifically target improved attendance of postpartum clinic visits and subsequent infant HIV testing in the context of prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) programs. The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial to examine the effect of text messages sent to women enrolled in PMTCT programs on adherence to postpartum clinic visits and uptake of early infant diagnosis by DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This study seeks to test the hypotheses that (a) text messages sent to women enrolled in PMTCT will improve their attendance at the postnatal clinic within the first 6-8 weeks after childbirth; and (b) text messages sent to women enrolled in PMTCT programs will increase uptake of DNA PCR HIV testing at 6-8 weeks among infants exposed to HIV. This study will evaluate a novel strategy to improve adherence to postnatal clinic visits and increase the uptake of infant HIV testing. If proven superior to standard care, the proposed intervention can be easily scaled-up and integrated into existing healthcare systems in resource-limited settings. Findings from this study will provide randomized trial evidence to inform HIV prevention program planners and implementers. This study will also provide further information on the feasibility of using mobile phone-based technology for public health interventions in resource-limited settings.</brief_summary>
