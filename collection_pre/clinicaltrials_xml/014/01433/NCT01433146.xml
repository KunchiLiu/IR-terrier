	<detailed_description>120 prospective patients, with non-metastatic colorectal cancer, will be evaluated with questionnaires and auto-questionnaires in order to assess temperament, anxiety and depression. The immunity status will be assessed by a blood sample with the aim to evaluate cell-mediated immunity. Survivall will be related to level of anxiety/temperament/depression and cell-mediated immunity. Univariate and multivariate model analisys will be performed in order to evaluate if anxiety/temperament/depression and cell-mediated immunity can be considered as prognostic factors.</detailed_description>
