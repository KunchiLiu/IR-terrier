	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of lens-free (recovery) intervals of varying lengths on end-of-day comfort and tear film changes with daily contact lens wear.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lens Wear Schedules and End-of-Day Comfort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was conducted in a cross-over design with two phases. Each phase consisted of four cycles approximately 12 hours in length. During each cycle, contact lenses were worn for 2-hour intervals, separated by lens-free (recovery) intervals of either 0, 30, 60, or 80 minutes. A new pair of contact lenses was dispensed for each 2-hour interval of lens wear. A 12-hour lens-free wear period preceded each phase.</detailed_description>
