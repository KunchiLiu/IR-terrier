	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic surgery is becoming a major procedure, owing to smaller incisions, shorter hospitalizations, and less post-operative pain as compared with traditional laparotomies. However, there is marked interindividual variability of post-operative shoulder-tip pain following laparoscopic surgery. The incidence of shoulder pain varies from 35% to 80% and ranges from mild to severe. In some cases, it has been reported to last more than 72 hours after surgery. The hypothesis of post-operative shoulder-tip pain is that carbon dioxide induced phrenic nerve irritation causes referred pain to C4. Therefore, the investigators should try to do is that if the investigators could reduce carbon dioxide retention in the pelvic cavity. This clinical controlled trial is tried to find out the practical and clinical maneuver to reduce post-operative should-tip pain following laparoscopic surgery.</brief_summary>
