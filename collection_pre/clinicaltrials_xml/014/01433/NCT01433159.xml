	<brief_summary>The trial will compare the effects of 14 days treatment with HP011 101 versus Standard Care in subjects with Stage I or II pressure ulcers as a complication of spinal cord injury, measured as change from baseline in composite wound bed scores of the PUSH 3.0 tool.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Provide informed consent, or assent if less than 18 years of age. Age 12 years or older, of either sex, and of any race or skin type, provided that their skin color, in the opinion of the Investigator, will not interfere with the study assessments. Have pressure ulcers ≤ Stage II severity, ≥ 2 cm² and ≤ 100 cm² in aggregate area (each area will be measured, including ulcer area (cm2), perimeter (cm) and greatest depth (cm) using the ARANZ Silhouette™ wound imaging and measurement device, and will remain at the treating facility for at least three weeks. In the opinion of the Investigator, are maintaining an adequate nutritional status and are receiving a full caloric diet, either orally or by tube. All female subjects must have a negative urinary pregnancy test at screening. Have, within 12 weeks prior to screening, clinical laboratory test results indicating: Alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, BUN and serum creatinine levels &lt; 3x upper limit of the Healthpoint normal range HbA1C ≤ 12% Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL Serum albumin, prealbumin, and serum total protein measurements must be collected or obtained. These will serve as baseline covariates for analysis, but will not be used as inclusion criteria. The most recently obtained laboratory values must be evaluated against the stated criteria. If these values are not available from a blood sample within 12 weeks of screening, blood must be drawn at screening and these laboratory values determined. For ulcers that will require surgical debridement, any debridement modality may be used at baseline, but the ulcer must remain a Stage I or Stage II partial thickness wound after debridement. Have spinal cord injuries, which are motor complete or motor incomplete injuries that are based on American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment classifications A, B, C, and D. Have a spinal cord injury from, epidural abscess, infection, neurodegenerative process, or malignancy. Have a known hypersensitivity to any of the test articles or their components. Have received therapy with another investigational agent within thirty (30) days of screening. Are pregnant or nursing. Have received systemic treatment with glucocorticoids for &gt; 10 consecutive days within 1 week prior to the start of the study. Have received chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the past 5 years. Have clinical evidence of bacterial or fungal infection of the any open wound per visual/clinical assessment. Have a severe burn, immunodeficiency disorder, hematologic disorder, or metastatic malignancy. Have had documented osteomyelitis in the ulcer area within 6 months prior to screening. Have endstage renal disease, are receiving treatment for cancer (except for nonmelanoma skin cancer within the past five years), or untreated peripheral vascular disease.</criteria>
