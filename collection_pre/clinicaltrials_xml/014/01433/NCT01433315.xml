	<brief_summary>Evidence suggests a relationship between sleep deprivation and cardiovascular disease. The investigators wish to determine whether 9 nights of modest sleep restriction results in activation of cardiovascular disease mechanisms, thus potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. The investigators hypothesize that sleep restriction will result in elevated blood pressure, inflammation, and neurocognitive deficits.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Physiologic Effects of Sleep Restriction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evidence suggests a relationship between sleep deprivation and cardiovascular disease. Voluntary sleep restriction is common, with 28% of the US adult population reports getting 6 or fewer hours of sleep per night, and those who do are 24% more likely to have cardiovascular disease and have twice the risk of hypertension. Insufficient sleep may conceivably be one of the most common, and most preventable, cardiovascular risk factors. The investigators wish to determine whether 9 nights of modest sleep restriction results in activation of cardiovascular disease mechanisms, thus potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. The investigators will combine our cardiovascular studies with state-of-the art sleep monitoring and neurocognitive tests to provide unambiguous data on the physiologic effects of sleep restriction. Together, the investigators findings will help explain whether the reduced sleep duration in the general population may be contributing to the current epidemic of cardiovascular disease, and suggest strategies to reduce this risk.</detailed_description>
