	<brief_summary>Studies of the human gut microbiome have suggested that treatment or prevention aimed at the obese microbiome could influence the development of obesity-associated metabolic disturbances. The objective of this project is to explore if a dietary intervention in 60 obese women with the probiotic Lactobacillus paracasei ssp paracasei F19 or flax seed fibres targeting the gut microbiome, can reduce insulin resistance, low-grade inflammation or dyslipidaemia, and to explore the interaction between the human genome and the gut microbiome. The study is based on the following hypotheses: - Treatment with the probiotic Lactobacillus paracasei ssp paracasei F19 and flax seed fibres will lower the metabolic risk profile in the intervention groups compared with placebo. - The effect on the metabolic risk markers can be correlated with changes in the gut microbiota (measured in faeces). After completion of the dietary intervention, the participants are offered a 10-week weight reduction program. Those who participate in the weight-loss program are invited to an optional follow-up visit in connection with the last visit at the clinical dietician, for the purpose of exploring the effect of weight loss on the gut microbiota and obesity-associated metabolic disturbances.</brief_summary>
