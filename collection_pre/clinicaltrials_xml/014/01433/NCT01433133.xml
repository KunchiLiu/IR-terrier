	<brief_summary>This will be a Phase I-II, open-label, single center, uncontrolled, dose-escalation study. The trial will be conducted in Israel at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center. All subjects will receive autologous InfraDure Biopump (micro-organ of dermis processed ex vivo transduced with genetic construct containing the gene for interferon)tissue implants intended to provide sustained production and delivery of therapeutic levels of INF for up to twenty four (24) weeks following INFRADURE Biopump implantation. Follow up will continue for a total of two years post INFRADURE Biopump implantation</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Biological Activity of InfraDure Biopump Secreting Sustained Interferon in HCV Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medgenics Inc. and Medgenics Medical Israel Ltd. are developing INFRADURE, an autologous dermal biopump capable of sustained secretion of therapeutic INF in the body, using a small tissue explant from the patient's own skin. The INFRADURE biopump is produced from a micro-organ (MO), typically measuring 30 mm in length and 1.5-2.5 mm diameter, which is harvested directly from the patient's dermis under local anesthesia. The micro-organ can be viably maintained ex-vivo for extended periods of time under standard culture conditions. INFRADURE Biopumps, produced by ex vivo transduction of MOs with Helper Dependent Adenoviral INF vectors (HDAd-INF), express and secrete INF. INFRADURE Biopump is monitored ex vivo prior to re-implantation, to attain true INF dosing. The INFRADURE Biopump is subsequently implanted subcutaneously back to the patient in order to provide continuous delivery of a known amount of INF. Each implanted autologous INFRADURE Biopump remains localized under the skin, and is accessible, so that if necessary, it can be removed or ablated at any time. The entire process from harvest to implantation requires 10-14 days</detailed_description>
