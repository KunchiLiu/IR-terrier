	<brief_summary>Elevated levels of thiamine may increase cellular energy metabolism by increasing the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. This has been hypothesized to have a beneficial affect in patients with several diseases including sepsis, heart failure, and diabetes. There is limited data on the pharmacokinetics of supraphysiologic doses of oral thiamine. The aims of this study are to: - Calculate the plasma and whole blood pharmacokinetics of supraphysiologic doses of oral thiamine in healthy volunteers; - Compare the different thiamine doses on the pharmacokinetic variables using repeated measures ANOVA.</brief_summary>
