	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on the neuropathic symptoms (pain/itch) due to a burn injury. The investigators hypothesize that the active tDCS group will show a significant pain/itch reduction when compared to sham stimulation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: 1. Providing informed consent to participate in the study 2. 18 to 64 years old 3. Any size closed wound from burn injury, occurring at least 3 weeks prior to enrollment in the study. Subjects with burns in scalp area will be excluded from the study as the electrode may cause irritation to the injuries 4. Use of regular medications for pain and/or itching control at stable doses for at least 3 weeks prior to enrollment in the study 5. No contraindications to tDCS: metallic implants in the head implanted brain medical devices 6. Subject is not pregnant at the time of enrollment 7. Neuropathic pain or itching (rated at least 4 on the VAS) within the burn scar or donor site, (pain can be described as burning, stabbing, piercing, pins and needles, tearing sensation) for at least 3 weeks.
