	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study s to determine whether treatment with Iodinated Active Charcoal can improve lung function and physical capacity in patients with chronic obstructive lung disorders. The rational for the study is the observation that COPD patients have an increased tissue load of mercury interfering with the function by NeuroEpithelial Endocrine (NEE) cells in the respiratory tract. Mercury binding to these NEE cells leads to an increased smooth muscle tonus and a reduced response to bronchodilator treatment. Initial observational data have shown an improved lung function and improved functional capacity after treatment motivating a larger placebo controlled POC study</brief_summary>
