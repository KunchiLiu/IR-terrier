	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on the pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee. The investigators hypothesize that there will be a decrease in pain levels with active stimulation, when compared to sham stimulation. Before, during and after stimulation, the investigators will measure and assess changes intracranial blood flow with transcranial ultrasound.</brief_summary>
