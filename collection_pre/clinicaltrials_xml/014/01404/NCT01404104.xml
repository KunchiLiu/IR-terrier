	<brief_summary>Temsirolimus is a drug that is being studied to possibly treat kidney cancer. It works by starving the cancer of nutrients, by cutting off the blood supply, which is hoping to shrink the cancer. This study will look at the experimental use of temsirolimus, 12 weeks prior to the surgical removal of the entire kidney or a portion of the kidney that is involved by the tumor.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will also find out whether or not there are certain biological factors that show up in patients during their treatment with this drug. This will be able to predict how their disease will respond to the therapy (biomarkers), and this will possibly allow anti-cancer therapies to be developed in the future to tailor to a patient's needs.</detailed_description>
