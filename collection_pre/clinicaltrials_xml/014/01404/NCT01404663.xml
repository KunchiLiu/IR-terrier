Most of these problems occur as the baby grows in the womb, but they can happen at any time during the first 2 years of life, while the baby's brain is still developing.Bone marrow derived stem cells are known as a effective therapy. In this study the investigators evaluate the side effect of bone marrow stem cell transplantation in patients with cerebral palsy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Side Effects of Bone Marrow Derived CD133 Transplantation in Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our study evaluate the side effects of bone marrow derived CD133 cells transplantation in 4-12years old patients with cerebral palsy.first all the patients undergone a comprehensive evaluation(physical exam, serology tests,EEG,MRI,GMFM66). After bone marrow aspiration,autologous stem cells prepare for each patient. In operation room ,the cells are transplanted by intrathecal injection. all the patients would be under observed to notice acute side effects and 3,6,9 and 12 months after injection they will be followed and evaluate by comprehensive tests.</detailed_description>
