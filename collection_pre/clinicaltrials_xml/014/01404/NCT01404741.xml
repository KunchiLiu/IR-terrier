	<brief_summary>5-azacytidine treatment prolongs survival in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but does not cure the disease. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a curative treatment option but is associated with a high risk treatment-related morbidity and mortality. In the current trial allogeneic stem cell transplantation will be compared to 5-azacytidine only treatment according to donor availability in elderly patients with MDS (55-70 years).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>5-azacytidine treatment prolongs survival in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but does not cure the disease. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a curative treatment option but is associated with a high risk treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Dose-reduced conditioning prior transplantation allows also treatment of elderly patients with MDS. In the current trial allogeneic stem cell transplantation will be compared to 5-azacytidine only treatment according to donor availability in elderly patients with MDS (55-70 years).</detailed_description>
