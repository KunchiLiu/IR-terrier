	<brief_summary>This clinical study has been planned to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the SUPRACR presbyopic excimer laser treatment algorithm for myopic eyes developed for applying to the cornea of the human eye in a single center. The developed software algorithm uses the subjective refraction of the eye to create a treatment for the distance vision correction. This part of the treatment does not show any difference to a regular aspheric LASIK treatment for myopic cases. In addition to the treatment for the distance vision an additional central ablation component will be added to address the near vision. The study design is applied as a single center unilateral eye safety and effectiveness study of the SUPRACOR presbyopic algorithm for myopia with a 3 months postoperative follow up.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Presbyopia is an age-related progressive decrease in the ability to bring near objects to clear focus. It is attributed to changes in the accommodative apparatus in the visual system which includes the ciliary muscle and crystalline lens. Current Presbyopia management includes bifocal or multifocal corrections in spectacles or contact lenses that provide good focus over a range of object distances. Current LASIK refractive surgery algorithms using Excimer laser are a safe, effective, and precise way to treat ametropia in eyes with regular corneas. The LASIK procedure uses a microkeratome to create a lamellar resection of the cornea at an intended depth ranging from 90 to 160 microns. The microkeratome is designed to maintain a "hinge" of tissue so that a flap of corneal epithelium and superficial stroma can be lifted to expose deeper stromal tissue while remaining attached to the cornea. The ablative energy of the excimer laser is then applied directly on the exposed corneal stroma to remove the required amount of tissue for a given refractive error. The amount of corneal tissue to be removed is determined by the magnitude of refractive correction and treatment area (optic zone). Once the laser ablation is completed, the flap is repositioned over the residual stromal bed. The presbyopic treatment consists of a standard aspheric treatment for distance vision and the so called SUPRACOR addition to correct near vision. The SUPRACOR addition provides a multifocal ablation with a central near addition with an aberration controlled transition zone towards the periphery, thereby allowing good focus over a range of object distances. This approach showed good near visual performance in hyperopic eyes (see also section 2.1). The SUPRACOR presbyopic treatment algorithm subject to this study has been specifically developed to prospectively generate a treatment file for the Technolas 217z100 laser that will provide Presbyopia correction among eyes with primary myopia or myopic astigmatism (distance correction).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must be at least 45 years old and not older than 85 years Subjects must read, understand, and sign an Informed Consent Form (ICF). Subjects must be willing and able to return for scheduled follow up examinations through 3 months after surgery. Subjects must have up to 7.0 diopters (D) of absolute spherical myopia (not spherical equivalent), with up to 4.0 D of refractive astigmatism (NOT corneal astigmatism) by manifest subjective refraction. The spherical equivalent and must be no more than 9.0 D. Subjects must have presbyopia as determined by an agerelated need for optical aid(&gt; +1.50 D) for reading with their best distance correction. Subjects who have be screened successfully for acceptance of the SUPRACOR simulation Subjects who are contact lens wearers must have gas permeable (GP) lenses discontinued for at least 3 weeks and soft lenses discontinued for at least 1 week prior to the preoperative evaluation in the eye to be treated. High contrast, manifest, best spectaclecorrected logMAR distance visual acuity (VA) must be correctable to at least 0.0 (20/20 or 6/6) in both eyes. Subjects for whom the combination of their baseline corneal thickness and the planned operative parameters for the LASIK procedure would result in less than 250 microns of remaining corneal thickness below the flap postoperatively. Subjects for whom the preoperative assessment of the ocular topography indicates that one or both eyes are not suitable candidates for treatment based upon the suggested computersimulated treatment plan (e.G. Keratoconus). Subjects with anterior segment pathology, including dry eye syndrome and cataracts which in the Investigator's opinion, would interfere with best spectaclecorrected VA (BSCVA) or a successful treatment. Subjects who have undergone previous intraocular or corneal surgery of any kind, including any type of excimer laser surgery for either refractive or therapeutic purposes. Previous LASIK treatment and standard cataract surgery is not an exclusion criteria</criteria>
