	<brief_summary>This is a randomized double blind 2x2 factorial controlled trial to evaluate efficacy tolerability of low strength Polycap versus two doses of low strength Polycap in patients with stable cardiovascular disease in reducing blood pressure and LDL. To evaluate the tolerability and safety of low dose potassium supplementation compared to placebo in patients with stable cardiovascular disease. Approximately 500 patients are planned to be randomized.</brief_summary>
