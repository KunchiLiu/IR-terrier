	<brief_title>Tolerability and Immunogenicity Study of Fluval AB Influenza Vaccine in Adults and Elderly Persons</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immunogenicity Objective: To assess immunogenicity of a single intramuscular (IM) injection of Fluval AB influenza vaccine (trivalent, seasonal, active ingredient content: 15 μg HA/0.5mL of seasonal H1N1, H3N2 and B influenza antigens each), as measured by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. Safety and Tolerability Objectives: To evaluate safety and tolerability (incidence of adverse events) of a single intramuscular (IM) injection of Fluval AB influenza vaccine (trivalent, seasonal, active ingredient content: 15 μg HA/0.5mL).</detailed_description>

Subjects will not be excluded with known adequately treated clinically significant organ or systemic diseases (e.g. asthma or diabetes), such that, in the opinion of the investigator, the significance of the disease will not compromise the subject's participation in the study Female volunteers aged 1860 years (i.e. participants of childbearing potential) with a negative result from the urine pregnancy test prior to vaccination who agrees to use an acceptable contraception method or abstinence throughout the trial and not become pregnant for the duration of the study. Capability of participants to understand and comply with planned study procedures Participants aged above 18 years provide written informed consent prior to initiation of study procedures Absence of existence of any exclusion criteria. Pregnancy, breast feeding or positive urine pregnancy test at baseline prior to vaccination. Female subjects who are able to bear children but not willing to use an acceptable contraception method for the duration of the study. Known hypersensitivity to eggs, chicken protein, thiomersal, formaldehyde, gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, neomycin or any other component of the vaccine History of GuillainBarré syndrome History of neurological symptoms or signs, or anaphylactic shock following administration of any vaccine Serious disease, such as cancer, autoimmune disease, advanced arteriosclerotic disease, complicated diabetes mellitus, acute or progressive hepatic disease, acute or progressive renal disease, congestive heart failure Immunosuppressive therapy within the past 36 months Concomitant corticosteroid therapy, including highdose inhaled corticosteroids Receipt of immunostimulants, Receipt of parenteral immunoglobulin, blood products and/or plasma derivate within the past 3 months Suspected or HIV, HBV or HCV infection Acute disease and/or axillary temperature ≥37oC within the past 3 days Vaccine therapy within the past 4 weeks Influenza vaccination (any kind) within the past 6 months Experimental drug therapy within the past 4 weeks Concomitant participation in another clinical study Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the evaluation of the study Past or current psychiatric disease of the volunteer that upon judgement of the investigator may have effect on the objective decisionmaking of the volunteer Alcohol or drug abuse of the participant.</criteria>
