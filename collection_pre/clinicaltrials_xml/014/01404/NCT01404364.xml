	<brief_title>Use of Intravitreal Triamcinolone and Retrobulbar Chlorpromazine as Alternatives to the Management of Painful Blind Eye</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The management of chronic eye pain is a constant challenge to ophthalmology. Treatment varies with the intensity of pain, and topical eye drops and contact lens therapy are effective in many patients. In refractory cases, and without vision, surgical removal of the eye through enucleation is considered classical therapy. As less invasive alternatives we have cyclodestruction and neurolytic drug injection in order to promote analgesia for a prolonged period. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of intravitreal triamcinolone and retrobulbar chlorpromazine as alternatives in the management of This is a prospective study of patients with blind painful eyes not responsive to topical treatment and with no indication for evisceration seen at the Department of Ophthalmology, Hospital Governador Celso Ramos (HGCR) in 2010.</detailed_description>
