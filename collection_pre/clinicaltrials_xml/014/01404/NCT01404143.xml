	<brief_summary>What is the difference in subscapularis strength between two different methods of subscapularis mobilization: incision of the tendon (tenotomy) versus peel, as measured by a hand-held dynamometer in the belly-press position at one year post operative? It is the investigators' hypothesis that a peel of the subscapularis will result in greater strength, a higher healing rate, and a greater improvement in shoulder function and quality of life following shoulder replacement.</brief_summary>
