	<brief_summary>The overall goal of this research is to develop safe and effective iron interventions that can be administered without production of plasma non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI: iron in the systemic circulation not bound to the iron-transport protein transferrin). The appearance of plasma non-transferrin-bound iron has been reported in uninfected adult volunteers after oral administration of iron supplements in doses similar to those used in the Pemba trial. This research project will (i) confirm the appearance of plasma non-transferrin-bound iron after administration of an iron supplement like that in the Pemba trial (~1 mg Fe/kg body weight, without food), and then determine the effects on production of plasma non-transferrin-bound iron and on iron absorption measured with stable isotopes (ii) of giving the supplemental iron (~1 mg Fe/kg) with the standard rice meal, and (iii) of giving a lower dose of iron (~0.1 mg Fe/kg) — like that used in home fortification — with the standard rice meal.</brief_summary>
