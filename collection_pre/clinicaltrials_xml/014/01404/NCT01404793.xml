	<brief_summary>Standard anesthetic management of liver transplantation patients includes a general anesthetic using multiple drugs, including the neuromuscular relaxant rocuronium. Pharmacokinetic modelling of this agent has been poorly described during liver transplantation, which impacts on appropriate dosing of this agent within this population where plasma concentrations can vary with fluid shifts and hepatic drug metabolism during the various phases of liver transplantation. Plasma drug and drug metabolite concentrations will be measured using the technique of solid phase micro-extraction (SPME). Measuring and correlating the levels of rocuronium and other liver metabolites with the degree of post transplantation hepatic dysfunction may serve as a simple and cost-effective marker to aid diagnosis, identify those at risk of hepatic dysfunction and potentially grade the severity</brief_summary>
