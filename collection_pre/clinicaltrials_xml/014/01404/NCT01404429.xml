	<brief_summary>To use different starting doses of methotrexate (7.5 mg per week) versus 15 mg per week in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, followed by similar hiking up of dose (2.5 mg per 2 weeks, till max of 25 mg per week). To look at the effect on efficacy ( or speed of efficacy) versus the adverse effects. Hypothesis: There will be no difference in the adverse effects, but better and faster control of disease when starting with a higher methotrexate dose</brief_summary>
