	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to prospectively examine the impact of various lifestyle habits in both men and women on the outcome of in vitro fertilization. There are 25 infertility centers in the United States which use the electronic medical record collection entity eIVF, made by Practice Highway, to collect medical and demographic information on the patients who are undergoing treatment at these centers. Information on every aspect of each cycle is also electronically collected daily during each cycle. Demographic and lifestyle information will be collected on all patients prior to cycle start and lifestyle habit information will be collected each time a patient logs onto the patient portal, which averages every few days.</brief_summary>
