	<brief_summary>Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children, with an annual incidence of 10.5 per million children less than 15 years of age. NB accounts for 15% of childhood cancer deaths. High risk (HR) patients carry a poor prognosis despite treatment with intensive chemotherapy, surgery and/or radiation, autologous bone marrow transplant, and treatment with cis-retinoic acid. New therapies are desperately needed for such patients. Recently, it has been demonstrated that HR NB patients benefit from anti-GD2 antibody therapy which directs the immune system against NB cells. To further explore means of harnessing the immune system to attack NB, the investigators are studying the combination of zoledronic acid (ZOL) and interleukin-2 (IL-2). ZOL has been demonstrated to have direct anti-neuroblastoma effects in laboratory studies. ZOL also augments the production of tumor killing white blood cells called gamma-delta T cells. When used in combination with IL-2, ZOL is capable of eliciting potent anti-cancer effects in patients, in part, via the expansion of gamma-delta T cells. In this present trial the investigators aim to study the tolerability of the combination of ZOL and IL-2 in pediatric NB patients. Patients will also be monitored radiologically for tumor response to therapy. Correlative biological studies will study the ability of this drug combination to elicit the production of NB killing gamma-delta T cells in children.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All patients must be diagnosed with treatmentrefractory neuroblastoma with no known curative treatment options. Tumor histology should be verified at diagnosis or relapse. Prior to enrollment, a determination of residual disease must be performed Patients must have a Lansky or Karnofsky performance scale score of ≥ 50%. Patients must have a life expectancy of ≥ 2 months (8 weeks). Total absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is at least 750, Hgb≥8 grams/dl, and plts ≥ 75K. PRBC transfusions are allowed. Patients with bone marrow disease will not evaluable for hematologic toxicity. These patients must have a peripheral absolute neutrophil count 750, platelet count ≥ 50K and Hgb ≥8 grams/dl. Transfusions are permitted to meet both the platelet and hemoglobin criteria. Creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR &gt; 70mL/min/1.73 m2 or a serum creatinine based on age/gender as follows: ≤ 0.8 mg/dL (for patients 2 to 5 years of age) ≤ 1.0 mg/dL (for patients 6 to 9 years of age) ≤ 1.2 mg/dL (for patients 10 to 12 years of age) ≤ 1.4 mg/dL (for female patients ≥ 13 years of age) ≤ 1.5 mg/dL (for male patients 13 to 15 years of age) ≤ 1.6 mg/dL (for male patients ≥ 16 years of age) Total bilirubin ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age, and SGPT (ALT) &lt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age. SOS (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, formerly known as venoocclusive disease [VOD]), if present, should be stable or improving. Shortening fraction of &gt; 27% by echocardiogram, or ejection fraction of &gt; 55% by radionuclide angiography. No evidence of dyspnea at rest. If PFTs are performed, FEV1/FVC &gt; 60% by pulmonary function test. Patients with seizure disorder may be enrolled if on anticonvulsants and well controlled. CNS toxicity &lt; Grade 2. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test. Patients of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective birth control method. Female patients who are lactating must agree to stop breastfeeding. All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed consent. All institutional requirements for human studies must be met. Previous treatment with antiGD2 and interleukin2 therapy</criteria>
