	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To assess the tolerability and safety of repeated oral ascending doses of SAR407899A in patients with moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) on stable angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitor (ACE-I) Secondary Objectives: - To assess in patients with moderate CKD the effect of concomitant multiple dose of SAR407899A and ACE-Is on office and 24-hr ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate - The effect of repeated multiple doses of SAR407899A on the pharmacodynamic response to ACE-Is (AcSDKP) - The pharmacokinetic profile of repeated oral administration of SAR407899A during co-administration of ACE-Is</brief_summary>
