	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to assess the safety of the addition of sitagliptin, and its effect on hemoglobin A1c (A1C) in pediatric participants 10-17 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with inadequate glycemic control. The primary hypothesis for this study is that sitagliptin reduces A1C more than placebo after 20 weeks of treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Assess Safety &amp; Efficacy of Sitagliptin as Initial Oral Therapy for Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Pediatric Participants. (MK-0431-083)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial is of approximately 56 weeks in duration, including a screening period of up to 1 week, a 1-week single-blind placebo run-in period, a 20-week placebo-controlled, double blind treatment period [Phase A] and a 34-week double-blind active controlled treatment period [Phase B] during which participants randomized to the placebo arm who have not initiated glycemic rescue therapy with metformin during Phase A will receive metformin (in a blinded manner). A telephone contact will be performed 14 days after the last dose of study medication to assess for any serious adverse events (SAEs). Two arms of the study were removed from the study by a protocol amendment.</detailed_description>

At screening, participants on insulin doses that are not stable can have their insulin doses adjusted and be eligible to participate after their dose remains stable for ≥12 weeks, if they meet all other eligibility criteria. In India, only participants on stable doses of insulin will be eligible. An A1C of ≥6.5% and ≤10.0% (For participants on insulin: an A1C ≥7.0% and ≤10.0%).

History of idiopathic acute pancreatitis or chronic pancreatitis. Known history of recreational or illicit drug use, or of alcohol abuse or dependence (within the past year). Donated blood products or has had phlebotomy of &gt;10% of estimated total blood volume within 8 weeks of signing informed consent, or intends to donate blood products or receive blood products within the projected duration of the study.
