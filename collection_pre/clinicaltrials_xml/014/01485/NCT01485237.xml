	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to review the resource utilization of severe adult H1N1 pneumonia undergoing antiviral and oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation and support with pulmonary rescue therapies ( nitric oxide, ECMO, HFO) in critically ill patients in Winnipeg. Secondary objectives include, comparison of resource utilization to other similar disorders (viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, septic shock, ARDS). The investigators will also look at the percentage of patients that required ICU care as compared to those who could be cared for on medical wards. The investigators will determine the resources used by both groups and compare. Finally the investigators will record the frequency of chronic comorbidities in hospitalized adult H1N1 patients.</brief_summary>
