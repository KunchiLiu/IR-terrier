	<brief_summary>Controversy exists regarding the optimal management of acute traumatic cervical spinal cord injury (SCI), especially those without bone injury. Although surgical decompression is often performed in SCI patients with cervical canal stenosis, efficacy and timing of surgery continues to be a subject of intense debate. In this randomized controlled trial, the investigators compare two strategies: early surgery within 24 hours after admission and delayed surgery following at least 2 weeks of conservative treatment. The purpose of this study is to examine whether early surgery would result in greater improvement in motor function as compared with delayed surgery.</brief_summary>
