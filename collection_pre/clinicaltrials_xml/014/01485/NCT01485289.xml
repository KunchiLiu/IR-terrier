	<brief_summary>The intent of this study is to complete the collection of clinical data on subjects enrolled in the Stabilimax Dynamic Spine Stabilization IDE clinical trial (#G060214) sponsored by the now defunct Applied Spine Technologies Inc . The Applied Spine assets, including the clinical trial data, were acquired by Rachiotek, LLC in 2010. When Applied Spine ceased their funding of the trial, a number of enrolled patients had not yet completed the two year follow-up visit defined as the study endpoint in the clinical investigation plan. No additional patient treatment is required to complete the study. Rachiotek has interest in pursuing IDE approval for a new study and the information collected in this study is essential for supporting the new Investigational Device Exemption application.</brief_summary>
