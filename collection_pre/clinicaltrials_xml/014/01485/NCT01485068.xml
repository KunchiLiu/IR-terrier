	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of the DANUBIO Paclitaxel Eluting Balloon in In-Stent Restenosis Lesions (DEBREST)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The DEBREST clinical trial is a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter, interventional study evaluating the investigational Danubio Paclitaxel Eluting Coronary Balloon in patients with in-stent restenosis (ISR) lesion(s) with reference vessel diameter ≥2.5 mm and ≤3.5 mm. The trial will allow the treatment of up to two ISR (either Bare Metal Stent (BMS) or Drug Eluting Stent (DES) ISR) per patient in native coronary arteries with mandatory predilatation with a conventional balloon. The DEBREST clinical trial will enroll 60 patients. All patients will receive Quantitative Coronary Angiography (QCA) before and after Drug-Eluting Balloon (DEB) inflation and at 6 months follow-up. All patients will have a clinical follow-up at 1, 6 and 12 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Restenotic lesion in a native coronary artery. 2. First ISR after BMS or DES implantation. 3. Reference diameter &gt; 2.5 and ≤ 3.5mm. 4. Target lesion length: ≤ 21mm. 5. Up to three restenotic lesions per patient. 6. Single restenotic lesion per vessel. 7. The lesion must be treated with the trial device Danubio. 8. During the index procedure, in case of 1. Treatment of a lesion in a vessel other than the target vessel or, 2. Treatment of a lesion in the target vessel proximal or distal to the target restenotic lesion, The treatment of the nontarget lesion must be successfully performed with a DrugEluting Stent before the treatment of the target lesion (residual stenosis &lt;30%; stent well deployed; no residual dissection; normal TIMI flow; no chest pain; ECG unchanged compared to preprocedural ECG). 9. Successful predilatation with a conventional balloon providing good angiographic result (i.e. absence of dissection, TIMI &gt; III). 10. The patient is at least 18 years of age. 11. Non menopausal women must provide a negative pregnancy test and use a double contraception until the end of the study. 12. The patient has clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease, stable or unstable angina with signs of ischemia, silent ischemia, or a positive functional test. 13. The patient is an acceptable candidate for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), stenting, and emergent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. 14. The patient or patient's legal representative has been informed of the nature of the trial and agrees to its provisions and has provided written informed consent as approved by the Ethics Committee (EC). 15. The patient agrees to return to the same research facility for required angiographic postprocedure followup visit at 6 months . 1. Bifurcation lesion(s) including left main. 2. The Danubio covers beyond the lesion proximally and distally with &lt; 2 mm. 3. Heavily calcified lesions. 4. Severe tortuous lesions. 5. Evidence of extensive thrombosis or dissection within target vessel before the intervention. 6. Documented Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) &lt; 30% at most recent evaluation. 7. A known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin or bivaluridin, ticlopidine or clopidogrel, paclitaxel or drugs in similar class, contrast media, which cannot be adequately premedicated. 8. Chronic total occlusion (CTO). 9. A serum creatinine level &gt; 2.0 mg/dL within seven days prior to index procedure. 10. Evidence of an acute MI within 72 hours of the intended index procedure (according to ARC definition). 11. Planned PCI of any vessel within 30 days postprocedure. 12. Surgery 30 days prior to this PCI or anticipated surgery 6months post this PCI. 13. During the index procedure, the target lesion requires treatment with a device other than PTCA prior to use of Danubio (including but not limited to cutting balloon, any atherectomy, any laser, thrombectomy, etc.). 14. Second restenotic lesion requiring treatment in target vessel. 15. History of a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the prior 6 months 16. Active peptic ulcer or upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding within the prior 6 months. 17. History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood transfusions. 18. Concurrent medical condition with a life expectancy of less than 12 months. 19. Any previous or planned treatment of the target vessel with antirestenotic therapies including, but not limited to brachytherapy. 20. Currently participating in an investigational drug or another device trial that has not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current trial endpoints; or requires coronary angiography, IVUS or other coronary artery imaging procedures</criteria>
