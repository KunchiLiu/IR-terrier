	<brief_title>Goal Directed Hemodynamic Management and Renal Outcome After Renal Transplant Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Volume assessment and management during renal transplantation is one of the most challenging problems the anesthetist has to deal with. It seems sensible that individualized volume management and hydration therapy during the operation and during the stay at the intensive care unit could improve perfusion of the transplanted organ resulting in a better transplant function. Aim of this study is to investigate the impact of a goal directed hemodynamic management on incidence of delayed graft function (DGF) after renal transplant surgery. Therefore patients will be randomized in one of two groups, the PiCCO group with goal directed hemodynamic management during operation and during the ICU-stay and the control group with hemodynamic management performed according to heart rate, blood pressure and central venous pressure.</detailed_description>
