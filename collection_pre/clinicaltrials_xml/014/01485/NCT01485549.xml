	<brief_summary>The main objectives are to determine on one hand whether oligomeric alpha-synuclein levels are increased in MSA patients compared to controls and on other hand whether there is a good agreement between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma levels.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oligomeric Alpha-synuclein in Multiple System Atrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder which is characterized by a variable combination of parkinsonism, cerebellar dysfunction, autonomic failure, and additional signs. No effective treatment is available. Together with PD and Lewy body dementia, MSA belongs to a group of neurodegenerative disorders, the alpha-synucleinopathies, which are characterized by the abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein. The development of biological markers for the diagnosis and prognosis in MSA remains an unmet need. Such biological markers are crucial for future disease-modification and neuroprotection trials. Alpha-synuclein has a high potential for biomarker development since it constitutes the pathological hallmark feature in MSA. The oligomeric alpha-synuclein seems to be particularly involved in abnormal protein aggregation in alpha-synucleinopathies. The study will compare alpha-synuclein levels in CSF and plasma between patients suffering from AMS and controls who are patients requiring spinal tap without being affected by a neurodegenerative disorder. The MSA patients and controls will receive CSF and blood sampling at one study visit.</detailed_description>
