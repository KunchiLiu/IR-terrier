	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to determine which baseline and yearly response factors (clinical and para clinical) predict overall disease-free status at Month 12 and Month 24, and clinical disease-free status in subsequent Months 36 and 48. The secondary objectives are: To identify prognostic factors at Baseline that predict overall disease-free status at Month 12, and to assess if yearly overall disease-free response factors predict overall disease-free status at Month 24; To evaluate clinical disease-free status (relapse, Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS]) at each analysis time point of Months 12, 24, 36, and 48; To identify prognostic factors at Baseline that predict clinical disease-free status at Month 12, and to assess yearly clinical disease-free response factors that predict clinical disease-free status (relapse, EDSS) in subsequent years at Months 24, 36, and 48; To evaluate the impact of Tysabri at each analysis time point of Months 12, 24, 36, and 48 on the following: annualized relapse rate (ARR), sustained EDSS progression and improvement (24-week sustained); To evaluate the impact of Tysabri at each analysis time point of Months 12, 24, 36, and 48 on the following: magnetic resonance image (MRI) measures: T2, T1, T1 with Gadolinium (Gd), brain atrophy; To evaluate the impact of Tysabri at Month 24 and Month 48 on the following: optical coherence tomography (OCT), Low and High Contrast Visual Acuity Assessment; To evaluate the impact of Tysabri at each analysis time point of Months 12, 24, 36, and 48 on the following: cognitive impairment (Symbol Digit Modalities Test [SDMT]), capacity for work (Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire [WPAI]), quality of life (QoL) (Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale [MSIS-29])</brief_summary>
