	<brief_title>Development and Validation of a NIRS-based Sinusitis Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the United States, approximately one in seven people develop sinusitis each year, and 20 million cases of acute bacterial sinusitis become chronic to require medical treatment. The optic light from the illumination wand travelled through the pallet into the sinuses and exited the face. The optic device can determine air-filled and fluid/tissue-filled spaces in the sinus cavity during clinical exam.</detailed_description>
