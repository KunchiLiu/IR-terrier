	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to evaluate whether the TEP-CT can be sensitive and specific in identifying degenerated intraductal papillary mucinous tumor of the pancreas.The results will be compared to those obtained by the pathological analysis of the removed piece of pancreas.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>18 Fluoro-deoxy-glucose Positrons Emission Tomography Combined With Computed Tomography (18-FDG TEP-CT ) in the Diagnosis of the Degeneration of Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Tumor of the Pancreas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Before surgery is undertaken, a 18 fluoro-deoxy-glucose positrons emission tomography combined with computed tomography (18-FDG TEP-CT ) will be performed. The primary outcome of this study is to compare results of the TEP-CT with those obtained by the pathological analysis of the removed piece of pancreas.</detailed_description>
