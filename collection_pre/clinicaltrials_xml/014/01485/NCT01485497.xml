	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Optical coherence tomography (OCT) can image the structure and geometry of hollow organs of the upper airway in sleep disorder. The research can identify the obstruction sites that help the select the appropriate treatment for potential surgical candidates.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The National Commission on Sleep Disorders Research estimated that 18 million Americans suffer from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) The majority of them are undiagnosed and untreated at this time. The current diagnostic gold standard for OSA is in-laboratory, a full night polysomnography (PSG). However, PSG is unable to provide information on upper airway structure and anatomy, and cannot identify the obstruction sites. OSA can lead to severe health complications including hypertension, heart failure, memory impairment, motor vehicle and work accidents, decreased work productivity, and increased risk of death.</detailed_description>
