	<brief_title>Phase II Study of STA-2 in Patients With Chronic Stable Angina</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of STA-2 in the management of chronic stable angina. The secondary objectives of this study were to evaluate the safety and pharmacological activities of STA-2 in the management of chronic stable angina. This was a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study of STA-2 in the management of chronic stable angina. The study period for each patient was approximately 7 weeks, during which the patient undergone one-week screening and washout period, followed by 6 weeks of treatment. Each patient was required to make a total of 5 visits. Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Change in total exercise time. After washout, patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly assigned either to the treatment or control group. The respective regimens were: Treatment group: STA-2 250 mg capsule, each containing 100 mg green tea polyphenols, 2 capsules ter in die (t.i.d.=three times daily) for 6 weeks, to be administered in a non-fasting state. Control group: Placebo 250 mg capsule, 2 capsules t.i.d. (three times daily) for 6 weeks, to be administered in a non-fasting state.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Male or female aged &gt; 20; 2. Patients who had effortinduced angina which was relieved by rest or nitroglycerin, or who had catheterizationdocumented coronary artery disease or previous myocardial infarction ≥ 3 months before screening; 3. Patients who manifested positive ETT (exercise tolerance testing) (defined as STsegment depression ≥ 1 mm compared with at rest, with or without limiting angina) at screening (Day 7); 4. Patients who manifested positive ETT (exercise tolerance testing) (defined as STsegment depression ≥ 1 mm compared with at rest, with or without limiting angina) on the day of enrollment (Day 0). ETT performance between Day 7 and Day 0 were required not differ by &gt;20% in total exercise time; 5. Female patient who was in the postmenopausal stage or of childbearing potential who: used adequate contraception since last menstruation and no plan for conception during the study; was nonlactating; had negative pregnancy test (urine) within 14 days prior to the study; 6. Able to provide written informed consent. Exclusion criteria: 1. Patients with preexcitation, conduction abnormalities, pacemaker rhythm, unstable angina or myocardial infarction within the preceding 3 months; 2. Patients with heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV), uncorrected valvular or congenital heart disease, patients who needed digoxin, isosorbide mononitrate, nitroglycerin sustained release preparation, theophylline, class I antiarrhythmic agents, digitalis, or monoamine oxidase inhibitors, as judged by the investigator; 3. Patients with any EKG abnormalities preventing the interpretation of ischemia (complete left bundle branch block); 4. Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) requiring bronchodilators; 5. Patients with hepatic failure (defined as aspartate transaminase (AST) and/or alanine transaminase (ALT) &gt; 3X the upper limit of normal values), and/or renal failure (defined as serum creatinine &gt; 3 mg/dL); 6. Patients with severe gastrointestinal illness as judged by the investigator; 7. Patient with any conditions that interfered the performance of exercise tolerance test as judged by investigator (e.g., knee/ankle arthropathy, Parkinsonism, stroke).</criteria>
