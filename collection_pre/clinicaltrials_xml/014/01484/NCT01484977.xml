	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the study drug lacosamide (200-600 mg/day) when added to a stable dose of levetiracetam (1000-3000 mg/day) with withdrawal of the concomitant sodium channel blocking-antiepileptic drug (AEDs) in subjects not well controlled on their current regimen.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject is male or female, at least 18 years of age Subject has a diagnosis of epilepsy with partialonset seizures according to the International Classification of Epileptic Seizures (1981) Subject is taking levetiracetam (LEV) in combination with 1 sodium channel blocking antiepileptic drug (defined as carbamazepine, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, or eslicarbazepine) as adjunctive treatment for epilepsy The minimum required seizure frequency during the 8week Retrospective Seizure Baseline is on average ≥ 2 partialonset seizures per 28 days with at least 1 seizure per 4 week period within the 8week Retrospective Seizure Baseline. Additionally, subjects must experience at least 1 seizure during the 4week Prospective Seizure Baseline Subject has been maintained on a stable dose of LEV and a sodium channel blocking antiepileptic drug (SCBAED) for at least 4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1) and during the 4week Prospective Seizure Baseline The minimum required seizure frequency during the 8week Retrospective Seizure Baseline is on average ≥ 2 partialonset seizures per 28 days (based on investigator assessment of subject report) with at least 1 seizure per 4 week period within the 8week Retrospective Seizure Baseline Subject has been maintained on a stable dose of levetiracetam (LEV) and a sodium channel blocking antiepileptic drug (SCBAED) for at least 4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1) and during the 4week Prospective Seizure Baseline, with or without additional concurrent stable vagal nerve stimulation (VNS). The VNS must have been in place for at least 6 months prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1) with constant settings for at least 4weeks prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1) and throughout the duration of the study Previous use of lacosamide History of alcohol or drug abuse History of seizure disorder characterized primarily by isolated auras History of primary generalized seizures History of status epilepticus within the 12months History of clustering seizures Nonepileptic events, including pseudoseizures that could be confused with seizures History of any medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, could jeopardize the subject's health or would compromise the subject's ability to participate in this study Lifetime history of suicide attempt, or suicidal ideation in the past 6 months Hypersensitivity to any component of lacosamide (LCM) History of acute or subacute progressive central nervous system disease History of severe anaphylactic reaction or serious blood dyscrasias Impaired renal function (ie, Creatinine Clearance (CLcr) is lower than 30 mL/min) at Visit 1 History of sick sinus syndrome without a pacemaker, or atrioventricular (AV) block, or subject has any other clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities History sodium channelopathy, such as Brugada syndrome History of myocardial infarction in the last 3 months</criteria>
