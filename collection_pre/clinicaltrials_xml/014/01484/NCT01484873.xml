	<brief_title>Weight Loss Study for Patients With Obesity Due to Craniopharyngioma or Other Brain Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothalamic obesity occurs in up to 60% of patients with tumors in the hypothalamic region, most commonly craniopharyngiomas. Hypothalamic dysfunction can be due to tumor infiltration and as a consequence of surgery or radiation therapy. Survivors who develop obesity have greater morbidity and mortality than normal weight survivors. Prevention and treatment of obesity in this population is vital in order to decrease the morbidity and mortality from diabetes, stroke and myocardial infarction. Exenatide (ByettaÂ®) is a GLP-1 homologue that was FDA approved for treatment of type 2 diabetes in 2005. It also decreases the rate of gastric emptying and increases satiety and has been shown to cause weight loss in some people. Exenatide may improve insulin sensitivity and satiety in patients with hypothalamic obesity but without the risks of bariatric surgery. The investigators hypothesize that treatment with exenatide will lead to weight loss in patients with hypothalamic obesity.</detailed_description>
