	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study to see how much study drug is in the blood after dosing children with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and to establish the correct dose for further clinical research.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pharmacokinetics Study for Pediatric Participants With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During Period I, tadalafil will be administered orally, once daily, at a low dose for approximately 5 weeks followed by a high dose for approximately 5 weeks. Dose levels are calculated based on body weight cohorts. Heavy weight cohort &gt;=40 kg, middle weight cohort &gt;=25 kg to &lt;40 kg. Light weight cohort&lt;25 kg. Participants who complete Period 1 may continue taking tadalafil in Period 2 for at least 2 years. Starting dose will not exceed the maximum weight range dose established in Period 1 and may be adjusted based on available safety and efficacy information.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Currently have a diagnosis of PAH that is either: idiopathic (including hereditary), related to collagen vascular disease, related to anorexigen use, associated with surgical repair, of at least 6 month duration, of a congenital systemic to pulmonary shunt (for example, atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus). Have a history of the diagnosis of PAH established by a resting mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥25 mm Hg, pulmonary artery wedge pressure ≤15 mm Hg, and a pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) ≥3 Wood units via right heart catheterization. In the event that a pulmonary artery wedge pressure is unable to be obtained during right heart catheterization, participants with a left ventricular end diastolic pressure &lt;15 mm Hg, with normal left heart function, and absence of mitral stenosis on echocardiography can be eligible for enrollment Have a World Health Organization (WHO) functional class value of I, II or III at the time of enrollment Have pulmonary hypertension related to conditions other than specified above, including but not limited to chronic thromboembolic disease, portal pulmonary hypertension, leftsided heart disease or lung disease and hypoxia History of leftsided heart disease, including any of the following: clinically significant (pulmonary artery occlusion pressure [PAOP] 15 to 18 mm Hg) aortic or mitral valve disease (that is, aortic stenosis, aortic insufficiency, mitral stenosis, moderate or greater mitral regurgitation) pericardial constriction restrictive or congestive cardiomyopathy left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40% by multigated radionucleotide angiogram (MUGA), angiography, or echocardiography left ventricular shortening fraction &lt;22% by echocardiography lifethreatening cardiac arrhythmias symptomatic coronary artery disease within 5 years of study entry as determined by the physician History of atrial septostomy or Potts Shunt within 3 months before administration of study drug Unrepaired congenital heart disease</criteria>
