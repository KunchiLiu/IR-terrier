	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine how much terbinafine is delivered to the nail bed after treatment with a number of modifications to a previously studied method for iontophoretic delivery of terbinafine gel. Iontophoretic delivery involves the use of a small electric charge to deliver drug across skin and nails.</brief_summary>
