	<criteria>Previously untreated advanced stage mantle cell lymphoma (Clinical stage 2 with abdominal involvement, stage 3 and stage 4). Histologic diagnosis confirmed by MSKCC pathologist as mantle cell lymphoma with Cyclin D1, or D2 and/or, D3 staining performed. Presence of measurable disease as determined by FDGPET, CT, endoscopy, colonoscopy, or bone marrow biopsy. Ages 1870. Transplant eligibility as confirmed by the Disease Management Team. KPS ≥ 70%. Adequate organ function: WBC ANC ≥ 1000 cells/mcL and platelet count ≥ 100,000 cells/mcL unless felt to be secondary to underlying mantle cell lymphoma at which any count is permissible. Adequate renal function as determined by Cr &lt; or = to 1.5 mg/dL or 24 hr creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/hr Adequate hepatic function as determined by total bilirubin &lt; or = to 1.5x ULN (unless known Gilbert syndrome) and AST &lt; or = to 5.0x ULN. Cardiac ejection fraction greater than or equal to 50% as determined by echocardiogram or MUGA. For patients ≥ age 60, a stress echocardiogram will be required, with same requirements as above. DLCO greater than or equal to 50% as determined by pulmonary function tests performed prior to initiation of treatment. Patients with positive Hepatitis B serologies will be treated per institutional guidelines. Prior treatment for mantle cell lymphoma, including more than 7 days of steroids, immunotherapy, radioimmunotherapy, or chemotherapy. This does not include patients who have initiated RCHOP at an outside institution within 2 weeks of enrollment. Patients using &gt; or = to 10mg/day of steroids for any chronic medical condition Pregnant or breastfeeding. Note: Premenopausal patients must have a negative, serum HCG within 14 days of enrollment,. HIV positive or Hepatitis C antibody positive.</criteria>
