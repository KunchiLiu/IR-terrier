	<brief_summary>If a person qualifies to participate in this study, they will have an equal chance of being assigned to either of two groups. One group will receive a patch that they will need to carry with them, because as soon as a cold sore starts (within 1 hour) they will need to put the patch over the sore. The other group will not get a patch, but will need to follow the other instructions anyway. When a subject's outbreak begins, they will need to return to the study center within 24 hours. Then they will return according to the appointments given within 10 days. If the study staff sees that their sore has healed enough before 10 days, subjects will be told that they don't need to return again. As long as subjects are in the study, they will need to answer a few simple questions every day on a card or booklet called a diary, starting the first day of their outbreak. If a subject is assigned to the patch group, they must wear the patch all the time, taking it off only to replace it (if it gets loose, dirty, or unsightly) and at the study center, when they are asked to remove the patch so the sore can be checked. During the study subjects will be allowed to use paracetamol for pain, but no other treatments or medicine. If they use paracetamol, subjects must record it in their diary. The study will be stopped, and there will be no subject visits or treatments during the end of year holiday break. If a subject experiences an outbreak during the holiday, they may follow their usual treatment routine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of a Cold Sore Patch for the Treatment of Herpes Labialis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a two-arm, randomized, clinician-blind study. No severe adverse effects are expected to be experienced in the control group. All subjects are allowed to treat cold sore related pain with an oral analgesic - paracetamol (APAP). The use of APAP for pain will be recorded as a concomitant medication. However, subjects will be required to refrain from using any additional treatment (topical or systemic) during study participation. Subjects randomized to treatment will be instructed to initiate the therapy within 1 hour onset of their first sign or symptom and record their assessment in the diary card (for no treatment subjects, they will only record assessments upon onset of first sign or symptom). All subjects will return to the study center for clinical assessments within 24 hours and 48 hours after onset of first sign or symptom/initiation of treatment and every other day thereafter, with a final visit at Day 10 or at the time of completion/discontinuation if before Day 10. Diaries will be completed each day, beginning upon initiation of therapy (Day 0) and continuing until study completion/discontinuation, and will include information on study product applications. Subjects assigned to a patch treatment will wear a patch continuously on their lesion and will apply a new patch on occasions where the patch becomes loose, falls off or becomes unsightly, including at study visits to the facility where subjects will be asked to remove their patch for clinical assessments. Treatment will continue until the lesion is healed, for a maximum of 10 days. As the test period will possibly extend through the end of year holiday break, subject visits and treatments will be halted during this break. All subjects who have not initiated therapy including subjects assigned no treatment group, will be allowed to use their regular therapy for a cold sore outbreak during the holiday break.</detailed_description>
