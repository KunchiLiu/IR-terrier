	<brief_summary>Following a personal observation and a retrospective analysis of the data, the investigators hypothesise that there is increased frequency of multiple gland disease in primary hyperparathyroidism in the elderly. This study will include patients over the age of 65, diagnosed with primary hyperaprathyroidism, referred for surgery and suspected to have a single adenoma according to preoperative imaging. Surgery will begin with a focal parathyroid exploration as suspected followed by an exploration of the other gland at the same time. Data will be analysed to determine the frequency of multigland disease in this population.</brief_summary>
