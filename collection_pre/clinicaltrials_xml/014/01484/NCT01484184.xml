	<brief_summary>As a first-in-class (Central Pattern Generator or CPG activator) approach, this tritherapy candidate called SPINALON has been identified and is currently under development for its capacity to temporarily induce episodes of involuntary locomotor movements. The primary objective of this Phase I/IIa study is to assess safety and tolerability of a single escalating dose of SPINALON (levodopa + carbidopa + buspirone) in chronic spinal cord-injured patients. As a secondary objective, preliminary evidence of efficacy will also be sought.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Assess Safety, Tolerability and MTD of a Central Pattern Generator-activating Tritherapy (SPINALON) in Patients With Chronic Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal cord injury (SCI) is generally considered as an irreversible condition for which no curative treatment has yet been found. A recent study sponsored by the Christopher &amp; Dana Reeve Foundation revealed an incidence ranging between 40 and 60 cases per million population and a prevalence estimated to be several times greater (new data: 1,275,000 cases) than previously reported(previous data: 200,000 cases). SPINALON (levodopa + carbidopa + buspirone) was discovered by Dr. Guertin and colleagues as a drug treatment candidate that can acutely elicit temporarily (lasting approximately 30-60 minutes) episodes of CPG activity and corresponding powerful weight-bearing hindlimb stepping in completely SCI subjects (preclinical efficacy data obtained from mice and turtles completely spinal cord transected thoracically). As such, SPINALON is currently being developed to become a chronic treatment (physical activity-based approach driven pharmacologically) against the multiple health problems or so-called 'secondary complications' associated specifically with the lack of physical activity (sarcopenia, osteoporosis, cardiovascular problems, dyslipidemia, obesity, type II diabetes, anemia, immune system deficiency, deep vein cloth, depression, etc.). This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single dose escalation study with fifty-one (51) patients who will receive either placebo capsules(starch) or capsules with buspirone only, levodopa/carbidopa only or buspirone/levodopa/carbidopa (SPINALON).</detailed_description>
