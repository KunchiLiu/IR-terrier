	<brief_summary>Collection of tissues for analysis from patients undergoing elective neck dissection. The hypothesis of the study is that specific genetic alterations occur in head and neck cancers that have spread to regional and/or distant sites, and these alterations can be identified from biopsy specimens to allow more accurate staging of tumor and better treatment planning.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The standard of care for the treatment of most squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is surgical extirpation of the primary tumor and elective neck dissection to remove regional nodes at risk for spread. Via this treatment regimen, the investigators will be able to prospectively obtain tissues for analysis from patients undergoing elective neck dissection. The specific aims of this study are to compare gene expression between head and neck tumors with and without regional lymph node metastases, and to compare gene expression between head and neck tumor with and without distant metastases.</detailed_description>
