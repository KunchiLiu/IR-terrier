	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the immune response to the H1N1 influenza or "flu" vaccine. The "immune response" is how your body recognizes and defends itself against bacteria, viruses, and substances that may be harmful to the body. HIV-1 infected children typically respond more poorly to vaccines compared to uninfected, healthy children and so this study hopes to learn whether or not the body will successfully produce enough antibodies (proteins that fight infection) that will prevent or fight the H1N1 flu virus. There is no information yet on the safety or immune response to this vaccine in children infected with HIV.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laboratory Study of Licensed H1N1 Influenza Vaccines in HIV-1 Perinatally Infected Children and Youth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV-infected children typically respond poorer to vaccines as compared to normal children. The FDA has currently approved several Influenza A 2009 monovalent vaccines to be used in children and adults. However, little data is available in perinatally infected youth. Therefore, knowledge of the immunogenicity of several of the licensed Influenza A 2009 monovalent vaccines in HIV-infected children and youth is critically important to address the health care needs of this vulnerable population. Efforts are currently underway to evaluate Influenza A 2009 monovalent vaccines in healthy children as well as other populations. This study will assess the immune response following receipt of three Influenza A monovalent vaccines in HIV-1 infected children and youth. Protection of HIV-1 infected children and youth from 2009 H1N1 Influenza A will require knowledge of immunogenicity of these new products in this population. The 2009 (H1N1) Influenza A virus is likely to infect a significant proportion of HIV-1 infected children and youth. Immunogenicity of licensed and commercially available Influenza A 2009 monovalent vaccines must be established in HIV-1 infected children in order to assure that this population is protected. Lack of a protective immune response would support the need for additional measures to protect this high risk population.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Children and youth 6 months to &lt;25 years of age at study entry. 2. HIV infection, defined as positive test results obtained from 2 different samples. Tests may include two of the same type OR two different types of tests listed below, as long as there are positive test results obtained from 2 different samples: HIV1 antibody (ELISA + WB), obtained at age &gt;18 months HIV1 culture, any age HIV1 DNA PCR, any age HIV1 RNA PCR &gt;10,000 copies/mL, any age Neutralizable HIV1 p24 antigen obtained &gt;28 days of age 3. In the opinion of the investigator, the route of HIV1 transmission is perinatally acquired. 4. Parent or legal guardian, youth of legal age, or subjects who are emancipated minors, who are willing and able to provide signed informed consent. 5. Planned receipt of one of the following FDA licensed Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccines within 24 hours following study entry: Group A: Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine (MedImmune FluMist®) Group B: Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine (Novartis Fluvirin®) Group C: Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine (Sanofi Pasteur Fluzone®) *OR has received one of the above vaccines within 4 hours prior to study entry. 1. Has a history of probable or proven pandemic 2009 H1N1 Influenza A virus infection prior to study entry. 2. Has received seasonal FluMist vaccine within 2 weeks prior to study entry. 3. Has received any 2009 H1N1 vaccines prior to the day of entry. 4. Has received any immunoglobulin or blood products within 3 months prior to study entry. 5. Has any condition that would, in the opinion of the site investigator, place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury or render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the study. 6. Use of anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the 36 months preceding study entry, or has immunosuppression as a result of an underlying illness or treatment (other than HIV1 infection). 7. Has an active neoplastic disease. 8. Long term use of glucocorticoids, including oral or parenteral prednisone or equivalent (more than or equal to 2 mg/kg per day or more than or equal to 20 mg total dose) for more than 2 weeks in the past 6 months, or highdose inhaled steroids (&gt;800 mcg/day of beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent) within the preceding 6 months (nasal and topical steroids are allowed).</criteria>
