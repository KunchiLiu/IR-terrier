	<brief_summary>There are two surgical approaches (incision types) used by surgeons who do total hip replacements. The purpose of this study is to determine which type of surgical approach (incision type) produces the best results for patients who have a total hip replacement. Null Hypothesis : There is no difference in complication rate, functional outcome, surgical time, or blood loss when comparing outcomes in patients receiving THA to hemiarthroplasty or ORIF for femoral neck fractures.</brief_summary>
