	<brief_summary>This randomized pilot clinical trial studies how well giving prolonged infusion compared to standard infusion of cefepime hydrochloride works in treating patients with febrile neutropenia. Giving cefepime hydrochloride over a longer period of time may be more effective than giving cefepime hydrochloride over the standard time.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prolonged or Standard Infusion of Cefepime Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Febrile Neutropenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. The objective of this study is to describe outcomes associated with prolonged infusion (3 hours) compared to standard infusion (30 minutes) cefepime (cefepime hydrochloride) among patients being treated empirically for febrile neutropenia. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized 1 of 2 treatment arms. All patients receive cefepime hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes as their first dose. ARM I: Patients receive cefepime hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes. ARM II: Patients receive cefepime hydrochloride IV over 3 hours. Treatment repeats every 8 hours.</detailed_description>
