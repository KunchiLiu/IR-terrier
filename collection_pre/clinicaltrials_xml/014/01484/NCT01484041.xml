	<brief_summary>This study is for women with confirmed hormone receptor positive HER-2 negative advanced breast cancer with evidence of disease resistance to an aromatase inhibitor. The purpose of this study is to determine how well these medications work together and/or if they have any side effects in patients with hormone-receptor positive metastatic breast cancer who have demonstrated progression of disease after first line hormonal therapy. This research is being done to determine if taking an already approved medicine (aromatase inhibitor) in combination with a new medication (dovitinib) results in better outcomes for patients with this disease. Both dovitinib and an aromatase inhibitor are pills that will be taken at home.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dovitinib Plus an Aromatase Inhibitor for Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I/Phase II open-label single arm trial of dovitinib in combination with anastrozole 1 mg daily, exemestane 25 mg daily, or letrozole 2.5 mg daily. Study subjects will receive the aromatase inhibitor on which they had previously derived clinical benefit.</detailed_description>
