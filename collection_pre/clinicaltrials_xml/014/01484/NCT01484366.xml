	<brief_summary>The hypothesis is that intramedullary nailing of the ulna and plating of the radius will result in a superior outcome as evidenced by two primary end points: 1. a lower rate of implant pain 2. a lower re-operation rate to remove painful hardware.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Forearm Shaft Fractures: Plating of Radius and Ulna Versus Plating of Radius and Nailing of Ulna</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized study to determine if intramedullary nailing of the ulna and plating of the radius is equal to, or superior to plating of both the radius and ulna for the treatment of both bone forearm fractures.</detailed_description>
