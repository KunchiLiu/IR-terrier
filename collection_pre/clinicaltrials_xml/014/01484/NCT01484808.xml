	<brief_title>The Utility of PSADv (PSA Density Velocity) While on Dutasteride for Predicting Prostate Cancer Incidence and Grade and Stage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a review of previously published data from a large prostate cancer prevention study known as REDUCE that utilized a 5 ARI, dutasteride. It is the investigators intention to review whether PSA velocity (change over time) will predict the presence of prostate cancer and its grade and stage (severity) by two year biopsy. The investigator will review and compare data to a previously published study of similar design with finasteride.</detailed_description>
