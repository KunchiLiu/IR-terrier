	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to establish the therapeutic equivalence between the test (Fluticasone/Salmeterol administered with Elpenhaler®, Rolenium®) and the reference formulation (Seretide®, administered with Diskus®), both containing 500/50μg of the Fluticasone/Salmeterol combination. The study will be conducted in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, 2x2 crossover fashion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Dose Study of the Fluticasone/Salmeterol (500/50 μg) Administered With Elpenhaler® Versus Diskus®</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In case of inhaled products, it is not possible to follow the classic scheme, based on similarity of plasma concentration-time behavior of parent drug in assessing bioequivalence. For this reason, a pharmacodynamic study was designed in order to assess the therapeutic equivalence of the new formulation of Fluticasone/Salmeterol with the innovative one. The test and reference Fluticasone/Salmeterol formulations will be compared in terms of their bronchodilator effects in lung function. Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) will be the primary efficacy measure and will be measured in such a way that a similar time-dependent increase in pulmonary function can be demonstrated for both Fluticasone/Salmeterol formulations in patients with asthma. In terms of safety comparison, repeated measurements of adverse events, vital signs, heart rate, blood hematology and biochemistry as well as ECG changes will enable the establishment of the similar safety profile of the test and reference Fluticasone/Salmeterol combinations.</detailed_description>
