	<brief_title>Intensive Lifestyle Intervention for Type 2 Diabetics: The KP TLC Pilot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peer reviewed research studies have proven the benefits of lifestyle interventions including the reversal of coronary artery disease and of diabetes. Experts agree that such a lifestyle must include a diet rich in whole, grown foods while low in saturated fat and cholesterol; regular physical activity; and healthy ways to cope with stress. There are several challenges with implementing such lifestyle interventions such as educating the general public and health care providers to the components of this lifestyle and in getting people to adopt these healthy lifestyle changes. While retreat-style, intensive lifestyle programs have shown that these obstacles can be overcome, they require monetary and time investments generally not feasible for the general public. A community-based, lifestyle program such as 'The Coronary Health Improvement Project' program offers similar potential benefits at a more reasonable cost. It does so through an intensive education (32 hours total) taught over 4 weeks, followed by an 8-week consolidation period which include live or DVD based group sessions, discussions led by a program facilitator, and medical monitoring. Kaiser Permanente, the leading Health maintenance organization in the nation, places special focus and significant resources into preventive medicine and health promotion, providing services to thousands of plan members but none with the level of intensity of 'The Coronary Health Improvement Project'. This study aims to determine if 'The Coronary Health Improvement Project' program can significantly improve blood sugar control in kaiser plan members with uncontrolled diabetes.</detailed_description>
