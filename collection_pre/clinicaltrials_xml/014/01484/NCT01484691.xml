	<brief_summary>This will be a single center study of asthmatic subjects and healthy controls which will investigate mechanisms of asthma through detailed molecular analysis of airway tissues and fluids. The primary goal will be investigate the role of microRNAs in Th2-driven inflammation in asthma. The investigators hypothesize that asthma is associated with abnormal expression of miRNAs in T cells which favors differentiation into Th2-cells. The investigators further hypothesize that asthma is heterogeneous based on the presence and absence of Th2-driven inflammation and that abnormalities in T cell miRNA expression will be most prominent in a subgroup with high levels of Th2-driven inflammation (as assessed using molecular markers that the investigators have previously established). Finally, the investigators hypothesize that inhaled corticosteroids will normalize the T-cell miRNA abnormalities observed in asthma, as corticosteroids treat Th2-driven inflammation. The samples collected will also facilitate the pursuit of secondary analyses designed to investigate mechanisms of inflammation and remodeling in asthma as well as molecular phenotypes of asthma.</brief_summary>
