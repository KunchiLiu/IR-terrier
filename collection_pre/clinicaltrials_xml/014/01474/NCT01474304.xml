	<brief_summary>Adding intraoperative IV acetaminophen, in addition to standard analgesics, will decrease opioid requirements over the first 12 hours of postoperative recovery following craniotomy. Opioids exacerbate symptoms of nausea and vomiting. Reducing postoperative opioid use hopefully will reduce incidence of nausea and vomiting in patients after craniotomy.</brief_summary>
