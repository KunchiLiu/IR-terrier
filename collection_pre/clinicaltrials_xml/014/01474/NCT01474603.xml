	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes is tightly associated with overweight and obesity. Inflammatory processes are crucial triggers for insulin resistance that paves the way to type 2 diabetes. In a previous study the investigators have shown that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids diminish adipose tissue inflammation in morbidly obese non-diabetic subjects. in this observational study the investigators will apply n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids as addition to a protein-enriched diet with low glycemic index to overweight and obese patients with insulin resistance, prediabetes and manifest type 2 diabetes over up to 6 months. Primary efficacy parameters are changes from baseline in HbA1c and body weight for for type 2 diabetes and all other patients, respectively.</brief_summary>
