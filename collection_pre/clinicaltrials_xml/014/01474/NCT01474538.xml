	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Insulin Lispro Versus Insulin Aspart in Participants With Type 2 Diabetes on Insulin Pump Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will provide clinical information on the use of insulin lispro in continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in participants with type 2 diabetes. This study is designed to allow comparison of the 2 rapid-acting insulin analogs, with regard to their efficacy and safety, when used as a pump insulin therapy in this participant population. Each participant will be randomized to 1 of the 2 sequence groups in a 1:1 ratio and randomization will be stratified according to screening A1C (less than or equal to 8.0% or greater than 8.0%) and thiazolidinedione (TZD) use (yes or no). The study design includes the following periods: Screening/Randomization, Treatment Period 1 (16 weeks), and Treatment Period 2 (16 weeks).</detailed_description>
