	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this research is to determine the efficacy of two portion-control strategies to achieve sustainable dietary and behavior changes and to promote weight loss and maintenance. A randomized controlled trial will test two approaches to managing portion sizes: one that gives individuals skills and tools to help them make appropriate portion choices, and another that focuses on consumption of pre-portioned foods in order to limit exposure to large portions in the personal food environment. A third group will receive a basic nutritional program to promote weight loss. The second aim of the research is to determine the effects of the programs on knowledge and consumption of appropriate portions, as assessed by innovative assessment methods and multiple-pass dietary recalls. The third aim is to conduct exploratory analyses of individual factors that may influence the response to the portion-control interventions, such as psychosocial indicators, blood biomarkers, and measures of adherence to the interventions. The expected outcome of the project is that it will lead to the development of specific, evidence-based strategies to help control portion sizes in order to manage weight.</brief_summary>
