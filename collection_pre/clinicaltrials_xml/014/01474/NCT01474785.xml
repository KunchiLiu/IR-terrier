	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if interruption in gastric-adipose tissue axis signaling contributes to early improvements in oxidative stress, insulin sensitivity, and inflammation, and to determine if interruption of the stomach in RYGB results in reduction of plasma acylated ghrelin (AG) and in an altered acylated ghrelin:unacylated ghrelin (AG:UAG) ratio which may contribute to decreased oxidative stress and improved insulin sensitivity.</brief_summary>
