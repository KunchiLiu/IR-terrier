	<brief_summary>The purpose of the research is to check the efficiency of practicing the tools of the Grinberg method (GM) in reducing Low-back Pain (LBP), reducing limitations in movement as a result of the pain, and improving the general quality of life. The hypothesis suggests that by learning to perceive pain differently, the level of pain will reduce and general well-being improved.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The research will include 140 patients, who attended the pain clinic due to chronic LBP. Any change in the pharmacological regimen will be done with consult of the tending doctor and the change will be reported. Tools and Methods A patient, whom volunteers to take part in the research, will be invited to the Ichilov Pain clinic in order to fill-in questionnaires and sign an informed consent form. Each participant in the experiment group will participate in a series of 6 sessions lasting 1 hour each, extending between 6 to 8 consecutive weeks, with one of the qualified GM practitioners partaking in the experiment. Each participant will have all their sessions with the same GM practitioner throughout the experiment. Immediately after the last session, the participants will fill-in the same questionnaires given at the beginning of the experiment. The non-GM intervention group will answer the questionnaires after 6-8 weeks of pharmacological treatment only.
