	<brief_summary>CACIPLIQ20 is a nanopolymer engineered to mimic glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfates. Glycosaminoglycans are implied 1) in the stabilization of the micro-environment of cells, known as extracellular matrix, by binding to structural proteins, and 2) in the cell communication by protecting growth factors. At the site of a lesion, glycosaminoglycans are degraded, thereby the extracellular matrix is disorganized and the tissue is destroyed. By replacing damaged glycosaminoglycans, CACIPLIQ20 provides a protective function and restores the matrix architecture and the cell communication, a process known as Matrix Therapy. As for now, three non-controlled pilot studies have been carried out on small populations. They have shown a substantial enhancement of chronic wounds state after treatment with CACIPLIQ20. Therefore, the purpose of this new controlled study is to determine whether CACIPLIQ20 can shorten diabetic neuropathic plantar ulcers healing when the off-loading is mandatory. The study's main hypothesis is that CACIPLIQ20 application on a non-healing diabetic plantar ulcer in an off-loading mandatory context would reinitiate the natural process of tissue regeneration and lead to total wound closure faster than following standard wound care.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Of CACIPLIQ20 On Diabetic Ulcers In Patients Wearing An Nonremovable, Windowed, Fiberglass Cast Boot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study specifically targets diabetic patients presenting neuropathic plantar ulcers. Diabetic patients have a 25% risk to develop foot ulcers during their life, and one diabetes-induced amputation is performed every 30 seconds in the world. Textbook-case of perforating foot ulcer (Malum Perforans Pedis) is caused by a mechanical impairment : only a thoroughly observed discharge may lead to good wound care and, ultimately, healing. Thus, this study proposes the utilization of an nonremovable windowed Fiberglass Cast Boot, a technique which has led to healing in 6 to 8 weeks for 95% of neuropathic foot ulcers treated that way. As 80% of amputations are caused by non-healing ulcers, it appears obvious that enhancing foot wounds healing could reduce amputation rate and in that way fairly improve diabetic patients' quality of life.</detailed_description>
