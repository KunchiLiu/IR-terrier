	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to conduct a preliminary test of the feasibility of a multi-micronutrient intervention to improve micronutrient status, cardiac function and quality of life in Veterans with Congestive Heart Failure (CHF).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility and Effectiveness of Micronutrients as Palliative Care Therapy in Patients With Congestive Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Veterans with stable CHF resulting from ischemic cardiomyopathy with systolic dysfunction and an ejection fraction ≤45% and who fit the criteria of stage B, C and D 2 heart failure will be recruited. This is a one group study with Veterans serving as their own control. They will receive 50 mg thiamin, vitamin B50 and 220 mg Zn as Zn sulfate daily for 6 months. Additionally, they will receive 50,000 IU Vitamin D as ergocalciferol each week for 8 weeks then every other week for 16 weeks. Pre (baseline) and post (6 months) cardiac function will be tested with echocardiogram and cardiac MR (when applicable), biochemical measures of thiamine, pyridoxine, zinc and Vitamin D will be measured at baseline, 3 months, 6 months and one year. Quality of life will be measured using the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire baseline, month 3,6,and one year. Nutritional assessment including a nutrition focused physical examination and three days food records will also be measured at baseline, month 3, 6 and one year.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>stable CHF (three months without an exacerbation or major change in medication regimen and cardiology provider determined medication regimen (angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), aldosterone, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and Beta blockers) has been maximized), Stage B, C or D CHF resulting from ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction ≤ 45% with or without a pacemaker or defibrillator . Potential participants who require further medication titration to attain maximal benefit, will need to wait 30 days after the provider has maximized the dose of medication to participate. recent (within the last three months) acute myocardial infarction, or unstable angina, pacemaker or defibrillator placed less than six months prior, or anticipated pacemaker or defibrillator placement in the next six months, or a bi ventricular pacemaker, corticosteroid use (&gt; 20 mg Prednisone use or its equivalent per day &gt; 2 weeks duration), isoniazid therapy, use of the study nutrition supplements at the study doses for the past month or longer,(if the participant has been taking a multivitamin or multivitamin with minerals , or other water soluble vitamins they will need to stop taking these for at least one month prior to initiating the study intervention), endstage liver disease, endstage renal disease requiring dialysis, receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy, active alcohol/ substance abuse, pregnancy /lactation, women of childbearing potential who do not have medical documentation of surgically induced menopause, pancreatitis, any psychological issues like severe depression, claustrophobia, active problematic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or memory loss that prevents compliance with the supplement intake, agoraphobia which may interfere attendance at research visits or fear of needles which would limit their ability to have the blood tests completed, and any active eating disorders. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan will not be used to test cardiac function in participants with a pacemaker or defibrillator. Nor will it be used for potential subjects with ferro magnetic materials (i.e., penile stimulator), inability to lie flat for up to one hour, inability to hold their breath for up to 15 seconds or those with claustrophobia.</criteria>
