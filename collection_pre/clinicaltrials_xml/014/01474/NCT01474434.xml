	<brief_title>Efficacy of LCQ908 on Cardiovascular Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study had 2 parts. Part A was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, non-confirmatory crossover study assessing response to a high-fat meal challenge in the setting of pradigastat versus placebo. Part A had 2 cohorts i.e. Cohort 1 patients with stable coronary artery disease and hypertriglyceridemia and Cohort 2 patients with asymptomatic non-obstructive coronary artery disease or elevated coronary heart disease risk and hypertriglyceridemia. Part B was a double blinded phase designed to assess response to three months of chronic treatment with pradigastat versus placebo on a normal diet. The trial was terminated after the interim analysis of Part A, Cohort 1. The interim analysis results indicated that the high-fat meal challenge did not induce any impairment on either myocardial perfusion reserve index (MPRi) or exercise treadmill performance. Part B was never started.</detailed_description>
