	<brief_title>Metabolic Availability of Lysine From Rice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators objective is to determine the metabolic availability (MA) of lysine in cooked white rice protein using the indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) technique. Five men will receive graded levels (20, 40, and 60, and 70%) of the lysine requirement of 35 mg/kg/d as a crystalline AA mixture,and cooked rice protein (20, 40 and 60%), respectively.</detailed_description>
