	<brief_title>Sedation Effect of Dexmedetomidine Versus Remifentanil to Fibreoptic Intubation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Awake fibreoptic nasotracheal intubation is an effective technique for the management of patients with difficult airways undergoing oral maxillofacial surgery. Both optimal intubating conditions and patient comfort are paramount while preparing the patient for fibreoptic intubation. One challenge associated with procedure is to provide adequate sedation while maintaining patients' airway ventilation. Dexmedetomidine, because of its sedative,analgesic properties and minimal influence on patients' ventilation, might be a useful management for it. While with the development of target controlled infusion (TCI) technology, remifentanil sedation becomes a potential sedation in clinical practice.</detailed_description>
