	<brief_title>Multi-country Post-Marketing Observational Study on Maintenance of Effectiveness of Adalimumab (Humira®) in Patients With Ankylosing Spondylitis and Psoriatic Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Additional study objectives were to evaluate AS and PsA with regard to extra-articular manifestations (EAMs), functional status, the use of concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, and work productivity impairment. In addition, the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS), a new disease activity index in AS, was measured in parallel with the standard Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) score to assess the effectiveness of adalimumab in treating axial symptoms.</detailed_description>
