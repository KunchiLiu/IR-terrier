	<brief_summary>This randomized, non-comparative study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Avastin (bevacizumab) in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Patients will be randomized to receive Avastin 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks or fotemustine 75 mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15, followed by, after a 5 weeks interval, 100 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks. Treatment with fotemustine serves as a calibration arm and no formal efficacy comparison will be made between the two treatment arms. The anticipated time of study treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</brief_summary>
