	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to collect blood samples and study cancer cells found in these blood samples from patients with pancreatic cancer. Prior research has discovered that tumor cells can be collected from the blood of patients with pancreatic and other cancers. The physicians have developed techniques for isolating and analyzing cancer cells using a simple blood test. They will study how these cells relate to how chemotherapy works. They hope to use this information to guide choices of treatment for patients in the future.</brief_summary>
