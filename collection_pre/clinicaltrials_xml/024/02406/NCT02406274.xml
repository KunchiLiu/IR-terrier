	<brief_summary>Contrast Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM) is an advanced form of mammography which is performed after injection of contrast or dye into a vein in the arm. This dye is the same dye that is used for CT scans. This type of mammogram includes a regular mammogram as well as additional pictures with the dye. This particular study is being done to determine if by adding the dye in the veins the investigators are better able to identify the cause of the lump than if they just did the regular mammogram alone.</brief_summary>
