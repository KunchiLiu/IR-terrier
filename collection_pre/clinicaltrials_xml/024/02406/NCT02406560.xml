	<brief_summary>Each subject will be given tafamidis after either a high fat meal or while fasted. After swallowing tafamidis, tafamidis blood concentrations will be measured periodically for one week. After about 14 days, subjects will take either a different dose of tafamidis or the same dose under the opposite meal condition. Tafamidis concentrations from the three different conditions will be compared to determine if they are approximately the same.</brief_summary>
