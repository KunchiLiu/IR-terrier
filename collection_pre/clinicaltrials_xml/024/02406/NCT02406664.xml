	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the change in kidney function and blood pressure after gastric bypass versus conventional medical therapy in morbid obesity. The study mainly focus on glomerular filtration rate(GFR) with known relation to the renal function and 24 hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring after intervention of gastric bypass or medical treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Bariatric/Metabolic Surgery on GFR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metabolic syndrome is strongly associated with obesity and the patients with this syndrome are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Obesity constitutes a strong risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease. Among diabetics, obesity is known to amplify the risk for kidney disease. Bariatric surgery has yielded dramatic results including longitudinal loss of excess body weight and either complete reversal or significant improvement of several features of metabolic syndrome. In addition, many observational studies have demonstrated significant reduction in proteinuria after bariatric surgery. However, the changes in the component of cardiovascular problem among metabolic syndrome and changes in renal filtration function or progression to end stage kidney disease in morbidly obese patients after weight loss surgery have not been extensively studied. Therefore, our study mainly focus on glomerular filtration rate(GFR) with known relation to the renal function and 24 hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring after intervention of gastric bypass or medical treatment.</detailed_description>
