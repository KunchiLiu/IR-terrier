	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the addition of ISTH0036, an antisense oligonucleotide against TGF-β2, to glaucoma filtration surgery (trabeculectomy). The treatment aims at improving the surgery outcome by prevention of excessive scarring and trabecular meshwork transformation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Dose Escalation Study to Investigate the Safety of ISTH0036 in Subjects With Glaucoma Undergoing Trabeculectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) is known to play a key role in glaucoma. Increased levels of TGF-β2 in the eye have been linked to trabecular meshwork transformation, increased intraocular pressure and direct optic nerve damage. Trabeculectomy is the standard surgical intervention to reduce intraocular pressure in subjects no longer sufficiently responding to pressure-lowering medications. Scarring of the surgically opened canal (bleb) often abolishes the effect of trabeculectomy (despite the intraoperative use of Mitomycin C to prevent this). TGF-β2 has been described to play a distinct role in the fibrotic process of bleb closure.</detailed_description>
