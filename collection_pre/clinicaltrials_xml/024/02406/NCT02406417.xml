	<brief_summary>Early detection and management of pituitary dysfunction reduces the morbidity that ensues as a consequence of missed or delayed diagnosis of this condition, and which may result in life-threatening events and increased mortality. The investigators study will explore the use of reflex strategies within the laboratory in capturing suspicious pituitary function test results from Primary Care patients and following these up with appropriate reflective testing. Subsequently patients identified from these results to have a possible underlying piuitary dysfunction will have an alert sent to their family physician prompting referral to the Endocrine team for further investigation and management.</brief_summary>
