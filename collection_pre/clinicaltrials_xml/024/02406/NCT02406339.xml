	<brief_title>Effectiveness of NMES Associated to Vascular Occlusion in Functional Performance and Muscle Hypertrophy in Athlete's</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pre-season preparation is seen as vital to maximize sports performance. However, there has been much debate on what the best strategy to prepare for use. Basketball is a sports activity of high intensity and volume of jumps, which are generally likely to cause injuries resulting from muscle imbalance and dynamic overload. Primarily in activities with eccentric contraction of the knee extensor muscles. A means of preventing injuries and optimization of sports performance is through strength training. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) has been a physical therapy effective in increasing the recruitment of muscle fibers and strength. Another method that has been shown effective in increasing strength and muscle hypertrophy is the association of low intensity training and peripheral vascular occlusion. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of neuromuscular electrical stimulation associated to vascular occlusion of lower limb muscle recruitment, strength and muscle hypertrophy. This will be met recruited basketball athletes of high performance, the males, aged between 18 and 30 years and BMI between 20 and 24 Kg/m2. The athletes will be randomized into four groups: group control (n = 20), group electrotherapy (n = 20) and group electrotherapy + vascular occlusion (n = 20). Will be carried out 12 sessions of treatment during the pre-season, and the volunteers evaluated before and after the pre-season and in middle the season, through the following instruments: Isokinetic Dynamometer, Surface Electromyography, Force Platform, Cross Section Area of Muscle, Vertical Jump, Functional Evaluation (Jump, Agility and Balance), Infrared Thermography and Numeric Scale of Pain Evaluation. For data analysis, normality test is used to verify the data distribution and consistent statistical test for the appropriate comparisons within and between groups, and thus considered two factors in the comparisons, time and group. Will adopt a significance level of 5%.</detailed_description>
