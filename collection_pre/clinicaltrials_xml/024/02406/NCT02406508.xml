	<brief_title>Sequential Melphalan for Use With Hepatic Delivery System Treatment Followed by Sorafenib in Patients With Unresectable HCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single arm, open label, multi-center, phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sequential treatment with Melphalan/HDS followed by sorafenib in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) confined to the liver. Eligible patients will receive up to 3 Melphalan/HDS treatments. Each treatment cycle consists of 6 weeks with an acceptable delay for another 2 weeks before next planned treatment. The Melphalan/HDS treatment will be terminated in patients with progressive disease (PD), complete response (CR), and &gt; 8 weeks delay of recovery from toxicity after last PHP treatment. With the exception of patients with PD, all patients will be treated with sorafenib after completing the Melphalan/HDS treatment. Patients with PD will be managed with standard of care off-study by their treating physician.</detailed_description>
