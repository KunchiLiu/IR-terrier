	<brief_title>H-Senses Project - Self Care Mediated by the Senses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The work environment of health professionals is commonly considered stressful, given that they need to deal with difficult situations that include pain, risk of death, the decisions that need to be fast and accurate, and conflicts generated in interpersonal relationships. There is an ongoing discussion that the investigators need to care for those who care, however, there are few interventions studied and validated to effectively reduce the stress of these professionals that resonate in states of well-being. There is little room for discussion of this topic during the workday, as well as to learn techniques and measures for effective stress management. This study aims to explore the relationship between well-being, self-esteem and stress of women health professionals, and compare three self-care interventions mediated by the senses.</detailed_description>
