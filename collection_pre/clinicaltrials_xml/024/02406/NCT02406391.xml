	<brief_summary>In the United States, the highest incidence of cervical cancer occurs in inner city urban centers, rural areas, the deep South, Appalachia and the U.S.-Mexico border. The goal of this study is to study predictors of adherence among patients seeking care at an inner city medical center in New York City and the U.S. Mexico border for cervical cancer prevention, namely, Pap smears and colposcopy exams.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adherence to Preventive Care for Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because there are multiple pathways through which a person is influenced to seek and receive care, the investigators will conduct interviews with patients seeking care for cervical cancer prevention at an inner city medical center. The investigators will ask questions related to previous screening, diagnostic, and treatment practices as well as barriers experienced in seeking such care. The investigators will also explore patients' level of resiliency and coping as predictors of adherence to timely care. Furthermore, among immigrants, questions about acculturation and discrimination will be asked. Additional measures of socioeconomic status, such as education, income and occupation will also be collected.</detailed_description>
