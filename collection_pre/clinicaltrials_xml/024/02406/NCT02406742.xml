	<brief_summary>Safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of CC-122 alone and in combination with ibrutinib and obinuzutumab. CC-122 has multiple activities, including immune modulation of several immune cell subsets and antiproliferative activity in CLL. CC-122 has also been shown to have a tolerable safety profile with some preliminary signs of efficacy with early human experience.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1/2, Open-label, Dose Finding Study to Evaluate CC-122 in Combination With Ibrutinib and Obinutuzumab in Subjects With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objectives of this Phase 1/2 Study are to determine the safety of single agent CC-122 and the safety, tolerability, and RP2D of CC-122 when administered in combination with ibrutinib and in combination with obinutuzumab to subjects with CLL/SLL. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the PK profiles of subjects administered CC-122 in combination with ibrutinib and in combination with obinutuzumab, to determine ibrutinib concentrations when given alone and in combination with CC-122 and to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of CC-122 at selected dose levels/regimens.</detailed_description>

EXPANSION COHORT 2 OF ARM C: 11. Subjects in Cohort 2 of Arm C must meet the following criteria: 1. Subject must have received at least one BCR PI (ibrutinib, idelalisib, or other approved BTK or PI3K inhibitor) and/or venetoclax; 2. Subject must be either resistant to or intolerant of (ie., treatment failures) the last BCR PI and/or venetoclax. Resistant is defined as relapsed or refractory per IWCLL2008: i. Relapse is defined as a patient who has previously achieved a CR or PR, but after a period of 6 or more months, demonstrates evidence of disease progression. ii. Refractory is defined as failing to achieve a CR or PR, or disease progression within 6 months after initiation of treatment with an approved BTK or PI3K inhibitor (eg, ibrutinib, idelalisib) or venetoclax. iii. Intolerance is defined as the inability to continue treatment with a BCR PI or venetoclax due to toxicities or due to development of a contraindication that makes the subject ineligible to receive further treatment with a BCR PI or venetoclax. 1. Any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from participating in the study. 2. Any condition including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study. 3.

The glycemic targets for subjects with diabetes should take into consideration age, comorbidities, life expectancy, and functional status of the subjects and follow established guidelines (eg, International Diabetes Federation, the European Diabetes Working Party guidelines, and the American Diabetes Association). For younger (&lt; 70 years old) or subjects with life expectancy ≥ 10 years, the target glycosylated hemoglobin, type A1C (HbA1c) should be &lt; 7.0%. The target HbA1c for older (≥ 70 years old) subjects or subjects with life expectancy &lt; 10 years should be &lt; 8.0%. Consultation with an endocrinologist is recommended when deciding if diabetes is optimally controlled. c. Chronic symptomatic congestive heart failure (Class III or IV of the New York Heart Association Classification for Heart Disease). d.

Patients should be referred to a specialist if they are carriers before treatment starts (see PI or SmPC). Subjects who are positive for antiHBc and/or antiHBs but negative for HBsAg and HBV DNA may be treated after consultation with a hepatologist. 8. Any peripheral neuropathy ≥ NCI CTCAE Grade 2. 9. Use of systemic corticosteroids in doses greater than prednisone equivalent to 20 mg/day. 10. Medicines with high probability to cause QT prolongation or torsades de pointes.

Rapid disease progression is defined as follows: 1. For subjects with measurable nodal disease, the increase in the sum of diameters of the largest lymph nodes (up to 3 nodes) exceeds 1 cm per day OR the diameter of the largest lymph node exceeds 5 cm during the 5 day wash out. 2. For subjects with lymphocytosis, the increase in the ALC exceeds 2x109/L per day OR the ALC exceeds 100,000 x109/L during the 5day wash out; b. Arm C: No minimum washout is required after discontinuation of ibrutinib (or other BTK inhibitors) c. Approved PI3 kinase inhibitors: Subjects may start study treatment within 3 days of discontinuation of approved PI3 kinase inhibitors. 14.
