	<brief_summary>Antiplatelet treatment in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) is still challenging because of bleeding and thrombotic complications. The investigators hypothesized ticagrelor once daily dose would achieve tolerable antiplatelet effects compared with ticagrelor twice a day dose in ESRD patients on HD.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and confers an increasing risk of stent thrombosis even when dual antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel and aspirin) is administered. Patients with severe CKD or end stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) exhibited higher platelet reactivity to clopidogrel than did those with normal renal function. The investigators recently reported platelet inhibition by ticagrelor was faster and markedly greater than by clopidogrel with onset dosing regimen in patients with ESRD on HD. However, few studies have been conducted whether platelet reactivity during ticagrelor treatment is associated with endothelial function, platelet activation markers and inflammation status in ESRD patients on HD. Additionally, the dose dependent effects of ticagrelor have been rarely evaluated.</detailed_description>
