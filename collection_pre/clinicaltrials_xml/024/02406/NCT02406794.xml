	<brief_summary>Background: It has been demonstrated that aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are more effective than tamoxifen in reducing breast cancer recurrence. However, despite the excellent results, the side effects associated with them cause between 24.5 and 31.3% therapy abandon. This study aimed to verify the effectiveness of Neuromuscular Taping (NMT) in the treatment of myalgia and arthralgia induced by AIs in women who have had breast cancer. Our goal is to improve their pain, decreasing by 20% the values of their Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at various points in order to improve symptoms and increase adherence. Methods/Design: The study includes 156 breast cancer survivors treated with endocrine therapy (aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors) from Virgen de la Victoria Hospital (MÃ¡laga, Spain) and musculoskeletal disorders resulting from such treatment. Clinical and patient data were obtained from medical histories, genetic and proteomic analysis, grip strength and algometry measured, questionnaires and the outcome of interest, their VAS. NMT is applied in four possible locations, according to the symptoms of each participant: carpal tunnel, cervical, lumbar or lumbar and cervical. There are several more interventions before repeating the readings from the last five weeks of the start of the study.</brief_summary>
