	<brief_summary>Retrospective interventional case series study reporting preoperative clinical and anatomical factors associated with visual recovery 1 year after combined cataract and idiopathic epiretinal membrane surgery. Age, duration of symptoms, and preoperative best corrected visual acuity appeared to be reliable prognostic factors. Combining these factors with analysis of the photoreceptors' inner and outer segments junction in spectral-domain optical coherence tomography provides a predictive score to estimate individual chances of good visual recovery</brief_summary>

	<criteria>symptomatic idiopathic epiretinal membrane operated on between April 2009 and September 2012 at the university hospital of Dijon, France. All patients signed informed consent for the surgical procedure. Patients were excluded if they presented any cause of secondary epiretinal membrane (including diabetic retinopathy, vein occlusion, ocular inflammation, retinal detachment, or previously vitrectomized eye), high myopia (axial length ≥ 26 mm or spherical equivalent ≥ 6 diopters), severe media opacities with weak SDOCT signal strengths, or any macular or optic nerve disease. Patients with a followup of less than 12 months were excluded and only one eye was included in those with bilateral epiretinal membranes.</criteria>
