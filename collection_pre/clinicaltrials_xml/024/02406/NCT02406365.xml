	<brief_summary>A handheld digital colposcope which utilizes flurorescent light is being tested for the rapid detection and management of cervical lesions. The handheld research device captures cervical images which with the fluorescent light show the regions of cervical tissue that autofluoresce. The investigators will study the relationship between the level of fluorescence and the samples of tissue (biopsies) obtained from the patient as part of her routine care. The investigators will also compare the efficacy of the hand held device with the data being collected from the other research devices being tested by the team, i.e. the multispectral digital colposcopes.</brief_summary>
