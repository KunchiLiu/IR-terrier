	<brief_title>Fibromyalgia Therapeutic Education in Thermal Cure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fibromyalgia is a poorly known and understood disease. Patients suffer from pain, fatigue, sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, preventing them from moving and going out, resulting in an alteration of social life. Multiple drugs treatment is frequently used but is burdensome and poorly effective. However, thermal cure proved efficacious to improve quality of life during the cure and beyond. This study aims at demonstrating the added value of a patient's therapeutic education program provided during a thermal cure, a moment where patients are available and receptive to guidance.</detailed_description>
