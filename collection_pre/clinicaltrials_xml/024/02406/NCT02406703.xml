	<brief_summary>Background and Objectives Short acting regional anesthetics have already been successfully employed for peripheral nerve blocks in an ambulatory surgery setting. However, the impact on direct and indirect perioperative costs comparing two different short-acting local anesthetics has not been performed, yet. Methods In an observational study including 50 patients per group, patient undergoing popliteal block with chloroprocaine 3% or mepivacaine 1.5% for ambulatory minor foot surgery were compared. The primary outcome was the saving of both direct and indirect perioperative costs. Secondary outcomes were block success, onset time and block duration, patient satisfaction and unplanned outpatient visits or readmissions after discharge.</brief_summary>
