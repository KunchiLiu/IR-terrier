	<brief_title>A Sub-study of PREDICT Neurodevelopment Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Normative data are mostly, if not exclusively, obtained from children in the Western world. Comparing data from Asian children to these norms may lead to the wrong interpretation of the results, as it does not account for cultural differences, translation issues and a possibly different education system. Therefore it is essential to include a matched control group to evaluate the participants of the study to the fullest extent in terms of cognition, memory, behavior and fine motor skills, in all age groups over the full course of the study.</detailed_description>
