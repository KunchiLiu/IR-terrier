	<brief_summary>The Primary Goal is to conduct a 5-10 week randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the Fitbit Flex, a popular, affordable, wearable physical activity tracking device, and the Fitbit mHealth app. The target population will be childhood cancer survivors 14-18 years old recruited from Seattle Children's Hospital. For the intervention group, peer influences will be engaged via a private, social network (e.g. a Facebook group) customized for survivors. Measurements will be completed (1) at baseline, prior to randomization, and (2) during the final week of the intervention period (follow-up measure). This study will provide initial proof of concept and allow for further customization of the intervention for childhood cancer survivors in anticipation of a future, larger proposal to study physical activity and related outcomes over a multi-year period.</brief_summary>
