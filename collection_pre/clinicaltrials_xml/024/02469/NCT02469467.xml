	<brief_title>A Dose Escalation Study of VS-505 in End Stage Renal Disease Patients Undergoing Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consists of 4 period; 1) screening period: up to 30 days, 2) first washout period: 2 weeks (remove existing phosphate binder effect), 3) treatment period: 8 weeks, and 4) second washout period: 2 weeks (remove VS-505 effect). VS-505 is orally administered with meal for 8 weeks. The starting dose of VS-505 is 1.50 g/day and the dose will be elevated step wise from 1.50 g to 2.25 g, 4.50 g and 6.75 g per day based on the safety assessment and plasma Pi level every 2 weeks during the treatment period.</detailed_description>
