	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators will be using an AUC of 6 based on creatinine clearance using the Carboplatin dosing formula used for Gynecologic Oncology Group protocols. Given that myelosuppression was significant using the docetaxel dose of 75 mg/m*2 in the SCOTROC trial, the prophylactic use of pegylated G-CSF in this Phase II trial is warranted. The expectation would be that patients will be able to receive their cycles in a more timely fashion, with less delays, thereby allowing for improved outcomes and decreased hospitalizations due to myelosuppression.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed newly diagnosed Stage III/IV epithelial ovarian or primary peritoneal carcinoma at time of initial diagnosis Treatment must start within 8 weeks of surgery Subjects may be measurable per RECIST criteria or evaluable for disease response by CA125. Evaluable CA 125 levels are defined as an elevated CA125 pre operatively which either remains elevated postoperatively or normalizes after surgery No prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy Age ≥ 18 Performance Status must be ≤ 2 (ECOG) Peripheral neuropathy: must be ≤ grade 1 Hematologic (minimal values) Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dl Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 Hepatic *Total Bilirubin ≤ ULN AST and ALT and Alkaline Phosphatase must be within the range allowing for eligibility. If alkaline phosphatase is ≤ ULN and AST or ALT is &gt;5x ULN then the patient is not eligible If alkaline phosphatase is &gt;1x but ≤2.5 x the ULN and the AST or ALT is &gt;1.5x the ULN then the patient is not eligible If alkaline phosphatase is &gt;2.5x but ≤5x the ULN and the AST or ALT is &gt;1x the ULN then the patient is not eligible If alkaline phosphatase is &gt;5x the ULN then the patient is not eligible Renal: Creatinine (serum) less than or equal to 1.5 ULN, CTC grade 1. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and must be willing to consent to using effective contraception while on treatment and for at least 3 months thereafter. PT/PTT ≤ 1.5 x's ULN Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to Docetaxel or other drugs formulated with polysorbate 80. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Patients who have signs of infection or who have not recovered from the effects of recent surgery Patients with a performance status of 3 or 4 Patients with a second malignancy within past 5 years other than nonmelanoma skin carcinoma. Patients who have received prior myelosuppressive chemotherapy or XRT.</criteria>
