	<detailed_description>1. Objectives -The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of ERT on LV diastolic function and flow in patients with Fabry's cardiomyopathy using diastolic stress echocardiography, LV vortex flow and CMR. 2. Primary / Secondary Endpoint 1) Primary endpoint - Changes of peak exercise E/E' by diastolic stress echocardiography (RECAP-F STRESS trial) and LV vortex flow parameters (RECAP-F FLOW trial) at 1 year follow up. 2) Secondary endpoint - Changes of extracellular volume by CMR(T1 mapping) at 1 year follow up (RECAP-F trial) ② Evaluation of the degree of the resting LV diastolic function ③ Other echo-parameters; LV mass index at baseline, 1 year follow up, reduction of peak exercise E/E prime at 1 year follow up - Changes of quality of life using questionnaire ⑤ Change of peak VO2, exercise time, AT by diastolic stress echocardiography at 1 year follow up ⑥ Change in T1 baseline(myo, ms) &amp; T1 baseline(blood, ms) T1 postcontrast(myo, ms) &amp; T1 baseline(blood, ms) by CMR 3. Study Methods 1) Study Design : 28 patients with newly diagnosed genetically confirmed Anderson-Fabry's disease will undergo diastolic stress echocardiography, LV vortex flow analysis, and cardiac MRI before enzyme replacement therapy(ERT) (baseline study) and after 1 year of treatment with agalsidese beta at the dose of 1mg/kg (follow-up study). 2) Study procedures : Examinations as described below will be done before ERT and 1 year later</detailed_description>
