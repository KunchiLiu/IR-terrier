	<brief_summary>The main objectives of this trial are to examine the effect of a low FODMAP diet on gut microbiota, inflammatory markers, gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life in patients with ulcerative colitis. Furthermore the trial will explore if the response towards a low FODMAP diet can be predicted by a patients initial gut microbiota profile. The patients will be randomized to an open parallel-group intervention of six weeks duration with intake of either a low FODMAP diet or a control diet (habitual diet).</brief_summary>
