	<brief_summary>Lower limb osteoarthritis is a major health problem in the westernized countries. The current gold standard treatment is joint replacement. However clinical guidelines recommend physical therapy as first option for these patients. Manual therapy has reported good reports in function, range of motion and pain in patients with hip osteoarthritis. The main aim of this study is to test the effects of a manual therapy protocol based on manual traction mobilization of the hip joint in an end range position and compare them with the effects achieve with the same protocol based on manual traction mobilization of the hip joint in a resting position. The investigators will use the caudal traction mobilization described by Kaltenborn. The study will test the effects of both treatments in passive range of motion, function and pain after three weeks of treatment, three weeks after finalizing the treatment and six weeks after.</brief_summary>
