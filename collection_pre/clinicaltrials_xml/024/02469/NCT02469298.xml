	<brief_summary>Study 201682 is a Phase IIa, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled four arm outpatient study evaluating the safety, tolerability and clinical effect of danirixin or danirixin + oseltamivir combination in comparison to placebo or oseltamivir twice daily for 5 days in otherwise healthy adults with laboratory confirmed influenza infection. Danirixin is a selective and reversible C-X-C Chemokine Receptor 2 (CXCR2) antagonist that inhibits neutrophil transmigration and activation to areas of inflammation. The study endpoints are intended to test the hypothesis that inhibition of neutrophil activation by approximately 50-60% (as previously measured by cluster of differentiation [CD11b] expression in response to chemokine [C-X-C motif] ligand 1 [CXCL1] stimulation ex vivo in human studies) will not impact safety parameters or worsen clinical manifestations of disease, disease-related events of interest, or viral load, and may possibly improve these parameters when administered within 48 hours of symptom onset. The aim of this exploratory study is to obtain data on the safety, tolerability and clinical effect of GSK1325756 (danirixin [DNX]) alone or in combination with oseltamivir (OSV) in otherwise healthy adults with acute, uncomplicated influenza prior to future evaluation in hospitalized patients with complicated influenza. The primary objective is to assess safety and tolerability of DNX with and without a neuraminidase inhibitor through the evaluation of AEs, SAEs, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters. Safety assessments will also include an assessment of disease related events (DREs) of interest and associated antibiotic use. The Influenza Intensity and Impact Questionnaire (FluiiQ™) will be used in the study to document patient reported outcomes (PROs). The screening visit in Australia will be composed of a pre-screen for influenza infection with an influenza rapid antigen test followed by a screen for the remaining eligibility criteria for those subjects with a positive result on the influenza rapid antigen test.

	<criteria>Between 18 and 64 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent; Onset of influenzalike illness symptoms within 48 hours prior to study enrollment. Onset of symptoms is defined as the time when the subject's temperature was measured as elevated (&gt;=38.0°C [&gt;=100.4°F]) OR the time when the subject first experienced at least one symptom (cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, headache, feeling feverish, body aches and pains, or fatigue); Subjects have an oral temperature &gt;=38.0°C (&gt;=100.4°F) at screening visit or history of feeling feverish within the 24 hours prior to screening visit; At least one respiratory symptom (cough, sore throat, nasal congestion) and at least one systemic symptom (headache, body aches and pain, fatigue) due to influenza infection; A positive influenza rapid antigen test; Body weight &gt;60 Kilogram (kg) for men and &gt;45 kg for women; and Body Mass Index (BMI) between 19 to 35 kilogram per meters squared (kg/m^2), inclusive; Male or Female subjects could be eligible if : Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must comply with the following contraception requirements from the time of first dose of study medication until at least 36 hours (five halflives) of study medication after the last dose of study medication: Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia; Male condom plus partner use of one of the following contraceptive options: Contraceptive subdermal implant; Intrauterine device or intrauterine system; Oral Contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone; Injectable progestogen; Contraceptive vaginal ring ; Percutaneous contraceptive patches; This is an allinclusive list of those methods that meet the following GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) definition of highly effective: having a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly and, when applicable, in accordance with the product label. For nonproduct methods (e.g., male sterility), the investigator determines what is consistent and correct use. The GSK definition is based on the definition provided by the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH). The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception; Female subject: is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative urine human chorionic gonadotrophin [hCG] test), not lactating, and at least one of the following conditions applies Nonreproductive potential defined as: Premenopausal females with one of the following: documented Tubal ligation; Documented Hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with followup confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion; Hysterectomy; Documented Bilateral oophorectomy; Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] and estradiol levels consistent with menopause). Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Reproductive potential agrees to follow one of the options listed below in the GSK Modified List of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of Reproductive Potential (FRP) requirements from the time of screening, during dosing, and until at least 36 hrs after the last dose of study medication and completion of the followup visit. GSK List of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of Reproductive Potential (FRP) meeting GSK criteria of highly effective: having a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly and, when applicable, in accordance with the product label. This list does not apply to FRP with same sex partners, when this is their preferred and usual lifestyle or for subjects who are and will continue to be abstinent from penilevaginal intercourse on a long term and persistent basis. Contraceptive subdermal implant; Intrauterine device or intrauterine system; Combined estrogen and progestogen oral contraceptive; Injectable progestogen; Contraceptive vaginal ring; Percutaneous contraceptive patches; Male partner sterilization with documentation of azoospermia prior to the female subject's entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that subject. These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently, correctly and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception.
