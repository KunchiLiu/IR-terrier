	<brief_title>Phase I - Pharmacokinetic Comparability Study in Healthy Male Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Double-blind, single-dose, three-treatment, parallel group design PK comparability study of MYL-1402O solution manufactured for Mylan compared to US and EU marketed Avastin® solution (bevacizumab) in a total of 111 healthy, adult male volunteers (37 subjects per treatment arm). After randomization, subjects will receive one of the following treatments: A single 1 mg/kg dose administered by i.v. infusion (25 mL over approximately 90 minutes) of MYL-1402O, an equivalent i.v. infusion of US marketed Avastin® (1 mg/kg), or an equivalent i.v. infusion of EU marketed Avastin® (1 mg/kg).</detailed_description>
