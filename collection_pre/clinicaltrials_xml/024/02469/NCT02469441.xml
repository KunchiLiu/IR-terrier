	<brief_title>Does Coffee Intake Reduce Postoperative Ileus After Elective Colorectal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative ileus after colorectal surgery is a frequent problem which significantly prolongs hospital stay and increases perioperative costs. Postoperative therapeutic interventions vary significantly between different hospitals due to missing evidence-based guidelines. Coffee is a safe, cheap and simple agent without significant side effects which can positively influence the bowel function. The aim of the investigators is to evaluate in an own study if coffee consumption has an influence on the duration of postoperative ileus. The present trial is designed to evaluate if postoperative coffee intake decreases the time until first bowel movement in colorectal surgery with primary anastomosis. This study would be the second study which evaluates the described questions under randomized conditions.</detailed_description>
