	<brief_summary>The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, preliminary and long-term effectiveness of utilizing the ReCell Autologous Cell Harvesting Device (ReCell) combined with widened split-thickness skin graft (STSG) mesh onto the dermal regenerate INTEGRA™ Meshed Bilayer Wound Matrix (MBWM) for healing of full-thickness wounds.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal of the study described herein is to determine the safety, tolerability, preliminary and long-term effectiveness of the use of the Recell device over a widened STSG mesh. It is hypothesized the ReCell cell suspension, in combination with INTEGRA™ MBWM, will improve upon the current standard of care. The potential for ReCell's promotion of healing in the interstices of the STSG mesh may close gaps that are potential points of failure during subsequent rehabilitation and return to physical activity. Within the current study, each participant will serve as his/her own control, allowing for comparison of ReCell treated (experimental) and non-ReCell treated (control) regions of the grafted wound. In the proposed study, each patient will serve as his/her own control. Due to the nature of the study, only patients whose wounds have been previously successfully treated with INTEGRA™ MBWM as part of their standard of care will qualify for participation. Therefore, as part of enrollment eligibility criteria for this study, the identified study wound will first be treated with INTEGRA™ MBWM. The wound will then be allowed to heal for approximately two to four weeks, at which time a viable granulation layer will have developed thus allowing for next stage STSG grafting. The timing of the STSG application will be determined by clinician judgment based on the state of the granulation process, which varies between patients, but typically takes 2 to 4 weeks. Approximately two to four weeks after INTEGRA™ MBWM treatment, the studied wound will be divided into a ReCell-treated area (over 1:5 meshed STSG) and a control area treated with 1:1.5 meshed STSG (no ReCell). In all cases, the ReCell region may be up to 320cm2 in size; the upper limit of application area for one ReCell kit, with a similarly sized control region. If the wound is larger than the combined ReCell and control regions (over 640cm2), the areas outside the study regions will be designated as non-study areas and treated according to standard of care. The same primary and secondary dressings will be used on ReCell-treated areas, control areas and donor sites. Once the study and control wounds are determined to have healed, standard local clinical practice will be followed. Within-subject comparisons of the ReCell region and control region, in order to evaluate improvements associated with use of ReCell, a battery of measurements and evaluations will be made. These measurements are divided into three categories: safety and tolerability, preliminary effectiveness (acute healing process) and long-term effectiveness. The safety of research participants is foremost. Therefore, efforts will be made to control risks to participants throughout the duration of their study participation. Wound healing time, donor site morbidity and histology will be assessed during an acute 6 week phase, with follow-up visits at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 post-treatment. Subjects will continue in the study for long-term follow-up with clinic visits at Week 12 and 24 post-treatment. Healing of treated wound sites (A region and B region) and donor sites (STSG 1:5, STSG 1:1.5 and ReCell) will be assessed at each visit. Treated wounds will be considered healed when 95% or greater of the study area has re-epithelialized by Week 6 post-treatment. Donor sites will be considered healed when ≥95% of the donor site has re-epithelialized by Week 4 post-treatment. Aesthetic and functional outcomes of the treated areas will be assessed and documented. Subject satisfaction will also be assessed and documented at these two time points.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>• The subject is a male or female military healthcare beneficiary of any race or ethnicity, aged 18 years or older, who is being treated for a traumatic wound at WRNMMC The subject has soft tissue loss resulting from a traumatic mechanism such as an explosive blast (i.e. motar, rocket, IED), highvelocity shells (i.e. missile), an avulsion injury, gunshot wound motor vehicle accident and/or burn secondary to blast The subject's fullthickness or deep partialthickness traumatic wound injury has been treated with INTEGRA™ MBWM as part of their standard of care The wound area is at least 200 cm2 All areas of the study wound area are covered with INTEGRA™ MBWM and has fully engrafted engrafting defined as the presence of a contiguous vascularized granulation layer indicated by the formation of a viable granulation layer (Note: there may be some areas of incomplete granulation at the INTEGRA™ MBWM application site, these areas will be excluded from the study wound area). The subject will comply with protocol requirements The subject will provide voluntary written informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization Subjects will not be eligible for study participation if they meet any of the following criteria: The subject is pregnant and/or lactating (selfreported) The subject has evidence of the following lab value results: 1. Hematocrit ≤ 20% 2. INR &gt; 1.8 second 3. Creatinine (serum) &gt; 2.0 mg/dL 4. Bilirubin Total (serum) within upper limit of normal (normal range 0.31.9 md/dL 5. Liver function test (AST/ALT) greater than 2 times upper limit of normal as defined by the clinical laboratory defined normal ranges 6. Albumin (serum) &lt; 2.0 g/dL 7. Platelets &lt; 70 K/µL The subject's targeted traumatic wound injury is a craniofacial wound The subject's targeted traumatic wound injury is on a weightbearing surface The subject's targeted traumatic wound is a fullthickness burn injury with visible eschar present (Note: Subjects with a traumatic wound of a burn nature secondary to an explosive blast injury resulting in significant soft tissue loss will NOT be excluded) The subject has active infection processes, that in the opinion of the investigator may compromise safety or study objectives The subject is known to have a preexisting condition that may interfere with wound healing, e.g. malignancy, diabetes or autoimmune disease, immunocompromised blood borne diseases, has AIDS, is HIV or HepatitisA positive, or currently has a severe dermatological disorder (e.g. severe psoriasis, epidermolysis bullosa, pyoderma gangrenosum) The subject has other concurrent conditions that in the opinion of the investigator may compromise safety or study objectives The subject has a known hypersensitivity to Trypsin and/or Compound Sodium Lactate for Irrigation (Hartmann's) solution The subject cannot be compliant with study procedures and that, in the investigator's opinion, would interfere with the study objectives</criteria>
