	<brief_summary>Incarcerated inguinal hernia is one of the common acute abdomen abdominal surgery, often prone to intestinal necrosis and acute peritonitis.Using traditional tension hernia reparation, the recurrence rate were as high as 30%. In recent years, biological materials especially acellular matrix materials (Acellular Dermal Matrix, ADM) in resisting the infection, has become a research hotspot. In the project, the investigators try to address the role of ADM in incarcerated inguinal hernia patients.</brief_summary>
