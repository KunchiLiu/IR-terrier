	<brief_summary>Autologous adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRC) will be extracted using Celution 800/CRS System (Cytori Therapeutics Inc) from a portion of the fat harvested from the patient's front abdominal wall. Patients will undergo knee arthroscopic surgery followed by one-time intraarticular ADRC administration (directly into anterior cruciate ligament). This is a single arm study with no control. All patients receive cell therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness and Safety of Autologous ADRC for Treatment of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Partial Rupture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with verified diagnosis partial rupture of anterior cruciate ligament will undergo liposuction from front abdominal wall under local anesthesia. After that autologous ADRC will be extracted using Celution 800/CRS System (Cytori Therapeutics Inc) from harvested adipose tissue. Same day patients will undergo knee arthroscopic surgery followed by one-time intraarticular freshly isolated ADRC administration (directly into anterior cruciate ligament close to the rupture).</detailed_description>
