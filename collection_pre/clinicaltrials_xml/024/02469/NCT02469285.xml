	<brief_summary>High consumption of red meat is related to cardiovascular diseases. Red meat containing more unsaturated fat than normal red meat may have a beneficial impact on plasma lipid and fatty acid profile in humans. Furthermore, consumption of red meat and especially processed red meat is considered harmful to colon health. However, consumption of fruit and berries rich in antioxidants and flavonoids may provide protection when red meat is consumed. The study aims to answer whether the fatty acid profile of pork when modified towards more unsaturated fat will affect plasma fatty acids and lipids in adult volunteers. The effects of pork with a modified fatty acid content is compared with conventional pork with lower unsaturated fat content. Fatty acid composition of pork is modified by altering the composition of animal feed. The other arm of the study investigates the effects of consuming berries together with red meat on gut metabolism. The study focuses on how berries affect the formation of fecal compounds known to be related to high red meat consumption, such as N-nitroso compounds.</brief_summary>
