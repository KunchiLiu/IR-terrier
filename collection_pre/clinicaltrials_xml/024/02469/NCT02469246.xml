	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of switching abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) to emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (F/TAF) versus maintaining ABC/3TC in HIV-1 infected adults who are virologically suppressed on regimens containing ABC/3TC.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key The ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form On antiretroviral regimen containing ABC/3TC FDC in combination with one third agent for ≥ 6 consecutive months prior to screening Plasma HIV1 RNA levels &lt; 50 copies/mL for ≥ 6 months preceding the screening visit (measured at least twice using the same assay) and without experiencing two consecutive HIV1 RNA above detectable levels after achieving a confirmed (two consecutive) HIV1 RNA below detectable levels on the current regimen in the past year Plasma HIV1 RNA should be &lt; 50 copies/mL at the screening visit Normal ECG Estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 50 mL/min according to the Cockcroft Gault formula for creatinine clearance Hepatic transaminases (AST and ALT) ≤ 5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL, or normal direct bilirubin Adequate hematologic function Serum amylase ≤ 5 × ULN Males and females of childbearing potential must agree to utilize highly effective contraception methods or be nonheterosexually active or practice sexual abstinence from screening throughout the duration of study treatment and for 30 days following the last dose of study drug Key A new AIDSdefining condition diagnosed within the 30 days prior to screening Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive Individuals experiencing decompensated cirrhosis Individuals receiving ongoing treatment with bisphosphonate to treat bone disease (eg, osteoporosis) Pregnant or lactating females Have an implanted defibrillator or pacemaker Current alcohol or substance use judged by the investigator to potentially interfere with study compliance A history of malignancy within the past 5 years (prior to screening) or ongoing malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), basal cell carcinoma, or resected, noninvasive cutaneous squamous carcinoma. Active, serious infections (other than HIV1 infection) requiring parenteral antibiotic or antifungal therapy within 30 days prior to Day 1 Visit Any other clinical condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the individual unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with dosing requirements Participation in any other clinical trial (including observational trials) without prior approval Medications excluded due to the potential for interaction with emtricitabine (FTC), TAF, ABC or 3TC Note: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
