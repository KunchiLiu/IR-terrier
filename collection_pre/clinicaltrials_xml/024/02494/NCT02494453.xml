	<brief_summary>Patients with breast cancer receive low doses to smaller volumes of the heart, but they also have an excellent long-term survival, so it is crucial to study the effects of low dose radiotherapy. Indeed, a recent study suggests that these effects can be seen within the first 5 years after treatment, and that there is no dose threshold. The investigators wish to develop imaging and blood biomarkers of cardiac exposure, as a first step to identifying patients at increased risk for cardiac effects. These patients can then be targeted for close monitoring and early intervention, potentially with statins or ACE inhibitors. Additionally, by characterizing a time-course and radiation dose-volume relationship, potentially real-time modifications can be made to radiotherapy (RT) field design for patients sensitive to RT effects. Finally, this information can be incorporated into better designs of treatment plans for future patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study of Biomarkers and Cardiac MRI as Early Indicators of Cardiac Exposure Following Breast Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiotherapy plays an integral role in breast cancer therapy. Multiple randomized studies have demonstrated decreased local-regional recurrence rates and decreased breast-cancer mortality. However, balanced with this survival benefit is the potential toxicity of the treatment itself. In particular, cardiac effects of radiotherapy have been a concern and an area of research for the past 20 years. From long-term follow up of patients with lymphoma, it is known that radiotherapy can lead to increased risk of myocardial infarction, valvular dysfunction, systolic and diastolic function abnormalities, and heart failure among cancer-survivors. Patients with breast cancer receive lower doses to smaller volumes of the heart, but they also have an excellent long-term survival, so it is crucial to study the effects of low dose radiotherapy. Indeed, a recent study suggests that these effects can be seen within the first 5 years after treatment, and that there is no dose threshold. The investigators hypothesize that they can develop imaging and blood biomarkers of cardiac exposure, as a first step to identifying patients at increased risk for cardiac effects. These patients can then be targeted for close monitoring and early intervention, potentially with statins or ACE inhibitors. Additionally, by characterizing a time-course and radiation dose-volume relationship, potentially real-time modifications can be made to RT field design for patients sensitive to RT effects. Finally, this information can be incorporated into better designs of treatment plans for future patients.</detailed_description>
