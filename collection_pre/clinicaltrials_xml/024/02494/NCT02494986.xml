	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to provide continued access to rilpivirine (RPV) for participants who were treated with RPV in a clinical development pediatric study with rilpivirine and who, at the time of roll-over, experience and are expected to continue experiencing clinical benefit from RPV treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Roll-over Study With Rilpivirine for Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) Infected Participants Who Participated in the Rilpivirine Pediatric Studies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multicenter (more than 1 hospital or medical school team work on a study), roll-over study to provide continued access to RPV for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected participants. All enrolled participants will continue to receive RPV in combination with an investigator-selected background regimen consisting of 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N[t]RTIs). Participants will continue to receive RPV in this study until they no longer benefit from RPV treatment, they meet at least 1 of the withdrawal criteria, or RPV is licensed for adult/pediatric use (depending on the age of the participant) and/or is available/accessible outside of a clinical study setting, whichever comes first.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants (or their legally acceptable representative) must sign an Informed Consent Form (ICF) indicating that they understand the purpose of and procedures required for the study and are willing to participate in the study. Assent is also required of children capable of understanding the nature of the study (typically 7 years of age and older) Participants must be human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV1) infected and must have previously been treated with rilpivirine (RPV) 25 mg qd (or weightadjusted dose) in a clinical development pediatric study and completed the protocol defined treatment period Participants must benefit from treatment with RPV, according to the efficacy and safety criteria as set out in the protocol of the pediatric study with RPV the participant was participating in prior to this rollover study, and must be expected to continue to benefit from this treatment in the opinion of the investigator Participants must be able and willing to comply with the current protocol requirements Participants general medical condition, in the opinion of the investigator, does not interfere with participation in this study Participants using disallowed concomitant treatment Pregnant participants Female participants of childbearing potential and nonvasectomized heterosexually active male participants not willing to continue practicing birth control methods during the study and for greater than or equal to (â‰¥)1 month after the end of the study (or after last intake of RPV) Participants who were withdrawn from a pediatric study with RPV that they were participating in prior to this rollover study, based on any of the mandatory withdrawal criteria</criteria>
