	<brief_summary>Early prognosis of cardiac arrest - nearly 40000 new cases per year in France - has been extensively studied, highlighting a poor outcome (less than 8% at hospital discharge). However, little is known on mid and long-term prognostic factors and how these patients do survive from the event. Using a regional cohort, the aim of the study is to describe long-term survival rate of cardiac arrest survivors, and to assess the influence of treatment strategies on survival and functional outcome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outcome of Cardiac Arrest Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The collection of clinical and biological data of patients who experienced cardiac arrest and survive from hospital, including a regular follow-up with qualitative data (functional, neurological and quality of life) may provide important benchmark on the evolution of these patients and on the impact of acute interventions (such as cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, defibrillation, emergent coronary revascularization, neuroprotective treatments). Using a large identified cohort of survivors of cardiac arrest, we aim to describe the qualitative long-term prognosis of these cardiac arrest patients (functional, neurological and quality of life status). Secondarily, we intend to identify the long-term prognostic factors, and particularly the role of early interventions, using a long-term and qualitative combined endpoint (vital status, functional scales, SF36). This project is observational and will include all patients over 18 admitted alive after non-traumatic cardiac arrest in the area of Ile-de-France (France), whatever the cause of the cardiac arrest. Patients or their proxies, refusing their participation, will not be included. We will collect all pre- and in-hospital information related to the event and performs prospectively interviews at 3 months and every year anniversary. The questionnaire will include vital status, cardiovascular events, medication and a complete qualitative report (SF36, ADL scale, OPC, CPC, social-professional activities). This project will provide important data over time on the evolution of these patients. Findings will help in measuring the role of different strategies on long-term prognosis and consequently improve the overall management of cardiac arrest.</detailed_description>
