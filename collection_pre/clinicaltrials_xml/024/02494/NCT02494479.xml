	<detailed_description>The total duration of study participation for an individual subject is approximately 112 days (16 weeks) consisting of a Screening visit, followed within 21 days by Randomization and a Treatment Period of 84 days, and a Follow-up Period of 28 days after the last day of study drug treatment. A window of ± 3 days will be considered acceptable for conduct of each scheduled visit following the first visit. This study will require eight (8) scheduled subject visits: x Visit 1: Screening (Up to Day 21) x Visit 2: Baseline (Day 0) x Visit 3: Day 14 Interim (± 3 days) x Visit 4: Day 28 Interim (± 3 days) x Visit 5: Day 42 Interim (± 3 days) x Visit 6: Day 56 Interim (± 3 days) x Visit 7: Day 84 End of Treatment/Unscheduled/ET (± 3 days) x Visit 8: Day 112 Follow-up (± 3 days)</detailed_description>

Use within 2 weeks of topical antipsoriasis drugs or topical corticosteroids or topical retinoids. Presence of a condition (e.g., history of frequent consumption of substantial quantities of alcohol, or an untreated psychiatric condition) that makes it unlikely that the requirements of the protocol will be completed.
