	<brief_summary>Thoracic traumas are frequent causes of emergency department admissions and the third most common cause of death from trauma. Although emergency management of major thoracic traumas that have high mortality and morbidity were discussed and well-understood in detail in the literature, there are limited information regarding diagnosis, emergency management, treatment and follow-up after discharge of patients with minor blunt thoracic traumas. The investigators aimed to investigate demographic data, physical examination findings, and the relationship between lung injury, emergency department final diagnosis, hospitalization, discharge and re-admission rates, effects of prescribed analgesics on pain and re-admissions of patients with a pre-diagnosis of minor blunt thoracic trauma on first admission.</brief_summary>
