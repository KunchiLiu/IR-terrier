	<brief_summary>Currently, no adjuvant study with hepatic arterial infusion in the adjuvant setting is opened. Recently, the results of a phase II study (NCT00268463, NSABP-C-09) assessing the potential benefit of systemic oxaliplatin and capecitabine alternating with HAI of FUDR, after resection of CRLM have been reported. The primary end point was 2-year survival. Fifty-five of 76 eligible patients were able to initiate protocol-directed therapy and completed median of six cycles (range, one to six). Three postoperative or treatment-related deaths were reported. Overall, 88% of evaluable patients were alive at 2 years. With a median followup of 4.8 years, a total of 30 patients have had disease recurrence, 11 involving the liver. Median disease-free survival was 32.7 months. In conclusion alternating HAI of FUDR and systemic capecitabine and oxaliplatin met the prespecified end point of higher than 85% survival at 2 years and were clinically tolerable.</brief_summary>

Negative pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential within 14 days prior to treatment initiation (premenopausal or less than 12 months of amenorrhea postmenopause, and who have not undergone surgical sterilization). Both men and women (of childbearing potential) who are sexually active must use adequate contraception, during and for at least 6 months posttreatment. 1. Extrahepatic metastatic disease (except ≤3 lung nodules (≤10 mm on chest CT scan) deemed amenable to curativeintent resection/ablation), 2. Symptomatic primary tumor requiring urgent surgery, asymptomatic primary colorectal tumor is not a noninclusion criteria if its 3. Contraindication to fluoropyrimidines or oxaliplatin, as mentioned in the SMPC of investigational medicinal products 4. Known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency 5. Disease progression during, or early hepatic relapse (&lt; 6 months) after the end of, oxaliplatinbased adjuvant chemotherapy following primary tumor resection 6. History of hepatic arterial infusion with any treatment (chemotherapy, radioembolisation), 7. Peripheral neuropathy&gt; grade 1, 8. History of cancer within 5 years prior to entry into the trial other than adequately treated basalcell skin cancer or in situ carcinoma of the cervix 9. Concomitant administration of cimetidine 10. Concomitant medications/comorbidities that may prevent the patient from receiving study treatments, 11. Patient already included in another clinical trial with an experimental molecule, 12. Pregnancy or lactation, 13. Patients deprived of liberty or under guardianship, 14. Patients unable to undergo medical monitoring test for geographical, social or psychological reasons. 15. Patients must not have any uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to, severe active or uncontrolled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable, angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements resection is planned (REVERSE strategy authorized)</criteria>
