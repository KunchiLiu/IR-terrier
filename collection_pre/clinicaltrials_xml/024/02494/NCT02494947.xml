	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to investigate if systematic, high intensity, interval-based aerobic exercise training results in regression of lipid content of atherosclerotic coronary artery plaques, and in reduction of plaque burden in patients with stable coronary heart disease. Composition and morphologic characteristics of plaques will be studied by intra-coronary near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.</brief_summary>
