	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome affects up to 5% of the general population. The prevalence is multiplied by 13 in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. Many studies have shown that OSA syndrome was the main risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (RR = 9.1 [95%, 2.6 to 31.2]). If the value of treatment with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) in symptomatic CAD patients (daytime sleepiness and/or 2 clinical symptoms with Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) â‰¥ 20) appears to be established, treatment with CPAP in asymptomatic CAD patients (with AHI&gt; 30) may be too demanding. Alternative treatments are rare and results are highly variable. Therefore, it would be interesting to suggest other treatment modalities with moderate coronary and/or minimally symptomatic OSA syndrome.</brief_summary>
