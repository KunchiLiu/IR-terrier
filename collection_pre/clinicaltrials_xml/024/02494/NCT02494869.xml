	<brief_summary>This study is being done to look at the effect that different amounts of progressive exercise training has on risk factors associated with developing breast cancer. These risk factors include exercise capacity, body weight, and body composition, as well as the expression of certain genes and levels of inflammatory factors in your breast tissue.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Women at highrisk of breast cancer as defined by one of the following: Cytologically confirmed atypical hyperplasia Cytologically confirmed LCIS BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutation carriers Predicted lifetime risk of breast cancer &gt;20% based on family history) Postmenopausal women, defined as: Age &gt; 45 with no menses for at least 2 years Age &lt; 80 years old Weight &lt;205 kilograms Must a negative mammogram or negative breast MRI within 1 year of protocol required baseline core biopsy o Patients positive for BRCA mutations must have a negative breast MRI within 1 year of protocolrequired baseline core biopsy Clinical breast exam interpreted as benign (not suspicious for cancer) at MSK Performing less than 75 minutes of structured moderateintensity or strenuousintensity exercise per week Able to complete an acceptable baseline CPET in the absence of high risk ECG findings or other inappropriate response to exercise as determined by the investigator. Able to achieve an acceptable peek baseline CPET defined as by any of the following criteria: achieving a plateau in oxygen consumption concurrent an with increase in power output; a respiratory exchange ratio ≥ 1.10; attainment of maximal predicted heart rate (HRmax) (i.e., within 10 bpm of agepredicted [HRmax = 220Age[years]) volitional exhaustion, as measured by a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) ≥ 18 on the BORG scale. Use of any selective estrogen receptor modulator or aromatase inhibitor within 6 months of randomization, including, but not limited to: (tamoxifen, raloxifene, arzoxifene, acolbifene, anastrozole, exemestane, and letrozole) Enrollment on an interventional investigational study Bilateral breast implants Any newly identified breast abnormality requiring surgical excision History of any of the following: Invasive cancer diagnosis DCIS Flat epithelial atypia Any current invasive cancer diagnosis Metastatic malignancy of any kind Any other condition or intercurrent illness that in the opinion of the investigator makes the subject a poor candidate for core biopsy or the trial Any of the following absolute contraindications to cardiopulmonary exercise testing and/or aerobic training: Acute myocardial Infarction (within 35 days of any planned study procedures); Unstable angina; Uncontrolled arrhythmia causing symptoms or hemodynamic compromise; Recurrent syncope; Active endocarditis; Acute myocarditis or pericarditis; Symptomatic severe aortic stenosis; Uncontrolled heart failure; Acute pulmonary embolus or pulmonary infarction within 3 months of any planned study procedures; Thrombosis of lower extremities; Suspected dissecting aneurysm; Uncontrolled asthma; Pulmonary edema; Room air desaturation at rest ≤85%; Respiratory failure; Acute noncardiopulmonary disorders that may affect exercise performance or be aggravated by exercise (i.e. infection, renal failure, thyrotoxicosis); or Mental impairment leading to inability to cooperate.</criteria>
