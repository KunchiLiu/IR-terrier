	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of the combination of rhuMab 2C4(Perjeta) and capecitabine (Xeloda) in participants with advanced solid tumors that have progressed during or after standard therapy, or for which no standard therapy is available. Participants will be enrolled and evaluated for dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in escalating-dose cohorts in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).</brief_summary>
