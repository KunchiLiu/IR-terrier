	<brief_summary>All parents in Sweden are offered group based parental support within Child Health Service (CHS) but only 40% participate. Nurses feel insecure in their group leadership and express a need for education in group leadership and group dynamics. Most CHC nurses do not have formal education or training in group leadership and the aim of this study was to evaluate a group based education program in group leadership for Child Health Care (CHC) nurses.</brief_summary>
