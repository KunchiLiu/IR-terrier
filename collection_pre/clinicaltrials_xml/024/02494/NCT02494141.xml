	<brief_summary>The proposed research will determine the effectiveness of curcumin for improving the health and function of arteries in children and young adults with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The study also will provide insight into how curcumin improves artery health by determining the physiological mechanisms (biological reasons) involved and offer exploratory evidence if curcumin can slow kidney growth. This will be done by comparing these measurements in children and young adults who are randomized to receive either curcumin or placebo for 1 year.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Curcumin Therapy to Treat Vascular Dysfunction in Children and Young Adults With ADPKD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although often considered to be a disease of adults, complications of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) begin in childhood. While ADPKD causes the continued growth of multiple kidney cysts that ultimately result in loss of kidney function, the leading cause of death among patients with ADPKD is cardiovascular disease. Treatment options to prevent cardiovascular disease in adults with ADPKD are limited, thus childhood may be an important time to reduce risk. Curcumin is a safe, naturally occurring substance found in the Indian spice tumeric, which is in curry powder. The proposed research will determine the effectiveness of curcumin for improving the health and function of arteries in children and young adults with ADPKD. The study also will provide insight into how curcumin improves artery health by determining the physiological mechanisms (biological reasons) involved and offer exploratory evidence if curcumin can slow kidney growth. This will be done by comparing these measurements in children and young adults who are randomized to receive either curcumin or placebo for 1 year.</detailed_description>
