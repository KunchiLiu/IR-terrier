	<brief_title>Using Bite Counter for Weight Loss: A One-month Usability Trial to Test the Effectiveness of Using the Bite Counter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will last approximately 1 month (about 4 weeks). Participants will need to attend one 1.5-hour orientation meeting, baseline assessment, and training meeting, and then weekly 1-hour meetings for four weeks (5 meetings total). Participants will listen to 2 podcasts per week and will be encouraged to monitor exercise and body weight and track each meal using the provided wearable, wrist worn device. Each of the podcasts will take about 15 - 20 minutes to listen to and so participants should expect to spend 30 - 40 minutes each week listening to podcasts and up to 3 hours completing other study-related activities each week—including attending the weekly meetings—for a total of about 4 hours per week.</detailed_description>
