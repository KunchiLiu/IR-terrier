	<brief_summary>This is a study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) as first-line treatment for participants with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the 3 treatment arms of the study: pembrolizumab as monotherapy, or pembrolizumab + cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or capecitabine, or placebo + cisplatin + 5-FU or capecitabine. The primary hypothesis is that pembrolizumab provides a clinically meaningful progression free and/or overall survival.</brief_summary>
