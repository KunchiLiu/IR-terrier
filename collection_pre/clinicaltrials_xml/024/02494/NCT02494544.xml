	<brief_summary>Patients will be randomized to either ConforMIS iTotal Knee Replacement or Off the Shelf knee replacement. The patient will conduct functional testing and answer questionnaires. The results will compare the ConforMIS iTotal with an Off the Shelf Knee replacement.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multicenter Study to Evaluate the ConforMIS iTotal® (CR) Knee Replacement System Versus Off-the-Shelf Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be randomized to one of two study arms in a 1:1 ratio and be implanted with either an iTotal CR or an off-the-shelf cruciate retaining total knee. Sites will perform the off-the-shelf total knees with patient specific instrumentation (PSI) or conventional instrumentation. At those sites that do not use PSI, a mock CT will be performed on all subjects pre-operatively. The mock CT will ensure that subjects will remain blinded to their randomization arm. Mock CT will involve the usual CT protocol being performed by a trained radiologist or technician; however, no radiation will be delivered. Mock CT will be performed primarily by sites outside the US, where PSI is less frequently utilized.</detailed_description>
