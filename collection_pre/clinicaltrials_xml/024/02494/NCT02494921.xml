	<brief_summary>This is a Phase Ib/II open label clinical trial in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. The objective of the phase Ib portion of the study is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of docetaxel (75 mg/m2 IV q21 days) and prednisone (5mg orally BID) in combination with ribociclib in escalating oral daily doses in patients with metastatic CRPC with prior resistance to abiraterone and/or enzalutamide who have not undergone prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Up to three cohorts will be enrolled to determine the MTD and DLT profile of this combination during Phase 1b. Dose escalation will follow the standard 3+3 design. The dosing schedule is being chosen to allow patients to be exposed to the most efficacious dosing schedule of docetaxel (75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks). If there is excess toxicity observed with the treatment combination at the first dose level (dose level I), an alternative dosing schema may be pursued with weekly docetaxel treatment (35 mg/m2 weekly), which has demonstrated activity in mCRPC and decreased risk of cytopenias compared with every 3 week dosing schedule. The Phase II portion (N = 29) of the study is a single arm, two stage, open-label study of ribociclib (dosed at the RP2D) in combination with docetaxel and prednisone to determine the efficacy and further define the safety of the treatment combination. Patients will be treated with the combination of ribociclib plus docetaxel + prednisone for up to 9 cycles. If there is no evidence of radiographic or clinical disease progression after 9 cycles of protocol therapy, patients may continue on single agent maintenance ribociclib until the time of disease progression. Patients will have the option of starting maintenance ribociclib after 6 cycles of docetaxel if stable disease or better on re-staging scans. The dose of ribociclib used during maintenance will be the same dose as that immediately preceding cessation of docetaxel treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed prostate cancer. Small cell/neuroendocrine differentiated allowed but not required for study participation. Progressive metastatic prostate cancer (as defined below in Item #5) despite castrate levels of testosterone (&lt; 50 ng/dL). Metastatic lesion amenable to biopsy in the judgment of Study Investigator and Interventional Radiology (Phase 2 only) Patients may have either nonmeasurable disease OR measurable disease Progressive disease during (or within 4 weeks of completion) with abiraterone, enzalutamide, and/or ARN509 based on any one of the following: For patients with measurable disease, progression by the RECIST criteria.13 PSA evidence for progressive prostate cancer consists of a PSA level of at least 2 ng/ml which has risen on at least 2 successive occasions, at least one week apart. If the confirmatory PSA (#3) value is less (i.e., #3b) than the screening PSA (#2) value, then an additional test for rising PSA (#4) will be required to document progression for the purposes of eligibility. Radionuclide bone scan: At least two new foci consistent with metastatic lesions Testosterone &lt; 50 ng/dL. Patients must continue primary androgen deprivation with an LHRH analogue if they have not undergone orchiectomy. Patients treated with first generation antiandrogen as most recent systemic therapy (bicalutamide, nilutamide) must have at least 4 weeks elapsed from treatment discontinuation to start of protocol therapy with evidence of disease progression by PCWG2 criteria following discontinuation of prior antiandrogen. ECOG Performance Status 0 or 1. Patient has adequate bone marrow and organ function as defined by the following laboratory values: Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 × 109/L. Platelets ≥ 100 × 109/L. Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dl. Potassium, total calcium (corrected for serum albumin), magnesium, sodium and phosphorus within normal limits for the institution or corrected to within normal limits before first dose of study medication. INR ≤ 1.5 unless on direct thrombin inhibitor at time of study entry. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5mg/dL or estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min In the absence of liver metastases, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt;2.5 x ULN. If the patient has liver metastases, ALT and AST &lt;5 x ULN Total bilirubin &lt; ULN; or total bilirubin ≤3.0 x ULN or direct bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN in patients with welldocumented Gilbert's Syndrome.

Sexually active males must use a condom during intercourse while taking the drug and for 30 days after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid. Fertile males must use a condom with spermicide (double barrier method).
