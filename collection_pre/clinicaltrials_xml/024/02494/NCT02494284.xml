	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare short-term (6-month Dual Anti Platelet Therapy(DAPT) followed by clopidogrel monotherapy) vs. standard long-term dual antiplatelet strategies (24-month DAPT followed by aspirin monotherapy) on clinically relevant bleeding complications (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium(BARC) type 2, 3, or 5)31 in patients after zotarolimus-eluting stent implantation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Men or women at least 19 years of age Patients with stable coronary artery disease who were successfully treated with zotarolimuseluting stents Patients without major bleeding or MACE (myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, stoke, repeat revascularization) within 6 months after zotarolimuseluting stent placement The patient or guardian agrees to the study protocol and the schedule of clinical followup, and provides informed, written consent, as approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board/Ethical Committee of the respective clinical site. Persistent thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;100,000/Âµl) A known intolerance to a study drug (aspirin, clopidogrel) Patients requiring longterm oral anticoagulants or cilostazol Patients presented with acute myocardial infarction (STEMI or NSTEMI) at the time of index procedure Planned cardiac surgery (e.g., CABG, valve repair or replacement, or aneurysmectomy) or planned major noncardiac surgery within 18 months after procedure Baremetal stent implantation at the time of index procedure Chronic disease requiring treatment with oral, intravenous, or intraarticular corticosteroids (use of topical, inhaled, or nasal corticosteroids is permissible). A diagnosis of cancer in the past 2 years or current treatment for the active cancer. Any clinically significant abnormality identified at the screening visit, physical examination, laboratory tests, or electrocardiogram which, in the judgment of the Investigator, would preclude safe completion of the study. Hepatic disease or biliary tract obstruction, or significant hepatic enzyme elevation (ALT or AST &gt; 3 times upper limit of normal). History of adult asthma manifested by bronchospasm in the past 6 months, or currently taking regular antiasthmatic medication(s).
