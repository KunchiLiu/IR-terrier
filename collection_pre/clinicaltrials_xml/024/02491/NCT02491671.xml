	<brief_summary>The effectiveness of tissue sealants to prevent Prolonged Air Leak (PAL) after lung resection procedures remains unproved. The investigators hypothesize that one of the main reasons for that is the heterogeneity of previously studied populations. Since currently the risk of postoperative PAL can be scored with a reasonable accuracy, the aim of this research is to investigate the effect of routine application of a novel tissue sealant in patients selected on the basis of a high risk of PAL estimated before surgery.</brief_summary>
