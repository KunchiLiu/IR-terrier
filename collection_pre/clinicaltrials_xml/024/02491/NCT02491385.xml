	<brief_title>Thoracic Epidural for Postoperative Ileus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative ileus (POI) is a prolonged inhibition of coordinated bowel activity after surgery. Half of patients undergoing major abdominal surgery experience POI making it one of the limiting factors for early recovery. The pathogenesis of POI is multifactorial, and includes neurogenic, inflammatory and pharmacological mechanisms. Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) can induce sympathetic block, attenuate inflammatory reaction and limit use of systemic opioids. In addition, sympatholysis induced by TEA can improve microcirculation of bowels and parasympathetic activation can increase gastrointestinal motility. However, studies comparing TEA and iv-PCA on POI are rare in major upper abdominal surgeries. This study, therefore, compares TEA and iv-PCA in terms of bowel function recovery as a primary endpoint in major upper abdominal surgeries. Secondary endpoints are side effects and hospital stay.</detailed_description>
