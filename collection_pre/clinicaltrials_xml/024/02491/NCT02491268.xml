	<brief_summary>Epidemiological, clinicopathological and animal studies show that vascular disease in various forms contributes to cognitive decline. Increasing age is the strongest risk for dementia irrespective of whether it results from a vascular etiology or neurodegenerative disease processes such as in Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD and vascular cognitive impairment, the two most common causes of dementia, represent two extremes of a spectrum of disorders; however, a number of entities, which possess varying degrees of neurodegenerative and vascular pathologies, occur in between. The pure forms of the disorders are preferred for convenience to label, treat or manage but conditions within the spectrum are the norm rather than the exception as dementia advances. Therefore, combinatorial therapy directed at both vascular and neurodegenerative aspects of dementia is a promising approach for the treatment of dementia in the elderly. Cilostazol acts as an antiplatelet agent and has other pleiotropic effects based on phosphodiesterase-3-dependent mechanisms. Increasing evidence suggests that cilostazol offers endothelial protection, via pleiotropic effects. Intriguingly, cilostazol has been shown to decrease amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation and protect Abeta-induced cognitive deficits in an experimental model. In a pilot study of 10 patients with moderate AD (mean MMSE score, 11.9 points) who received donepezil, cilostazol add-on treatment for 5-6 months demonstrated significantly increased MMSE score in comparison to baseline. Moreover, cilostazol was shown to be effective in preventing cognitive decline in patients with AD with cerebrovascular diseases, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and mild dementia who received donepezil. These results highlight the need for a comprehensive prospective cohort study to analyze the effect of cilostazol on the preservation of cognitive function in patients with early-stage cognitive impairment, namely MCI.</brief_summary>
