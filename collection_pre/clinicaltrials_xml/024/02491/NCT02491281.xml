	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ascending single doses of LNA043 given intra-articularly into the human knee joint prior to its removal at total knee replacement surgery. In addition, this will help to establish the presence of LNA043 within the articular cartilage, assess pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity, and will allow exploration of biomarkers of hyaline cartilage repair.</brief_summary>
