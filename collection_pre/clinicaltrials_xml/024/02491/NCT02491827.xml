	<brief_summary>Purpose of the study is to answer the question whether confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE, also named 'optical biopsy') might improve the results of medically necessary neurosurgery to prove practicability, safety and harmlessness of CLE during neurosurgical procedures</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy (CLE) During Medically Induced Neurosurgery in Craniobasal and Glioma Tumours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patients requiring neurosurgical oncological Intervention using endoscopic devices, a mini laser probe will be administered through the endoscopic device to characterize in vivo the tissue by thousandfold magnification down to the cellular level (so-called optical biopsy). Magnification is presented to the neurosurgeon in time to better differentiate between healthy and pathological tissue. Post-surgery results of in-vivo Differentiation will then be compared to histocytopathological findings.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>patients administered to the department of neurosurgery requiring neurosurgery due to either diagnosed gliomata (40 patients) or diagnosed subcranial tumors adjacent to or already invading neuronal structures (20 patients) patients having given informed consent severe concomitant diseases probably negatively influencing the participation in this clinical trial cardial infarction or stroke within the preceding 12 months Treatment resistant hypertonus (systolic blood pressure &gt;200 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;120 mmHg or a combination of both Pulmonic diseases that might result in an advanced risk for anesthetic measurements Patients being vaccinated with live vaccines (14 days Prior) or contra Influenza (7 days Prior) to start of the study All concomitant findings that might increase in the eyes of the investigator the risk of participation</criteria>
