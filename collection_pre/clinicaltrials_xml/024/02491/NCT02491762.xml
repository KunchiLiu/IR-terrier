	<brief_title>The Effect of Breast Reconstruction Surgery Using Tissue Expanders on Respiratory Functions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast reconstruction surgery using tissue expander and implant technique is the most common breast reconstruction surgery. During this procedure, the surgeon will insert a silicone expander under the Pectoralis Major muscle. In order to fully cover the expander, the surgeon will detach the Serratus Anterior [SA] muscle from its natural attachments in the rib cage and will attach the free edges to the lateral edge of the Pectoralis Major muscle. After the wound is healed, a gradual inflation of the expander with a physiological fluid will be done by injecting the fluid into a subcutaneous filling port connected to the expander by silicone tubing. When the tissues around the expander will reach the required size, the tissue expander can be replaced by a permanent silicone implant. The SA attachments are to the superior angle, medial border and inferior angle of the scapula and to the first to eighth ribs. Its main functions are stabilization and protraction of the scapula and turning the glenoid cavity superiorly in abduction of arms. In addition, the SA is an accessory respiratory muscle: when the scapula is stabilized, its contraction will lift the rib cage in order to help breathing. The importance of the SA in breathing has been examined since the late 19th century and until this day it is not fully agreed upon. Most studies agree that the SA major role in breathing is in deep breaths and is that the muscle is most effective for this purpose when arms are lifted. Since breast reconstruction procedure includes detachment of the SA from the rib cage and there by canceling its respiratory function, an examination of the respiratory functions before and after the procedure is in order to determine whether or not the overall respiratory functions had been effected. 45 patients elected for unilateral or bilateral breast reconstruction surgery will go through respiratory function examinations a month prior to the surgery, one month after surgery and three months after surgery. The examinations will include the following tests: Spirometry: FVC, FEV1, MVV. Lung capacities: FRC, RV, TLC. Breathing muscle strength: MIP, MEP.</detailed_description>
