	<brief_summary>A study to investigate if inhaled Interferon beta-1a is safe and tolerated, and can prevent or reduce the severity of asthma attacks when administered to asthma patients at the onset of symptoms of common cold or influenza</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study in Asthma Patients to Evaluate Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of 14 Days Once Daily Inhaled Interferon Beta-1a After the Onset of Symptoms of an Upper Respiratory Tract Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will consist of a Pre-Treatment Phase followed by a Treatment Phase. Patients are screened and enter the Pre-Treatment phase where they remain until they develop symptoms of a common cold or the flu. During this Pre-Treatment Phase patients will be asked daily if they think they have a common cold or the flu. When the patient answers yes to the question that he/she is coming down with a common cold or the flu, arrangements are made to evaluate the patient at the study site and, if eligible, enters the Treatment Phase. Baseline assessments are performed and the patient is randomized 1:1 to receive 24 μg (metered dose) inhaled Interferon beta-1a or placebo once daily for 14 days (delivered by the I-neb® device [Philips Respironics]). Treatment should start as soon as possible but no later than 48 hours after the onset of the first of the common cold or flu symptoms. Patients will be assessed with regards to exacerbations and changes in respiratory symptoms and reliever medication use at home using an ePRO device. Lung function will be measured both at home by the patients and at the study site. There will be five clinical visits during the Treatment Phase and two visits after the end of treatment; efficacy and safety will be monitored until 2-3 weeks after end of treatment when a final follow-up visit will take place. The study population will comprise adult asthmatic patients on a maintenance treatment of medium to high dose inhaled corticosteroids and a second controller medication (eg, long- acting β2 agonist), with a documented history of at least two severe exacerbations within the last 24 months, of which at least one has occurred during the last 12 months, and it is suspected by the patient that these aforementioned exacerbations were triggered by an upper respiratory tract infection (ie, related to symptoms of a common cold or the flu).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For inclusion in the study patients should fulfil the following criteria: 1. Provision of signed and dated written informed consent prior to any study specific procedures 2. Male or female aged 18 and above at the time of enrolment 3. History of physiciandiagnosed asthma requiring treatment with mediumtohigh dose ICS (&gt;250 μg fluticasone dry powder formulation equivalents total daily dose, as defined in GINA 2014, see CSP Appendix G), and a second controller medication as recommended in the GINA guidelines (ie, LABA, leukotriene receptor antagonist or sustained release theophylline). The medium or high dose ICS plus LABA can be any combination inhaler or 2 separate inhalers. Patients must have taken ICS (&gt;250 μg fluticasone or the equivalent daily) plus second controller medication for at least 12 months prior to the date the informed consent is obtained, with or without another controller such as oral corticosteroids (OCS), theophylline, tiotropium, or leukotriene receptor antagonists. The maintenance treatment must have been kept at the same or at a higher level these last 12 months. 4. Proof of postbronchodilator reversibility in FEV1 of ≥12% and ≥200 mL (Pellegrino et al 2005) documented within 5 years prior to Visit 1, or proof of a positive response to a methacholine or histamine challenge (a decrease in FEV1 by 20% [PC20] at ≤8 mg/mL) performed according to ATS/ERS guidelines (American Thoracic Society 2000) or proof of positive response to mannitol challenge (a decrease in FEV1 by 15% [PD15] at ≤635 mg) (Anderson et al 2009) documented within 5 years prior to Visit 1. If historical documentation is not available, reversibility or proof of a positive response to a methacholine, histamine or mannitol challenge must be demonstrated and documented at Visit 1 5. Must answer "Yes" to the question "Does a cold or flu make your asthma worse?" 6. To have had at least two documented severe asthma exacerbations within the last 24 months that were suspected by the patient to have been caused by a common cold or flu and To have had at least one documented severe asthma exacerbation within the last 12 months that was suspected by the patient to have been caused by a common cold or flu 7. Female patients must be 1 year postmenopausal, surgically sterile, or using an acceptable method of contraception. 8. Negative pregnancy test (urine) for female patients of childbearing potential 9. Motivation (in the Investigator's opinion) to complete all study visits, the ability to communicate well with the Investigator and be capable of understanding the nature of the research and its treatment including its risks and benefits 10. Ability to read and write and use the electronic devices, including demonstrating an acceptable technique when using the ePRO device, home spirometer and the Ineb Patients should not enter the study if any of the following exclusion criteria are fulfilled: 1. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca staff and staff at third party vendors or staff at the study sites) 2. Previous randomization to treatment in the present study 3. Any condition, including findings in the medical history or in the prestudy assessments that, in the opinion of the Investigator, constitutes a risk or a contraindication for the participation of the patient in the study or that could interfere with the study objectives, conduct or evaluation 4. Lung disease other than asthma (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, active tuberculosis). Patients with CT or chest Xray findings indicating bronchiectasis which in the opinion of the Investigator are not clinically significant may be enrolled at the discretion of the Investigator 5.
