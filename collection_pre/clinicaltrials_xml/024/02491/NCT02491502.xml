	<brief_title>Treatment of Benign Thyroid Nodules With FastScan HIFU</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Echopulse is specially designed, manufactured and CE marked for treating benign thyroid nodules. HIFU is a completely alternative to surgery which utilizes high-energy ultrasound to deliver a large amount of sound energy to a focal point to rapidly induce tissue heating to 85-90°C.This initiates tissue coagulation followed by tissue necrosis ablating the targeted area. In a previous european feasibility study performed at 1 site (Bulgaria), 20 benign thyroid nodules were treated. The HIFU treatment was well tolerated and showed efficacy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female patient 18 years or older. Patient presenting with at least one thyroid nodule with no signs of malignancy: 1. Non suspect clinically and at ultrasonography imaging 2. Benign cytological diagnosis at FNAB (fineneedle aspiration biopsy) from the last 6 months 3. Normal serum calcitonin 4. No history of neck irradiation Normal TSH (thyroidstimulating hormone) Targeted nodule accessible and eligible to HIFU Absence of abnormal vocal cord mobility at laryngoscopy Nodule diameter ≥ 10mm measured by ultrasound Composition of the targeted nodule(s) : predominantly solid Patient has signed a written informed consent. Head and/or neck disease that prevents hyperextension of neck Known history of thyroid cancer or other neoplasias in the neck region History of neck irradiation Macrocalcification inducing a shadow in the thyroid significant enough to preclude the HIFU treatment Posterior position of the nodule if the thickness of the nodule is &lt;15mm Pregnant or lactating woman Any contraindication to the assigned analgesia/anaesthesia.</criteria>
