	<brief_title>The Effect of Dairy and Non-dairy Alternatives on Satiety and Post-meal Glycemia in Healthy Young Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regular consumption of dairy is associated with better body composition and lower incidences of type 2 diabetes and obesity. This may be due to dairy's ability to increase satiety and decrease post-prandial glycemia. However, most clinical studies have only investigated isolated dairy proteins (whey and casein) and the effects of whole dairy products remains unclear. Additionally, as non-dairy alternatives are becoming more popular there is interest to see if they can elicit similar benefits as dairy. Therefore, this study will test the effects of commercially-available dairy and non-dairy beverages when consumed with cereal at breakfast time. Thirty healthy young males and females (20-30 years, BMI 20.0-24.9 kg/m2) will be recruited for the randomized, unblinded, crossover study. Participants will fast overnight, and at baseline will consume 250 mL of 1% milk, soy beverage, almond beverage, yogurt beverage, or water with 54 g of Cheerios cereal. At 0 (baseline), 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120 minutes (pre-meal period) 140, and 170 minutes (post-meal period) blood will be collected for glucose analysis and subjective appetite ratings completed. Insulin will be analyzed every 30 minutes and for the last two timepoints. Between 120-140 minutes, an ad libitum lunch will be provided to assess food intake.</detailed_description>
