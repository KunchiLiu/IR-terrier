History of any neurological disorders or seizures History of transient thrombocytopenia or neurological complications following any prior vaccination Hypersensitivity to latex Hypersensitivity to Bexsero's active substances or to any of its excipients Allergic reaction to kanamycin Any medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator would make intramuscular injection unsafe Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests Malignancy within previous 5 years or lymphoproliferative disorders Any clinically significant or any ≥ Grade 2 haematological laboratory abnormality Body mass index &gt; 40 kg/m2 Current alcohol and/or drug abuse Pregnant or lactating female Any other condition that the investigator judges may interfere with study procedures or findings Planned move to a location that will prohibit participating in the trial until study end</criteria>
