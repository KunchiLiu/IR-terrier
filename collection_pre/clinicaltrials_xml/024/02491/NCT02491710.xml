	<brief_summary>Training is of great importance in laparoscopy. There are different commercially available trainers which are quite expensive and are used by trainees only inside the hospital. The aim of this study is to find out whether basic laparoscopic skills training using an inexpensive tablet-based laparoscopic box trainer leads to equal training results (= improvement of skills) compared to practicing with a conventional commercial box trainer. Furthermore, trainee satisfaction with this home-made alternative compared to the standard trainer will be assessed.</brief_summary>
