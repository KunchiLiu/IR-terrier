	<brief_title>Correlation Between Dental Inclination and Bone Thickness in Patients With Class III Dentofacial Deformities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Class III dentofacial deformity is associated with important functional, psychological and aesthetic changes and thus individuals affected by this type of deformity are motivated in seeking treatment. The sample will consist of three-dimensional images of 40 individuals with Class III dentofacial deformities. From these images generated by CBCT scans, the buccolingual inclinations of all teeth and maxillo-mandibular alveolar bone thickness in three different heights will be measured (3, 6 and 8 mm) from the cementoenamel junction through the Dolphin 3DÂ® program. The 3D scans of the sample will be evaluated in two stages: the initial stage and after dental decompensation at the end of pre-surgical orthodontic phase. Pearson correlation test will be used to verify the relationship between tooth inclination and bone thickness. The thickness measurements and buccolingual inclination will be compared between treatment times (initial and pre-surgical) using paired Student t-test.</detailed_description>
