	<brief_title>Quantitative Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test in Symptomatic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consecutive patients referred from primary care for colonoscopy due to symptoms are eligible. Patients will receive written information of the study together with the time for colonoscopy. A specific research nurse will call them and for those accepting participation, history and current medication will be collected. Kits will be sent to patients and they will provide three faecal samples before examination. These will be analysed at one certified laboratory. Hemoglobin concentration will be notified in the range of 50 - &lt; 1000 ng/mL, or as a negative outcome. Macroscopic findings at the colonoscopy will be collected, as well as the outcome of the pathological report.</detailed_description>
