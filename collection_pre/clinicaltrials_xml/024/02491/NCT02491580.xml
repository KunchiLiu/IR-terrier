	<brief_summary>Patients with previous malignancies have increasingly been accepted for renal transplantation. However, post-transplant malignancy risk and survival rates of these patients are unknown. Our aim was to assess if previous malignancies pose an unnecessarily high risk of post-transplant malignant tumours and if the organs as a resource are too limited for investment in this patient group.</brief_summary>
