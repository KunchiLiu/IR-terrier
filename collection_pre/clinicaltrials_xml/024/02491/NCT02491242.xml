	<brief_title>Dolutegravir-based Dual Therapies in HIV-infected Patients With Virological Suppression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite the high rate of virological suppression and low risk of toxicity, HIV-infected patients continue to need new antiretroviral strategies, such as dual therapies, because of different end-organ involvement (kidney, bone, cardiovascular..), intolerance or toxicity. To date, only a protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen was able to permit the use of dual therapies (two antiretrovirals), especially in case of patients with history of virological failure to other regimens. However, the recent license of Dolutegravir, a integrase inhibitor with high genetic barrier, could help to clinicians to manage patients with intolerance or toxicity to nucleoside analogues without putting in risk virological suppression.</detailed_description>
