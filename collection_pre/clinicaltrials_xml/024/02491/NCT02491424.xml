	<brief_summary>Direct Skeletal Fixation of Prosthetic Limbs Following Trans-Femoral Amputation - Study of an Intraosseous Transcutaneous Amputation Prosthesis (ITAPTM).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraosseous Transcutaneous Amputation Prosthesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The core ITAP™ design comprises of three discrete sections, the proximal section, which is the intramedullary stem secured into the medullary canal, the soft tissue integration flange and the transcutaneous component that passes through the skin. The device has been designed to be surgically implanted in a one stage procedure. In greater detail: Intra-medullary stem - this component is designed to match the natural shape of the canal and is designed using the same principles established and used for the fixation of massive endo-prosthetic replacements. In certain cases a hydroxyapatite ceramic (CaPO4) coating is used, providing enhanced uncemented fixation. In other cases, depending on the geometry of the intramedullary canal, the stem can be fixed in place using acrylic bone cement.</detailed_description>
