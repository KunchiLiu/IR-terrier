	<brief_summary>Neonatal hypothermia is associated with increased risk of mortality as well as multiple morbidities. The investigators objective is to determine if an increase in ambient operative room temperature decreases the rate of hypothermia. Operating room temperature will be randomized to the current institutional standard (67°F) or a temperature of 73°F on a weekly basis for a period of six months.</brief_summary>
