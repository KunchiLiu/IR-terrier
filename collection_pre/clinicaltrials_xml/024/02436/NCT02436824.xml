	<brief_title>A Study of a Topical Patch (AB001) in Patients With Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of the safety and efficacy of AB001 topical patches in patients with chronic low back pain. Subjects meeting inclusion criteria are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive AB001 patches or placebo patches. Two AB001 or placebo patches will be given topically once daily for 14 days. The primary end point is the change of low back pain intensity rated on a visual analog scale (VAS) scale on Day 15, the secondary end points include the subject global assessment (SGA) of low back pain, the subject global perceived effect (GPE) of study medication, the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), and the pain assessment from subject diary (Days 1 - 3 only). Subjects' safety will be monitored throughout the study, including the adverse event (AE) incidence and severity, laboratory test results (hematology and clinical chemistry), vital signs, and physical examination.</detailed_description>
