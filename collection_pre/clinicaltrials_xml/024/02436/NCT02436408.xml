	<brief_summary>Basal cell carcinoma (BCCA) is the most common human cancer, and frequently affects facial structures. While rarely fatal, facial BCCA can be disfiguring and expensive to treat. Vismodegib is a small molecule inhibitor of SMO developed for the treatment of tumors in which the Hh signaling pathway appears to contribute to the development and maintenance of tumorigenesis. Vismodegib was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of metastatic and locally advanced BCCA. Recent reports have suggested that vismodegib treatment for orbital BCCA may facilitate eye preservation even if surgery is eventually required In order to assess the potential of vismodegib to improve the ophthalmic outcomes following treatment for orbital and/or periocular BCCA, this study will follow patients with globe-threatening orbital and lacrimal-threatening periocular BCCA who are being treated with vismodegib as standard of care.</brief_summary>
