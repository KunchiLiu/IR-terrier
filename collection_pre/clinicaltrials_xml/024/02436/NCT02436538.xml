	<brief_summary>Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), also known as Müllerian inhibiting substance, is a dimeric glycoprotein that belongs to the transforming growth factor-beta family. It is involved in the regression of the Müllerian ducts during male fetal development. In the female, AMH is solely produced by the granulosa cells of preantral and small antral follicles, and regulates ovarian activity and follicular steroidogenesis</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Following approval of the internal review board of Egyptian IVF-ET center, a retrospective analysis will be undertaken where a detailed review of the patients files who underwent intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) trials starting January 2010 till January 2015 will be done. Patients with diagnosed mullerian anomalies will have their name , age ,duration of infertility, serum FSH, LH ,&amp; AMH levels recorded. The method of diagnosis (HSG, 3D/ultrasonography, hysteroscopy, or laparoscopy) will also be documented.</detailed_description>
