	<brief_summary>Low pulse oximetry is the most common adverse events during sedation for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The main reason is the glossoptosis after sedation. In present study a new designed nasopharyngeal airway embedded with jet ventilation catheter(WEI NASAL JET) will be utilized in order to reduce the hypoxia. At the same time the safety will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
