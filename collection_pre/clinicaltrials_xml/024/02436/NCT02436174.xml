	<brief_summary>Shivering is a common side-effect of epidural anesthesia. In studies to date, the assessment of shivering has been based on a simple scale using descriptive words rather than actual measurements. We believe that we can assess shivering more scientifically by using a novel method to quantify arm movements during shivering.</brief_summary>
