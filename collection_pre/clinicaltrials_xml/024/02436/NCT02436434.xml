	<brief_summary>Pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) is designed to alleviate pain by delivering an electrical field and heat bursts at a temperature less than 42째C to neural tissue. In contrast with conventional radiofrequency, PRF is controlled below 42째C without damage to nerves and many studies have shown its benefits in pain relief for certain kinds of chronic pain conditions. For lessening pain of certain joint arthropathy, the direct nerve block by application of PRF is difficult and complicated because the supplying nerve of joint is complex or small. Hence, some authors perform intra-articular PRF on the chronic painful joint for example, knee osteoarthritis, atlantoaxial joint, cervical facet joint sacroiliac joint, scapholunate and shoulder joint and the excellent long-term effects are reported. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of intra-articular PRF in osteoarthritis.</brief_summary>

However, the definite effect of intra-articular PRF for osteoarthritis from current published studies are insufficiently proved because of small patient numbers and lack of placebo-controlled design. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of intra-articular PRF in osteoarthritis.</detailed_description>
