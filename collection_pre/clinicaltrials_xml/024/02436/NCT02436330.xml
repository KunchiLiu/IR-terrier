	<detailed_description>Eighty-four overweight pediatric subjects will be enrolled sequentially and randomized 2:1 in experimental and control groups for six months of weight management programming. The experimental group and their parents/guardians will participate in ten weekly 2-hour sessions, comprised of 1 hour of exergaming or exergaming combined with traditional exercise and 1 hour of didactic classes focusing on nutrition and psychosocial behaviors related to weight management. Following these 10 weeks, they will attend monthly 1-hour maintenance didactic classes. The control group and their parents/guardians will participate only in the didactic portion of the curricula for the same duration of time, 10 weeks, followed by monthly maintenance classes for the remainder of the 6 month period. The control group will then be offered participation in the Exergaming for Health program upon study completion. Comparisons between the two groups will be obtained through changes in the measurements of weight, height, BMI z-scores, shuttle run times, and responses to questionnaires about screen time, self-perception, and nutrition. Measurements of both groups will be obtained at baseline and 6 months and another set of measurements will be obtained on the experimental group at 12 months.</detailed_description>
