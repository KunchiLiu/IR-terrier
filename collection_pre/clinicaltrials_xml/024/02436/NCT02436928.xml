Subjects administered with any other vaccine during the period within 6 weeks before the first administration of study vaccine. 4. Subjects with confirmed or suspected abnormal immune function, immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, based on medical history and physical examination. 5. Subjects with a history of hypersensitivity to vaccines or a history of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. 6. Subjects with a history of inflammatory or degenerative neurological disease . 7. Subjects receiving chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within 6 months prior to the administration of the study vaccine.

Subjects, judged by the investigator, with any clinically significant medical illness including acute pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by medical history, physical examination and/or laboratory screening tests. 10. The subjects would not be suitable for the vaccination if the screening laboratory tests show any of the follows ALT or AST &gt; upper limit of normal range (ULN); Serum creatinine &gt; upper limit of normal range (ULN); Any significant laboratory abnormality as judged by the investigator 11. Subjects receiving administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months preceding the administration of the study vaccine or at any time during the study. 12. Subjects with acute disease at the time of enrolment. 13. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product other than the study vaccine within 30 days prior to the first vaccination, or planned use of the abovementioned product during the entire study period. 14.
