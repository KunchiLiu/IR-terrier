	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the performance of a blood test for detecting biomarkers in metastatic breast cancer patients at one clinic against standard testing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Utilization of the OncoCEE™ Platform to Evaluate Selected Biomarker Alterations in CTCs Isolated From Patients With MBC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this pilot study is to detect the expression of FGFR1 and AR on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) isolated from the peripheral blood of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients using the OncoCEE™ platform. No procedures will be associated with this study, as these mutations will be evaluated from the leftover blood that has already been sent for standard of care ER and HER2 using the same platform. Results from this testing will be correlated with results obtained from standard testing to calculate the rate of concordance between tests.</detailed_description>
