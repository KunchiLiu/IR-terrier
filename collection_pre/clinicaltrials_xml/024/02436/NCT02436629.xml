	<brief_title>Nitrate for High Intensity Intermittent Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oral ingestion of nitrate (NO3-) in the form of both nitrate salts and concentrated red beetroot juice has been shown to significantly lower blood pressure at rest and to improve exercise performance during cycle time trials. Furthermore, a positive exercise performance effect of nitrate ingestion has been observed in recreational athletes during intermittent exercise. However, this was achieved after acute supplementation with a substantial dose of dietary nitrate. Whether similar ergogenic effects of nitrate supplementation can be achieved with a more conventional 6-day nitrate supplementation protocol with a lower daily dose remains to be established. Based on the gaps in current literature, our main goal will be to gain further insight into the effects of a 6-day nitrate supplementation protocol on high intensity intermittent exercise performance in recreational athletes.</detailed_description>
