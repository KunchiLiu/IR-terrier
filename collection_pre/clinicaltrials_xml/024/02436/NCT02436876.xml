	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the safety and clinical benefit of MBN-101 administered intraoperatively to infected osteosynthesis sites for patients diagnosed with a fracture site infection associated with orthopaedic hardware. Three quarters of the patients will receive MBN-101, while the other one quarter will receive placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Assess Safety and Clinical Activity of Local MBN-101 in Treatment of Infected Osteosynthesis Sites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative orthopaedic infections, particularly antibiotic-resistant infections, present a serious clinical challenge to surgeons and other treating physicians. These infections involve implanted foreign materials (stabilizing orthopaedic hardware), making infection of these sites much more likely than if foreign materials were not involved. MBN-101 has broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against orthopaedic wound pathogens. This is a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study to assess the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of MBN-101 to treat infected osteosynthesis sites during revision surgery with or without hardware removal and replacement for patients diagnosed with an apparent fracture site infection within one year of the last surgical intervention.</detailed_description>
