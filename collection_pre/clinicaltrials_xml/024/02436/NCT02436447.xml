	<brief_summary>This study is a Phase 1, open-label, parallel group, multiple dose study, in subjects over 18 years, to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of one-hour intravenous infusion of MTP-131 administered for 7 consecutive days. Twenty-four subjects are planned to be enrolled into 4 cohorts of varying renal function, with each cohort consisting of 6 subjects.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject is ≥18 yearsofage at the Screening Visit. Subject has signed an ICF before any study specific procedures are performed. Subjects selected for each cohort must satisfy the following creatinine clearance (CLCR) criteria (as determined by 24 hour urine collection and analysis): Cohort 1 Normal Renal Function, 24 hour CLCR ≥ 90 mL/min Cohort 2 Mild renal impairment, 24 hour CLCR ≥ 6089 mL/min Cohort 3 Moderate renal impairment, 24 hour CLCR ≥ 3059 mL/min Cohort 4 Severe renal impairment, 24 hour CLCR &lt;30 not requiring dialysis Have a history of stable renal impairment as determined by standard estimated creatinine clearance methodology (at least 1 month within the same descriptive cohort) and be in a stable physical condition based on findings of medical history. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use 1 of the following methods of birth control from the date they sign the ICF until two months after the last dose of study drug: 1. Abstinence, when it is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Subject agrees to use an acceptable method of contraception should they become sexually active. 2. Maintenance of a monogamous relationship with a male partner who has been surgically sterilized by vasectomy (the vasectomy procedure must have been conducted at least 60 days prior to the Screening Visit or confirmed via sperm analysis). 3. Barrier method (e.g., condom or occlusive cap) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream AND either hormonal contraception (oral, implanted, or injectable) or an intrauterine device or system. Subject has history of any concurrent medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, significantly increases the potential risks associated with administration of MTP131 or any other aspect of study participation, with the exception of renal impairment. Female subjects who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or lactating. Subject has history of cancer (with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer), unless the subject has documentation of completed curative treatment Subject has history of renal transplantation. Subject has active inflammatory renal disease. Subject has a history of histamine intolerance (e.g., a known deficiency of endogenous or exogenous histamine degradation). Subject is currently receiving treatment with chemotherapeutic agents or immunosuppressant agents. Subject has positive serology for HIV 1, HIV 2, HBsAg or HCV. Subject has donated or received blood or blood products within the past 30 days. Subject participated in a clinical study involving investigational product within 30 days prior to the planned date of study drug administration. Subject has a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity or allergy to any of the excipients contained in the study drug. Subject has a history of active alcoholism or drug addiction during the year before the Screening Visit. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
