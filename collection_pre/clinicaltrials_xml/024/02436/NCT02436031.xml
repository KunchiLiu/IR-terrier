	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common and has major health implications but treatment options are limited. OSA patients show a marked reduction in upper airway (UA) dilator muscle activity at sleep onset and this phenomenon leads to increased collapsibility of UA compared to normal participants. Until recently, the search for medicines to activate pharyngeal muscles in sleeping humans has been discouraging. However, exciting new animal research has shown that drugs with noradrenergic and antimuscarinic effects can restore pharyngeal muscle activity to waking levels. In this protocol the investigators will test the effect of desipramine (a tricyclic antidepressant with strong noradrenergic and antimuscarinic effects) on upper airway collapsibility and genioglossus muscle activity (EMG GG) during sleep in OSA patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Desipramine on Upper Airway Collapsibility and Genioglossus Muscle Activity in Patients With Obstructive Sleep Apnea - Study B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two overnight sleep studies, a placebo night and a drug night, will be performed approximately one week apart in random order. The placebo or drug will be administered 2 hours before lights out. At least 15 minutes of quiet wakefulness will be recorded to quantify the participant's EMG GG activity while awake and at sleep onset (alpha-theta transition at the electroencephalogram). During the second part of the night, the participants will be connected to a modified continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine (Pcrit3000, Respironics) which can provide a wide range of pressures between 20 and -20 cmH2O in order to modify upper airway pressure and measure pharyngeal critical collapsing pressure (Pcrit), ventilation at 0 cmH2O when UA muscle are passive and active as well as change in EMG GG as a function of epiglottic pressure (muscle responsiveness). Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) will be calculated in each night from the part of the study off CPAP.</detailed_description>
