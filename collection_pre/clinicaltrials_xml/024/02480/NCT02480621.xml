	<brief_title>Liposomal Bupivacaine With Bupivacaine in Ankle Fracture ORIF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a prospective, randomized controlled trial assessing pain control in ankle fractures repaired with open reduction and internal fixation. Patients are consented and enrolled pre-operatively, and randomized to either control or liposomal bupivacaine with bupivacaine administered intra-operatively. Patients are to remain blinded to the treatment arm. The surgeon is non-blinded and administers the bupivacaine solution locally, intra-operatively. Patients pain scores and pain medication usage is documented. A trained research coordinator contacts each patient at 24, 48, and 72 hours post-operatively to assess pain levels on a VAS scale and pain medications taken. Patients return for followup at standard intervals of 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year post-operatively to assess healing and functional outcomes. Patients are queried as to satisfaction with pain control at 2 weeks post-operatively. The study will compare outcomes including pain levels, pain medications taken, OR and PACU times, LOS, satisfaction with pain control, clinical outcomes, and complication rates.</detailed_description>
