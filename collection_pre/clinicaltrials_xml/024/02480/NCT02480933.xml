	<brief_title>Silent Breast Cancer A Study of the Disease Prevalence Held by Imaging Guided Biopsies in Autopsy Specimens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cadavers of both sexes are going to be submitted to bilateral mastectomy. The specimens are going to be examined by palpation, ecography and mammography and all areas with (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System) BI-RADS classification &gt;= 3 are going to be biopsied. Biopsy specimens are going to be processed by the pathology department and cancers are going to be identified and classified by their molecular type. The investigators intend to know which is the disease reservoir in various ages.</detailed_description>
