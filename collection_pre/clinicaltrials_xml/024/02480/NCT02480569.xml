	<brief_summary>The investigators propose a single center prospective study that will assess two different strategies for measuring Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) in patients undergoing clinically-indicated coronary angiography in whom FFR measurement is indicated. FFR will be measured with a non-side hole guide catheter (with the guide catheter both engaged and disengaged from the coronary ostium) and with a side-hole guide catheter (with the guide catheter both engaged and disengaged from the coronary ostium) to determine, whether measurements obtained with an engaged side-hole guide catheter are more accurate as compared with those obtained with the engaged non-side hole catheter.</brief_summary>
