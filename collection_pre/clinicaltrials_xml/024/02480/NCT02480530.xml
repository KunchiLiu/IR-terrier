	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to improve statin medication adherence among Veterans with coronary artery disease with poor adherence to medications. The investigators are testing if newer technology pill bottle devices linked with individual feedback and/or social incentive strategies can improve medication taking behavior.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Feedback Reports to Improve Medication Adherence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with coronary artery disease and previous poor adherence to statin medications will be recruited at Philadelphia VA Medical Center. Enrolled participants will be randomly assigned to one of three arms: 1. Control Group 2. Individual Alarm device and feedback report 3. Individual plus patient-selected Feedback Friend report Patients will be given a medication-monitoring device (Vitality GlowCaps) to monitor the statin medication that is being currently prescribed by their primary care physician. In first group, the control arm (Arm 1), the device reminders will be turned off but the device will continue recording adherence to the medications. In second group, reminder arm (Arm 2), the device will be programmed as an alarm that will be activated if the patient does not take the medication at the time set by the patient. In addition the patient will get a weekly report of his/her adherence. In the third group, patient-selected family/friend/or reciprocal peer feedback arm (Arm 3), in addition to the activation of the alarm function the device will be linked to a weekly report on adherence to medications. This report will be delivered to the patient and to the patient identified family/friend/ or reciprocal peer.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All participants will have a diagnosis of CAD To be eligible they must be between the ages of 3075 years of ageto ensure we are targeting those most likely to benefit from improving control to these medications Patients must have been prescribed a statin by their provider and a documented poor adherence as measured by a 16month medication adherence rate (Medication Possession Ratio) of &lt;80% Due to the use of the medication adherence reminder device, patients must speak English Have a home address Telephone number Be willing and able to identify a friend or family member The investigators will exclude atients with active substance abuse, significant hearing loss, or reduced cognitive ability as determined from the patient's problem list</criteria>
