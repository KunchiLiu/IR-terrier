	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the clinical safety and efficacy of the Polymer-Free Drug-Eluting coronary stent system for the treatment of de novo lesions in native coronary arteries with a reference vessel diameter (RVD) that allows use of stents between 2.25 and 3.50 mm in diameter.</brief_summary>
