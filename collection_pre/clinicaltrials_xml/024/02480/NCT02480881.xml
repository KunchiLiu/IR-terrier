	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, single sequence, 4-cycle, 4-treatment, drug-drug interaction (DDI) study in healthy female subjects on oral contraceptives (OC). There is no formal research hypothesis to be statistically tested. It is expected that coadministration of BMS-663068 with OC will not affect the pharmacokinetics (PK) of either ethinyl estradiol (EE) or norethindrone (NE).</brief_summary>
