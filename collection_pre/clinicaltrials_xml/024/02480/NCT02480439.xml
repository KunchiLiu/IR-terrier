	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Relative Bioavailability and to Assess the Effect of Food on the Bioavailability of a TAK-648 Tablet in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will assess the relative Bioavailability (BA) of TAK-648 tablet compared with that of TAK-648 solution and the effect of food on the BA of the TAK-648 tablet. The study will enroll approximately 24 healthy participants. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three treatment sequences: - TAK-648 tablet in fed state, followed by TAK-648 tablet in fasted state, followed by TAK-648 oral solution in fasted state - TAK-648 tablet in fasted state, followed by TAK-648 oral solution in fasted state, followed by TAK-648 tablet in fed state - TAK-648 oral solution in fasted state, TAK-648 tablet in fed state, TAK-648 tablet in fasted state The dosing in a period and the subsequent period will be separated by a minimum 7-day washout interval. Participants will be asked to take single dose of TAK-648 tablet or oral solution on Day 1 of each period. This single-center trial will be conducted in the United States. Participants will make 4 visits to the clinic including three 4-day periods of confinement to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 30 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>
