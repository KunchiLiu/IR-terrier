	<brief_title>EFFECT OF Salvia Hispanica l. (CHIA) IN THE BIOCHEMICAL METABOLIC SYNDROME COMPONENTS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The metabolic syndrome (MS) is a cardiovascular risk factor and is present in about 20-25% of the world's adult population. Individuals with this condition have twice the risk of cardiovascular disease and die from it, compared with those who do not and 5 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). For this reason, it is appropriate to develop better tools for prevention and management of MS, with more emphasis on lifestyleÂ´s changes. Chia has been studied in the past 10 years due to its high concentration of omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and 6 linoleic acid (LA) showing beneficial effects in some components of MS in rodents and individuals. The addition of chia to the conventional treatment of MS for the modification of metabolic disorders provides us a tool for easy incorporation into daily life, inexpensive and accessible in our environment.</detailed_description>
