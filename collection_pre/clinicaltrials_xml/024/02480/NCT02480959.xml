	<brief_title>Medial Retinacular Plication Versus Medial Patellofemoral Ligament Reconstruction for Recurrent Patellar Instability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with recurrent lateral patellar instability will be assigned to undergo one of two surgical approaches aimed to prevent recurrent patellar instability and result in improvement in function. One surgical approach will be medial retinacular plication with multiple stitches while the other surgical approach will include medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction using a hamstring tendon graft. Prior to surgery, and then during follow-up after surgery as well as at the completion of minimum two years follow-up after surgery, patients will be asked to complete subjective functional questionaires that will rate their knee function, and to undergo detailed physical examination and objective functional tests that will quantify the success of surgery. The outcomes of the surgical treatment options will be compared to determine whether medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction results in superior function and patient subjective satisfaction compared to medial retinacular plication only.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Recurrent lateral patellar instability has been described by the patient Imaging criteria include: TTTG distance (on CT or MRI) is between 1020 mm InsallSalvati Index is between 0.9 1.2 Trochlea angle is lower than 145 degrees Only a single event of lateral patellar instability occured Imaging criteria include: TTTG distance (on CT or MRI) is below 10 mm or above 20 mm InsallSalvati Index is below 0.9 or above 1.2 Trochlea angle is above 145 degrees Other concomitant intraarticular patholgies, injuries, and surgeries, besides the patella instability, with were recorded at the lower limbs and did not uneventfuly healed, and as a result cause dysfunction of the lower limbs Significant ligamentous injuries of the knees, including cruciate and collateral injuries, as well as meniscal injuries that interfere with function</criteria>
