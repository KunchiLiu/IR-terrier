	<brief_title>Hepatic Fibrosis Assessment Using Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patients with liver parenchymal disease or normal liver parenchyma who are scheduled to undergo either liver resection or liver biopsy are included. Referred patients undergo multiparametric MRI including perfusion, diffusion, elastography and fat quantification before surgery or biopsy. The pathophysiologic changes are evaluated using multiparametric MRI, and compared between normal/early fibrosis and advanced fibrosis.</detailed_description>
