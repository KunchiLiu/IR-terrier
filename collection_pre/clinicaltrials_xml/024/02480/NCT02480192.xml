	<brief_summary>Women going through the menopausal transition often experience adverse physical changes (e.g., hot flashes/night sweats, sleep difficulties, sexual concerns) in addition to emotional difficulties (e.g., depression, anxiety) that can significantly impact functioning and overall quality of life. To date, hormone therapy (HT) has been the most commonly used treatment to relieve symptoms of menopause. However, reports have questioned the safety of HT long-term (e.g., risk of heart attacks, strokes, cancer) in some women. Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), has been proposed as a low-risk treatment for menopausal symptoms and received some initial support. The investigators developed a comprehensive non-pharmacological, CBT based treatment program for menopausal symptoms, published the treatment manual, and have initial evidence supporting its effectiveness with the investigators' published pilot data. The investigators' goal is to conduct a large randomized controlled trial of Cognitive Behavioural Group Therapy (CBGT) for the improvement of menopausal symptoms. The investigators hypothesize that participants will experience fewer and less intense/disruptive hot flashes/night sweats, reduced depression and anxiety and improvement in sleep difficulties, sexual concerns, and overall quality of life. The investigators also predict that these benefits will be maintained at follow up and there will be high satisfaction associated with the program by participants.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Menopausal staging: perimenopause or early postmenopause, as per STRAW definition (Harlow et al., 2012) 2. A minimal of a Moderate level of severity of depressive symptoms (defined by the Beck Depression Inventory), 3. Significant vasomotor symptoms (defined as subscore of 3 or more on the vasomotor subscale of Greene's Climacteric Scale (Greene, 1998). Further, participants have to report significant occurrence of hot flashes (defined as at least 4/day or 30/week) and that these hot flashes have a significant negative impact on their functioning (defined by a score of 30 or greater on the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale). 4. Not taking hormonal, antidepressant, or any herbal therapies or if taking these medications they must be taking a stable dose for at least three months prior to the study and for the duration of the study, 5. Speak, read, and write in English sufficiently to comprehend testing procedures and written materials in group treatment. 1. Participants who are severely depressed/suicidal at the time of the screen or intake assessment that would warrant acute treatment and hence, render them unable to act as a wait list control participant if randomized to this condition, 2. Participants with Psychotic Disorders, or current Substance Dependence.</criteria>
