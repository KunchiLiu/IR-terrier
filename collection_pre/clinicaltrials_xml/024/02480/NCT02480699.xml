	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by a irreversible decrease of kidney functions. It is characterized by accumulation of solutes called uremic toxins. Uremic toxins levels are implicated in cardiovascular complications associated with CKD. Several protein-bound toxins have been implicated in the increased cardiovascular risk such as indoxyl sulfate (IS), p cresol sulfate (pCS) and more recently the indole acetic acid (IAA). All clinical studies are performed with a single measurement at baseline assuming that the toxin levels are stable over time. The variability of uremic toxins level is not known. Furthermore, little is known concerning determinants of serum toxins level.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intra Individual Evaluation of Uremic Toxin Levels in Hemodialysed Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colonic absorption play a major role in IS (indoxyl sulfate) and pCS level. IS and pCS level are significantly reduced in patient with colectomy. To validate the measurement of uremic toxins level in serum as biomarkers for cardiovascular risk, we need to know about intra-individual variability over time and the impact of diet or digestive disorders on uremic toxin serum level. We propose a prospective study evaluating the intra-individual variability in 3 uremic toxins serum levels the SI, the pCS and IAA. The main objective is to study the kinetics of three serum uremic toxins: the indoxyl sulfate, p cresyl sulfate and indole acetic acid (and thus determine the intra-individual variability) in a population of chronic hemodialysis patients during 1 year.</detailed_description>
