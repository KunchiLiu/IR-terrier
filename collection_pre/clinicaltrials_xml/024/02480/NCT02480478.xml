	<brief_summary>Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is the most common liver disease in pregnancy. It is is a pregnancy-specific liver disorder with onset mainly in the third trimester of pregnancy. ICP is characterized by pruritus, elevated serum fasting bile salts and transaminases and an increased risk of adverse fetal outcomes. Serum autotaxin levels were found highly sensitive and specific biomarker to to differentiate ICP from other pregnancy-related liver disorders or pruritic dermatoses. The purpose of the study is to determine the diagnostic accuracy of serum autotaxin activity in cholestasis of pregnancy.</brief_summary>
