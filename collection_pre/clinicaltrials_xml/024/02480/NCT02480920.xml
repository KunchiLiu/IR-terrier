	<detailed_description>NOACs have several clinical and pharmacological advantages over warfarin however suboptimal adherence is one of the most common causes of failure to respond to medications and outcomes. This observational multicenter, retrospective study, will compose a national database of drug adherence and investigate the factors that affect drug adherence in patients taking new oral anticoagulation therapy in Turkey. Social support and adherence to therapy factors that may affect drug adherence and adverse events will be assessed by self-report questionnaires. Non-adherence will be tested for demographic, clinical, awareness of NOAC therapy and socioeconomic factors.</detailed_description>
