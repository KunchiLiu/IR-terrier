	<brief_summary>Opioid-based intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) offers excellent pain control, however, its use inevitably increases the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Ramosetron and palonosetron are commonly used 5-HT3 antagonists for the prevention and treatment of PONV. It is not clear which one has superior antiemetic efficacy for the prevention of PONV in patients using opioid-based IV-PCA. The antiemetic efficacy of 5HT3 antagonists may be influenced by polymorphism of ABCB1, a drug-transporter gene. This study evaluates relative antiemetic efficacy of ramosetron and palonosetron in patients using IV-PCA after spinal surgery and impact of ABCB1 polymorphism on the antiemetic efficacy of the ramosetron and palonosetron. The incidence and intensity of PONV during postoperative 48 h will be assessed. ABCB1 polymorphisms 3435C&gt;T and 2677G&gt;T/A will be evaluated in all patients.</brief_summary>
