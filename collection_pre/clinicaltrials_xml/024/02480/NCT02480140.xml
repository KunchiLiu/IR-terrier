	<brief_summary>Emerging research suggests the use of self-regulation (SR) strategies at improving functional regain in patients with brain injury. SR is proposed to produce an added effect to the effective constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT). This study aimed to examine the efficacy of a self-regulated CIMT program (SR-CIMT) for function regain of patients with subacute stroke. It was hypothesized that participants receiving the combined treatment (SR and CIMT) would have a better functional regain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Self-regulated Constraint-induced Movement Therapy in Subacute Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background - Emerging research suggests the use of self-regulation (SR) strategies at improving functional regain in patients with brain injury. SR is proposed to produce an added effect to the effective constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT). Objective - This study aimed to examine the efficacy of a self-regulated CIMT program (SR-CIMT) for function regain of patients with sub-acute stroke. Methods - Seventy-six patients were randomly assigned to the self-regulated constraint-induced movement therapy (SR-CIMT; n=25), constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT; n=27) or conventional functional rehabilitation (control; n=24) groups, and completed the trial. The SR-CIMT intervention was two-week therapist-guided training using the SR strategy to reflect on the relearning of functional tasks with CIMT. Outcome measurements were for upper limb function (Action Research Arm Test, ARAT, Fugl-Meyer Assessment, FMA), daily task performance (Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, Lawton IADL) and self-perceived functional ability (Motor Activity Log, MAL) at pre and post intervention intervals, and at one month follow up.</detailed_description>
