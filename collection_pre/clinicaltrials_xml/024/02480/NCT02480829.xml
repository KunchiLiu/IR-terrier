	<brief_summary>Two Phase Multicenter Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of the Amphora OAB system for treatment of urgency and frequency with or without urge incontinence caused by an overactive bladder.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cystoscopic Ablation Via RF Energy Clinical Trial (CARET 2)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will enroll subjects with symptomatic idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB). Subjects who are found to be unresponsive to or intolerant of medical therapy will be screened and evaluated for suitability for study participation. A 3 day Bladder Diary must be completed to verify enrollment eligibility.</detailed_description>

Ambulatory without the aid of walking assistance a majority of the time (cane, walker etc.) and able to use toilet without assistance 5. Postvoid residual (PVR) ≤ 100 ml NOTE: Subjects with a single PVR of &gt;100 ml followed by two consecutive PVR measurements of ≤100 ml may be included in the study. 6. Ability and willingness to selfcatheterize in case this is necessary 7. Bladder Diary Criteria: over the 3 days the following outcomes: Micturition frequency of ≥ 8 times/day, on average AND &gt; 3 episodes of urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) Subjects will be excluded if ANY of the following conditions apply: 1. Planning on becoming pregnant during the 18 month study period 2. Current participation in any other conflicting interventional or OAB treatment study 3.

Any invasive or surgical intervention involving the bladder, rectum or vaginal wall (e.g., radio frequency, implant, sling) within the last 6 months 5. Ongoing complications of prior antiincontinence surgery 6. SNS or PTNS treatment within the last 15 days. NOTE: a SNS device that is not turned on is acceptable for enrollment 7. Botox treatment for OAB with 100u in the last 6 months OR Botox treatment with &gt;100u in last 9 months. 8. Subject with 24hour total urine volume voided greater than 3,000 ml as measured at screening period 9. Urinary tract infection that is not resolved at the time of enrollment or had &gt; 3 urinary tract infections (UTIs) within the last 12 months NOTE: If UTI is present at baseline screening, treatment with antibiotics and a negative urinalysis at least 7 days after the initial diagnosis of UTI will be acceptable for enrollment. 10.

Anatomical conditions or surgical implants that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the introduction and/or use of the device such as significant pelvic organ prolapse, urogenital prolapse visible at rest beyond the hymen, significant cystocele prolapse, implanted vaginal mesh between the trigone of the bladder and vagina or high BMI. 12. Current hydronephrosis or hydroureter 13. Current bleeding disorder or coagulopathies 14. Current use of antimuscarinics, β3 agonist or antispasmodics NOTE: subjects on these drugs must undergo a 2 week washout period prior to completing the baseline Bladder Diary. 15.
