	<brief_title>Study of Free DNA Content of Embryo Culture Medium as a Non-Invasive Tool for Embryo Assessment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the present study is to determine whether cell free DNA content of the culture medium of the human embryo correlates with the quality and reproductive potential of embryos in ICSI cycles and, thus, to look for a new non invasive tool of assessing embryo quality beside morphological assessment. Determining a rapid, noninvasive method for the assessment of the developmental potential of embryos may be a great achievement</detailed_description>
