	<brief_summary>This is a cluster randomized trial (CRT) to assess the effectiveness of a culturally appropriate behavioral intervention to reduce obesity levels and ultimately the risk of developing diabetes type II in immigrant Latino farm workers. Randomization is at the farm ranch level. Individuals at intervention ranches will receive a multi-week curriculum at the work-site on diabetes, diet and physical activity and optional supplemental sessions in the evening and weekends. The investigators will adopt the intent-to-treat principle for the primary analysis. Individuals on control ranches will receive no health educational instruction. The primary outcome is BMI. The investigators hypothesize that intervention ranches will achieve significant improvement in obesity and diabetes risk factors as compared to control ranches.</brief_summary>
