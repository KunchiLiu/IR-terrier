	<brief_summary>This study will give comparison of the bone pain remission and the adverse reaction of Zoledronic acid combine with High dose fractionation radiotherapy(30Gy/10f) and Zoledronic acid combine with low dose fractionation radiotherapy(15Gy/5f) . The purpose of this trial is to prove whether Zoledronic acid combine radiotherapy can reduce radiotherapy dose in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer bone metastasis'pain relief or not.</brief_summary>
