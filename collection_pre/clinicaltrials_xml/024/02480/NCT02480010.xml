	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) pertuzumab in participants with hormone-refractory prostate cancer who have had no previous chemotherapy. Participants will be enrolled in two stages, the first (Cohort A) at a lower 420-mg dose and the second (Cohort B) at a higher 1050-mg dose based upon observations in Cohort A. Up to 50 participants may enter either cohort, for a total enrollment between 46 and 73 participants across 9 study centers.</brief_summary>
