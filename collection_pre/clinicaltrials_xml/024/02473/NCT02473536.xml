	<criteria>Radiographic evidence of renal cancer with IVC tumor thrombus Tumor thrombus must be ≥ level II Patient eligible for SABR to the IVC tumor thrombus as decided by the treating radiation oncologist Patient eligible for IVC tumor thrombectomy as decided by the treating urologist Any number of metastatic disease is allowed in the Pilot phase of the trial For the Phase II, metastatic patients will be allowed only if all sites of metastasis has been treated either surgically or radiosurgically Age ≥ 18 years. Performance status ECOG 02 Any serum Albumin is allowed, but ≥ 3.4 g/dL is strongly encouraged Any serum AST is allowed but serum AST ≤ 34 IU/L is strongly encouraged Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion of therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent. Subjects must be able to undergo either a contrast enhanced MRI or CT. Subjects who have had radiotherapy to a target within 3 cm of the IVC tumor thrombus. Subjects may have received any other investigational agents or chemotherapy as long as they are eligible for SABR and surgery Subjects with brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial unless all the metastasis are treated surgically or radiosurgically Subjects with a history of pulmonary embolism is excluded Subjects with a history of pulmonary hypertension is excluded Subjects must not be pregnant due to the potential for congenital abnormalities. Surgery or SABR of metastatic site concurrently or at any time is allowed Contraindication for contrastenhanced MRI as defined by the standard operating procedures of the Department of Radiology at UT Southwestern. Briefly, these include medically unstable; cardiac pacemaker; intracranial clips, metal implants; metal in the eyes; pregnant or nursing; claustrophobia; and impairment of the renal function with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2.</criteria>
