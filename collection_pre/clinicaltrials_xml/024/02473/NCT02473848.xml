	<brief_summary>The substance ingenol mebutate (IM) is registered in Switzerland and many countries worldwide for the treatment of actinic keratosis (AK). There is no data on the use of IM in organ transplant recipients, a population highly affected by AK and skin cancer at large. The investigators want to study the use of IM against AK in this high-risk group of patients and assess its safety. The investigators are hoping to prove that IM is safe to use in AK of organ transplant recipients, allowing its use in the clinical routine treatement of AK also in this subset of patients with AK.</brief_summary>
