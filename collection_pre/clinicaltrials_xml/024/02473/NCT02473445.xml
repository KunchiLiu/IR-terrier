	<brief_summary>A long-term extension study of patients with mitochondrial diseases, who are ≥ 6 years old and &lt; 18 years previously enrolled into the RP103-MITO-001 (NCT02023866) study assessing the safety, tolerability and efficacy of RP103.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Long-Term Extension Study of RP103-MITO-001 (NCT02023866) to Assess RP103 in Children With Inherited Mitochondrial Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with either documented genetically confirmed diagnosis of inherited mitochondrial diseases, who are ≥ 6 years old and &lt; 18 years, and meet other specified inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be included in this study. Patients with inherited mitochondrial diseases associated with nuclear or mitochondrial DNA mutations that impair the respiratory chain. These include, but are not limited to the following clinical syndromes: Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy; myoclonic epilepsy and ragged-red fibers (MERFF); mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like syndrome (MELAS); Kearn-Sayre syndrome; subacute necrotizing encephalopathy (Leigh Syndrome); POLG-related disorders (Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome, Autosomal Dominant Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia, Autosomal Recessive Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia, Childhood Myocerebrohepatopathy Spectrum Disorders, Myoclonic Epilepsy Myopathy Sensory Ataxia, POLG-Related Ataxia Neuropathy Spectrum Disorders); Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome (MNGIE), also called myoneurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome or POLIP syndrome; others, e.g., mitochondrial cardiomyopathies and other syndromes due to multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions. Patients completing the RP103-MITO-001(NCT02023866) study are eligible for enrollment into the extension study RP103-MITO-002 if all inclusion and exclusion criteria are fulfilled. Subjects continue on the last total daily dose of RP103 taken during RP103-MITO-001. Dose-adjustments are permitted.The sample size is maximally 25 subjects.</detailed_description>

Willing and able to comply with study drug dosing requirements, i.e. ingest the RP103 capsules intact, or sprinkled in liquid or soft food, or using a Gtube. 5. Sexually active female subjects of childbearing potential (i.e., not surgically sterile [tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy]) must agree to utilize two of the following acceptable forms of contraception throughout the study (from Day 1 to Study Exit): Hormonal contraception: birth control pills, injection, patch, vaginal ring or implant; Condom or diaphragm, with spermicide; Intrauterine device (IUD); Sterile male partner (vasectomy performed at least 6 months prior to the study). 6. Patient's legally authorized representative must provide written informed consent; Patient must provide assent, if required by local/institutional requirements. 1. Documented diagnosis of concurrent inborn errors of metabolism. 2. Platelet count, lymphocyte count or hemoglobin below the lower limit of normal (LLN) at the Baseline visit. 3. Hepatic insufficiency with liver enzyme tests (alkaline phosphatase, AST or ALT) greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) at the Baseline Visit. 4. Bilirubin &gt; 1.2 g/dL at the Baseline Visit. 5. Inability to complete the elements of the study, e.g., coma, hemodynamic instability or requiring continuous ventilator support. 6. Malabsorption requiring TPN, chronic diarrhea, bouts of pseudo obstruction. 7. Severe endorgan hypoperfusion syndrome secondary to cardiac failure resulting in lactic acidosis. 8. Patients with suspected elevated intracranial pressure, pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) and/or papilledema. 9. Severe gastrointestinal disease including gastroparesis. 10. History of drug or alcohol abuse. 11. History of pancreatitis. 12. Participated in an investigational drug trial (except the RP103MITO001 study) within 30 days or, within 90 days for a biologic, device, or surgical treatment, for inherited mitochondrial diseases prior to the Baseline Visit. 13. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to cysteamine and penicillamine. 14. Female subjects who are nursing, planning a pregnancy, known or suspected to be pregnant, or with a positive serum pregnancy test at the Baseline visit. 15. Patients who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are not able or willing to comply with the protocol.</criteria>
