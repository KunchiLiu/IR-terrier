	<brief_summary>A group of engineers at Michigan State developed a novel waveform analysis technique ("Long Time Interval Analysis" [LTIA]) that attempts to estimate cardiac output non-invasively. Retrospective comparison of LTIA to invasive techniques (e.g. thermodilution) suggest acceptable agreement. Thus, a prospective trial of LTIA is warranted. This study compares LTIA to a validated measure of cardiac output - esophageal Doppler monitoring.</brief_summary>
