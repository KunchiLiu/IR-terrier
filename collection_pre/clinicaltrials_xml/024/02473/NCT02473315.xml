	<brief_summary>Whole body cryotherpy (WBC) is a well-tolerated procedure that implies patients' exposition at a temperature of approximately -110 degrees. A considerable increase in the popularity of WBC has occurred in rheumatologic patients, despite a lack of evidences of its efficiency. Because of its interesting anti-inflammatory properties, the investigators think that WBC could be an alternative treatment to classical NSAIDs (Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs) and corticosteroids, in patients suffering from axial spondyloarthritis. This is a proof of concept study.</brief_summary>
