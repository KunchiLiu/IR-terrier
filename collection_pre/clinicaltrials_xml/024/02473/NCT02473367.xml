	<brief_summary>In order to define the safe windows for co-dosing of metal-cation antacids with once daily administered raltegravir, this study will evaluate the effect of both calcium carbonate and magnesium/aluminum hydroxide antacids on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir, due to dosage of 1200 mg raltegravir in HIV-infected participants already taking 400 mg raltegravir twice daily as part of their HIV treatment regimen.</brief_summary>
