	<brief_summary>For those chronic hepatitis C patients, who are interferon-ineligible or intolerant, there is a burning need for the development of pan-oral interferon-free regimen. The investigators examine the efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir, a NS5B nucleotide polymerase inhibitor and daclatasvir, an NS5A replication complex inhibitor in Chinese treatment-experienced cirrhosis patients with chronic G1b infection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SOF Plus DCV in Treating Chinese Treatment-experienced HCV Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chinese genotype 1b HCV treatment-experienced cirrhotic patients are recruited and treated with 12 weeks sofosbuvir 400 mg daily plus daclatasvir 60 mg daily. At baseline, liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using transient elastography (FibroScan®) is used to assess liver fibrosis and the single nucleotide polymorphism ofinterferon-λ 3 (IL-28, rs12979860, C or T) and IFLN4 (ss469415590, TT or ΔG) is determined. Serial measurement of plasma HCV RNA levels are performed with the use of the COBAS TaqMan real-time assay (Roche version 2.0), at baseline, Day 2,4 and 7, week 2,4 and 12, post-treatment week 12. The primary efficacy end point is a sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients chronically infected with HCV Genotype1b; 2. Documented evidence of relapse after completion of previous course of interferonbased regimen with or without ribavirin; 3. HCV RNA level greater than 10,000 IU/ml at screening; 4. Patients with compensated cirrhosis are permitted. 1. Current or prior history: Clinicallysignificant illness (other than HCV) or any other major medical disorder that may interfere with treatment, assessment or compliance with the protocol; individuals currently under evaluation for a potentially clinicallysignificant illness (other than HCV) are also excluded; 2. Screening ECG with clinically significant abnormalities; 3. Laboratory results outside of acceptable ranges at screening; 4. Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).</criteria>
