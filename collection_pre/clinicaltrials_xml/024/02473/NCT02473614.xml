	<brief_summary>We are trying to determine the therapeutic effect of the music glove and conventional hand exercise program to patients with spinal cord injuries. All participants will be randomized into two groups: AB and BA. They will all exercise at least 3 times a week for 3 weeks with a minimal 3 hours exercise time per week. Participants will receive the other intervention at their 3 week post therapy follow up visits. Clinical evaluations will be performed at baseline 1 and 2 (3 to 10 days apart), post therapy after first intervention, 3-week post therapy follow up, post therapy after second intervention, and 3-week post second intervention follow up visits.</brief_summary>
