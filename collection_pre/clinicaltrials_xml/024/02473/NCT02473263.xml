	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether an aggressive strategy of severe sepsis patients since pre hospital care, including early antibiotics administration, hemodynamic optimization, and opotherapy when indicated, could reduce mortality</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Samu Save Sepsis: Early Goal Directed Therapy in Pre Hospital Care of Patients With Severe Sepsis and/or Septic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major prognostic factor in sepsis management is rapidity of treatments implementation. In 2001, Rivers observed a reduction in mortality through early hemodynamic optimization. In 2009, Arnold emphasizes that establishing more early antibiotic therapy allowed a further reduction of mortality. In France, pre hospital care is based on mobile intensive care unit (MICU) called SMUR. SMUR is consisting of a driver, a nurse and an emergency physician. Actually in France, management of severe septic syndrome (severe sepsis and septic shock) are not standardized and based on a "conventional" strategy at the discretion of the emergency physician. Antibiotics are given in only two cases: fulminans purpura and meningitis. Hemodynamic optimization is not a standard of care and no recommendation exist for hemodynamic targets. An "aggressive" strategy based on early antibiotics administration, hemodynamic optimization and opotherapy when required could be initiated by SMUR since first contact with the patient before hospital admission. We assume that an "aggressive" strategy initiated during the first 60 minutes of prehospital stage compared to "conventional" strategy could allow to reduce mortality in severe sepsis patients.</detailed_description>
