	<brief_title>Mivacurium Chloramine Muscle Relaxation Effect in Patients With Liver Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The liver is an important organ of the body to maintain life activities, material and energy metabolism, and the main organ of biotransformation and elimination of toxic substances and drugs, have many complex functions. Anesthetic drugs mostly through liver transformation and degradation.Liver cirrhosis, liver cancer patients due to abnormal liver dysfunction and liver metabolism, Most of the muscle relaxant prone to muscle relaxant accumulation and delayed recovery of patients with liver cirrhosis. Mivacurium is a new type of non depolarizing muscle relaxants，has the characteristics of rapid onset, short duration of action. Mivacurium can produce similar clinical effect of depolarizing muscle relaxant succinylcholine, and rapidly be blood Che catabolism, Without liver metabolism. It can either as a single vein for medicinal endotracheal intubation, or as maintain continuous intravenous auxiliary anesthesia drug , is a muscle relaxant to shorten the clinical anesthesia recovery period ideal.</detailed_description>
