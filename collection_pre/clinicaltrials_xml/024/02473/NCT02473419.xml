	<brief_title>Neurobiological Basis of Response to Vayarin in Adults With ADHD: an fMRI Study of Brain Activation Pre and Post Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators prior research suggests that effective non-stimulant treatments for ADHD act through key prefrontal regions that subserve inhibitory and executive functions, although different medications may achieve these effects via distinct mechanisms. The objective of this research is to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a face go/no-go task to test the prefrontal mechanism of action of the medical food Vayarin. Participants are not treated at the Icahn School of Medicine, but instead will be recruited from trials of Vayarin that are enrolling and treating participants at New York University and The Medical Research Network.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subjects eligible to enroll in the Vayarin clinical study according to screening visit will be asked to participate in the fMRI study. Must be willing and able to perform fMRI scanning Must maintain compliance to their trials' protocols preexisting medical or psychological condition that precludes scanning (e.g., claustrophobia, morbid obesity) implanted medical device (e.g., pacemaker) metal in the body that cannot be removed (e.g., braces) pregnancy concomitant use of antihypertensives or any other medications affecting the blood oxygenation leveldependent (BOLD) signal</criteria>
