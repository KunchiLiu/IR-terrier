	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to obtain skin spectroscopic data from two imaging systems. Comparison groups: - Skin Spect dermoscope - Spatially modulated quantitative spectrometer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Imaging System Between Spatially Modulated Quantitative Spectroscopy and Skin Spect Dermoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The researcher can compare the spectroscopic data from the two systems as well as the relative concentrations of melanin, oxy- and deoxy- hemoglobin calculated from the measurements. Skin Spect can measure larger area of skin, whereas Spatially modulated quantitative spectrometer is a point-based measurement.Therefore, larger nevi will require multiple Spatially modulated quantitative spectrometer measurements for comparison with corresponding sub-regions of the larger Skin Spect measurements. Only sub-regions of the image data from Skin Spect that match the locations Spatially modulated quantitative spectrometer acquired data will be used in this correlation study. This researcher ensure that the spectral data collected by the two instruments are collected from the same spatial locations, should lesion heterogeneity be present.</detailed_description>
