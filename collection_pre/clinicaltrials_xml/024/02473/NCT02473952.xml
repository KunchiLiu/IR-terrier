	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of IGIV-C in Symptomatic Subjects With Generalized Myasthenia Gravis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of IGIV-C in subjects with generalized myasthenia gravis (MG) on standard of care treatment at study entry in terms of improvement in MG symptoms as measured by the mean change in Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score from Baseline (Week 0) to Week 24 as compared to placebo. The safety objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IGIV-C loading dose of 2 g/kg followed by 7 maintenance dosages of 1 g/kg every 3 weeks through Week 21 in subjects with MG.</detailed_description>
