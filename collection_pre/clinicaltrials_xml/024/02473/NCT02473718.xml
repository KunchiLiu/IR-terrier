	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine if a protocol that assesses patients' daily fluid intake and output can decrease the overall amount of fluid patients receive during the first five days in the ICU. The study will also determine if decreasing overall fluids can decrease adverse events associated with mechanical ventilation, such as ventilator-associated pneumonias. The protocol will include daily ultrasounds and blood draws to evaluate fluid balance. Ultrasound will be used to measure changes in the diameter of the inferior vena cava with respiration.</brief_summary>
