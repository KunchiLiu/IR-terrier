	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Metformin in Association to Chemoradiotherapy for Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NEOMETRE is a randomized, double blind trial aiming to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of metformin in association to chemoradiotherapy for the preoperative treatment of locally advanced (T3-4N0M0 or TxN1-2M0) rectal carcinomas. Patients eligible for this study will be submitted to neoadjuvant 3D radiotherapy with 50,4 Gray (Gy) divided in 25 applications, in association to capecitabine, 825mg/m2 bid for five days every week. The participants will be randomized to daily metformin or placebo during the chemoradiotherapy period. The primary end-point is pathological complete response. The secondary end-points are recurrence-free survival (RFS), disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), local recurrence rate, overall response rate, sphincter preservation rate, quality of life (QoL) and toxicity.</detailed_description>
