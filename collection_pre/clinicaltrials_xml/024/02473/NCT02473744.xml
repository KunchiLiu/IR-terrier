	<brief_summary>- Background : Edema of lower extremities is a concern ranging from 19 % to 60% of palliative cancer patients. Lymphedema decreases mobility, induces pain, impacts daily activities, esthetic and behavior. Usual treatment is based on diuretics and physiotherapy but is often unsuccessful. In case of conventional treatment failure, in palliative care, subcutaneous drainage can be discussed with the patients. The technique is simple, easy to use but remains off the record. Since 2004, 23 cases were reported with various methods. All the cases reported were undertaken with various technical approaches and efficacy criteria. - Purpose : Investigator hypothesize that the subcutaneous drainage of edema (SDO) is effective in case of refractory lymphedema of the lower limbs in palliative care and leads to an improvement in QOL in terms of behavioral and autonomy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oedematous Lower Limb Subcutaneous Drainage in Palliative Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>• Abstract : In palliative care, lymphedema results from various associations of cancer, hypoalbuminemia, electrolytic disturbances or organ failure. The lymphatic circulation cannot be summarized by the Starling's equation and obstruction cannot explain everything. An interstitial hypothesis underlines the role of the lymphatic pump and edema volume can be a crucial point. The SDO, via the direct liquid removal, can restore the lymphatic pump function. This volumetric effect can explain the long time effect of the SDO and the large range of liquid amount reported in effective SDO. The superficial lymphatic system, in the superficial layer of derma, drains 80 % of lymph flow. In edema, the increased volume leads to the creation of subcutaneous interconnected lacunas. The subcutaneous site for drainage is justified. After topic anesthesia, three subcutaneous channels are created on the ankle's medial face of the edematous limbs and liquids are absorbed by pads. An additional drainage can be done on the external face of the thigh with liquid collecting bags in bedridden patients. The study includes clinical examination, total and segmental bioelectrical impedance measured at J0, J4 and on exit or at J7 at the latest and daily weight, umbilic abdominal perimeters and segmental circumferences and QOL evaluation before and after SDO. Bioelectrical impedance is collected from hand-foot, thigh root-foot and under patella calf - foot electrodes. Segmental circumferences are collected at thigh, calf and ankle points identified from bone relief distance.</detailed_description>
