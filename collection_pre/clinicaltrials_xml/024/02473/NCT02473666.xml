	<brief_title>Patient Blood Management - Use and Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At the University Hospital of Zurich, an in-house designed monitoring and feedback system was introduced which electronically registers each transfusion of any allogeneic blood product, be it red blood cells, plasma or platelets as well as corresponding laboratory data. Results are reported quarterly to Department heads. The investigator analyzes whether the introduction of this monitoring and feedback system as part of a patient blood management Program has a significant influence on use of allogeneic blood product transfusions and transfusion-related costs, without compromising patient outcome.</detailed_description>
