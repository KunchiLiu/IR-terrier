	<brief_summary>The study is a epidemiological, cross-sectional study in a mainly rural area of Denmark in Denmark. Life expectancy is shorter, morbidity is higher, and social problems more prevalent than in the urban areas of the country. The population study aims at examining complexities of environmental, hereditary, lifestyle, and social factors as determinants and predisposing factors for morbidity, health, and quality of life. The study will cover physical, mental, and social dimensions and examine family patterns and subgroups. The study will provide baseline information for later follow-up.</brief_summary>
