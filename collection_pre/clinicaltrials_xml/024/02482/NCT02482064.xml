	<brief_summary>Ten patients who had had maxillectomy will be assigned to two groups employing two types of 'temporary obturators. The obturators in the first group will be made from heat cure acrylic resin, whereas those in the second group from flexible resin. A comparison will be made between the two materials in terms of oral-nasal seal using the drinking water test as well as the mirror test.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Flexible Resin in Maxillary Obturators</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oral rehabilitation following partial maxillectomy presents numerous clinical and technical issues. Using soft-tissue undercuts in the palatal side of the upper jaw is so useful for prostheses' retention over and above the abutment teeth. The use of flexible materials can serve this aim. The current study aims to compare the efficacy of nasal-oral seal using flexible materials against the traditional method of using heat activated acrylic materials.</detailed_description>
