	<brief_summary>This study is a phase 1 open-label dose escalation study of the immuno-activating monoclonal antibody APX005M in adults with solid tumors. Study is intended to establish the maximum tolerated dose and the overall safety and tolerability of APX005M.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the CD40 Agonistic Monoclonal Antibody APX005M</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>APX005M-001 is an open-label study and comprises a dose-escalation portion of approximately 8 dose level cohorts, plus an expansion cohort. Eligible subjects with solid tumors will receive intravenous APX005M every 3 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or death, whichever occurs first. Study objectives include: - Evaluate safety of APX005M - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of APX005M - Determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of APX005M: the maximal drug concentration (Cmax), area under the curve of serum concentration over time (Area Under the Curve/ AUC), and half-life (tÂ½). - Preliminary assessment of clinical response</detailed_description>
