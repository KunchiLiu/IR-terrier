	<brief_title>Moving Forward: A Weight Loss Intervention for African-American Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized study with 300 African American (AA) breast cancer survivors to be conducted in Chicago Park District (CPD) facilities. The study will be based in six predominantly AA communities in Chicago (Roseland, Pullman, Englewood, Chatham, Austin, South Shore, Woodlawn, Calumet Heights, North Lawndale and Grand Crossing). These communities have at least one CPD fitness center, have populations that are at least 90% or more AA and have similar socioeconomic statuses. Fifty AA breast cancer survivors will be recruited from each community (25 treatment/ 25 control). The Moving Forward intervention integrates concepts from Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) and the Socio-Ecological Model (SEM) to promote independent behavior change. SCT suggests that behavior can be explained by the dynamic interaction between behavior, personal factors (e.g., self-efficacy), and the environment (e.g, social support). Self-efficacy is a person's confidence in performing a particular behavior and overcoming barriers to that behavior. A number of studies have supported the mediating role of self-efficacy in making independent health behavior changes. The overall goal of Moving Forward is to make independent changes in health behaviors to promote a healthy weight. The weight loss goal will be consistent with the recommendations of an expert panel at National Institutes of Health (NIH). Dietary goals aimed at producing weight loss, decreasing BC recurrence risk, and improving overall health include 1) a decrease in daily caloric intake (based on weight in pounds X 12 kcal/day with 500-750 calories subtracted to create an energy deficit); 2) a decrease in dietary fat consumption to 20% of total calories; 3) an increase in fruit and vegetable consumption to 7 daily servings; and 4) an increase in fiber to 25 grams per day. For exercise, participants will gradually increase their activity to a minimum of 180 minutes per week at 55-65% maximal heart rate.</detailed_description>
