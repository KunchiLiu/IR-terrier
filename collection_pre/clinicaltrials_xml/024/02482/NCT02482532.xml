	<brief_title>Vaccine Enriched, Autologous, Activated T-Cells Directed to Tumor in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rate of progression free survival at one (1) year is &lt; 20% for patients with stage IV metastatic melanoma, despite aggressive cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens and newly approved immunomodulatory and targeted therapy. Immunotherapy seems to hold the most promise for achieving prolonged survival or even cure, therefore,efforts have focused on several different approaches. Such approaches have used tumor vaccination, adoptive transfer of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and even monoclonal antibodies, unconjugated or conjugated to cytokines, toxins, or radionucleotides. The tumor-associated antigen GD2 has been noted on the surface of several tumors, most notably neuroblastoma, but is expressed on melanoma as well. Clinical studies have shown activity of a GD2-specific chimeric T-cell receptor expressed on activated, autologous, T-cells in patients with neuroblastoma. It is the investigators intention to enrich peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with stage IV metastatic melanoma with vaccine-specific T-cells through pre-harvest/ phlebotomy vaccination with common, well understood vaccines. The investigators will then modify the T-cells to attack the GD2 antigen. These tumor redirected, vaccine specific, activated T-cells will then be infused into the patient following revaccination with the common vaccines. The Investigators will monitor expansion of the modified T-cells through serial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays following vaccination. The Investigators then intend to re-vaccinate with the selected vaccines one month following infusion and monitor for expansion of the modified T-cells.</detailed_description>
