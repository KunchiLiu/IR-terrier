	<brief_title>Prognosis and Long Term Pubertal Outcome of Girls Previously Diagnosed With a Prenatal Ovarian Cyst</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prenatal diagnosis of ovarian cysts is a common disease with an estimated incidence of 1 case per 2500 births. This pathology is the first diagnosis of abdominal cystic picture on the female fetus in the third trimester of pregnancy.Various complications of ovarian cysts have been described, such as ovarian torsion, breaking the cyst, hemorrhage intra cystic and compression of adjacent viscera. A conservative attitude for uncomplicated cysts is proposed in the literature but surgical care and / or puncture can be made to prevent the occurrence of complications and thus to protect ovarian tissue.However, no data on puberty and long-term ovarian prognosis in this disease is published in the literature. Without this information, no support for the recommendation of a prenatal ovarian cyst can be established formally.</detailed_description>
