	<brief_summary>The LFX453X2202 study will test the investigational drug LFX453 against placebo for safety, tolerability, and efficacy in treating genital warts in circumcised men, in parallel with an additional open label arm using imiquimod 5%. During the study the patients will receive either LFX453, placebo or active comparator and the tolerability and safety will be assessed continuously through local tolerability assessments and adverse event recording. Efficacy will be clinical evaluations and lesion count. During the study biopsies will be taken for analysis of pharmacokinetics and biomarkers. Blood samples will be taken for safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and biomarkers.</brief_summary>
