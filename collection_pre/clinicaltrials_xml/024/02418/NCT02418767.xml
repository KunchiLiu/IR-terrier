	<brief_summary>The study is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, single-dose, three dose levels study in healthy Caucasian and Japanese male volunteers. Following a 4-week screening period, eligible male subjects will be stratified by ethnic group and will be randomized to one of six groups. On dosing day, designated as Day 1, each subject will receive single SC injection of study medication according to group allocation and will be followed up for a month for safety monitoring.</brief_summary>

Subjects in generally good health in the opinion of the investigator as determined by medical history, vital signs and a physical examination. 4. Blood pressure and heart rate within normal limits. 5. Electrocardiogram (ECG) with no clinically significant abnormalities recorded at screening visit (up to 28 days before dosing) and on dosing day (before drug administration). 6. Negative HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C serology tests at screening 7. No clinically significant abnormalities in complete blood count (CBC), international normalized ratio (INR), chemistry lab tests (liver and renal function) and urinalysis at screening. 8. No history of alcohol or drug abuse within 1 year of screening. Negative urine drugsofabuse (DOA) in screening and on admission. Negative breath alcohol on admission. 9. Subjects must agree to use medically accepted form of contraception from dosing day to 12 weeks after drug administration. 10. Subjects must be able to understand the requirements of the study and must be willing to comply with the requirements of the study and to provide their written informed consent to participate in the study. 1. History of significant neurological (including history of seizures or EEG abnormalities), renal, cardiovascular (including known structural cardiac abnormalities or hypertension), respiratory (asthma), endocrinological, gastrointestinal, hematopoietic disease, neoplasm, psychological (marked anxiety, tension or agitation) or any other clinically significant medical disorder, which in the investigator's judgment contraindicate administration of the study medication. 2. Known allergy to growth hormone or any constituents or ingredients or components in the vehicle. 3.

Use of any prescription or overthecounter (OTC) medications, including vitamins and herbal or dietary supplements within 14 days prior to dosing. Brief use of OTC medications for symptomatic relief of pain until 24 hours prior to and 48 hours after the study drug administration may be allowed per the discretion of the medical monitor. 5. Subjects who have received any vaccines within 4 weeks prior to study drug administration. 6. Subjects who donated blood or received blood or plasma derivatives in the one month preceding signing of consent form. 7. Systemic corticosteroids other than in replacement doses within the 3 months before study entry (temporary adjustment of glucocorticoids, as appropriate, is acceptable) 8. Anabolic steroids other than gonadal steroid replacement therapy within 2 months before study entry 9. Participation in another clinical trial with drugs within one month of signing of consent form (calculated from the previous study's last dosing date). 10. Subjects with an inability to communicate well with the investigators and clinic staff [i.e., language problem (except Japanese speakers), poor mental development or impaired cerebral function]. 11. Subjects with any acute medical situation (e.g. acute infection) within 48 hours of study start, which is considered of significance by the Principal Investigator. Use of investigational products (within 30 days of screening visit).</criteria>
