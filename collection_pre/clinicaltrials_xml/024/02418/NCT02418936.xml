	<brief_title>Development and Clinical Application of Two New Genetic Deafness Gene Diagnostic Kit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. For the pathogenic gene of Waardenburg syndrome and large vestibular aqueduct syndrome, based on the second-generation sequencing technology, the investigators develop multiplex PCR system for these two hereditary deafness gene diagnostic kit. 2. Using CNVplex high-throughput gene copy number detection technology to analyse Warrdenburg syndrome pathologic gene. CNVs analysis for Warrdenburg deafness syndrome develop special testing system / kit achieve SNP / CNVs detected simultaneously, as a supplementary means of genetic testing in clinical deafness.</detailed_description>
