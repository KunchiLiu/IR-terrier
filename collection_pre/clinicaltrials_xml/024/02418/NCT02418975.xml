	<brief_summary>Pre-operative weight loss can reduce the risk intra- and post-operative complications but no optimal pre-operative weight loss strategy has been investigated. Very-low-calorie diets (VLCDs) were proven to results in higher metabolic improvements in the short-term than balanced, hypocaloric diets. Therefore, the aim of the study is to investigate whether a VLCD results in lower intra-and post-operative complications compared to a hypocaloric diet. However, to achieve a optimal compliance in patients having experienced multiple dietary intervention failures, administration of the intervention will be performed by the enteral route using a naso-gastric feeding tube.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bariatric surgery is an important treatment strategy for obese patients having failed multiple diet-induced weight loss attempts. On the other hand, severly obese patients have also a high risk of both intra- and post-operative complications. Pre-operative weight loss can reduce these risks but no optimal pre-operative weight loss strategy has been investigated. Very-low-calorie diets (VLCDs) were proven to results in higher metabolic improvements in the short-term than balanced, hypocaloric diets. Therefore, the aim of the study is to investigate whether a VLCD results in lower intra-and post-operative complications compared to a hypocaloric diet. However, to achieve a optimal compliance in patients having experienced multiple dietary intervention failures, administration of the intervention will be performed by the enteral route using a naso-gastric feeding tube.</detailed_description>
