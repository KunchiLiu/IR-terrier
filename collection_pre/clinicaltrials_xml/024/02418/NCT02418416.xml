	<brief_title>Novel Approach With Double Agent Artificial Oocyte Activation for Repeated Fertilization Failure Due to Combined Sperm and Oocyte Factor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In some cases undergoes assisted reproduction technique specially Intracytoplasmic sperm injection, in subgroup of patient they fail to fertilize or poorly fertilized, some authors recommend chemical activation for those group of patient with Ca ionophore but still with Ca ionophore there are some cases with total fertilization failure or low fertilization specially in those patient with 2 separate factors like teratozoospermia with poor quality Oocytes so the investigators decided to test the effect of double activation methods by using tow agents proven with life birth rate Ca ionophore and strontium chloride. We Do intracytoplasmic sperm injection and immediately activate oocyte with Ca Ionophore followed by strontium chloride activation and monitoring the embryogenesis until the blastocyst formation and pregnancy outcome in multicenter assessment.</detailed_description>
