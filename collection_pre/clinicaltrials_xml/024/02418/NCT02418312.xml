	<brief_title>Efficacy of H2 Receptor Antagonist in Prevention of Thienopyridine-related Peptic Ulcer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the prospective, randomized study is investigate the efficacy of H2 receptor antagonist in prevention of thienopyridine-related peptic ulcer and gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with an ulcer history. We plan to enroll 236 thienopyridine (clopidogrel or ticlopidine) users with a peptic ulcer history who don't have baseline gastroduodenal ulcers at initial endoscopy . The patients will be randomly assigned to receive either (1) famotidine (40 mg qd) plus thienopyridine used previously or (2) placebo plus thienopyridine treatment alone for 6 months. The ulcer recurrence rate between the treatment gruops will be compared.</detailed_description>
