	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To develop an Anal Cancer/HSIL Outcomes Research Study (ANCHOR) high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) health-related quality of life (HRQoL) Index (HQI) using state-of-the-art measure development methodology that captures the most important HRQoL symptoms and concerns of those persons diagnosed with anal HSIL and either treated or untreated for anal HSIL. OUTLINE: Participants complete the ANCHOR HSIL HRQoL interview over 45-60 minutes, comparing the list of symptoms, concerns, or HRQOL impacts related to HSIL diagnosis and treatment.
