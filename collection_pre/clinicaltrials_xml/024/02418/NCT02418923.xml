	<detailed_description>HemoSonics is developing a novel POC diagnostic device, the Quantra System, to perform whole blood coagulation analysis and which is suitable for use in surgical and intensive care settings. The Quantra System employs a patented technology named sonorheometry, which was invented at the University of Virginia. Sonorheometry uses ultrasound pulses to characterize the dynamic changes in viscoelastic properties of a blood sample during coagulation and clot lysis. The initial assay performed on the Quantra System will be the surgical assay for monitoring hemostasis during major surgical procedures in adult patients. A clinical study will be conducted to evaluate the analytical performance as well as compared to existing coagulation monitoring technology</detailed_description>
