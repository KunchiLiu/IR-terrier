	<brief_summary>Cesarean section rates continue to increase worldwide, particularly in middle- and high-income countries. In France, the rate has now stabilized around 20 %. Cesarean section is a particular way of giving birth, sometimes desired, but sometimes feared. If some women do not feel affected by this way of giving birth, it is more difficult for others to live with. In this way, not being able to give birth trough natural way may be disturbing in motherhood. At La Rochelle hospital, more than 230 healthcare providers have been trained according to Erickson's hypnosis methodology. Among them, 40 are part of the anesthesia department and a committee oversees the hypnotherapist activities in pain management. The objective of the present study is to assess the benefit of hypnosis session for improving experience and reducing anxiety in women giving birth through surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Nonpharmacological approaches for pain management, either as a primary method or as a complement to pharmacological approaches, are suggested for a better perinatal management. The investigators assessed the use of conversational hypnotic induction and therapeutic suggestions during cesarean section as a complement to pharmacological strategy. Women giving birth through scheduled or unplanned cesarean section and who accepted hypnotherapy session were compared to a control group.</detailed_description>
