	<brief_summary>Current standard of care is no pretreatment medications before the egg retrieval, and the investigators would like to evaluate if preoperative Tylenol improves procedure and post procedure pain control over the current practice (no pre-treatment). Specifically, this study will compare Tylenol with a placebo when given before retrieval procedures. The investigators believe that if Tylenol can offer better analgesic relief than no pretreatment medications, then it may reduce the amount of narcotics needed by patients during and after the procedure and contribute to better patient satisfaction. . This study will enroll 100 participants all from UAB.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Trial of Oral Acetaminophen for Analgesic Control After Transvaginal Oocyte Retrieval</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current standard of care for oocyte retrieval in IVF involves fentanyl, propofol, as well as oxycodone. However, there exists little data of alternatives to narcotic medications for analgesic purposes in oocyte retrieval procedures. A retrospective study published in 2013 showed potential for NSAID's, specifically ketorolac, to significantly improve pain scores in women undergoing oocyte retrieval (Mesen et al). It was also shown that the use of these medications did not significantly alter pregnancy rate, live birth rate, or miscarriage rate in these patients. Few other studies have delved into the question of anesthetics for oocyte retrievals except a prospective study in 2006. This study, performed by Akande et al, shows that no significant difference in pregnancy rates of implantation occurs with the use of acetaminophen and diclofenac vs. acetaminophen alone if given post-operatively. However, pain was not measured in this study for either group. Therefore, it is clear that there exists limited data on the subject of analgesics used in oocyte retrievals for in vitro fertilization and that more exploration into alternative medications is required to find the most effective and least harmful option.</detailed_description>
