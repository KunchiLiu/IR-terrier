	<brief_title>Head Position for Endotracheal Intubation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The neck flexion using a 8 to 10 cm head elevation has been suggested to align laryngeal, pharyngeal and oral axes and facilitate endotracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy. There have been scarce clinical studies about the appropriate degree of neck flexion for endotracheal intubation. In the present study, the laryngeal view and physician's discomfort during endotracheal intubation were evaluated according to the two degrees of neck flexion(4 cm vs 8 cm) using a 4 or 8 cm height of pillows, respectively, in adult patients.</detailed_description>
