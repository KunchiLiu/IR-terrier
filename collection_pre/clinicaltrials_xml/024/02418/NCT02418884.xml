	<brief_summary>This study is designed to validate the hypothesis that the treatment of rosuvastatin could increase the score of Calcification of Coronary artery(CAC) density in coronary artery disease(CAD) patients with diabetes mellitus.CAD patients with diabetes who confirmed CAC will receive rosuvastatin (20mg/d) therapy for 24 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact of Rosuvastatin on the Density Score of Coronary Artery Calcification in CAD Patients With Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Calcification of atherosclerotic plaque is a complicated and organic active process, which is one of the main pathologic features of atherosclerosis. Widely coverage of CAC is correlated with the greater likelihood of coronary events.With the increasing density of CAC, the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) declines.Some studies showed that the calcified plaque in stable CHD is denser. Statins are widely used in the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Treatment of statins may increase the density score of CAC, thus, promote the unstable atherosclerotic plaque to the stable plaque.</detailed_description>
