	<brief_summary>This study aims to carry out a safety evaluation of human cord blood and frozen plasma as treatment for pre-frailty , to assess whether the treatment can prevent and improve the aging process, and to identify useful clinical markers of frailty. The study is a randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled pilot clinical Trial conducted at CHA clinical trial institute.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Potential Efficacy and Safety of Human Umbilical Cord Blood and Plasma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Assessment criteria for the study include (1) clinical indicators-weight loss, a decrease in physical activity, weak grip strength, depression; (2) Short Physical Performance Battery(SPPB); (3) SF-36; (4)cardiac output; (4)biomarkers for oxidative stress, inflammation and immune response; (5) methylation; (6) mitochondria DNA copy number; (7) growth factors; (8) antioxidant capacity; (9) hormone assay; (10) genome assay; (11) metabolite; (12) safety of intravenous administration. Participants will be randomly assigned to three experimental groups and one control group in a ratio of 1:1:1:1. At second visit, the participants will be administered with experimental and placebo agents. Follow-up visits are expected to be at 7 days, 1 and 6 months after the first treatment. Sixth visit is the completion of it. Primary end points are defined as severe clinical abnormalities, which could be observed until 1 month after administration of blood-derived products, including death, pulmonary embolism, stroke, respiratory stress and hospitalization due to abnormal findings in laboratory tests.</detailed_description>
