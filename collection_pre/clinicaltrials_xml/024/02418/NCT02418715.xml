	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of water-based exercises on lipid profile (LP) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) levels in premenopausal dyslipidemic women. It was hypothesized that a water-based aerobic interval-training period would decrease plasma concentrations of atherogenic lipoproteins and concomitantly increase HDL and LPL levels, as well as maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) values.</brief_summary>
