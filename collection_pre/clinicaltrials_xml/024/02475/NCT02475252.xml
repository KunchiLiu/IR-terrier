	<brief_summary>In a prospective case-control study, the investigators compare the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) scores in medical students and gynecologic experts performing a hysteroscopy on a training model for diagnostic hysteroscopy. The investigators hypothesize that OSATS on a hysteroscopy training model has construct validity to discriminate between experts and novices.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Construct Validity of a Diagnostic Hysteroscopy Training Model</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a prospective case-control study, 140 medical students (,novices') and 10 senior gynecologists (,experts') will watch a demonstration detailing how to perform a hysteroscopy on a training model. All probands will perform a hysteroscopy themselves within 1 hour after the demonstration. Their performance will be judged using an Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) assessment. Using metrical and non-metrical measurements, construct validity of the hysteroscopy training model to distinguish between experts and novices will be assessed. Secondary endpoints are differences in OSATS scores within the group of novices based on gender and handyness, as well as satisfaction of the novices with the learning experience.</detailed_description>
