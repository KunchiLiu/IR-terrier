	<brief_summary>Despite the large therapeutic arsenal available since one decade allowing a strong reduction of inflammation process, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients claimed pain, fatigue, sleep problems and other quality of life outcomes. Fatigue reduction during TNF blockers therapy is lower than the strong reduction in RA disease activity. Furthermore, RA patients have higher prevalence of non-inflammatory pain than general population. Fatigue is a real major problem due to 50% of patients considered it as severe. This dissociation between disease activity and fatigue level suggests that fatigue is multifactorial. No consistent explanations for fatigue are currently available.</brief_summary>
