	<brief_title>Hyperglucagonaemia in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes - Role of Glucagon Clearance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the present project we wish to identify whether the elimination and degradation of glucagon differ between healthy control subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, we wish to examine whether obesity is an independent factor for altered glucagon metabolism. Thus, by examining glucagon elimination in obese subjects with and without type 2 diabetes and in lean subjects with and without type 2 diabetes we will be able to describe the metabolic clearance rate (MCR) of glucagon in a broad spectrum of individuals with different levels of insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction.</detailed_description>
