	<brief_summary>This study will assess the safety and efficacy of IdeS in the transplantation setting. Each patient will receive one dose of IdeS. If the crossmatch test is negative at the time of transplantation, the patient will be transplanted with a kidney from a deceased or living donor. The starting dose will be 0.25 mg/kg BW, given as a single intravenous infusion prior to surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Efficacy and PK of IdeS in Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will assess the safety and efficacy of the IgG degrading cysteine protease IdeS in the transplantation setting. Patients with DSAs will be treated with IdeS prior to transplantation. Each patient will receive one dose of IdeS. If the crossmatch test is negative after IdeS treatment, the patient will be transplanted with a kidney from a deceased or living donor. Two to four dose groups are planned. Each group will contain 2 patients with the possibility to extend the group to up to 4 patients per group if required for safety and/or efficacy evaluation. The starting dose will be 0.25 mg/kg BW, given as a single intravenous infusion prior to surgery with the possibility to increase the dose in higher dose groups.</detailed_description>
