	<detailed_description>The participants will complete a series of balance assessments with a licensed physical (PT) or occupational therapist (OT) or qualified research assistant (RA) at Blue Marble Game Co or in their respective homes at the start of the study, at cross over and upon completion of the study. During this study a PT, OT, or RA trained in fall risk management will supervise the instruction and practice by participants of the home exercise programs during the initial 2-3 hour introduction to the study activities. Participants will be asked to exercise 3/week for one month then crossover to the alternative exercise program and exercise 3/week for a second month. The PT, OT, or RA will determine that the participant is competent to perform the home exercise programs safely, with no more than a normal risk of falls or withdraw the participant from the study. The participant's score on the standard version of the Falls Risk Questionnaire, Single Leg Stance Test, and Chair Rise Test will be recorded and stored on a password protected computer in a locked office. Once the data has been stored electronically, paper data collection sheets will be placed in a confidential bin for shredding. Exercise Data will be captured using a) the Health In Motion software via the Kinect Sensor and stored on the Blue Marble secure server and b) via a daily exercise log provided to the participant in paper form.</detailed_description>
