	<brief_title>A Study to Investigate the Effect of Increased Gastric pH on the Oral Bioavailability of the Orexin-2 Receptor Antagonist JNJ-42847922 in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, single-center, fixed-sequence study designed to assess the effects of multiple oral administration of rabeprazole (a PPI) on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of JNJ-42847922 in healthy participants. The study consists of 3 phases: a Screening Phase of approximately 4 weeks (Days -29 to -2); an Open Label Treatment Phase (Days -1 to 7); and an End-of-Study Phase occurring from 7 to 14 days after the last dose of study drug. All participants will receive JNJ-42847922, orally on Day 1 (alone) and Day 6 (along with rabeprazole).Rabeprazole will be administered orally on Day 2 to Day 6. Pharmacokinetics will primarily be for JNJ-42847922, M12 metabolite and M16 metabolite. Participant's safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
