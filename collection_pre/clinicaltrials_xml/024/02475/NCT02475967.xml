	<brief_title>Study Assessing the Effectiveness of a Cardiac Web-based eLearning Platform</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients participating in the trial will be provided with a cardiac web-based eLearning platform for one month during study period. The medical content of the packages will be gathered from a multidisciplinary input of both medics (e.g. cardiologists) and paramedics (e.g. psychologists). E-Learning packages type I: videos with information from caregivers. In these videos, medics and paramedics are interviewed to highlight the etiology, pathophysiology and treatment of coronary artery disease; the associated comorbidities and the ways to prevent recurrence. E-Learning packages type II: videos in which patients are interviewed. Patients can help each other to adhere to their treatment plan, by sharing stories from their own experience about their illness and the rehabilitation afterwards. Short clips of maximum 2 minutes will be provided to study participants.</detailed_description>
