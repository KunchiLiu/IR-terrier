	<brief_summary>Fifteen women with recurrent ovarian cancer will be treated by an intraperitoneal chemotherapy with cisplatin and doxorubicin in three escalating dosage schedules. The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of doxorubicin and cisplatin every 4 weeks for three courses using a three-group, dose-escalation protocol with fixed dose-density. The time Frame for the assessment of the Primary outcome is therefore 12 weeks. Predefined toxicity criteria will be applied using CTCAE version 4.0 criteria. The study hypothesis is that local and systemic toxicity will increase with increasing dosage of cisplatin and doxorubicin during three repeated PIPAC courses with no CTCAE grade 4 and 5 events in any treatment group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study With Intraperitoneal Cisplatin and Doxorubicin in Recurrent Ovarian Cancer and Peritoneal Carcinomatosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective phase I, single-arm (nonrandomized), open-label, three step dose-escalation study with cisplatin and doxorubicin applied as PIPAC in 15 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer and peritoneal cancer. The first 5 patients will receive doxorubicin 1.5 mg/m2 body surface in 50 ml NaCl 0,9% and cisplatin 7.5 mg/m2 in 50 ml NaCl 0,9% q 4 weeks for three courses. The next 5 patients will receive doxorubicin 2.25 mg/m2 body surface in 50 ml NaCl 0,9% and cisplatin 11.25 mg/m2 in 50 ml NaCl 0,9% q 4 weeks for three courses. The next 5 patients will receive doxorubicin 3 mg/m2 body surface in 50 ml NaCl 0,9% and cisplatin 15 mg/m2 in 50 ml NaCl 0,9% q 4 weeks for three courses. This schedule represents a three-step, 50% dose-escalation. Dose density will not be changed. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of doxorubicin and cisplatin every 4-6 weeks for three courses using a three-group, dose-escalation protocol with fixed dose-density. The time Frame for the assessment of the Primary outcome is therefore 12 weeks. Predefined toxicity criteria will be applied using CTCAE version 4.0 criteria, documented after the first, second, and third course of treatment. Clinical examinations will include abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans after the first, second, and third course of treatment, cardiac echocardiography before the first, second, and third course of treatment, and a clinical neurological assessment before the first, second, and third course of treatment. Pharmacological studies will include hematologic, liver, and renal function tests as well as cisplatin and doxorubicin plasma levels with blood samples drawn before, during, and up to 12 h after the start of each PIPAC course.</detailed_description>
