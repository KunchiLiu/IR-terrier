	<brief_title>Oral Nutritional Supplement in Reducing Surgical Site Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgical incisions are associated with a number of possible complications. The reported incidence of surgical site infections at the groin after vascular procedures is between 3% and 30%. This incidence is up to five times higher than the expected incidence of infection in clean cases. Risk factors for postoperative surgical site infection in patients undergoing vascular surgery may include age, co-morbidities, use of prosthetic grafts and repeat operations. A systematic review in 2011 concluded that arginine supplemented diets among perioperative patients were associated with a reduced rate of surgical infection and reduced overall length of hospital stay. The study aims are to determine if taking an oral nutritional supplement reduces the rate of wound complications post lower limb revascularization.</detailed_description>
