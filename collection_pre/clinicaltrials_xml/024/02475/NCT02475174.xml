	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD) massage in arterial and venous circulation of the upper limb ipsilateral of women submitted after axillary lymphadenectomy breast cancer. Will be evaluated 30 volunteers aged between 40 and 60 years, divided into 2 equal groups, submitted at MLD: Group 1 - volunteers who underwent surgery for breast cancer that have lymphedema, subject to manual lymphatic drainage without upper limb elevation; Group 2 - volunteers who underwent surgery for breast cancer that have lymphedema, subject to manual lymphatic drainage with the upper limb elevation to 30º. Data will be collected by ultrasound Doppler in vein and brachial artery before, after MLD, immediately after, and 30 minutes after therapeutic treatment, with and without elevation of 30°, cross over delimitation, being made a therapy session for therapeutic use with and without elevation, with interval period (washout) for seven days. The order of treatment protocols will be randomized by simple raffle for each volunteer. The data within and between groups will be evaluated by a statistical test t student or ANOVA. Otherwise it will be used Kruskal-Wallis followed test by Dunn. Data processing will be performed by software and fixed the critical level of 5% (p&lt;0,05).</detailed_description>
