	<brief_title>Vildagliptin Versus Dapagliflozin on Glucagon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to assess if vildagliptin and dapagliflozin have dissociated effects on glucagon secretion after a mixed meal ingestion in metformin-treated subjects with type 2 diabetes and whether this is associated with effects on glucose homeostasis. Subjects will therefore be treated with vildagliptin or dapagliflozin as add-on to metformin for two weeks followed by a meal test in which glucagon levels will be determined.</detailed_description>
