	<brief_summary>Incontinence is a widespread problem in all health care setting. One of the main complications of incontinence is inflammation of the skin in the genital and anal region, also known as incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD). IAD is a known risk factor of pressure ulcer development. Prevalence figures of IAD vary between 5.6% and 50%. The primary aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a 3-in-1 genital wipe versus standard care (traditional water and soap) for the prevention of IAD. The second aim is to perform a health economic evaluation of the 3-in-1 genital wipe versus standard care, and third to compare the cost of a 2-in-1 total body wash wipe versus standard care for total body wash. Other outcomes are the comfort and tolerance of both the nurses and participants. In this Randomized Controlled Trial, performed in 13 long-term care settings, the participants will undergo a 30 day study period. In the experimental intervention, the participants will be washed with body wash wipes and genital wipes. In the control group, the subjects will receive traditional care. IAD as well as Pressure Ulcer prevalence will be monitored. Subjective and objective time measurements will be performed.</brief_summary>
