	<brief_title>Partner Involvement During Pregnancy and Its Association With Maternal Health Behaviors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Paternal support is related to positive pregnancy outcomes. We explored the relationship between paternal involvement and maternal smoking and alcohol consumption during pregnancy. This was an IRB-approved cross sectional study. Pregnant women between the ages of 18 - 44 years old and their partners were surveyed in the outpatient OB/GYN offices of Thomas Jefferson University. Women who identified their partner as their main support were included. Demographic and health information was collected. A composite support score for each woman was generated from a modified version of the Norbeck Social Support Questionnaire (NSSQ) on a scale from 5 - 35. Support scores were evaluated with women's current smoking and drinking status using ANOVA and Student's t-test.</detailed_description>
