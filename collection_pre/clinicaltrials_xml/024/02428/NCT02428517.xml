	<brief_summary>This study is a prospective multicenter observational study to evaluate the feasibility and the efficacy of the conditioning regimens which are modified by the donor differences and the age of recipients among patients who will receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in their 1st or 2nd hematologic complete remission (CR).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (2015)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (AlloHCT) is recommended as a post-remission therapy for patients with adult ALL, and reduced intensity conditioning has been tried to decrease treatment-related mortality (TRM) rate. Recent results showed that reduced intensity conditioning can be safely and effectively used for alloHCT of adult patients with ALL. However, the reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) can increase the possibilities of hematologic relapse, especially due to the reduced anti-leukemic effect. Another challenge in performing alloHCT for ALL is the donor availability - the limited availability of matched sibling donor (MSD) and well-matched unrelated donor (WMUD) forces us to find the feasibility of alternative donors such as partially-matched unrelated donor (PMUD) or haploidentical familial donor (familial mismatched donor, FMD). The previous study (NCT0137764) which the investigators performed showed that the use of RIC and alternative donor was feasible. However, the incidence of relapse was slightly higher among patients who received RIC when the investigators analyzed the interim analysis results. Especially, the graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) incidence was relatively higher among patients who received alloHCT from MSD, and the investigators think that the addition of antithymocyte globulin will reduce the incidence of GVHD for these patients. In this study, the dose of busulfan will be increased when the recipients are below 55 years old, irrespective of donor type. The investigators will also define the partially matched donor exactly and find the feasibility of PMUD and FMD again. Another endpoint for this study is to find out whether the addition of antithymocyte globulin may be helpful in preventing the GVHD incidence for patients who received alloHCT from MSD without increasing the chance of hematologic relapse.</detailed_description>
