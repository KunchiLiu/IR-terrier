	<brief_summary>Influenza virus accounts for numerous cases (epidemics) of respiratory illnesses each year worldwide and affects people of all ages. These epidemics typically occur in the winter months, and can result in substantial morbidity and mortality in persons at risk. Pregnant women may be more susceptible to morbidity and mortality associated with influenza infection. This increased risk may result from several factors including increased heart rate, stroke volume, and oxygen consumption, decreased lung capacity, and changes in immunologic function. Immunization of women during pregnancy can help to prevent infection in the woman herself and may also offer protection to the infant in two ways: by the passage of antibodies from mother to the fetus during pregnancy, and by preventing infection in the mother and therefore decreasing the infant's exposure risk after birth. In Canada, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends the vaccine for pregnant women who are expected to deliver during influenza season because they will become household contacts of their newborn. Ideal timing of vaccination occurs in October or November since influenza outbreaks typically occur throughout the winter months. Despite the Canadian and American guidelines for influenza vaccination during pregnancy, it is unclear how many women are offered and/or actually receive the vaccine while pregnant. There is, however, evidence that women will accept the vaccine if offered. Specifically, in the Women's Health Care Centre at St. Michael's Hospital, it was found that 42% of women not only accepted but also received the influenza vaccination when offered. Innovative techniques will be required to continue to increase vaccination rates among vulnerable populations, including pregnant women. The purpose of the present study is to determine if the use of electronic reminders (text messages) increases the likelihood of receiving the influenza vaccine among pregnant women.</brief_summary>
