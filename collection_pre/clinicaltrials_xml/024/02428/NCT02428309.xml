	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this Phase 1 study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and effect of 3 different doses of Treg therapy in adults with skin (cutaneous) involvement of their lupus. Targeting cutaneous disease offers the ability to control background therapy, readily detect clinical effects, and perform research analyses not only in blood but also skin. Safety, disease activity, and mechanism of Tregs will be evaluated. The intent is to support dose selection for a future larger efficacy trial in lupus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Polyclonal Tregs for Lupus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigational therapy in this trial, regulatory T cells (Tregs), is evaluating an alternative to traditional immunosuppressive therapies for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, lupus). Too frequently, aggressive therapies are inadequate in the control of the disease and have potent side effects and complications. The collection and expansion of one's own T cells harnesses a naturally occurring regulatory mechanism to restore self-tolerance in people with lupus. Tregs are a specialized subset of T cells that function to control the immune response. Studies have shown that in active lupus, the numbers and function of Treg cells are significantly decreased, which contributes to an overactive immune system and an increase in disease activity. The hope is that these naturally occurring Treg cells can be used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including lupus.</detailed_description>
