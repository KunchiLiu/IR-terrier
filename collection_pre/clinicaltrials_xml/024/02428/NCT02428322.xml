	<brief_summary>Epidemiological and observational studies have linked vitamin D deficiency with increased asthma/allergy incidence . Vitamin D insufficiency (&lt;75nmol/L) has been associated with increased incidence of severe childhood asthma. Further, high 25(OH)D levels were associated with reduced risk of recent hospitalization, lower use of anti-asthmatic medication and lower airway hyper-responsiveness in childhood asthmatics. The association between vitamin D and allergy and asthma appears to be stronger in children than adults, with some even suggesting that childhood asthma may may be caused by VDD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Vitamin D3 Supplementation in Paediatric Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthmatic children will be recruited in winter. After baseline testing, children will be randomized to take 2,000iu vitamin D or placebo daily for 15 weeks. After the 15 weeks, testing will be repeated. Tests involve blood draws, questionnaires and breathing tests.</detailed_description>
