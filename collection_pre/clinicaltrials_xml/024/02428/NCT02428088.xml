Subject, male or female, must be between 6 and 12 years of age, inclusive, at the time of consent/assent and at Baseline.

Subject has an ADHD RS IV HV score of ≥ 28. Subject has a CGI S score of ≥ 4. Subject, if female, must not be pregnant or breastfeeding, and if ≥ 8 years of age must have a negative pregnancy test. Female subject: must be unable to become pregnant (eg, premenarchal, surgically sterile, etc); OR • practice true abstinence (consistent with lifestyle) and must agree to remain abstinent from signing informed consent/assent to at least 14 days after the last dose of study drug has been taken; OR • is sexually active and willing to use a medically effective method of birth control (see Appendix VII) from signing informed consent/assent to at least 14 days after the last dose of study drug has been taken.

Subject must be in general good health (defined as the absence of any clinically relevant abnormalities as determined by the Investigator) based on screening physical and neurological examinations, vital signs, medical history, and clinical laboratory values (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis). Note: If any of the hematology, chemistry, or urinalysis results are not within the laboratory's reference range, then the subject may be included only if the investigator determines the deviations to be not clinically relevant. Subject weighs at least 21 kg and is within 3rd to 97th percentile for gender specific bodymassindex (BMI)forage from the World Health Organization (WHO) growth charts (see Appendices II and IX). Subject's parent/legal guardian must report a history of the subject being able to swallow capsules. Subject and subject's parents/legal guardians must be able to fully comprehend the informed consent/assent form (as applicable), understand all study procedures, and be able to communicate satisfactorily with the Investigator and study coordinator. Subject or parent/legal guardian has commitments during the study that would interfere with attending study visits. Subject currently has a diagnosis of asthma that has required daily treatment with bronchodilators or nebulizer treatments in the 30 days prior to screening and/or who may require daily treatments with these agents over the course of the trial. Intermittent use of bronchodilators is not exclusionary. Subjects who have a history of requiring persistent asthma treatment should be discussed wit the medical monitor prior to enrolment. Subject has any clinically significant unstable medical abnormality, chronic disease, or a history of a clinically significant abnormality of the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory, hepatic, or renal systems, or a disorder or history of a condition (eg, malabsorption, gastrointestinal surgery) that may interfere with drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion. Note: Active medical conditions that are minor or wellcontrolled are not exclusionary if they do not affect risk to the subject or the study results. In cases in which the impact of the condition upon risk to the subject or study results is unclear, the Medical Monitor should be consulted. Any subject with a known cardiovascular disease or condition (even if controlled) must be discussed with the Medical Monitor during screening. Subject has a history or presence of abnormal ECGs, which in the investigator's opinion is clinically significant. Screening site ECGs will be centrally overread, and eligibility will be determined by the investigator based on the results of the overread report.

Past history of febrile seizure, druginduced seizure, or alcohol withdrawal seizure is exclusionary. Subject taking anticonvulsants for seizure control currently or within the past 2 years is not eligible for study participation. Subject has uncontrolled thyroid disorder indicated by free T4, free T3, or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) outside the limit of normal for the reference laboratory. Subject answers "yes" to "Suicidal Ideation" item 4 (active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan) or item 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent) for any lifetime history on the C SSRS Children's Lifetime/Recent assessment at screening.

Subject has a history of, or current malignancy except for non melanomatous skin cancer. Subject has history of positive test for Hepatitis B surface antigen or Hepatitis C antibody and has liver function test results at screening above the upper limit of normal for the reference laboratory.

Subject has participated in any investigational study within 90 days prior to screening or is currently participating in another clinical trial. Subject has a history of substance or alcohol use disorder (excluding caffeine) within the 12 months prior to screening, as defined by the DSM 5 criteria, or is currently using tobacco or other nicotinecontaining products, or has a positive urine drug screen (UDS) or breath alcohol test at screening.
