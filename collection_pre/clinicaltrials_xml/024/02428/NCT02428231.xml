	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to assess whether a 6-week titration (compared with a 1-week titration) is effective in reducing the incidence of dimethyl fumarate (DMF)-related gastrointestinal (GI) Adverse Events (AEs) in subjects with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The secondary objective of this study is to assess whether a 6-week titration (compared with a 1-week titration) is effective in reducing the average severity and duration of GI symptoms over 12 weeks of dimethyl fumarate treatment in this study population.</brief_summary>
