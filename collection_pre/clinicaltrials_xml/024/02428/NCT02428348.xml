	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is the development of an EEG-cap (min. 21 electrodes) with user-friendly active dry electrodes that meets the expectations of the users regarding comfort and esthetics, without losing sight of the functional and technical demands for recording high quality EEG signals. The purpose is to use the EEG-cap to investigate clinical neurological disorders (e.g. epilepsy). The EEG-cap could also be used at home so that hospital admission in the EMU can be avoided for some patients and an increasing number of patients can be examined. Phase 3 of this Project will be divided into Phase 3a and Phase 3b. In Phase 3b of the project epilepsy patients and their family will be interviewed about different EEG-cap models in development. This interview is anticipated to take approximately 1 hour. Minimum 4 - maximum 20 epilepsy patients and their family will be interviewed. The results of the interviews will be analysed by the design company pilipili nv.</brief_summary>
