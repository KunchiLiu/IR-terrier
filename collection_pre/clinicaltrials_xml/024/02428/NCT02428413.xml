	<brief_title>Evaluation and Control of WAG in PACU Within Patient and Caregiver Breathing Zone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this single-center, multi-arm, randomized controlled study is to evaluate use of the ISO-Gard mask in patients immediately following a surgical procedure in which inhaled anesthetic is used as the primary modality of anesthesia, for the following: 1) measure the waste anesthetic gas emanating from patient during the immediate one hour post-operative recovery period in the PACU; 2) measure waste anesthetic gas within PACU caregiver's breathing zone; and 3) determine the efficacy of the ISO-Gard mask in reducing caregiver's exposure to waste anesthetic gas in the PACU. Subjects who will receive either Sevoflurane or Desflurane inhaled anesthetic will be enrolled in this study. Subjects will be randomized to receive either the ISO-Gard scavenging mask or a traditional supplemental oxygen mask post operatively; all other elements of the subjects' care will be in accordance with the institution's standard of care.</detailed_description>
