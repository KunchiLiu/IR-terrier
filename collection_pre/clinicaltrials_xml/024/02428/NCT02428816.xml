	<brief_summary>Based on previous promising results, the next step for the validation of a multimodal MRI method in diagnosis and follow up of patients reached by parkinsonian syndromes is (i) to test whether the multimodal neuroimaging is able to discriminate at the individual level, patients with multiple system atrophy parkinsonism (MSA) and patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) (ii) to determine whether the method is sensitive to measure changes over time for the two diseases, according to imaging, neuropsychological and other clinical data.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Multimodal Neuroimaging Method for Diagnosis in Parkinsonian Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>30 patients with PD and 30 patients with MSA will be examined in a 3Tesla MRI. The aim of our project is to demonstrate that our multimodal MRI method can discriminate both diseases with a similar clinical presentation and monitor the progress of the disease. CIC's expertise in recruitment and assessment of patients, and the powers of the INSERM U825 in terms of development and processing in neuroimaging guarantee the feasibility of the project and its successful completion.</detailed_description>
