	<criteria>1. No prior treatment for cervical cancer. 2. FIGO Stage IB1 to IVB; all histological subtypes (excluding neuroendocrine type). 3. Pelvic MRI available or planned before the start of treatment, , if FIGO ≥ IB2. and optional for IB1 stage 4. Possibility to communicate imaging data by CDROM (format DICOM 3.0 or more). 5. Disease amenable to biopsy (3 tumour samples are mandatory prior to treatment). 6. Age ≥ 18 years. 7. ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) 02. 8. Life expectancy &gt; 6 months. 9. Patient eligible for standard treatment (according to standards of each center). 10. Patient having health care insurance. 11. Informed and signed consent by patient. (DICOM = Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) 1. Patient enrolled in a clinical trial involving an investigative new agent. 2. Co morbidity, preventing patient to tolerate the proposed standard treatment. 3. Past history of invasive cancer over the 5 years preceding entry in the present trial (except basal cell carcinoma and carcinoma in situ of the cervix). 4. Impossibility to carry out evaluation by MRI (patient claustrophobic, pacemaker, metallic implant, non availability, other), ), if FIGO ≥ IB2 . 5. Patient deprived from ability to decide on her own. 6. Patient unable to have a regular follow up for geographical, social or psychological reasons. 7.
