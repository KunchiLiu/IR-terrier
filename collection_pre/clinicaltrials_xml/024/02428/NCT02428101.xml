	<brief_summary>This study will examine DNA from Gastrointestinal Tract of cancer patients treated with oxaliplatin to look for a variation (mutation) of the ABCG2 gene that may lead to drug-induced peripheral neuropathy in certain patients. The DNA will be extracted from patients' blood samples and are analyzed for the ABCG2 gene(G34A ,C421A genotypes) and correlated with peripheral neuropathy grades.</brief_summary>
