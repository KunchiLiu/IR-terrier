	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab works in treating patients with uterine cancer that has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nivolumab in Treating Patients With Advanced Uterine Leiomyosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the objective response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 of patients with advanced leiomyosarcoma of the uterus (ULMS) treated with nivolumab. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the toxicity of nivolumab in patients with advanced ULMS. II. To evaluate the progression-free survival of ULMS treated with nivolumab. III. To explore the relationship between programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1), programmed death (PD)1 in infiltrating lymphocytes and PD2 status in archival tumor, and pre/post treatment biopsies in a minimum of 10 patients. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore the relationship between general immune response and specific markers of immunomodulation and response to nivolumab. II. To explore the relationship between tumor inflammatory gene signature and response to nivolumab in archival material. OUTLINE: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over approximately 60 minutes once every 2 weeks for up to 46 doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 100 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced leiomyosarcoma of the uterus (ULMS); advanced ULMS is defined as metastatic ULMS or unresectable primary ULMS Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for nonnodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as &gt;= 20 mm (&gt;= 2 cm) with conventional techniques or as &gt;= 10 mm (&gt;= 1 cm) with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or calipers by clinical exam Patients must have received at least one prior line of chemotherapy, for ULMS (either in the adjuvant or metastatic setting) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 Life expectancy of greater than 9 months Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mcL Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (except patients with Gilbert syndrome, who can have total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =&lt; 2.5 x ULN/ =&lt; 5 x ULN for subjects with liver metastases Serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x ULN OR creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt;= 50 mL/min (if using the CockcroftGault formula) Patients with a requirement for steroid treatment or other immunosuppressive treatment: patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration; inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 31weeks after the last dose of investigational drug; women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG]) within 24 hours prior to the start of nivolumab; women must not be breastfeeding; women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile) do not require contraception Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal; menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes; in addition, women under the age of 55 must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level less than 40 mIU/mL WOCBP receiving nivolumab will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 31 weeks after the last dose of investigational product.; these durations have been calculated using the upper limit of the halflife for nivolumab (25 days) and are based on the protocol requirement that WOCBP use contraception for 5 halflives plus 30 days Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform the treating physician immediately Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events (AEs) due to agents administered more than 3 weeks earlier; patients who have had prior pelvic radiation may be at increased risk for bowel perforation, and therefore may not have residual inflammatory disease of the bowel or residual bowel toxicity based on baseline imaging and clinical assessment; palliative (limitedfield) radiation therapy is permitted, if all of the following criteria are met: Repeat imaging demonstrates no new sites of bone metastases The lesion being considered for palliative radiation is not a target lesion Bowel toxicity is not expected from the target field due to increased risk of perforation Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents Patients are excluded if they have had prior treatment with an antiPD1, antiPDL1, antiPDligand 2 (L2), anticytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated protein 4 (CTLA4) antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting Tcell costimulation or immune checkpoint pathways Active brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease; patients with known brain metastases are allowed if metastases have been treated and there is no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of progression for at least 12 weeks after treatment is complete and within 28 days prior to the first dose of nivolumab administration; there must also be no requirement for immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents) for at least 2 weeks prior to study drug administration History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to nivolumab History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Pregnant women are excluded from this study;
