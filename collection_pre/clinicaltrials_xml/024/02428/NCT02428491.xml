	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to describe the immunogenicity and safety of Sanofi Pasteur's DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T fully liquid combined hexavalent vaccine (Hexaxim®) administered at 2, 3, and 4 months of age and at 16 to 17 months of age in infants and toddlers who received a dose of Hep B vaccine at birth or within 1 week after birth. Primary Objective: - To describe the safety profile after each and all doses of Sanofi-Pasteur's DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T combined vaccine in Vietnamese infants and toddlers Secondary Objective: - To evaluate the immunogenicity of the study vaccine one month after the third dose primary series. - To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the immune response to all antigens induced by the study vaccine in Vietnamese infants one month after the third dose in a 3 dose primary series with the immune response to all antigens induced by the same study vaccine outside Vietnam - To describe the persistence of all antibodies before receipt of the booster vaccination.</brief_summary>
