	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to identification of genetic markers and predictors of antidepressant-induced suicidality in youth depression. Participants who take the standardized pharmacotherapy (bupropion or lamotrigine) for depression will be observed for 8 weeks. They will do several scales and genetic tests at visit 1 (week 0), visit 3 (week 4) and visit 4 (week 8)</brief_summary>
