	<brief_summary>This study is designed to compare the incremental area under the curve from 0 to 24h (iAUC0-24h) of plasma levels of n-3 fatty acids (sum of total and free eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) after ingestion of an emulsified product and a non-emulsified reference control of free flowing cod liver oil at the lowest appropriate dose that is practically acceptable, and as near as possible to the test products' recommended daily dose.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing Blood Levels of Fatty Acids After Consuming Two Forms of Cod Liver Oil</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many dietary lipids are in the form of triglycerides, ethyl esters or phospholipids. During digestion these lipids are subject to hydrolysis, in particular by pancreatic triglyceride lipase. To facilitate the action of the enzyme, lipids are emulsified by the action of bile salts. By increasing the surface area of the fat globules, emulsification increases access to the lipids by pancreatic triglyceride lipase. This study is designed to compare iAUC0-24h of plasma levels of n-3 fatty acids (sum of total and free EPA and DHA) after ingestion of an emulsified product and a non-emulsified reference control of free flowing cod liver oil at the lowest appropriate dose that is practically acceptable, and as near as possible to the test products' recommended daily dose.</detailed_description>
