	<brief_title>Providing Resources to Enhance Patients' Readiness to Make Decisions About Kidney Disease: The PREPARE NOW Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will study the effectiveness of patient educational materials (a book and DVD, called the PREPARED materials) to help patients with chronic kidney disease make early, shared, and informed decisions about kidney replacement therapy. Half of the participants will receive the PREPARED materials and half will receive usual care from their doctors. PREPARED materials feature patients and their families discussing the pros and cons of different treatment options for kidney failure. The investigators will randomly assign patients already under the care of a nephrologist to receive the video and book or to receive their usual nephrology care. They will measure the degree to which patients in either study arm are prepared for kidney failure treatment at follow up.</detailed_description>
