	<detailed_description>The study is To evaluate clinical and peri-procedural angiographic outcomes for the SYNERGYTM MONORAILTM Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System in the treatment of subjects with atherosclerotic lesion(s) ≤34 mm in length (by visual estimate) in native coronary arteries ≥2.25 mm to ≤4.0 mm in diameter (by visual estimate).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key 1. Subject must be at least 18 75 years of age 2. Subject is eligible for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) 3. Target lesion(s) must be located in a native coronary artery with a visually estimated reference vessel diameter (RVD) ≥2.25 mm and ≤4.0 mm, length must be ≤34* mm (by visual estimate), Target lesion(s) must have visually estimated stenosis ≥50% and &lt;100% with thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow &gt;1 Key 1. Planned PCI (including staged procedures) or CABG after the index procedure 2. Subject with out of range complete blood count (CBC) values that are determined by the study physician to be clinically significant. 3. Subject is on dialysis or has baseline serum creatinine level &gt;2.0 mg/dL (177µmol/L) 4. Planned treatment of more than 3 lesions, Planned treatment of lesions in more than 2 major epicardial vessels, Planned treatment of a single lesion with more than 1 stent 5. Target lesion(s) is located within 3 mm of the origin of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery or left circumflex (LCx) coronary artery by visual estimate. 6. Target vessel develops a dissection greater than National Heart, Lung, Blood Institute (NHLBI) type C following the predilatation/pretreatment of the first target lesion</criteria>
