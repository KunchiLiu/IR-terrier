	<brief_title>Evaluate, Safety and Tolerability of Intraprostatic PRX302 Administration, Low to Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single center, open label, Phase IIa, Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, Long-term follow-up (IDEAL) prospective development study. The study will treat approximately 20 men who meet the eligibility criteria, and give written informed consent. Safety and Tolerability will be assessed post-treatment at 2 days (phone call), 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks and 26 weeks. Potential Efficacy will be assessed by biopsy at 24 weeks and imaging (MRI) at 2 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks and PSA outcomes at 12 and 24 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men aged ≥40 years and life expectancy of ≥10 years. Serum prostatespecific antigen (PSA) ≤15 ng/mL. Transperineal prostate biopsy within 12 months prior to dosing, with a clinically significant lesion correlating with an mpMRI visible lesion. Radiological stage T1T2 N0 Mx/M0 disease. A visible lesion on mpMRI that is accessible to PRX302 transperineal injection. Previous radiation therapy to the pelvis. Androgen suppression or antiandrogen therapy within the 12 months prior to dosing, for prostate cancer. Use of a 5alpha reductase inhibitor within the 3 months prior to dosing. Evidence of metastatic disease or nodal disease outside the prostate on bone scan or crosssectional imaging. Inability to tolerate a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). Known allergy to latex or gadolinium (Gd). Previous electroporation, radiofrequency ablation, highintensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), cryosurgery, thermal or microwave therapy to treat cancer of the prostate. Unable to have pelvic MRI scanning (severe claustrophobia, permanent cardiac pacemaker, metallic implant, etc. likely to contribute significant artifact to images).</criteria>
