	<brief_summary>Amino acids are the building blocks of the body's protein and are used to build muscle, body tissue, and to support the immune system. Amino acids play a crucial role in growth and development of our body, especially in young children. However, some rare genetic diseases do not allow for proper digestion of these amino acids and so protein needs to be restricted in the diet of people who live with these conditions. One such disorder of lysine (an amino acid) is called Pyridoxine Dependent Epilepsy(PDE) where lysine is restricted in the diet of children and adults who live with this condition. Although diet restrictions are common for such genetic disorders, some people find it hard to follow restrictions and so alternative treatment methods have been developed. One such alternative treatment methods is to provide an excess of a "competitive" amino acid, in this case, arginine to reduce or stop the digestion and/or absorption lysine. Our aim is to examine if arginine can reduce lysine digestion/absorption under conditions of normal lysine intake. Animal experiments have shown that the body's ability to absorb lysine from the diet and thereby accumulating in the brain can be altered by adding more of another "competitive" amino acid, in this case, arginine. This is because lysine and arginine share the same transport system in the body. In other words, the breakdown of lysine (lysine oxidation) can be altered by adding additional arginine to the diet. Such changes can be studied in human body with the use of stable isotopes. Stable isotope techniques may help us gain a better understanding of how arginine can affect lysine absorption in the body. Although, the arginine supplementation described above is primarily for PDE patients, the investigators propose to study this 13C- lysine tracer protocol in healthy adult men to generate pilot data.</brief_summary>
