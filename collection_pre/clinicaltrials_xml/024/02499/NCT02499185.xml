	<brief_title>Study Evaluating Novel Biomarkers of AKI (Acute Kidney Injury) in Post-operative Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective pilot single center study to investigate the potential of [TIMP-2].[IGFBP-7] to predict AKI (Acute Kidney Injury) in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. The investigators will measure the biomarker once preoperatively and 4-times postoperatively starting at arrival on PACU (post anesthesia care unit).The primary endpoint of this study is the development of AKI stage 2 or 3 within the first 72 postoperative hours.</detailed_description>
