	<brief_summary>To further increase the access of evidence based psychotherapies for Veterans with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, we propose to offer training and intensive consultation to community-based providers in Cognitive Processing Therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. However, we believe that many clinicians may not implement Cognitive Processing Therapy or take advantage of consultation after initial training. For this reason, we propose to examine the effectiveness of an enhanced training method, which would add Motivational Interviewing to the standard Cognitive Processing Therapy training. Motivational Interviewing is a form of collaborative discussion for strengthening motivation and commitment to change. We hypothesize that augmenting the standard Cognitive Processing Therapy training with these techniques will reduce providers' reluctance to fully implement the interventions.</brief_summary>
