	<brief_title>Safety and Pharmacokinetics Study of YYB101 in Advanced Solid Tumors Patients Who Are Refractory to Standard Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of YYB101, patients who are refractory to standard therapy will be enrolled in this study. In dose-escalation cohort, subjects will be enrolled sequentially into four dose cohorts receiving a single dose of YYB101 (0.3, 1, 3, or 5 mg/kg; 3 or 6 subjects per dose cohort) and will be entered the 4-week treatment-free period to evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics. If no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed during the 4-week period, YYB101 administration will be resumed at the same dose level every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity development. After the completion of the dose-escalation cohort, additional subjects will be enrolled into a dose-expansion cohort at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for further exploration of safety, tolerability, efficacy and pharmacodynamics.</detailed_description>

Patients had received highdose chemotherapy requiring hematopoietic progenitor cell support within 2 years before IP administration 4. Patients with symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastasis (patients who are radiologically and neurologically stable condition for ≥ 4 weeks and discontinued corticosteroids at least 4 week before IP administration are able to participate in this trial.) 5.

Concurrent NYHA class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, poorly controlled arrhythmia, other clinically significant cardiovascular abnormalities at investigator's discretion (e.g. LVEF &lt; 50%, clinical significant abnormalities of heart wall, or cardiac muscle damage), known positive result for HIV or other uncontrolled active infection disease 7. Requirement for continuous nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or systemic corticosteroids 8. Receiving anticoagulant, history of bleeding diathesis, massive hemoptysis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, or peptic ulcer disease (&lt; 325 mg aspirin is acceptable) 9.
