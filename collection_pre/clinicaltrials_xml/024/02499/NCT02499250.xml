	<brief_summary>The purpose is to test whether daily ischemic conditioning of the arms over 30 days could reduce the frequency and severity of angina pectoris and improve the life quality of refractory angina pectoris patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Daily Remote Ischemic Conditioning on the Life Quality of Refractory Angina Pectoris Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Refractory angina pectoris denotes "chronic stable angina that persists despite optimal medication and when revascularisation is unfeasible or where the risks are unjustified". These patients could potentially be relieved by non-conventional treatments like remote ischemic conditioning, and actually this effect has been observed in several cases in the center of the sponsor. This study is a pilot study to measure the efficacy and safety of this method in this group of patients.</detailed_description>
