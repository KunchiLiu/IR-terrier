	<brief_summary>Exparel is an FDA-approved local anesthetic (bupivacaine), in a long-release formulation. In this study the investigators plan to determine the ability of Exparel to control post-operative pain in common first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint procedures (bunion surgery, 1st MTP fusion, and cheilectomy).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pericapsular Exparel for Pain Relief in Bunionectomy and Related Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators propose a prospective, randomized, single-blinded study of patients who are electing to undergo an outpatient first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint procedure (bunionectomy, 1st MTP fusion, or cheilectomy). As a standard, patients undergoing these procedures are given regional anesthesia (adductor canal block plus popliteal block). Patients are then given prescriptions for oral opioids to manage post-operative pain. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a single intrapopliteal administration of Exparel, in conjunction with the standard of care regional block, improves pain relief and therefore decreases use of post-operative opioids.</detailed_description>
