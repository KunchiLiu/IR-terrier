	<brief_summary>As part of the global clinical development program for Palbociclib, studies are planned in cancer patients in China. An assessment of Palbociclib pharmacokinetics in Chinese patients, as required by the Chinese Health Authorities, is therefore warranted. In addition, safety and efficacy will be also evaluated. The single and multiple 125 mg oral dose pharmacokinetics of Palbociclib will be characterized.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>ER(+), HER2(), postmenopausal adult (ages 1865 years, inclusive) Chinese women with proven diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the breast with evidence locoregionally recurrent or metastatic disease not amenable to resection or radiation therapy with curative intent and for whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated. a. Postmenopausal women: i. Prior bilateral surgical oophorectomy; or ii. Medically confirmed postmenopausal status defined as spontaneous cessation of regular menses for at least 12 consecutive months with no alternative pathological or physiological cause b. Documentation of histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of: i. ER(+) breast cancer. c. Documentation of HER2() breast cancer. d. Previously untreated with any systemic anti cancer therapy for their locoregionally recurrent or metastatic ER+ disease. Measurable disease as defined per RECIST v.1.1 or boneonly disease. Tumor lesions previously irradiated or subjected to other locoregional therapy will only be deemed measurable if disease progression at the treated site after completion of therapy is clearly documented. HER2positive tumor as defined by documentation of erbB2 gene amplification by FISH (as defined by a HER2/CEP17 ratio â‰¥2) or chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH, as defined by the manufacturer's kit instruction) or documentation of HER2 overexpression by IHC (defined as IHC3+, or IHC2+ with FISH or CISH confirmation) based on local laboratory results Patients with advanced, symptomatic, visceral spread, that are at risk of lifethreatening complications in the short term (including patients with massive uncontrolled effusions [pleural, pericardial, peritoneal], pulmonary lymphangitis, and over 50% liver involvement).</criteria>
