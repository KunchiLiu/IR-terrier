	<criteria>Clinical criteria: 1. Adult (age &gt;18 years) 2. Diagnosis of heart failure with preserved systolic function 3. NYHA F. Class III or IV symptoms or history of at least two previous heart failure hospitalization in the last year 4. Able to sign informed consent and return for followup visits. 5. No contraindication for anticoagulation and antiplatelet treatment* 6. Cardiovascular medications unchanged for greater than 4 weeks (not including diuretics). 7. Pulmonary Wedge pressure &gt; 15 mmHg documented by right heart catheterization at enrollment. Echocardiography criteria: 8. Left ventricular ejection fraction &gt;50% 9. LV enddiastolic volume index (LVEDVI) &lt;97 ml/m 2 10. E/E' (mean of septal and lateral) &gt; 12 (applicable only to patients with sinus rhythm). 11. Left Atrial Volume Index: (LAVi ml/m2 &gt;29). 12. No evidence of intracardiac thrombus. 13. Minimal endocardial height from Apex to Mitral Annulus &gt; 60mm at end systole. * In case of doubt regarding contraindication for antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation therapy hematological evaluation will be conduct Exclusion Criteria Cardiovascular disease: 1. Uncontrolled HTN defined as &gt;160/90 mmHg for patients on 3drug therapy. 2. Current or anticipated need for ICD, currently implanted with a cardiac resynchronization device (CRTD), left ventricular assist device (LVAD). 3. Within the past 3 months Acute myocardial infarction (AMI), cerebral vascular accident (CVA), Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) , 4. Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery (CABG), valve replacement or repair, aortic surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI or transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMR or PMR)) in the past 3 months or planned/anticipated within 6 months. 5. Significant Valvular disease classified as Moderate or severe aortic stenosis/regurgitation Moderate or severe mitral stenosis Severe mitral regurgitation 6. History of thrombus within the previous 3 months. 7. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 8. History of pericardial disease. 9. HF attributed to Cor pulmonale or other cause of isolated right heart failure. 10. Infiltrative heart disease. Noncardiovascular disease: 12. Prior surgery, radiation, or thoracic surgery limiting the ability to place the device. 13. Asthma COPD (e.g. FEV1 &lt;1.5 liter), or severe restrictive lung disease. 14. Severe chronic renal failure indicated by MDRD GFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m2 15. Liver impairment addressed by bilirubin &gt; 2 mg/dl and or pseudocolinesterasis plasma concentration &lt; 1500 IU and or abnormal coagulative profile. 16. Severe anemia addressed by Hb concentration &lt;9 gr/l. 17. Solid organ or hematologic transplant. 18. Previous Trans Apical procedures/implantation. Miscellaneous conditions: 19. Unwilling to fulfill the protocol medication compliance, testing, and followup requirements. 20. Comorbid condition that in the physician's opinion would prohibit the subject's ability to meet the protocol requirements. 21. Pregnancy at the time of enrollment. (Women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within two weeks prior to enrollment, or be using hormonal contraceptives or intrauterine devices). 22. Enrolled in another treatment investigational study. 23. A history of alcohol abuse, drug addiction, or other psychosocial condition that would preclude successful participation, or clear judgment and informed consent in the opinion of the Principal Investigator.</criteria>
