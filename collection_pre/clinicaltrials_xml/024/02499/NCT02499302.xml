	<brief_summary>The general aim of this study is to investigate the effect of an individually tailored mental training program in adolescents developing chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) after an acute Epstein Barr-virus (EBV) infection. Endpoints include physical activity (primary endpoint), symptoms (fatigue, pain, insomnia), cognitive function (executive functions) and markers of disease mechanisms (autonomic, endocrine, and immune responses).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mental Training for CFS Following EBV Infection in Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>EBV-infection is a well-known trigger of CFS. A closely related research project (Chronic fatigue following acute Epstein-Barr virus infection in Adolescents; ClinicalTrials ID:NCT02335437) is a combined prospective and cross-sectional study of 200 adolescents suffering from acute EBV infection. The primary aim of that study is to identify factors that predispose to CFS 6 months after the acute infection. Thus, that project will provide a sample of thoroughly characterized CFS patients, all having the same precipitation factor (EBV-infection). The present project is an intervention trial in the subgroup of patients that actually did develop CFS 6 months after the acute EBV infection. Patients will be randomised 1:1 to either a mental training program (10 sessions) combining elements from cognitive behavioral therapy and music therapy, or routine follow-up from the general practitioner. By its nature, treatment group allocation cannot be blinded; however, both patients and therapists will be blinded for end-point evaluation. An extensive investigational program will be carried out at three time points: Prior to the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and 1 year after the intervention. The program includes: Clinical examination; Pain threshold assessment; Cardiovascular assessment; Cognitive assessment; Sampling of biological material (blood and urine); Questionnaire; Brain fMRI; Qualitative interview; Monitoring of physical activity (accelerometer)</detailed_description>
