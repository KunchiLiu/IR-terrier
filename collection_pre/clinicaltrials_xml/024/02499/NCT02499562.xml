	<brief_title>A Phase II Clinical Trial of Hydronidone Capsules(F351) in Patients With Liver Fibrosis Induced by HBV Chronic Hepatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary observation indexes: Hepatic fibrosis Ishak score after treatment decreases by the proportion not less than 1 compared with that before treatment. Secondary observation indexes : 1. Negative conversion ratio of HBV DNA after treatment (HBV DNA＜1×103copies/mL) and falling range. 2. The falling proportion of Fibrocan Kpa value after treatment compared with that before treatment. 3. The falling proportion that decreases not less than 1 level and progression-free fibrosis after treatment compared with that before treatment. 4. The improvement of ALT of liver function.</detailed_description>
