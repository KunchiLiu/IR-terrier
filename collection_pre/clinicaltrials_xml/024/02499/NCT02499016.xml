	<brief_summary>Conventional laparoscopic appendectomy(CLA) is the current standard treatment. To obtain additional benefits such as a better cosmetic outcome, the investigators developed a surgical option termed suprapubic single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy (SSILA), which creates a non-visible scar, that was preliminarily shown to be feasible and safe in our previous retrospective studies To further evaluate the feasibility, safety and cosmetic results of this innovative approach, the investigators compared the outcomes of SSILA and CLA by performing a randomized controlled trial.</brief_summary>
