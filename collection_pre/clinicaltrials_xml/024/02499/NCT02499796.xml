	<brief_title>Short-term Effects of Humidification Devices on Respiratory Pattern and Work of Breathing During Invasive Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Three humidifying devices are commonly and indifferently used during mechanical ventilation, but their impact on respiratory mechanics and, eventually, mechanical ventilation efficacy, particularly in patients highly dependent from mechanical ventilation, are not superimposable. It has already been described that heated and moisture exchangers (HME), increasing dead space, can negatively affect ventilatory function and gas exchange, in comparison to heated humidifiers (HH). The Hygrovent Gold, mainly because of its position between the tracheostomy and the Y-piece of the ventilatory circuit and its structure, may lead to analogous or even worse effects, determining and increase in inspiratory resistances and dead space and consequently an increase in the work of breathing.</detailed_description>
