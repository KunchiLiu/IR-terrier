	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is 1. to compare the effects of nifedipine GITS and ramipril on blood pressure variability in subjects with elevated blood pressure variability. 2. to assess whether the degree of treatment-induced changes in blood pressure variability, is related to the degree of regression (or progression) of organ damage in heart, kidneys and carotid arteries.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>REducing Blood Pressure Variability in Essential Hypertension With RAmipril vErsus Nifedipine GITS Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elevated blood pressure variability (BPV) is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes and organ damage in hypertensive subjects. An antihypertensive treatment able to reduce BPV independently of BP lowering effect might thus provide additional protection in terms of cardiovascular risk in subjects with elevated BPV, independently on its effect of BP itself. However, data on the effects of different classes of antihypertensive drugs on BPV are limited and inconsistent. Some studies have suggested a possible usefulness of calcium antagonists in this setting. Based on the above considerations the investigators hypothesize that a calcium channel blocker nifedipine GITS, will provide a greater BPV lowering effect, when compared with ramipril, independently from the reduction in mean BP level. Based on the above considerations, the primary objective of this study is to compare the effects of nifedipine GITS and ramipril on different estimates of BPV (24 h BPV, home BPV, and visit-to-visit BPV) in subjects with elevated BPV. The secondary objective is to assess whether the degree of treatment-induced changes in BPV, is related to the degree of regression (or progression) of organ damage, after accounting for mean BP reduction by treatment.</detailed_description>
