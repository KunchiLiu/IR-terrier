	<brief_summary>This multicentre, open-label, Phase 1b/2 study is designed as a 2 part study consisting of a dose-escalation, safety run-in Part A and a dose-expansion Part B</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Assess MEDI4736 With Either AZD9150 or AZD5069 in Advanced Solid Tumors &amp; Relapsed Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head &amp; Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The dose-escalation Part A of this study will involve patients with advanced solid malignancies refractory to standard therapy or for which no standard of care regimen currently exists. Approximately 30 evaluable patients per treatment arm (A1 or A2) will be enrolled. A3 will test viability of alternate dosing schedule for AZD5069, A4/A5 will evaluate AZD9150/AZd5069 in fixed dose combination with MEDI4736 and tremelimumab in solid tumors. there may also be safety run in cohorts enrolled (A6/A7) in specific solid tumor types (breast and prostate cancer). Once the maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) for each of the 2 agents (AZD9150/AZD5069)in combination with MEDI4736 have been identified or the maximum doses of each of the 2 agents in combination with MEDI4736 have been reached, the dose expansion Part B of the study would commence. It will be conducted in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic (RM) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Between 68 and 124 eligible patients will be enrolled and will randomly assigned to 1 of the following 6 treatment arms: - Treatment arm B1: AZD9150 in combination with MEDI4736 in patients with prior exposure to anti-PD-(L)1 antibodies - Treatment arm B2: AZD5069 in combination with MEDI4736 in patients with prior exposure to anti-PD-(L)1 antibodies - Treatment arm B3: AZD9150 in combination with MEDI4736 in patients with no prior exposure to anti-PD-(L)1 antibodies - Treatment arm B4: AZD5069 in combination with MEDI4736 in patients with no prior exposure to anti-PD-(L)1 antibodies - Treatment arm B5: AZD9150 alone in patients with no prior exposure to anti-PD-(L)1 antibodies - Treatment arm B6: AZD5069 alone in patients with no prior exposure to anti-PD-(L)1 antibodies</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key Male and female patients must be at least 18 years of age. Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS score of 0 or 1. Has measurable disease, defined as at least 1 lesion that can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) with a minimum size of 10 mm by computerised tomography (CT) scan, except lymph nodes which must have minimum short axis size of 15 mm (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm in both cases). Indicator lesions must not have been previously treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or radiofrequency ablation unless there is documented progression after therapy. Has undergone ≤3 previous regimens of cytoreductive therapies including, but not limited to, platinumbased compounds, taxanes, or 5fluorouracil. Adequate organ and marrow function Female subjects of childbearing potential and male subjects with partners of childbearing potential should ensure use of a highly effective method of birth control as defined in study protocol Additional inclusion for part A: Has a histological confirmation of a solid malignancy (other than HCC) that is refractory to standard therapy or for which no standard of care regimen currently exists. Addition inclusion for Part A (A6 &amp; A7) Has a histological confirmation of either metastatic breast (ER+ve for Arm A6, 50% ER +ve and 50% HER2+ve metastatic breast cancer patients for Arm A7) or castrateresistant prostate cancer Additional inclusion for Part B:Has histologically and/or cytologically confirmed SCCHN that is RM and not amendable to curative therapy by surgery or radiation. Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck originating from the following sites is eligible: oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, or hypopharynx. Has at least 1 SCCHN tumour lesion (TL) amenable to biopsy and must have failed, refused, or has been found to be ineligible for least 1 prior platinumbased chemotherapy for RMSCCHN Additional inclusion criteria for Arms B1 &amp; B2:must have had prior exposure to anti PDL1 antibody Key Spinal cord compression unless asymptomatic and not requiring steroids for at least 4 weeks before the start of study treatment. Presently has a second malignancy other than SCCHN, or history of treatment for invasive cancer other than SCCHN in the past 3 years. Exceptions are Previously treated insitu carcinoma (ie, noninvasive) Cervical carcinoma stage 1B or less Noninvasive basal cell and squamous cell skin carcinoma Radically treated prostate cancer (prostatectomy or radiotherapy) with normal prostatespecific antigen, and not requiring ongoing antiandrogen hormonal therapy Patients must have completed any previous cancerrelated treatments before enrolment. Any concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or biologic, or hormonal therapy for cancer excludes the patient (concurrent use of hormones for noncancerrelated conditions [eg, insulin for diabetes and hormone replacement therapy] is acceptable), Experiencing CTCAE grade &gt;1 events, experienced immunerelated grade ≥3AEs with prior immunotherapy Has active or prior autoimmune disease within the past 2 years Has active or prior inflammatory bowel disease or primary immunodeficiency Undergone an organ transplant that requires use of immunosuppressive treatment Abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of resting 12lead ECG uncontrolled comorbid conditions Received a live attenuated vaccine within 28 days of first study dose, unable to take oral medications History of allergic reactions to study compounds or excepients Additional exclusion criteria Part A: Patients with clinically active brain metastases and prior exposure to AZD9150, AZD5069, MEDI4736, or any other anti PD (L)1 antibody. Additional exclusion criteria Part B: Patients with brain metastases (known or suspected) Additional exclusion criteria Part B: treatment arms B3, B4, B5, and B6: prior exposure to AZD9150, AZD5069, MEDI4736, or any other anti PD (L)1 antibody.</criteria>
