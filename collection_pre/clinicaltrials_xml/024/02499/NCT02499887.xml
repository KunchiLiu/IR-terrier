	<brief_summary>The purpose of the proposed study is to determine whether the addition of inhaled corticosteroids to treatment with oral corticosteroids and albuterol would reduce repeat emergency department (ED) visits among patients treated for acute exacerbations of asthma and COPD discharged from the emergency department to home. The investigators hypothesize that patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids in addition to oral corticosteroids and albuterol will have lower rates of 30-day return visits to the emergency department than those patients treated with oral corticosteroids and albuterol only.</brief_summary>
