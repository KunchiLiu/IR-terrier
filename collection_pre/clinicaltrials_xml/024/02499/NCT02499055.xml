	<brief_summary>Background. In Denmark, about 350,000 persons suffer from anxiety. Public health-care services plan to implement internet based self-help psychotherapy (IBT) to be an important alternative and supplement to ordinary face-to-face therapy. Meta-analyses indicate that the effect of IBT for anxiety disorders seems better than no intervention, and in some instances equal to 'usual therapy'. But studies have been characterised by small sample sizes, high risk for bias, including high dropout. Objective. The objective of this pilot trial is to assess the feasibility of conducting a larger confirmatory trial investigating the benefits and harms of an internet-based self-help therapy program, FearFighter™, compared with no intervention for persons with an anxiety disorder. Design. An investigator-initiated feasibility randomised clinical trial investigating internet-based therapy with FearFighter™ compared with no intervention for persons with an anxiety disorder. We will include 64 participants. Eligibility criteria. Inclusion criteria: age 18 or older; specific phobia, panic disorder, agoraphobia, or social phobia is the primary diagnosis according to the DSM-IV; and informed consent. Exclusion criteria: suicidal risk; ongoing episode of bipolar disorder or psychosis; concurrent psychological treatment for the anxiety disorder; unable to attend the intervention; or lack of informed consent. Intervention. The intervention group will use the program FearFighter™, a nine session cognitive behavioural self-help therapy program delivered over the internet during nine weeks. The control group receive no intervention for nine weeks. Outcomes. Feasibility outcomes are the fraction that are eligible, the fraction that are randomised, and the compliance in the intervention group. Clinical exploratory outcomes are: remission, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Symptom Check List-90R, WHO Well-Being Index, Sheehan Disability Scale, serious adverse events, and behaviour log from FearFighter. Time schedule. Participants will be included in the trial from July 2015. Results are expected in February 2016.</brief_summary>
