	<brief_summary>A prospective, interventional, monocentric, controlled and randomized study will compare a conventional surgical technique to a surgical technique with the assistance of the Acetabular Cup Orientation Guide (ACOG, Materialise) System during total hip replacement (THR).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monocentric Study on Acetabulum Patient-specific Pin Drilling Guides</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: The Acetabular Cup Orientation Guide(ACOG) System from MATERIALISE NV was developed and is intended to be used as a surgical instrument to assist in the positioning of acetabular cup components intra-operatively using anatomical landmarks of the pelvis that are clearly identifiable on preoperative computed tomography (CT) imaging scans. Use of ACOG is a relative new technique. ACOG, based on CT imaging data, fit directly into the patient's anatomy and enable primary total hip replacement . Data showing extra benefit of this technique compared to conventional THR technique are not widely available. Aim: To determine the safety of this new surgical technique compared to conventional THR. Methods: 30 participants will be randomized to 2 groups. One group will be operated for a THR with the conventional technique and the other group will be operated for a THR with the assistance of the ACOG System. CT imaging will be taken pre and post operatively to measure cup orientation.</detailed_description>
