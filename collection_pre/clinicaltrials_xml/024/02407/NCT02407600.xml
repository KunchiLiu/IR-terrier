	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the addition of fosaprepitant to currently available antiemtic treatments of carboplatin chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients. Half of the patients will receive fosaprepitant in their first chemotherapy cycle, and a placebo on their second chemotherapy cycle. The other half of the patients will begin their first chemotherapy cycle.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Assessing Fosaprepitant in Advanced NSCLC Patients Treated With Carboplatin Based Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The addition of aprepitant to 5HT-3 antagonist and steroid is approved for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea for highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC). The use of oral aprepitant 3 day regimen has been evaluated in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. However, its use has not been explored in carboplatin containing combination regimens in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). An equivalency study compared fosaprepitant, a 1-day intravenous formulation of aprepitant, with oral aprepitant. Findings demonstrate equivalence between the agents for complete response and both emesis and nausea control. Fosaprepitant was endorsed by the ASCO Update Committee as an acceptable NK1 receptor antagonist. However, there has been no evaluation of this iv formulation with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and specifically carboplatin containing regimens in NSCLC. Therefore, the investigators propose a double-blind, randomized placebo controlled cross-over phase II study assessing the role of fosaprepitant in the prevention of nausea and emesis in patients receiving carboplatin based chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC. Patients will be treated with Emend/ placebo administered intravenously on day 1 of cycles 1 of carboplatin based chemotherapy with crossover to the alternate agent (placebo/ Emend) on day 1 of cycle 2 with each cycle being 21 days. Fosaprepitant will be administered intravenously on day 1 of either cycle 1 or cycle 2 prior to carboplatin based chemotherapy. Placebo will be administered as the alternative agent. Study team and the subject will be blinded to fosaprepitant versus placebo.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient age &gt; 18 years and able to sign informed consent. ECOG PS 02 Patients with stage IV or recurrent NSCLC being treated with carboplatin based regimen with palliative intent. Acceptable chemotherapy regimens include: Carboplatin (AUC of 5 OR 6) q 21 days with: Paclitaxel Q 21 days OR Docetaxel Q 21 days OR Pemetrexed Q 21 days (nonsquamous histology with Vitamin B12 and folate supplementation) OR Gemcitabine administered days 1 and 8 Q 21 days OR Vinorelbine administered days 1 and 8 Q 21 days The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy is permitted where indicated and clinically appropriate. Patients who have received prior adjuvant chemotherapy for lung cancer ( &gt; 1 year prior) and have recurred are eligible if it has been &gt; 1 year since completion of adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients who have been treated for locally advanced lung cancer with concurrent chemoradiation but completed such therapy &gt; 1 year ago are eligible provided they meet all other inclusion criteria. Patients who have received prior adjuvant chemotherapy for lung cancer ( &gt; 1 year prior) and have recurred are eligible if it has been &gt; 1 year since completion of adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients who have been treated for locally advanced lung cancer with concurrent chemoradiation but completed such therapy &gt; 1 year ago are eligible provided they meet all other inclusion criteria.

If used concurrently with above agents, there can be elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs, potentially causing serious or lifethreatening reactions. Patients may be enrolled on the study if at least 7 days have elapsed since last dose of such a medication. Women who are pregnant or lactating are not eligible. Women of childbearing age musthave a negative pregnancy test within 3 days of treatment and agree to use of contraception during the study period.
