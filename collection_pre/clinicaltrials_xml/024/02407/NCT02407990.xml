	<brief_title>Study of the Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Antitumor Activities of BGB-A317 in Subjects With Advanced Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. Subjects must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic tumor for which no effective standard therapy is available. 2. Subjects with previously treated brain metastasis (es) that is asymptomatic or radiographically/clinically stable and not requiring steroids medications for 4 weeks prior to enrollment are permitted. 3. Subjects must have archival tumor tissues or agree to a tumor biopsy for analysis of predictive biomarkers such as PDL1. (Fresh tumor biopsies are strongly recommended at baseline for biomarker analysis in subjects with readily accessible tumor lesions and who consent to the biopsies.) 4. Subjects must have measurable disease as defined per RECIST Version 1.1. 5. Male or female and ≥18 years of age on day of signing informed consent. 6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤1. 7. Subjects must have adequate organ function as indicated by the following laboratory values. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500 /mL Platelets ≥100,000 / mL Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL or ≥5.6 mmol/L without qualifications Serum creatinine ≤1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN for patients with liver metastases International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) ≤1.5 X ULN Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) ≤1.5 X ULN 8. Subjects have voluntarily agreed to participate by giving written informed consent. 9. Female subjects are eligible to enter and participate in the study if they Non childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant), including any female who Has had a hysterectomy. Has had a bilateral oophorectomy (ovariectomy). Has had a bilateral tubal ligation. Is post menopausal (total cessation of menses for ≥1 year). Childbearing potential, has a negative serum pregnancy test at screening (within 7 days of the first investigational product administration), and uses adequate contraception before study entry and throughout the study until 90 days after the last investigational product administration. Adequate contraception, when used consistently and in accordance with both the product label and the instructions of the physician, are defined as follows: Vasectomized partner who is sterile prior to the female subject's entry and is the sole sexual partner for that female. Any intrauterine device with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year. Double barrier contraception defined as condom with spermicidal jelly, foam, suppository, or film; OR diaphragm with spermicide; OR male condom and diaphragm. Not be breast feeding. 10. Male subjects are eligible to enter and participate in the study if they are vasectomized or agree to the use of contraception during the study treatment period and for at least 180 days after the last dose of study drug 1. History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other mAbs. 2. Prior malignancy active within the previous 2 years except for tumor for which a patient is enrolled in the study, and locally curable cancers that have been apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast. 3. Prior therapies targeting PD1 or PDL1. 4. Subjects who fail to meet enrollment criteria for other PD1 or PDL1 trials solely due to low or negative predictive biomarkers. 5. Subjects with active autoimmune diseases or history of autoimmune diseases should be excluded. 6. Subjects should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. 7. Has history of interstitial lung disease or noninfectious pneumonitis except for those induced by radiation therapies.. 8. Known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus; 9. Active infection requiring therapy, positive tests for Hepatitis B surface antigen or Hepatitis C ribonucleic acid (RNA); 10. Underlying medical conditions that, in the Investigator's opinion, will make the administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the interpretation of toxicity determination or adverse events; 11. Prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy or any investigational therapies used to control cancer must have been completed at least 4 weeks or at least 5 halflives (whichever is shorter) before study drug administration, and all adverse events have either returned to baseline or stabilized. 12. Use of any vaccines against infectious diseases (e.g., influenza, varicella, etc.) within 4 weeks (28 days) of initiation of study therapy and 60 days after the last administration of the study medication.</criteria>
