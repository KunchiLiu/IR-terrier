	<brief_summary>The current standard of care for unresectable locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a combination of chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy (TRT). The standard regimens consist of platinum-based doublet chemotherapy.Icotinib(BPI-2009, Conmana) is the first self-developed small molecular drug in China for targeted therapy of lung cancer.Icotinib is a novel oral quinazoline compound that has proven survival benefit in Chinese patients with lung cancer,especially in EGFR mutation lung cancer. This randomised, multi-center, controlled trial is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of icotinib with concurrent radiotherapy versus pemetrexed + carboplatin with concurrent radiotherapy in inoperable stage III non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutation, the primary endpoint is progression-free survival.</brief_summary>
