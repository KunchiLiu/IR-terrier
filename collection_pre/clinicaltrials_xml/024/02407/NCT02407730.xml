	<brief_summary>Both hereditary and acquired thrombophilia have been associated with recurrent miscarriage and pregnancy complications. Thrombophilia could favor the development of thrombosis of the maternal vasculature and obstacle placentation. Some studies have suggested a role of thrombophilia in the failure of assisted reproductive techniques although this association has been recently questioned. The scope of this study is to evaluate the effect of thrombophilia on the implantation rate and live birth rate in women undergoing ART. Design: prospective, observational study Primary end-point: live birth rate. Secondary end-points: implantation rate, venous thromboembolic events during ART up to 6 weeks post-partum</brief_summary>
