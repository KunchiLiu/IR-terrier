	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the efficacy of MR-HIFU ablation of breast cancer. Ten patients with early-stage breast cancer with a maximum diameter of 3 cm undergo MR-HIFU ablation, followed by MRI and surgical resection to evaluate treatment effect. The main purpose of the study is to demonstrate the feasibility of total tumor ablation with MR-HIFU. The secondary objective is safety assessment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Women, aged 18 years and older. Able to give informed consent herself. World Health Organization (WHO) performance score ≤ 2. Biopsy proven cT12 N02 MX invasive breast cancer with a size of ≤ 3.0 cm. Histological type of tumor: invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). The target breast fits in the cup of the dedicated MRHIFU breast system. Patient weight is limited to &lt; 80 kg The distance of the tumor, including a 5 mm margin around the tumor, from the skin, nipple and pectoral wall is at least 1.0 cm measured on MRI. The tumor is located within the reach of the HIFU beam produced by the transducers in the HIFU breast system. Prior treatment with: neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the past 3 months or radiotherapy or thermal therapy or surgery of any kind in the targeted breast. Discrepancy between biopsy and Mammaprint in patients of ≥ 35 years old, with no lymphadenopathy and a tumor of 12 cm. I.e. biopsy shows Bloom &amp; Richardson grade I and Mammaprint indicates unfavorable prognosis or biopsy shows Bloom &amp; Richardson grade II or III and Mammaprint indicates favorable prognosis. Contraindications to MR imaging according to the hospital guidelines (e.g. pacemaker in situ, severe claustrophobia, big metal implants, body size incompatible with MR bore). Contraindications to administration of gadoliniumbased contrast agent, including: prior allergic reaction to a gadoliniumbased contrast agent, kidney disease (e.g. nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy) and/or renal failure (GFR &lt; 30 ml/min/1,73m2). Contraindications for procedural sedation analgesia with Propofol and Esketamine or Propofol and Remifentanil. Macro calcifications at mammography in or around the targeted tumor. Extensive intraductal components in the lesion determined by biopsy. Scar tissue or surgical clips in the HIFU beam path. Inability to lie in prone position. Pregnancy or lactation. Communication barrier with patient.</criteria>
