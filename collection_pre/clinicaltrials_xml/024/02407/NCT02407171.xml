	<brief_summary>This is a 2-part prospective trial examining the ability of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) to induce a response to MK-3475, a humanized antibody to PD-1, in patients who progress on this antibody. Patients with metastatic melanoma will be enrolled after they have progressed on anti-PD-1 therapy. Patients with metastatic NSCLC (previously untreated with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy) will be enrolled and treated with MK-3475 until they exhibit progression of disease. At this point (when patients have demonstrated progression of disease) a single target lesion will be selected and treated with SBRT, and then MK-3475 will be restarted and continued until there is further progression of disease. The first phase of the study is a radiation dose escalation with a constant dose of MK-3475. The second part of the study includes expansion cohorts of NSCLC and melanoma patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating the Combination of MK-3475 and Sterotactic Body Radiotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma or NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The phase 1b portion of the trial is a radiation dose escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SBRT when given to patients previously and subsequently exposed to MK-3475. Because the class of PD-1 inhibitory antibodies conveys a risk of pneumonitis, there will be two parallel dose escalation arms- Arm A will include SBRT targets in the lung parenchyma, and Arm B will be limited to targets outside the lung parenchyma. Each arm will be separately escalated, and two MTDs will be determined. The starting dose will be 3000 cGy in 5 fractions; there will be one dose escalation cohort (3000 cGy in 3 fractions), and if necessary one dose de-escalation cohort (1000 cGy in a single fraction). If there is dose-limiting toxicity at the lowest cohort, that arm will be closed and SBRT to that site will be discontinued. The phase 2a portion of the study includes 2 expansion cohorts, for melanoma and NSCLC, with SBRT delivered at the MTD. The primary endpoint of this phase of the study is the overall response rate to post-SBRT MK-3475. Secondary endpoints include determining the time to progression, overall survival, and exploratory biomarkers. IND exempt per FDA. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Updated 4/7/2016</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial. Have metastatic melanoma or NSCLC, or locally advanced NSCLC not suitable for curativeintent local therapy. For melanoma patients and NSCLC patients treated with prior antiPD1 therapy, patients must have received prior PD1 therapy and have progressed (irPD) by irRC. Have 2 or more measurable sites of disease as defined by either RECIST 1.1, or cutaneous lesions at least 1 cm in greatest dimension Have at least one site of disease that is considered potentially suitable for treatment with SBRT Have provided tissue from an archival or newly obtained tissue sample of a tumor lesion, sufficient for analysis of PDL1 and other biomarkers. Patients who have had PDL1 analysis previously performed at Merck can substitute earlier analysis results and are not required to submit additional tissue for PDL1 testing. Expression of PDL1 is NOT required for study entry. Have a performance status of 0, 1 or 2 on the ECOG Performance Scale. Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in Table 1, all screening labs should be performed within 28 days of protocol treatment. Table 1. Adequate Organ Function Laboratory Values (System/Labratory Value) Hematological Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500 /mcL Platelets ≥100,000 / mcL Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL Renal Measured or calculated creatinine** clearance ≤1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) (GFR can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl) ≥60 mL/min for subject with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN Hepatic Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR Direct bilirubin Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 ULN AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN for subjects with liver metastases **(Creatinine clearance should be calculated per institutional standard. ) Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication (Reference Section 5.7.2). Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year. Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy Has had radiation therapy within 2 weeks of the first protocol treatment. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or using an investigational device within 2 weeks of the first protocol treatment. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 2 weeks of the first protocol treatment. The use of lowdose steroids for management of chronic conditions is allowed. Nonsmall cell lung cancer patients enrolling to MK3475 as first protocol therapy (no prior antiPD1 therapy): Has had a prior monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks prior to first protocol treatment or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks of the first protocol treatment or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent. Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study. Note: Patients who have had prior treatments with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (e.g. Tarceva) require only a 72hour washout period prior to starting protocol treatment. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy. Has known active and untreated brain (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate. Has an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Subjects with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an example of an exception to this rule. Subjects that require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be excluded from the study. Those with a history of hypothyroidism who are now stable on hormone replacement will not be excluded. Those with Sjorgen's syndrome will not be excluded from the study. Has a history of (noninfectious) pneumonitis that required steroids, current pneumonitis or evidence of interstitial lung disease. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.
