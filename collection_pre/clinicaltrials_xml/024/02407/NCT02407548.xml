	<brief_summary>In previous study the investigators found that CoQ10 can improve cholesterol efflux from macrophages in cell model, ApoE mice model and small-scale of healthy volunteers. In addition, CoQ10 has strong antioxidant activity and is an essential factor of mitochondria electron transport chain. So the investigators hypothesize that CoQ10 may have some health promotion effect on dyslipidemia, risk factor of atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases. On this purpose, the investigators are going to recruit 150 dyslipidemia patients to supply CoQ10+vitamin E or CoQ10 alone or placebo in different doses for 24 weeks to explore the effects of CoQ10 on cholesterol efflux and lipid profiles on dyslipidemia.</brief_summary>
