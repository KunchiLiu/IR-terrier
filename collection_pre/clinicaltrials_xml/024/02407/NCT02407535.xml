	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators aim to assess the diagnostic performance of intraoperative, ultrasonographic assessment of the surgical extracted uterus for determining myometrial invasion's depth in comparison to preoperative ultrasound, intraoperative gross inspection and final pathological report (gold standard). The investigators hope that intraoperative gross inspection of the extracted uterus might offer an additional intraoperative tool for assessing the need for pelvic lymphadenectomy in early stage of endometrial cancer at least as good as pathological exam.</brief_summary>
