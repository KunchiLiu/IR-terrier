	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to thoroughly investigate how the interaction between black rice and human gut microbiota affects metabolic diseases, this study will recruit patients with Metabolic Syndrome (MS) and provide them with dietary supplementation of black rice (50 g/day) for 3 months to observe its effect on the development of MS. The focuses of this project are to elucidate how black rice consumption affects the composition and metabolism of intestinal bacteria as well as the development of MS, and to further analyze whether the changes in intestinal bacteria are associated with the changes in MS improvements.</brief_summary>
