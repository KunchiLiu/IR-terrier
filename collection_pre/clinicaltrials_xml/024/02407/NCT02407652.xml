	<brief_title>Cognitive Control Training for Remitted Depressed Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective studies have linked impaired cognitive control to increased cognitive vulnerability for future depression. Importantly, experimental studies indicate that cognitive control training can be used to reduce rumination and depressive symptomatology in MDD samples. Furthermore, studies exploring the potential of cognitive control training in at-risk undergraduate students indicate that cognitive control training has beneficial effects on rumination, an important vulnerability factor for depression. Provided that remitted depressed patients form a high-risk group for developing future depressive episodes, the current study will explore whether internet-delivered cognitive control training can be used to reduce vulnerability for future depression in remitted depressed patients. The investigators will explore effects on depressive symptomatology, (mal-)adaptive emotion regulation (directly following training and at 3 months follow-up), and indices of functioning (at 3 months follow-up).</detailed_description>
