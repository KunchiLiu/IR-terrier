	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the myocardial protection against perioperative ischemia comparing two standard anesthetic regimes in diabetic patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Half of the patients will receive volatile anesthesia while the other half will receive total intravenous anesthesia. Primary and secondary outcome parameters will be assessed after induction of anesthesia, at the end of the procedure and postoperative day 1 to 3.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Volatile anaesthetics such as Sevoflurane have shown to have a protective effect regarding myocardial ischemia in the perioperative setting - the so-called "preconditioning". However the observed response of preconditioning in clinical trials is not consistent. An increased perioperative insulin resistance especially in diabetic patients resulting in an increased postoperative morbidity and mortality may be responsible for these findings. In an animal model, the use of propofol that is being routinely applied for general anesthesia was associated with a change of the insulin receptor substrate via phosphorylation and thus a change of insulin resistance. Avoiding a total intravenous anesthesia and applying a volatile anesthesia may result in an increased cardioprotective effect by a reduction of the perioperative insulin resistance.</detailed_description>
