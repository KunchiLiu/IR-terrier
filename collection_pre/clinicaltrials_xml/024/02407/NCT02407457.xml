	<brief_summary>The objective of this post-market study is to evaluate Endologix AFX endovascular AAA system with anatomical fixation against other approved Endovascular systems with proximal fixation. Multiple U.S clinical centers will be involved in the study to include a broad range of experience. Imaging data will be evaluated by an independent core lab.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post-Market Study to Assess Outcomes of Patients Treated With AFX System Compared to Other EVAR Devices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a prospective, randomized, multi-center study, intended to evaluate the outcomes of contemporary EVAR (Endovascular Aneurysm Repair) in a real world population. The study is designed to compare the anatomically stabilized AFX Endograft System to a reference group of proximally fixated EVAR devices. Patients will be randomized between the two groups. Randomization will be 1:1. Each investigator will select one comparator device of their choice before enrolling the first patient. The study will sequentially evaluate non-inferiority and superiority hypotheses. Up to 80 sites with experience in EVAR and up to 800 subjects will participate in this study.</detailed_description>
