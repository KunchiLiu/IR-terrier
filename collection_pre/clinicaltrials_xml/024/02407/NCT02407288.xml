	<detailed_description>Total number of scheduled patients to be recruited: 46 We used the effect size of the study of Ruffini and colleagues (2009) in which rTMS was used to target the left orbito frontal cortex to calculate the number of patients to be recruited. With a risk alpha of 5%, a power of 80%, the number of patients to be included was 46 with an anticipated rate of 10% of lost to follow-up patients. (calculation was made on the http://www.spc.univ-lyon1.fr/mfcalc/NSN/assistant.htm) Statistical analysis to address the primary and secondary objectives: Chi squared test will be applied for quantitative data.</detailed_description>
