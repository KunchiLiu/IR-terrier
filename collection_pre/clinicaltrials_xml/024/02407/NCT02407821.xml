	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators hypothesize that antidepressant therapy may improve the overall welling of patients with acute or chronic kidney disease when given around the time of starting chronic dialysis therapy. This study is a pilot, randomized controlled trial that aims to examine whether prescribing oral escitalopram to all incident dialysis patients is safe and feasible.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Routine Use of SSRI's at the Initiation of End-stage Renal Disease Treatment (RoSIE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 120,000 people with kidney disease start chronic dialysis therapy across North America each year. In addition to high mortality, studies uniformly report high rates of depression, pain and non-specific symptoms after dialysis is started. Suicide rates are high, particularly early in the treatment history, and withdrawal from dialysis is increasingly common in recent years, suggesting a high burden of depressive symptoms. While various treatments appear to be effective, there are multiple barriers preventing patients from getting or accepting appropriate care for depression. The investigators hypothesize that antidepressant therapy may improve morbidity and mortality when prescribed to patients with acute or chronic kidney disease (CKD) around the time of starting chronic dialysis therapy. This is a phase II, multi-centre, double blind, randomized controlled trial to compare the safety and feasibility of oral escitalopram to placebo in incident dialysis patients. Those who have started chronic dialysis therapy within 12 weeks of being identified will be eligible for the study. Participants will randomized 1:1 to receive either escitalopram or placebo daily for 26 weeks. The primary outcome is feasibility in terms of recruitment rates and protocol compliance. The secondary outcomes include estimates of safety (adverse events) and efficacy (hospitalization days, mortality, and changes in depression and quality of life scores). This pilot trial is intended to guide and inform the design of a full scale study to evaluate whether the routine use of escitalopram can improve the quality of life and hospital free days in patients on dialysis, as compared to placebo.</detailed_description>
