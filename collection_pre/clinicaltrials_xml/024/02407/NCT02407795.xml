	<brief_summary>A randomized, multicentre, phase III study comparing conventional radiotherapy (1x8Gy) with stereotactic radiotherapy (1x20Gy) for pain reduction and quality of life in spinal metastases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Conventional With Stereotactic Radiotherapy for Pain Reduction and Quality of Life in Spinal Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study population: patients with painful spinal metastases from solid tumors without spinal cord compression or cord instability. Objective: This study will test the hypothesis that stereotactic radiotherapy gives a better and longer lasting reduction of pain, local control and therewith a better quality of life. This in order to optimize and to individualize the treatment options for the patient. Study design: Complaints due to pain will be analysed using the validated Dutch Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and side-effects will be recorded using the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). In addition to this the quality of life will be analysed using the EORTC QOL-C15-PAL and EORTC QLQ-BM22 questionnaires. For analysis of cost-effectiveness the EQ-5D will be used.</detailed_description>
