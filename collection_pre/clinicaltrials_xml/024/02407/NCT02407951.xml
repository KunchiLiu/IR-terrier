	<brief_summary>Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics. The most studied and promising intervention is Habit Reversal Training (HRT) and its variations: Behavioral Comprehensive Intervention for Tics (CBIT). Group intervention for children with TS has not been evaluated. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of CBIT group intervention compared with Psycho-Educational-Supportive group in terms of tic severity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Group Intervention for Children With Chronic Tics Syndrome or Tourette Syndrome: CBIT vs Psycho-Educational Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a neuro-developmental disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics, frequently associated with behavioral and functional problems, impacting significantly on children's quality of life . Current evidence supports the contribution of individual behavioral treatment for TS both for reducing tics and improving children's quality of life. The most studied and promising intervention is Habit Reversal Training (HRT) and its variations: Behavioral Comprehensive Intervention for Tics (CBIT). One of the developments of behavioral treatments is group interventions, supported in various types of psychological difficulties, adding benefit of providing peer support. However, group intervention for children with TS has not been empirically evaluated. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of CBIT group intervention. We hypothesize that CBIT group intervention will be more effective than Psycho-Educational-Supportive (PES) group in terms of tic severity, and that both groups will be effective in quality of life measures.</detailed_description>
