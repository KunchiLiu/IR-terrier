	<brief_summary>Traditionally, Black Seed (Nigella sativa) is a well-known food supplement and herbal product that has a wide range of medical claims (including asthma) that originate from different historical backgrounds. Today in the era of Evidence-based medicine, it is hard to accept those traditional medical claims of medicinal plants without valid scientific experiments. Thus, randomized clinical trials is important to rational the uses of herbal products. Asthma is a common chronic disorder of the airways, characterized by variable reversible and recurring symptoms related to airflow obstruction, bronchial hyper-responsiveness, and underlying inflammation. In Saudi Arabia, Asthma is considered one of the leading chronic diseases affecting more than 2 million Saudi citizens. The global Asthma Report 2014 considered Asthma as an epidemic disease probably affecting about 334 million people worldwide and becoming a global health priority. This project investigates the use of herbal products to enhance asthma control in Saudi Arabia. In this context, Black Seed is one of the common herbal products used traditionally for asthma in the Saudi region. Black seed is a common unconventional therapy used among 10% of Asthmatic patients in King Abdulaziz Medical city, Riyadh.
