	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Training With Laser Guidance Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: The loss of depth perception due to working in a three-dimensional space based on two-dimensional images is one of the challenging aspects of laparoscopy compared to conventional open surgery. Objectives: To examine the effect of laser visual guidance on laparoscopic performance and cognitive load in a simulated setting for novices. Methods: Randomised Clinical Trial- Laser visual guidance vs. normal 2 D vision. Outcomes: Primary outcome: Motor skills performance parameters-movement-time: Cumulative instrument movement-time for both the right and left instrument for the test session, Secondary outcome: 2) The overall composite score. Exploratory outcomes: 3) The NASA Task Load index (NASA-TLX).</detailed_description>
