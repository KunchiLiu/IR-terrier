	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of ustekinumab in adult participants with active nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-AxSpA) measured by the reduction in signs and symptoms of nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-AxSpA).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Safety Study of Ustekinumab in Participants With Active Nonradiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ustekinumab in the treatment of participants with active non-radiographic axial spondylo arthritis. Participants will receive either placebo or ustekinumab 45 or 90 milligram (mg). Participants will primarily be assessed for Assessment of Spondylo Arthritis (ASAS) International Society criteria 20 at Week 24. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
