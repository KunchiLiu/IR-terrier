	<brief_title>An Open-Label, Phase 2a Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of GR-MD-02 for Treatment of Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall objective is to establish the safety and efficacy of GR-MD-02 in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Primary objective: The objective is to evaluate the number of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who have 75% improvement in Psoriasis Activity Severity Index (PASI-75) following 12 weeks of therapy with GR-MD-02 Secondary objectives: - To determine the PASI-50 and PASI-100 scores in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis following the first 12 weeks of therapy with GR-MD-02 - To determine the PASI-50, PASI-75, and PASI-100 scores in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis following an additional 12 weeks of therapy (total 24 weeks) with GR-MD-02 - To determine the durability of response to therapy in responders over a one year period following the end of therapy - To determine whether there is any change in disease status of patients who also have psoriatic arthritis - To determine the incidence of adverse events and vital sign and laboratory abnormalities during study treatment</detailed_description>
