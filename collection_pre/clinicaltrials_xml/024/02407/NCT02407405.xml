	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well selumetinib works in treating patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 and plexiform neurofibromas (tumors which arise from the nerves) that cannot be removed by surgery (inoperable). Selumetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selumetinib in Treating Patients With Neurofibromatosis Type 1 and Plexiform Neurofibromas That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate (plexiform neurofibromas [PN] volume decrease &gt;= 20% compared to baseline) to selumetinib in adult patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and inoperable PN. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Correlate 3 dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) responses with percent target inhibition (phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinase [pERK]) in PN biopsies obtained pretreatment and on treatment with selumetinib. II. Pathology evaluation of tumor changes on treatment with selumetinib. III. Analyze paired biopsies for mechanisms of response and resistance to selumetinib: measurement of phosphorylated v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (pAKT), tumor kinome, and tumor transcriptome. IV. Compare pERK inhibition in dermal neurofibromas and in PN. V. Evaluate immune infiltrate of plexiform neurofibromas, as well as peripheral blood for presence of circulating tumor cells. VI. Evaluate steady state pharmacokinetics of selumetinib (in blood) and correlate steady state levels with response and pERK inhibition. VII. Analyze bone marrow derived precursor cells and cytokines from blood samples obtained pretreatment and on treatment with selumetinib. VIII. Compare volumetric response and target inhibition and pathway activation in PN and nodular lesions. IX. Establish patient derived xenografts. X. Characterize the effect of selumetinib on pain, quality of life, and physical functioning. XI. Determine baseline functional impairments secondary to PN, and the effect of selumetinib on functional outcomes depending on PN location. XII. Determine the effect of selumetinib on the PN growth rate based on volumetric analysis of MRI studies obtained prior to enrollment (if available and amenable to volumetric analysis). XIII. Determine time to progression (TTP) and progression free survival (PFS) in progressive PN (&gt;= 20% increase in PN volume within 12-15 months prior to enrollment). XIV. Evaluate change in dermal neurofibroma burden using digital photography. OUTLINE: Patients receive selumetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) (approximately every 12 hours) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have a documented germline NF1 mutation in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory or a diagnosis of NF1 based on clinical National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus criteria of at least one other diagnostic criterion in addition to the presence of a PN; NF1 mutation analysis will be performed on germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as described by Messiaen &amp; Wimmer; histologic confirmation of tumor is not necessary in the presence of consistent clinical and imaging findings, but should be considered if malignant transformation of a PN is clinically suspected; additional criteria are as follows: Six or more caf√©aulait macules (&gt;= 0.5cm in prepubertal subjects or &gt;= 1.5 cm in post pubertal subjects) Freckling in axilla or groin Optic glioma Two or more Lisch nodules A distinctive bony lesion (dysplasia of the sphenoid bone or dysplasia or thinning of long bone cortex) A firstdegree relative with NF1 Patients must have at least one measurable PN, defined as a lesion of at least 3 cm measured in one dimension; patients who underwent surgery for resection of a PN are eligible provided the PN was incompletely resected and is measurable as per criteria above; measurability and suitability for volumetric MRI analysis of the target PN must be confirmed with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Pediatric Oncology Branch (POB) prior to enrolling a patient; the target PN will be defined as the clinically most relevant PN, which has to be amenable to volumetric MRI analysis; PN will be classified as "typical" or "nodular" prior to enrollment The PN must be inoperable, defined as a PN that cannot be surgically completely removed without risk for substantial morbidity due to: encasement of or close proximity to vital structures, invasiveness, or high vascularity of the PN; the PN either causes morbidity or it is growing and has the potential to cause morbidity such as (but not limited to): head and neck lesions that could compromise the airway or great vessels, brachial or lumbar plexus lesions that could cause nerve compression and loss of function, lesions that could result in major deformity (e.g., orbital lesions) or are significantly disfiguring, and lesions of the extremity that cause limb hypertrophy or loss of function or pain; PN growth will be defined as a &gt;= 20% increase in PN volume within approximately 3 years prior to enrollment on this trial Patients must have a PN amenable to a percutaneous biopsy to participate in the biopsy portion of this study, and must be willing to undergo pre, and on treatment tumor biopsies; there should be no contraindication for serial biopsies; NOTE: up to 10 patients who meet all criteria, but have PN which cannot be biopsied safely, will be eligible for the treatment portion of the study Must be able to undergo serial MRI scans for response evaluation Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt;
