	<brief_summary>Elderberries (Sambuci fructus) have been shown in a number of studies to have significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Multiple human and animal studies have supported the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of elderberry preparations and it has been used in natural medicine for hundreds of years. Studies examining factors that may decrease the risk of Alzheimer's disease have revealed that drinking juices with similar properties to elderberries is one of the most reliable way to decrease risk. As such the investigators wish to determine the effects of elderberry juice on cognitive decline in a group of subjects at high risk for Alzheimer's disease, those with mild cognitive impairment. Elderberry juice is a commercially available nutritional supplement and easily available to this population.</brief_summary>

Currently making changes to other drugs that might affect cognitive performance (subjects showing the greatest cognitive decline and other signs of Alzheimer's disease may be prescribed cholinesterase inhibitors as this is a standard of care for Alzheimer's disease but not MCI). Presence of any condition the health professional believes will impair ability to complete study procedures (ex. terminal illness, comorbid major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, or drug abuse).
