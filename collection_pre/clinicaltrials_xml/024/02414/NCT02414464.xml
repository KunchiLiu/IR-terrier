	<brief_title>Tooth Bleaching for Young Patients Using a Hydrogen Peroxide-based Gel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized, controlled, clinical trial was conducted with 53 patients aged 11 to 24 years who were allocated to groups based on the use of the following commercial products: Whiteness HP - FGM® (35% hydrogen peroxide); Whiteness HP Blue Calcium - FGM® (35% hydrogen peroxide); and Whiteness HP Blue Calcium - FGM® (20% hydrogen peroxide). After the bleaching procedure, the visual analog scale was used to measure tooth sensitivity and the classic Vita® scale was used to determine changes in tooth color. Statistical analysis involved the Friedman, Kruskal-Wallis and Student-Newman-Keuls tests, with p-value ≤ 0.05 or ≤ 0.0001 considered indicative of statistical significance.</detailed_description>
