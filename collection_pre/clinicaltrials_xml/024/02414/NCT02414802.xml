	<brief_title>Study of a Novel Thrombectomy Device to Treat Acute Iliofemoral Deep Venous Thrombosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Catheter-directed thrombolysis will be performed in eligible patients with acute IF-DVT. A combined mechanical thrombectomy will be used to clear the iliac thrombi in experimental group. The immediate, mid- and long-term outcomes will be recorded. Quantitative data wiil be expressed as mean Â± SD, and will be compared with independent-sample t-test or paired-sample t-test. Count data will be expressed as a ratio (or percentage), and the chi-square test or the fisher's exact test will be used for comparisons. A difference with P &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses will be performed using IBM SPSS, version 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</detailed_description>
