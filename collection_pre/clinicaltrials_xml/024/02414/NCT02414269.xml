	<brief_summary>The purpose of this Phase I study is to test the safety of different doses of specially prepared immune cells (called "T cells") collected from blood. The Investigators want to find a safe dose of these modified T cells for patients who have malignant pleural disease. They want to find out what effects these T cells have on the patient and the cancer (MPD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Malignant Pleural Disease Treated With Autologous T Cells Genetically Engineered to Target the Cancer-Cell Surface Antigen Mesothelin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, dose-escalating, non randomized, single-center, phase I study of mesothelin-targeted T cells administered intrapleurally as a single infusion in patients with a diagnosis (histologically or cytologically documented) of MPD from mesothelioma, lung cancer, or breast cancer. The total number of patients studied will depend on the number of dose levels tested, up to a maximum dose of 3×10^6 mesothelin-targeted T cells/kg or until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with MPD aged ≥18 years Karnofsky performance status ≥70% Patients with malignant pleural disease (MPD), pathologically confirmed at MSKCC (radiographic confirmation is acceptable for screening phase eligibility), and defined as one of the following (patients who have not yet received treatment may enroll in the screening portion only): 1. Malignant pleural mesothelioma previously treated with at least one prior treatment regimen. 2. Nonsmall cell lung cancer metastatic to the pleura—previously treated with at least one prior treatment regimen (chemotherapy or targeted agent) and documented progression of disease. Patients with disease outside of the pleura will be discussed among study PI and CoPIs prior to considered eligible for the study. Disease outside of the pleura must not require any immediate therapy per PI's discretion. 3. Breast cancer metastatic to the pleura— previously treated with at least one prior treatment regimen (chemotherapy or targeted agent) and documented progression of disease. Patients with disease outside of the pleura will be discussed among study PI and CoPIs prior to be considered eligible for the study. Disease outside of the pleura must not require any immediate therapy per PI's discretion. Expression of mesothelin must be confirmed by meeting one of the following criteria. 1. Mesothelin expression (&gt;10% of the tumor expressing mesothelin) by immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis 2. Elevated serum SMRP levels (&gt;0.4 nM/L). Free flowing pleural effusion requiring management by placement of a pleural catheter. Patients with a functional pleural catheter already in place are eligible for the study, as long as there are no clinical concerns of infection. OR No freeflowing pleural effusion: an Interventional Radiologist has agreed that radiologyguided intrapleural injection of the CAR T cells is feasible. Chemotherapy, targeted therapy (such as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor) or radiotherapy must have been completed at least 14 days prior to administration of T cells. Continuation of hormonal therapy (ie for breast cancer) is acceptable. Prior immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade (i.e. PD1 inhibitor, PDL1 inhibitor or CTL4antagonist or similar agent) must have been completed more than 1 month1prior to the T cell infusion. Chemotherapy must have been completed at least 7 days prior to leukapheresis Any major thoracic (thoracotomy with lung or esophageal resection) or abdominal (laparotomy with organ resection) operation must have occurred at least 28 days before study enrollment. Patients who have undergone diagnostic VATS or laparoscopy can be included in the study. All acute toxic effects of any previous radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or surgical procedures must have resolved to grade I or lower according to CTCAE (version 4.0). Lab requirements (hematology) White blood cell (WBC) count ≥3000 cells/mm3 Absolute neutrophil count ≥1500 neutrophils/mm3 Platelet count ≥100,000 platelets/mm3 Lab requirements (serum chemistry) Bilirubin ≤ 1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) Serum alanine aminotransferase and serum aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST) ≤.5x ULN Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5x ULN or Cr &gt; 1.5x ULN, but calculated clearances of &gt;60 Negative screen for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) antigen, and hepatitis C virus (HCV). If testing was performed during the previous 3 months, there is no need to repeat testing, as long as documentation of results is provided to the study site. Subjects must receive counseling and sign a separate informed consent form for HIV testing. Subjects and their partners with reproductive potential must agree to use an effective form of contraception during the period of drug administration and for 4 weeks after completion of the last administration of the study drug. An effective form of contraception is defined as oral contraceptives plus 1 form of barrier or doublebarrier method contraception (condom with spermicide or condom with diaphragm). Subjects must be able to understand the potential risks and benefits of the study and must be able to read and provide written, informed consent for the study Any prior history of brain metastases Nonsmall cell lung cancer metastatic to the pleura that extends outside of the pleura requiring immediate therapy Breast cancer metastatic to the pleura that extends outside of the pleura requiring immediate therapy Prior history of seizure disorder Patients currently receiving treatment for concurrent active malignancy Continuation of hormonal therapy (i.e. for breast cancer) is acceptable. Prior immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade (i.e. PD1 inhibitor, PDL1 inhibitor or CTL4antagonist or similar agent) must have been completed more than 1 month prior to the T cell infusion. Autoimmune or antibodymediated disease, including but not limited to systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and temporal arteritis (Patients with a history of hypothyroidism will not be excluded) Clinically significant cardiac disease (New York Heart Association class III/IV) or severe debilitating pulmonary disease Pregnant or lactating women An infection requiring antibiotic treatment within 7 days before the start of treatment (day 0) A requirement for daily systemic corticosteroids for any reason or a requirement for other immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents. Topical, nasal, and inhaled steroids are permitted. Administration of live, attenuated vaccine within 8 weeks before the start of treatment (day 0) and throughout the study Any other medical condition that, in the opinion of the PI, may interfere with a subject's participation in or compliance with the study</criteria>
