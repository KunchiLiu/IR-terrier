	<criteria>Children with documented cow's milk allergy, confirmed by one of the following criteria, within six months prior to study start (visit 2): Positive doubleblind, placebocontrolled oral food challenge (DBPCFC) with cow's milk OR Positive open or singleblind oral food challenge with cow's milk carried out under the supervision of a specialist in children with clear immediate reactions and a positive test for specific IgE (in serum [sIgE&gt;0,35 KUI/L] or skin prick test [SPT ≥ 3 mm]) OR Reported convincing allergic symptoms following an exposure to milk or a milkcontaining food product and detectable serum milkspecific IgE or positive skin prick test Aged ≤12 years of age at screening. Expected consumption of a minimum of 250ml of study formula per day during the open challenge. Written informed consent from one or both parents (depending on the local legislation) or legal representative. Children who receive breastfeeding at study enrolment. Had any chronic medical diseases, chromosomal or major congenital anomalies, or major gastrointestinal disease/abnormalities (other the CMPA); had immunodeficiency; antihistamine [excluding eye drops] use in 7 days prior to a food challenge or oral steroid use within 14 days prior to enrolment; unstable asthma; severe uncontrolled eczema; Severe anaphylactic reaction [required ≥ 2 doses of epinephrine] to milk or breast milk within the past 2 years; Existing illness that could interfere with formula acceptance or identification of allergic reactions. Investigator's uncertainty about the willingness or ability of the parents to comply with the protocol requirements. Participation in any other studies involving investigational or marketed products concomitantly or within two weeks prior to entry into the study.</criteria>
