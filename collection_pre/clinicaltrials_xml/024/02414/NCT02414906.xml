	<brief_summary>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication in critically ill patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) and it is associated with increased morbimortality. There is evidence that perioperative hemodynamic optimization decreases the incidence of AKI in the post operative phase in high-risk patients. We aimed to evaluate if the use of a goal-directed therapy to increase oxygen delivery in the early phase of acute kidney injury can decrease the prevalence of patients with acute renal failure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Goal Directed Therapy for Acute Kidney Injury in Critical Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized, controlled, multicenter study.The intervention group was monitored with Flo Trac/Vigileo and optimized with fluid challenges, dobutamine and blood transfusion, if necessary, to maintain a IDO² ≥600ml/min/m² during 8h. The control group was treated according to the discretion of the attending physician.</detailed_description>
