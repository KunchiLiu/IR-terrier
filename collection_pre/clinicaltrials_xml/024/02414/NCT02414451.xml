	<brief_title>Trial of Propranolol in Adults and Adolescents With ASD and Predictors of Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators' specific aim is to examine the effects of serial doses of propranolol on social interaction, and secondarily on language tasks, anxiety, adaptive behaviors, and global function in high functioning adults and adolescents with autism in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. The investigators will also examine whether response to treatment can be predicted based upon markers of autonomic functioning, such as skin conductance and heart rate variability, and whether anxiety predicts treatment response. The investigators' hypothesis is that social functioning and language abilities will benefit from serial doses of propranolol, as the investigators have demonstrated in previous single-dose studies. The investigators also predict that those with the greatest degree of autonomic dysregulation will demonstrate the greatest benefit from the drug.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For participants with autism: Highfunctioning, nativeEnglish speaking subjects with ASD aged 1530. Highfunctioning ASD is defined in this study by the DSMV criteria plus Autism Diagnostic InterviewRevised (ADIR) criteria for Autism, and Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence (WASI) full scale IQ of at least 85. For participants with autism: Nonautism learning disability (e.g. dyslexia), major psychiatric diagnosis (e.g. major depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder), other neurological diagnosis, major head trauma, any of the following exclusionary criteria related to propranolol (diabetes, reactive airway/pulmonary disease, thyroid disease, bradyarrhythmias, unexplained syncope, narrow angle glaucoma, pregnancy, known hypersensitivity/adverse reaction to betablockers), any of the following exclusionary criteria related to placebo (severe allergy to lactose), any of the following exclusionary criteria related to the psychophysiological measurements (history of rash from adhesives).</criteria>
