	<brief_title>Bendamustine Study in Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma Patients Over 60 Treated by Prednisone, Vinblastine and Doxorubicin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The usual treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma is ABVD chemotherapy (Adriamycin (also known as doxorubicin), Bleomycin, Vinblastine and Dacarbazine). Studies have shown that patients aged over 60 years have a lower tolerance and efficiency during this treatment than younger patients. There are particular pulmonary toxicities with bleomycin included in the ABVD treatment. Alternative treatment strategies have been proposed removing bleomycin in the PVAG Protocol (Prednisone, Vinblastine, Adriamycin/Doxorubicin and Gemcitabine) evaluated in more than 60 patients. Compared to ABVD treatment, PVAG treatment presented a more favorable toxicity profile. The quality of response between the two treatments is substantially equal. Bendamustine was evaluated in four studies in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma in relapse and showed higher efficacy than gemcitabine with an acceptable toxicity profile. In this study, the Sponsor and the coordinating investigator propose to replace dacarbazine in the standard ABVD protocol by bendamustine and to stop using bleomycin. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bendamustine in patients treated with prednisone, vinblastine and doxorubicin. This is the PVAB treatment with which LYSARC and the coordinating investigator expect better tolerability and quality response.</detailed_description>
