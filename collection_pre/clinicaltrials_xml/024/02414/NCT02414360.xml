	<brief_title>Using a Systematic Review in Clinical Decision Making: a Pilot Parallel, Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two shortened systematic review formats were developed to enhance their use in clinical decision making. An online randomized controlled trial is planned to make comparisons of the shortened formats to a full-length systematic review. To prepare for the full-scale trial, a pilot study will be conducted to test methods and procedures in order to refine the processes.</detailed_description>
