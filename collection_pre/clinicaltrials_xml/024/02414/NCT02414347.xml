	<brief_summary>This project will collect quantitative pilot data that will allow the characterization of uptake and binding of 18F-AV-1451 (also known as F 18 T807), a novel tau imaging compound, in individuals with and without brain tau fibrils. The primary goal is to develop tau imaging technique as an antecedent biomarker of cognitive decline. The investigators propose to obtain preliminary data that will support the possibility of detecting cognitive decline in its earliest stages, before the occurrence of dementia.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Male or female participants, at least 18 years of age. 2. Cognitively normal, or with mild dementia, as assessed clinically 3. Participant is able and willing to undergo testing (MRI or CT, PET, radioactive tracer injection, LP; for those unable to undergo an MRI, CT will be used to generate regionsofinterest). 4. Premenopausal women will undergo a urine pregnancy test within 24 hours of drug administration. 1. Has any condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, could increase risk to the participant, limit the participant's ability to tolerate the experimental procedures, or interfere with the collection/analysis of the data (for example, participants with severe chronic back pain might not be able to lie still during the scanning procedures). 2. Is deemed likely unable to perform the imaging procedures for any reason. 3. Has a high risk for Torsades de Pointes or is taking medications known to prolong QT interval. 4. Has hypersensitivity to F 18 T807 or any of its excipients. 5. Contraindications to PET, PETCT or MR (e.g. electronic medical devices, inability to lie still for long periods) that make it unsafe for the individual to participate. 6. Severe claustrophobia. 7. Currently pregnant or breastfeeding. 8. For those electing to undergo the optional lumbar puncture: currently on anticoagulant of any form</criteria>
