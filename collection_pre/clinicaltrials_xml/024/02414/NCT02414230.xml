	<criteria>1. Male or female participants, at least 18 years of age. 2. Clinically diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), or both; or a carrier of a mutation known to cause ALS or FTD (with or without symptoms); or a normal control. 3. Participant is able and willing to undergo testing (psychometric testing, MRI or CT, PET, radioactive tracer injection; for those unable to undergo an MRI, CT will be used to generate regionsofinterest). 4. Premenopausal women will undergo a urine pregnancy test within 24 hours of drug administration. 1. Has any condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, could increase risk to the participant, limit the participant's ability to tolerate the experimental procedures, or interfere with the collection/analysis of the data (for example, participants with significant respiratory involvement may not be able to lie flat during the scanning procedures). 2. Is deemed likely unable to perform the imaging procedures for any reason. 3. Has a high risk for Torsades de Pointes or is taking medications known to prolong QT interval. 4. Has hypersensitivity to F 18 T807 or any of its excipients. 5. Contraindications to PET, PETCT or MR (e.g. electronic medical devices, inability to lie still for long periods) that make it unsafe for the individual to participate. 6. Severe claustrophobia. 7. Currently pregnant or breastfeeding.</criteria>
