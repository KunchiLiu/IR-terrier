	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation(AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia in humans. The loss of rate-dependent action potential duration(APD) adaptation is one of the characteristics of atrial fibrillation, but detailed understanding of mechanism is limited. Thus, we propose to utilize the monophasic action potential recording data from human patients in three groups, control, paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation, and apply reverse engineering method to quantify the extent of electrical remodeling of ionic channel parameters using a mathematical model of atrial cell. Our approach will be useful in developing drug targets for ion channels in atrial fibrillation patients.</brief_summary>
