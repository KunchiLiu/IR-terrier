	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well trastuzumab emtansine works in treating older patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive stage I-III breast cancer. HER2 is a protein found on the surface of cancer cells that helps them to grow and spread. Trastuzumab emtansine may kill cancer cells by binding to HER2-positive on the surface of the tumor cells and blocking their ability grow and spread.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trastuzumab Emtansine in Treating Older Patients With Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive Stage I-III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Invasive disease-free survival (IDFS), defined as occurrence of any of the following: ipsilateral invasive breast cancer recurrence, regional invasive breast cancer recurrence, distant recurrence, death attributable to any cause, contralateral invasive breast cancer, or second non-breast invasive cancer. Note: In-situ events are not included. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Overall survival (OS). II. Recurrence-free survival (RFS). III. Adverse events. IV. Cardiac function/adverse events. V. Site of first recurrence. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. The associations of adverse events and outcomes with each of the following will be examined: geriatric assessment (GA), patient reported outcomes (Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event [PRO-CTCAE]), quality of life (QOL), and biomarkers of aging. II. To determine whether clinician-reported CTCAEs are more accurate when PRO-CTCAE data are shared with the patient and clinician. III. Utilize a high-throughput mutation profiling system (Oncomap) to query a large panel of cancer gene mutations in older patients with HER2-positive breast cancers. OUTLINE: Patients receive trastuzumab emtansine intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 17 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6-12 months and then yearly for 4 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>HER2positive disease, defined as immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+ or amplification by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) (HER2/chromosome 17 centromere [CEP17] ratio &gt;= 2 or an average of &gt;= 6 HER2 gene copies per nucleus) confirmed by Central Pathology Review (Mayo Clinic Rochester) prior to patient being registered to begin protocol therapy NOTE: ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) components should not be counted in the determination of HER2 status Stage IIII breast cancer with the following criteria met: If nodenegative or if node status unknown (because it was not assessed), tumor must be &gt; 2 cm (T2 or T3 tumor) or have higherrisk T1c disease (defined as tumor &gt; 1 cm and estrogen receptor [ER]negative and progesteronereceptor [PR] negative); if some ER/PR staining is present, ER and PR negative are defined as being positive in &lt; 10% cells (per local pathology read) If nodepositive (N1N3), T1mi, T1a, T1b, T1c, T2, or T3 tumors are eligible Definition of nodenegative disease (when node status known): if the patient has had a negative sentinel node biopsy and/or a negative axillary dissection, then the patient is determined to be nodenegative; axillary nodes with single cells or tumor clusters =&lt; 0.2 mm by either hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) or IHC will be considered nodenegative; any axillary lymph node with tumor clusters between 0.02 and 0.2 cm is considered a micrometastasis; patients with a micrometastasis are eligible; an axillary dissection is not required to be performed in patients with a positive sentinel node and management of the axilla will be left up to the treating provider; in cases where the specific pathologic size of lymph node involvement is subject to interpretation, the principal investigator will make the final determination as to eligibility; in these special situations, the investigator must document this approval in the patient medical record ER/PR determination assays performed by IHC methods according to the local institution standard protocol Standard chemotherapy/trastuzumab declined by patient OR patient is deemed by physician for any reason to not be a candidate for standard therapy (i.e. patient and/or provider choose not to pursue standard trastuzumabbased chemotherapy regimen because of concerns related to toxicity or patient preference) For patients with bilateral or multifocal/multicentric breast cancers, one of the following criteria must be met to enroll: (1) each cancer individually meets criteria for enrollment (only ONE tumor has to undergo central confirmation for HER2), OR (2) at least one tumor meets eligibility (per tumor size/nodes/subtype outlined above) and the other foci in the ipsilateral or contralateral breast are also HER2positive but are too small for enrollment (e.g., a patient is eligible if a cancer is T2N0 and HER2positive in one breast, but the contralateral breast has a T1b HER2+ cancer that isn't eligible on its own, OR, (3) at least one tumor meets eligibility and the other foci in the ipsilateral or contralateral breast are HER2negative and do not meet criteria for adjuvant chemotherapy per provider discretion (e.g. if a patient has a HER2positive tumor meeting eligibility but also has a second, HER2negative, small, nodenegative, ER+, low grade cancer present, she is still eligible for enrollment); however, in the specific case that a second breast cancer is stage III and HER2negative, that patient is excluded (because the second cancer is highrisk and likely will require nonHER2directed therapy) All tumor removed by either a modified radical mastectomy or a segmental mastectomy (lumpectomy) NOTE: management of axillary lymph nodes is up to the treating provider; however, all surgical margins should be clear of invasive cancer or DCIS (i.e., no tumor on ink); the local pathologist must document negative margins of resection in the pathology report; if all other margins are clear, a positive posterior (deep) margin is permitted, provided the surgeon documents that the excision was performed down to the pectoral fascia and all tumor has been removed; likewise, if all other margins are clear, a positive anterior (superficial; abutting skin) margin is permitted provided the surgeon documents that all tumor has been removed =&lt; 90 days from the patient's most recent breast surgery for this breast cancer Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 02 Baseline ejection fraction &gt;= 50% by multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram performed =&lt;
