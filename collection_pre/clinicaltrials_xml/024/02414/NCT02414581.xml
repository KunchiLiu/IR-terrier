	<brief_title>Mouthwash With Chlorhexidine 0.12%/Ethyl Alcohol 7% Compared to Ethyl Alcohol 7%</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical triple-blind randomized controlled trial. With two arms to the study: 1. Mouth rinses with chlorhexidine-based solution at a concentration of 0.12%, using as a vehicle to 7% ethyl alcohol. 2. Mouthwashes with solution based only 7% ethyl alcohol. GOAL. Assess whether there decrease in the rate of oral colonization by gram-negative bacteria in patients with chemotherapy by using chlorhexidine mouthwash. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES: 1. The rate of the oral colonization by gram-negative bacteria initiation of chemotherapy. 2. The rate of oral colonization by gram-negative bacteria after 10 days of initiation of chemotherapy. 3. Identify microbiologically gram-negative bacteria colonizing the oral cavity. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES 1. The presence of severe neutropenia and fever in each study group during the first 10 days of starting treatment</detailed_description>
