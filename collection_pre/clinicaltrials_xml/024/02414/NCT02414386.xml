	<brief_summary>Several studies point at a potential relationship between vitamin D deficiency and worse outcome in critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit. It is linked with the lack of vitamin D pleiotropic effects in the state of hypovitaminosis D. The pleiotropism of vitamin D is dependent on a specific feature of vitamin D receptor (VDR) namely polymorphism and its universal existence in the human body. Vitamin D pleiotropism is linked with cancer cells inhibition, a modulation of the immune system, an influence on cardiovascular system and neuroprotection. In 35-65% critically ill patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit the acute kidney injury (AKI) is diagnosed. Acute kidney injury increases significantly the probability of death. The standard therapy of a severe AKI in many intensive care units is the regional citrate anticoagulation continuous renal replacement therapy by means of continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF). The specificity of the regional citrate anticoagulation by means of precise ionized calcium and citrate dosing evokes questions regarding its influence on vitamin D and entire calcium-phosphate metabolism in the state of a severe AKI treated with regional citrate anticoagulation continuous renal replacement therapy. The intention of that trial is to measure vitamin D plasma levels and other parameters (parathormone, ionized and total calcium, magnesium, phosphate, albumin, globulin) linked with calcium-phosphate metabolism in the human body. We would like to assess potential relationships between the regional citrate anticoagulation continuous renal replacement therapy and these parameters.</brief_summary>
