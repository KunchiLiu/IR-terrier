	<brief_summary>Depression has emotional consequences, social and important business. Reaching at least 7.5% of French aged 15 to 85 years. General Practitioners are the first professional consulted in terms of frequency of consultations. Indeed, in primary care, 10 to 25% of patients with depression that General Practitioners are often alone to support and follow. But General Practitioners are faced with diagnostic difficulties facing the diagnosis of depression, because if the patient does not engage itself, no tool is validated in France to help them in their diagnosis. However, standardized questionary exist that allow to overcome this difficulty. Questionary used in other european countries. Among them, the HSCL25 scale was selected by a systematic review of literature and a RAND UCLA type of consensus procedure. This HSCL25 scale is the most efficient for the diagnosis of depression in terms of efficiency tool, reproducibility and ergonomics. However, it remains necessary to confirm its validity in terms of the French translation and in terms of efficiency.</brief_summary>
