	<brief_summary>We will enroll patients submitted to breast surgery (in and outsettings) with regional anesthesia. The blinded observers, in the first 48 hours post-operative, will evaluate (telephone interview in outsetting) the pain intensity through the Numeric Rating Scale ( 0= no pain, 10 = worst possible pain) thereby recording the treatment procedures in accordance with usual clinical practice. At the same time we will evaluate the presence of intraoperative or postoperative complications related to regional anesthesia, the PONV rate (post-operative nausea and vomiting) and the analgesic/antiemetic therapy.</brief_summary>
