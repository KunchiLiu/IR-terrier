	<brief_summary>This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled dose-escalation study in adults recently treated for pulmonary TB. The dose of AERAS-402 increased in successive dose groups. Enrollment into a dose group was sequential. Enrollees were stratified based on time from the start of TB treatment. The "on-TB-treatment" stratum started TB treatment between 1 and 4 months (30 to 120 calendar days) prior to Study Day 0. The "post-TB-treatment" stratum started TB treatment at least 12 months (360 calendar days) prior to Study Day 0. Subjects were randomized to receive a placebo or AERAS-402 vaccine. In Dose Groups 1 and 2, subjects were randomized to receive a single injection of AERAS-402 or placebo. Dose Group 3 subjects were randomized to receive two injections on study day 0 and study day 42 of AERAS-402 or placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety of AERAS-402 in Adults Recently Treated for Pulmonary TB</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 72 subjects were randomized into the study. Subjects were stratified, based on time from the start of TB treatment, into the 'on-TB-treatment' stratum (TB treatment started between 1 and 4 months prior to Study Day 0) or the 'post-TB-treatment' stratum (TB treatment started at least 12 months before Study Day 0). In the on-TB-treatment stratum, 36 subjects were randomized to receive AERAS-402 or placebo as follows: 1 or 2 doses of placebo (N=5); 1 dose of AERAS-402 at 3 x 10^8 vp (N=5) or 3 x 10^9 vp (N=10), or 2 doses of AERAS-402 at 3 x 10^10 vp (N=16). In the post-TB-treatment stratum, 36 subjects were randomized to receive AERAS-402 or placebo as follows: 1 or 2 doses of placebo (N=6); 1 dose of AERAS-402 at 3 x 10^8 vp (N=5) or 3 x 109 vp (N=10), or 2 doses of AERAS-402 at 3 x 10^10 vp (N=15).</detailed_description>
