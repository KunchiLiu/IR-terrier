	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ribociclib and gemcitabine hydrochloride in treating patients with solid tumors or lymphoma that have spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment. Ribociclib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving ribociclib together with gemcitabine hydrochloride may work better in treating patients with solid tumors or lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ribociclib and Gemcitabine Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To describe the dose-limiting toxicities and identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase II dose of the combination of LEE011 (ribociclib) and gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) in patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To describe the safety and tolerability of the combination of LEE011 and gemcitabine. II. To describe the pharmacokinetic (PK) of LEE011 in combination with gemcitabine. III. To describe preliminary evidence of efficacy of the combination of LEE011 and gemcitabine. IV. To evaluate the correlation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) amplification (testing by fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH]), retinoblastoma (RB) and P16 expression (by immunohistochemistry) in archived and biopsied tumor tissue with treatment response. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive ribociclib orally (PO) on days 1-14 and gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.</detailed_description>
