	<brief_summary>A phase II study to evaluate antitumor activity of oral cMET inhibitor INC280 in adult patients with EGFR wild-type, advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as measured by overall response rate (ORR). The study will also evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics of INC280.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Stage IIIB or IV NSCLC (any histology) at the time of study entry Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC that is: 1. EGFR wt as per patient standard of care by a validated test 2. AND ALKnegative rearrangement as part of the patient standard of care by a validated test 3. AND (by central assessment) either: Cohort 1: Pretreated patients with cMET GCN ≥ 6 or Cohort 2: Pretreated patients with cMET GCN ≥4 and &lt; 6, or Cohort 3: Pretreated patients with cMET GCN &lt; 4, or Cohort 4: Pretreated patients with cMET mutations regardless of cMET GCN, or Cohort 5: Treatmentnaïve patients with cMET dysregulation To be eligible for Cohorts 14, patients must have failed one or two prior lines of systemic therapy for advanced/metastatic disease To be eligible for Cohort 5, patients must not have received any systemic therapy for advanced/metastatic disease At least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST 1.1 Patients must have recovered from all toxicities related to prior anticancer therapies to grade ≤ 1 (CTCAE v 4.03). Patients with any grade of alopecia are allowed to enter the study. Patients must have adequate organ function ECOG performance status (PS) of 0 or 1 Details and other protocoldefined inclusion criteria may apply Prior treatment with crizotinib, or any other cMET or HGF inhibitor Patients with characterized EGFR mutations that predict sensitivity to EGFR therapy, including, but not limited to exon 19 deletions and exon 21 mutations Patients with characterized ALKpositive rearrangement Clinically significant, uncontrolled heart diseases. Patients receiving treatment with medications that cannot be discontinued at least 1 week prior to first INC280 treatment and for the duration of the study: Strong and moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 Strong inducers of CYP3A4 Impairment of GI function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of INC280 Patients receiving treatment with any enzymeinducing anticonvulsant Applicable to Cohorts 14 only: Previous anticancer and investigational agents within 4 weeks or ≤ 5 x halflife of the agent (whichever is longer) before first dose Pregnant or nursing women Women of childbearing potential, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
