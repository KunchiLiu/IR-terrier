	<brief_summary>This pilot research trial studies patient derived cancer cell lines in identifying molecular changes in patients with previously untreated pancreatic cancer and are receiving gemcitabine hydrochloride-based chemotherapy. Cell lines refer to samples taken from the patient's tumor to grow for many months or years in a laboratory, and can therefore be studied scientifically. Studying cell lines in the laboratory may help doctors understand the genetic changes that occur to the tumor during chemotherapy that allows the tumor to resist or grow despite treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patient Derived Cancer Cell Lines in Identifying Molecular Changes in Patients With Previously Untreated Pancreatic Cancer Receiving Gemcitabine Hydrochloride-Based Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the genetic profile of the tumor after progression has occurred, to the tumor prior to treatment. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Additional molecular patterns, beyond genetics, will be analyzed, including ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein expression. OUTLINE: Tissue and blood samples are collected for genetic analysis via sequencing from patients receiving gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously or gemcitabine hydrochloride and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation. Chemotherapy is not part of the protocol. Per standard of care, patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride (IV) the first 3 of 4 weeks (qw 3/4 wk) or gemcitabine hydrochloride and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV qw 3/4 wk in the absence of disease progression or recurrence.</detailed_description>
