	<brief_summary>This research study is designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of an experimental drug called vonapanitase (PRT-201) in patients both receiving or expecting to receive hemodialysis who have chronic kidney disease and who are undergoing surgery to create a new access point to their bloodstream for hemodialysis. Vonapanitase is a protein that has been shown in previous research studies to help keep vessels patent when applied to the outside surface of the blood vessels (arteries and veins) in patients who undergo surgery to create an arteriovenous fistula (AVF). The purpose of this study is to determine whether vonapanitase when applied to a limited segment of your blood vessel (about 2 inches) immediately after surgery is safe and improves the patency of your AVF.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Age of at least 18 years. 2. Life expectancy of at least 6 months. 3. Diagnosis of CKD. 4. Planned creation of a new radiocephalic AVF (revision of an existing AVF is not eligible). 5. Ability to understand and comply with the requirements of the entire study and to communicate with the study team. 6. Written informed consent using a document that has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC). 7. If female and of childbearing potential (premenopausal and not surgically sterile) must have a negative serum pregnancy test at the screening visit and be willing to use contraception from the time of the screening visit to 2 weeks following study drug administration. Acceptable methods of birth control include abstinence, barrier methods, hormones, or intrauterine device. 1. Malignancy or treatment for malignancy within the previous 12 months with the exception of the following cancers if they have been resected: localized basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or any cancer in situ. 2. Presence of any significant medical condition that might significantly confound the collection of safety and efficacy data in this study. 3. Previous treatment with vonapanitase (PRT201). 4. Treatment with any investigational drug within the previous 30 days or investigational antibody therapy within the previous 90 days prior to signing informed consent.</criteria>
