	<brief_summary>Pain after transurethral resection of prostate is considered mild to moderate severity from detrusor muscle spasm and traction from urinary catheter. Numerous pain relieve methods have been studied including spinal opioids, spinal anesthesia with local anesthetic and dexmedetomidine, periprostatic nerve blockade with bupivacaine and mixing of prilocaine with distilled water irrigation while undergoing a procedure. Most of patients having this procedure are in elderly period, thus many anesthetists avoided spinal morphine which may cause respiratory depressant effect postoperatively. Although previous studies showed effectiveness of spinal morphine 25-200 mcg, some patients suffered from neuraxial opioid side effects. The aim of this study is to demonstrate efficacy of local anesthetic with intrathecal morphine 50 mcg providing pain relieve after transurethral resection of prostate compare to spinal anesthesia with sole local anesthetic.</brief_summary>
