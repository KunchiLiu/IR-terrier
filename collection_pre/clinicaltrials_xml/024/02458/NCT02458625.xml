	<brief_title>A Comparison Between Intravenous Iron Sucrose to Its Combination With Oral Iron Supplements for the Treatment of Postpartum Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anemia is common following delivery. It is associated with disturbing symptoms such as fatigue, cognitive impairment and syncope in severe cases. International guidelines recommend to use intravenous iron sucrose to treat intermediate and severe anemia until the target hemoglobin is achieved. However, patient's compliance after delivery is low, making the administration of several doses difficult. In those cases oral iron supplements might be used. In the present study the investigators will compare the efficacy of two iron administration protocols to treat post partum anemia - a single dose of intravenous iron sucrose versus a single dose of iron sucrose and 6 weeks of treatment with oral iron supplement.</detailed_description>
