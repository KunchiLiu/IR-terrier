	<brief_title>Isometric Handgrip Exercise for Blood Pressure Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent meta-analyses suggest isometric resistance training (IRT) may be superior to aerobic exercise for lowering blood pressure. A randomised controlled study will be conducted with participants who are either pre-hypertensive, blood pressure between 120/80 and 140/90, or on medication to control their blood pressure. Previous studies have utilised a sedentary control so we intend to use a sham group to determine if it can be used as a working control for future studies.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Those within the required age limits, both normotensive, prehypertensive, and those medicated for blood pressure management. Younger than 30 years and older than 70 years; those deemed not to have the capacity to voluntarily participate, unable to participate under their doctor's recommendation, or with arthritis or carpal tunnel syndrome who may aggravate their condition with handgrip exercise.</criteria>
