	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of ReCell grafting after CO2 laser abrasion with superficial full surface ablation, fractional laser treatment and conventional (deep) full surface CO2 laser ablation, to assess the practical aspects and the patient reported outcome and to assess the cellular composition of the graft.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Cell Suspension Grafting Using ReCell in Vitiligo and Piebaldism Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autologous epidermal cell suspension grafting is an effective method of surgical treatment in vitiligo, which is suitable for treating large areas with good cosmetic results. The ReCell Autologous Cell Harvesting Device (Avita Medical Europe Limited, Cambridge, UK) is a device which, compared to other forms of autologous epidermal cell suspension grafting, is easier in use showing similar results. With this device an epidermal cell suspension is created from a split skin graft, usually taken from the hip region. Currently, conventional ablative (full surface de-epidermisation) laser treatment in different laser settings is used as pre-treatment to prepare the acceptor site for transplantation. There is no evidence for the laser settings used and no studies are available on the use of a fractional laser as pre-treatment in autologous cell suspension grafting using ReCell (ReCell grafting). The investigators hypothesize that more superficial conventional ablative laser treatment and fractional ablative laser treatment are as effective as the current pre-treatment, whereas these treatments are less invasive, provide faster healing and prevent side effects like persisting erythema and scars. Furthermore, infiltration anaesthesia is not necessary with these less invasive treatments.</detailed_description>
