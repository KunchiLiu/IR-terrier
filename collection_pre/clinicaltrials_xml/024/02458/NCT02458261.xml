	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Extended-Infusion Cefepime in Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective, multi-center study aims to determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of extended-infusion cefepime in CRRT. Patients on CRRT who are being initiated on cefepime 2000 mg IV every eight hours with a four-hour infusion will be considered for enrollment. Pre- and post-membrane serum levels will be drawn at scheduled intervals for both the first dose and again during another dose at steady state. Concomitant effluent and urine levels will also be obtained. A pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed and Monte Carlo simulations will be used to determine the probability of target attainment for various pharmacodynamic endpoints. Documented organism MICs will be used to determine the cumulative fraction of response.</detailed_description>
