	<brief_title>Complete Decongestive Therapy in Breast Cancer-Related Lymphedema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Complete Decongestive Therapy (CDT) is the "gold standard" in lymphedema care and has been found to be efficacious in numerous studies. These studies have varying treatment protocols of intensive phase I CDT with dosing ranging from 2x/wk for a mean of 7.5 wks to 6x/wk until a plateau in arm volumes were achieved. This variability in research does not lend itself to recommendations of evidence-based protocol use of CDT in an outpatient setting. Although CDT is backed by efficacy studies, the daily dosing given to patients is based on anecdotal rather than evidence-based practice. Because the traditional protocol was developed from "longstanding experience," research is necessary to determine the best dosing of the intensive phase of CDT. The purpose of this study is to investigate what level of dosing in the intensive CDT phase promotes best volume reduction and increased upper extremity function in the breast cancer-related lymphedema patient population. This particular study will answer: What dosing produces best volumetric reduction and upper extremity function in the intensive phase of complete decongestive therapy for outpatients with breast cancer-related lymphedema 2x/wk for 4wks or 4x/wk for 4 wks?</detailed_description>
