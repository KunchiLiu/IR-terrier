	<brief_summary>Recent meta-analyses suggest isometric resistance training (IRT) may be superior to aerobic exercise for lowering blood pressure. The investigators intend to conduct the largest, longest, prospective, double-blind randomized controlled trial using isometric resistance training to reduce blood pressure to reduce hypertension.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Isometric Handgrip Exercise for Blood Pressure Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We are looking to assess the effect of isometric exercise on ambulatory blood pressure in participants aged 40-70 years who are either pre- or mild hypertensive; either un-medicated or taking medication to control their blood pressure. Our secondary aims are to examine whether the size of blood pressure change is different in those people taking or not taking anti-hypertensive medication, to determine the anti-hypertensive mechanism to IRT, and to establish rate of de-training effects after participants have ceased IRT.</detailed_description>
