	<brief_summary>Despite many previous studies, whether anesthetic technique will significantly affect overall patient outcome, morbidity and mortality in elderly hip fracture patients is controversial. Due to old age, poor patient condition and emergent clinical settings, patients undergoing surgical procedures for hip fracture management are often subject to poor postoperative outcome and high mortality rates. While many studies have reported that regional anesthesia leads to improved postoperative outcome after hip fracture surgery, others have concluded otherwise. Moreover, because the majority of these previous studies are retrospective cohorts or systemic reviews, there is a need for randomized clinical trials to provide high quality evidence. This study aims to compare patient outcome between three different anesthetic techniques in elderly patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture management by evaluating proinflammatory cytokines, chemistry lab testing and clinical outcome between general anesthesia with either desflurane or propofol-based TIVA and spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine.</brief_summary>
