	<brief_summary>The Ambu-Aura GainTM is a new extraglottic airway device which brings together features of both the LMA ProSealTM (high seal cuff, gastric access and bite block - to facilitate ventilation, airway protection and airway obstruction, respectively) and the LMA UniqueTM (single use - prevention of disease transmission). In the following randomized, crossover study, the investigators test the hypothesis that ease of insertion, oropharyngeal leak pressure, fiberoptic position and ease of gastric tube placement differ between the Ambu-Aura GainTM and the LMA SupremeTM in paralyzed, anesthetized patients.</brief_summary>
