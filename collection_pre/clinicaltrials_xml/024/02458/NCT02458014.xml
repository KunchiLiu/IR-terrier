	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if Blinacyto (blinatumomab) can help to control ALL with positive MRD. The safety of this drug will also be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Blinatumomab in Patients With B-cell Lineage Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia With Positive Minimal Residual Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: Each study cycle is 6 weeks. If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive blinatumomab by a central venous catheter (CVC) continuously for Weeks 1-4 of each cycle. A CVC is a sterile flexible tube that will be placed into a large vein while you are under local anesthesia. Your doctor will explain this to you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a separate consent form for this procedure. During Cycle 1, the blinatumomab infusion will be started in the hospital. You will be in the hospital for up to 9 nights so that you can be checked for side effects. Your doctor will decide when you can leave the hospital. Blinatumomab will be delivered by a small pump, which you will carry with you for the whole time you receive the drug. You will be given a shoulder or belt bag to hold the pump and infusion bag. You will be able to wear regular clothes, walk around, and perform daily living activities. You will be given instructions for taking a shower and other activities. There will be some things that you should not do, such as go swimming. The study staff will give you more information on activities you should not do while receiving the drug. You will need to come to MD Anderson to have the infusion bags changed every 48 hours. The study staff will let you know when you need to return to the clinic. You will be given standard drugs, such as dexamethasone, to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks. If you have severe side effects, your study doctor may decide to stop treatment permanently or temporarily. If you recover or if the symptoms have improved, the treatment may be continued. If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before you restart treatment. Study Visits: At the beginning of every cycle, you will have a physical exam. One (1) time each week during Cycles 1-5, blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. During Week 6 of Cycle 1 and then 1 time every cycle after that, you will have a bone marrow biopsy/aspiration to check the status of the disease. Length of Study: You may receive blinatumomab for up to 5 cycles. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. You participation on this study will be over after you have completed follow-up. Follow-Up: You will be called by the study staff and asked about your health 1 time each month for up to 18 months after all participants have been enrolled in the study. These calls should last about 5-10 minutes each. This is an investigational study. Blinatumomab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of ALL. It is considered investigational to use blinatumomab to treat ALL patients with MRD. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work. Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients at least 18 years of age. 2. Patients with Blineage ALL in hematologic complete remission (CR) with molecular failure (ie, had never achieved an MRDnegativity status before blinatumomab) or had a molecular relapse (ie, became MRD positive after having been MRD negative) starting at any time point after 3 months of frontline therapy. Molecular disease or minimal residual disease is defined by a value of at least of 1x10^4 by multicolor flow cytometry. 3. Patients with Blineage ALL in at least marrow CR in Salvage 1 and beyond with molecular failure at any time point after 1 month of salvage therapy are allowed, including patients who received prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation. 4. Performance status of 0, 1, or 2 5. Adequate organ function with creatinine clearance &gt;/= 30 ml/minute and bilirubin less than or equal to 3.0 mg/dL. 6. No active or coexisting malignancy with life expectancy less than 12 months. 7. Patients with Ph+ ALL can be enrolled in CR1 or CR2 and beyond. A TKI will be added at the discretion of the treating physician. MRD for these patients will be defined by PCR of 0.1% and above (International Scale). 1. Pregnant or nursing women 2. Known to be HIV+ 3. Active and uncontrolled disease/infection as judged by the treating physician 4. Unable or unwilling to sign the consent form 5. Active CNS or extramedullary disease 6. Monoclonal antibodies therapy within 2 weeks before study entry 7. Radiotherapy and cancer chemotherapy (except for intrathecal prophylaxis and/or lowdose maintenance therapy such as vinca alkaloids, mercaptopurine, methotrexate, steroids) or any investigational drug within 2 weeks before study entry</criteria>
