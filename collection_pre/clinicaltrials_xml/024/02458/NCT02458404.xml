	<brief_summary>This study will help determine the effect of varied estradiol levels on the uterine lining in healthy humans that are not undergoing a stimulated in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Varied Estrogen Doses on Endometrial Receptivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Volunteers who wish to participate in the study, will undergo a diagnostic and screening phase to determine their eligibility. Once eligibility is determined, participants will undergo three, separate "endometrial preparatory cycles". These cycles will consist of estrogen supplementation to mimic normal, above normal, and highly elevated estradiol levels. Once supplementation is complete uterine procedures will be done to hopefully determine the effects of the estrogen levels on the uterine lining. Subcutaneous leuprolide injections, intramuscular estrogen, and progesterone injections will be used to mimic the levels needed. Blood draws will monitor the needed estradiol and progesterone levels during the injection phase of the cycle. Once the injection phase is complete, transvaginal ultrasound, uterine aspiration, and endometrial biopsy will be done.</detailed_description>
