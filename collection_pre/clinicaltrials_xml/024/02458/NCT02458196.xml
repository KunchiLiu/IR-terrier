	<brief_title>Study of Treatment Response on IgG4 Related Disease (IgG4RD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with IgG4-RD will be randomized in two therapeutic groups: Prednisone alone and combination therapy with Prednisone and Mycophenolate mofetil. These patients will be followed in 12 months. Treatment response and relapse will be recorded, as well as side effects.</detailed_description>
