	<brief_title>Trial of PICO Versus Standard Care in Chronic and Sub-acute Wounds</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study is being conducted to assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of managing patients with a chronic or sub-acute wound in a community setting with PICO and to explore the patient experience and issues of concordance that affect patients treated with PICO. The study will provide information on the level of clinical benefit that PICO can deliver in the population studied in order to justify a sample size for a definitive evaluation of PICO and the study will further assess wound types that may benefit from treatment with PICO.</detailed_description>
