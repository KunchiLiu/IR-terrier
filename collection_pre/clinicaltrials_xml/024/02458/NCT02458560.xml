	<brief_title>Safety and Performance Study of the Edwards CENTERA-EU Self-Expanding Transcatheter Heart Valve</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a non-randomized, prospective, multi-center safety and device success study. Up to two hundred (200) patients are planned to be implanted at up to 35 participating investigational centers in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Patient participation will last for a minimum of 5 years. Patients will be assessed at the following intervals: baseline, discharge, 30 days, 6 months, 1 year and annually thereafter through 5 years.</detailed_description>
