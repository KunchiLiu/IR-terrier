	<brief_summary>The primary efficacy objective for this study is to evaluate non-progression rate (NPR) at 18 weeks in participants with advanced solid tumors treated with atezolizumab, defined as the percentage of participants with complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) as assessed by the Investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), or according to disease-specific criteria for prostate cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma.</brief_summary>
