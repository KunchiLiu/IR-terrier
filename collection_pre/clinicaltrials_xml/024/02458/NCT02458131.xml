	<brief_summary>The number of youth with type 2 diabetes is predicted to quadruple by 2050, with a disproportionate increase among minority youth. The research proposed in this Career Development Award will use community-based participatory research methodology as well as novel strategies (peer education and mobile health technologies) to design, implement and evaluate a diabetes prevention intervention for at-risk ethnic minority youth in an urban community with high disease burden.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Community-based Adolescent Diabetes Prevention Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approach: The proposed research addresses diabetes risk and prevention among racial/ethnic minority adolescents in East Harlem (EH), NY. Aim 1 will use qualitative methods to explore the best strategies for using peer education for diabetes risk reduction in youth and the potential role of mobile health technologies in improving adherence to behavioral modification plans. Aim 2 will utilize findings from preliminary studies and Aim 1 to design and evaluate a pilot community-based intervention to 1) maintain/reduce BMI (primary outcome), 2) improve adolescent dietary, physical activity and weight control behaviors, and 3) improve other measures of diabetes risk. Data will be collected at baseline, immediately after the intervention (3 months) and at one year in the intervention and wait list control groups. Aim 3 involves refining the pilot intervention based on an examination of intervention feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability and planning for a future R01.</detailed_description>
