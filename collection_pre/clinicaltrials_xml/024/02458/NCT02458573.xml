	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesized that sympatholytic effect of epidural analgesia would attenuate the hemodynamic instability and decrease in the splanchnic blood flow caused by pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic surgery. This study is to compare the effect of epidural analgesia and intravenous analgesia on postoperative bowel movement in patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrectomy.</brief_summary>
