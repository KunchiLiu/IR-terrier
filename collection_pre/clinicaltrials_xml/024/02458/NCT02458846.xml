	<brief_summary>Amblyopia (lazy eye), is the leading treatable cause of vision loss in childhood. Uncorrected refractive errors (ie farsightedness) can lead to difficulties in school. Unfortunately, many children do not receive vision screening until they have already developed irreversible vision problems. This has led to the development of a variety of screening protocols and devices that attempt to identify patients at risk for vision problems early in life. This study aims to compare the leading vision screening devices/protocols to a new device, The Pediatric Vision Scanner, and compare their ability to detect vision problems against a "gold standard" eye exam.</brief_summary>
