	<brief_summary>Treatment for severe alcoholic hepatitis patients not eligible for steroid therapy is a dilemma. Pentoxyfilline has been shown to have no improvement in outcomes as per current studies and liver transplantation is with great risk of recidivism in this difficult to treat cohort of patients. Dysbiosis forms the central role in severe alcoholic hepatitis patients and modulation of gut microbiota by way of healthy donor fecal transplantation could prove to be a novel way to treating these patients who are ineligible for standard therapy. This study utilizes correction of dysbiosis in severe alcoholic hepatitis and surveys outcomes with the same with respect to survival and liver disease severity scores.</brief_summary>
