	<detailed_description>Barriers to healthy eating and active living are at the heart of the obesity epidemic. This study focuses on a key factor underlying healthy eating: home food preparation. This study aims to test the effectiveness of a community-based, peer-mentored intervention to improve home food preparation practices in families with young children. The investigators will partner with community-based organizations serving families with children ages 1 to 3 years in West Philadelphia aiming specifically to: 1. Test the intervention's effect on diet and physical health. Hypothesis 1: The intervention group will have improved home food preparation practices and a healthier diet compared to the control group. 2. Test the intervention's effect on family health. Hypothesis 2: The intervention group will report improved parenting skills and more hopeful patterns of thinking. 3. Identify factors present at baseline and during engagement with the intervention that distinguish intervention participants who have improved diet, physical health, and family health from those who do not.</detailed_description>
