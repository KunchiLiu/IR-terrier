	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out if special blood tests and imaging scans can help evaluate the effects of the radiation the patient receives as part of standard treatment. The patient will undergo either stereotactic or conventional radiation treatment as determined by the treating doctor. Previous evidence suggests that blood flow to tumors is affected by the amount (dose) of radiation that it receives. This effect may be seen as soon as 1-2 hours after the radiation is given. This study will evaluate if these changes can be seen and measured by performing a special type of scan called Intravoxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and a blood test. IVIM MRI is a research exam which is similar to a standard MRI exam, with only a slight difference in the technical parameters used to acquire the images.</brief_summary>
