	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to develop new approaches for screening astronauts for cardiovascular risk during deep space missions. In this protocol, two different forms of imaging will be used to evaluate coronary plaque development (CT coronary angiography) and microvascular function (myocardial contrast echocardiography) to stratify CV risk. Based on this stratification, "omic" patterns (targeted metabolomics, lipidomic, and whole genome sequencing) will be assessed to determine whether there are any patterns that can add to existing predictive models. Outcomes measures will involve correlation of "omic" patterns to incremental risk scaling from lowest (no plaque and normal endothelial function) to highest (+ plaque and endothelial dysfunction).</detailed_description>
