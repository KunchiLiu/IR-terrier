	<brief_summary>Prospective, blinded, one arm, baseline-controlled clinical study for the evaluation the performance of the UltraShape treatment for non-invasive fat reduction by compare control and treated flanks. Study subjects will undergo UltraShape treatments on one randomized flank using the U-Sculpt/VDF Transducer. The second flank will not be treated (control).

	<brief_title>Fat Reduction in the Flanks Area vs. Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a prospective, baseline and blinded controlled, comparison, clinical study showing the performance and safety of the UltraShape treatment for non-invasive fat reduction at the flanks area comparing improvement observed in treated versus control flanks. Up to 60 Healthy subjects in up to 4 investigational sites will be enrolled in this study. All subjects will undergo an assessment of their general health. During the treatment period, subject's fat thickness will be measured on both flanks. Three successive bi-weekly (two weeks interval) UltraShape treatments will be performed on one randomized flank, while the second flank will not be treated and served as a control. The study subjects will undergo UltraShape treatments on one flank using the U-Sculpt /VDF Transducer, the treated flank will remain steady along the study and will be comparing to the baseline and to the controlled flank Three follow-up visits will be conducted as follows: 4 weeks (4wk FU), 8 weeks (8wk FU) and 16 weeks (16wk FU) post last treatment (Tx.3). Subject's fat thickness will be measured on both flanks in the measurements points using caliper at each visit (at treatment visits, prior to treatment). Ultrasound measurements will be taken at each visit, except for the second treatment visit, on each flank. Investigator satisfaction will be assessed at all FU visits. In addition, subject questionnaires will be completed at each follow-up visit. Photographs of the front, right, left and back view of each flank will be performed under visible light conditions at each study visit.</detailed_description>

Known hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, hepatitis, liver disease, HIV positive status, blood coagulopathy or excessive bleeding, autoimmune or connective tissue disease 3. Having or undergoing any form of treatment for active cancer, or having a history of skin cancer or any other cancer in the areas to be treated, including presence of malignant or pre‐malignant pigmented lesions 4. Having any active electrical implant anywhere in the body, such as a pacemaker or an internal defibrillator 5. Having a permanent implant in the treated area, such as metal plates or an injected chemical substance such as silicone 6. Having undergone any other surgery in the treated areas within 12 months of treatment or during the study, including liposuction 7. Previous body contouring procedures in the treatment area within 12 months 8. History of skin disease in the treatment area, known tendency to form keloids or poor wound healing 9. Suffering from significant skin conditions in the treated areas or inflammatory skin conditions, including, but not limited to, open lacerations or abrasions and active cold sores or herpes sores prior to treatment (duration of resolution as per the Investigator's discretion) or during the treatment course 10. Skin lesions in the treatment area other than simple nevi on physical examination (e.g., atypical nevus, tattoo, abrasions) including depressed scars in the treatment area 11. Very poor skin quality (i.e., severe laxity) 12. Abdominal wall diastasis or hernia on physical examination 13. Abnormal kidney, liver or coagulation functions, abnormal lipid profile or blood count within the last 3 months 14. Obesity (BMI above 30) 15. Childbirth within the last 12 months or breastfeeding women. Any acute or chronic condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, could interfere with the conduct of the study 16. Unstable weight within the last 6 months (i.e., ± 3% weight change in the prior six months) 17. Fat thickness lower than 2.5 cm after strapping at the treated area. 18. Participation in another clinical study involving same anatomical areas within the last 6 months (or 30 days in case different anatomical areas were treated in previous trial/s). 19. As per the Investigator's discretion, any physical or mental condition which might make it unsafe for the subject to participate in this study.</criteria>
