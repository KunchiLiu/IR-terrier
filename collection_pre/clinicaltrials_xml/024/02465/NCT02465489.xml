	<brief_title>Comparison of Deferiprone Extended Release Tablets and Ferriprox Immediate Release Tablets in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-center, open-label, randomized, 5-period, 5-sequence study of the pharmacokinetics of a new formulation of deferiprone, extended release tablets, in twenty healthy volunteers. In each study period, blood samples for pharmacokinetics assessment will be collected pre-dose and over 24 hours post-dose. Safety will be assessed throughout the study.</detailed_description>

Any history of tuberculosis and/or prophylaxis for tuberculosis 12. Serum ferritin value below the normal limit of the reference laboratory at screening 13. Positive urine screening of alcohol and/or drugs of abuse 14. Positive results on HIV Ag/Ab Combo, Hepatitis B surface Antigen (HBsAG (B) (hepatitis B)) or antiHepatitis C Virus (HCV (C)) tests 15. Positive result on a serum pregnancy test 16. Receipt of an investigational product in another clinical trial in the previous 28 days before Day 1 of this study 17. Donation of 50 mL or more of blood in the previous 28 days before Day 1 of this study or donation of 500 mL or more of blood (Canadian Blood Services, HemaQuebec, clinical studies, etc.) in the previous 56 days before Day 1 of this study</criteria>
