	<brief_summary>The objective of this post marketing study is to further explore a variety of treatment parameters in order to optimize the optical (laser) and electrical (RF) treatments over the various skin types, when using a combination 755 nm alexandrite laser together with a bipolar RF energy system, for the purpose of hair reduction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined 755nm Alexandrite Laser With Bipolar RF for Hair Reduction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study device (Helos) combines 755nm alexandrite laser energy with bipolar RF energy. The laser can deliver 0.25 to 100 ms laser pulses at a maximum of 20 J/cm2. Bipolar RF energy will be delivered across the laser beam via two appropriately sized electrodes and spacing between the electrodes. Bipolar RF energy may be delivered at a maximum of 35 J operating at 1 MHz. Typical RF pulses will be of duration of between 100 and 300ms. Epidermal cooling is accomplished via contact with a cooled window.</detailed_description>
