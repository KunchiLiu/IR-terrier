	<brief_summary>Drug-resistant partial epilepsy has a heavy impact on quality of life and sometimes on life expectancy itself. Only a minority of patients may benefit from a curative epilepsy surgery. Neurostimulation, which can be an effective add-on treatment, is currently mainly represented by vagus nervus stimulation. Transcranial direct current stimulation, a non -invasive technique already used in other areas of neurology, may be efficient on some partial epilepsies, in particular through the individual configuration of stimulation, made possible by recent technological advances. Main goal : To study the effect of transcranial electrical stimulation on the frequency of seizures in patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy. Hypothesis : Reduction of 50% or more in the frequency of occurrence of seizures within 24 hours following an individually configured TDCS session: responders in real TDCS vs placebo stimulation.</brief_summary>
