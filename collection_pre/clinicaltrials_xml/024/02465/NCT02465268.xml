	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine if an investigational dendritic cell vaccine, called pp65 DC, is effective for the treatment of a specific type of brain tumor called glioblastoma (GBM) when given with stronger doses of routine chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy for the Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dendritic cells (DC) are involved in activating, or turning-on, your body's immune system. Your immune system helps guard your body from germs, viruses, and other threats. Although dendritic cells are very strong, the number of them in the body is not high enough to cause a powerful immune response; therefore, more DC are made in a laboratory with cells collected from an individual's blood. In this study, we will make a vaccine that we hope will educate immune cells to target the pp65 antigen, a type of immune marker in GBM, thus resulting in what we call the pp65 DC vaccine. Use of a vaccine that activates your immune system is a type of immunotherapy. It is hoped that by giving the pp65 DC vaccine as a shot under the skin, the immune system will be activated to attack tumor cells in the brain while leaving normal cells alone. To see if the pp65 DC vaccine is effective for the treatment of GBM, subjects will be assigned to different treatment groups. Two groups of subjects will receive the pp65 DC vaccine and one group will receive a placebo.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Abbreviated To be assessed at study enrollment prior to radiation therapy: Age ≥ 18 years. Histopathologically proven newlydiagnosed de novo GBM (secondary GBM not eligible). CMV seropositive. The tumor must have a supratentorial component. Must have undergone definitive surgical resection of tumor with less than approximately 3cm x 3cm residual enhancing tumor as product of longest perpendicular planes by MRI. Recovery from the effects of surgery, postoperative infection, and other complications. Diagnostic contrastenhanced MRI or CT scan of the brain preoperatively and postoperatively. Karnofsky Performance Status of ≥ 70. Signed informed consent. For females of childbearing potential, negative serum pregnancy test. Women of childbearing potential and male participants must be willing to practice adequate contraception. To be assessed prior to initiation of adjuvant TMZ: Must have completed RT (60Gy over 6 weeks) and concomitant TMZ (targeted dose of 75mg/m2/d for ≤ 49 days) therapy without significant toxicity that persisted over 4 weeks. History &amp; physical with neurologic examination prior to initiation of adjuvant TMZ. For patients receiving steroids, daily dose must be ≤ 4 mg. CBC with differential with adequate bone marrow function. Adequate renal function. Adequate hepatic function. Abbreviated To be assessed at study enrollment prior to radiation therapy: Prior invasive malignancy unless disease free for ≥ 3 years. Metastases detected below the tentorium or beyond the cranial vault and leptomeningeal involvement. Recurrent or multifocal malignant gliomas. HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C seropositive. Known active infection or immunosuppressive disease. Prior chemotherapy or radiosensitizers (including Gliadel wafers) for cancers of the head and neck region. Prior radiotherapy to the head or neck, resulting in overlap of radiation fields. Severe, active comorbidity. Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception. Pregnant or lactating women. Prior allergic reaction to temozolomide, GMCSF or Td. Prior history of brachial neuritis or GuillainBarré syndrome. Patients treated on any other therapeutic clinical protocols within 30 days prior to study entry. To be assessed prior to initiation of adjuvant TMZ: Did not start radiation therapy and temozolomide within 7 weeks of surgery. Progression of disease as defined by RANO criteria. More than 45 days after completion of radiation therapy and temozolomide</criteria>
