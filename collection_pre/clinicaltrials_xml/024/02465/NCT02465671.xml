	<brief_title>Prognostic Value of Plasma Thrombospondin-1 Levels After Acute Intracerebral Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thrombospondin-1 acts as an anti-angiogenic factor and its expression in rat brain is upregulated after intracerebral hemorrhage. The current study was designed to investigate the change of plasma thrombospondin-1 levels and assess the prognostic predictive effect of plasma thrombospondin-1 levels in the patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage. About 110 patients will be recruited. All blood samples from the patients at admission were collected. Thrombospondin-1 levels in plasma were measured using sandwich immunoassays. The patients will be followed up till 6 months after intracerebral hemorrhage. The relationships between plasma thrombospondin-1 levels and 1-week mortality, 6-month mortality, 6-month overall survival, 6-month unfavorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score &gt;2) and disease severity reflected by hematoma volume and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score were assessed using multivariate analysis. It is proposed that elevated plasma thrombospondin-1 levels are independently associated with disease severity and clinical outcomes. It will be suggested thrombospondin has potential to be a good prognostic biomarker of intracerebral hemorrhage.</detailed_description>
