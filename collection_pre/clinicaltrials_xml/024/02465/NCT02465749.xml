	<brief_title>Clinical Trials of Continuous Oxygen Therapy Combined With Blue Light Deprivation in the Treatment of Retinitis Pigmentosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is one of of the major causes of blindness in ocular diseases.Up to now, the etiology of RP remained unclear, and there are no effective therapeutic methods. Several studies had showed that the retina of RP may be anoxic, and oxygen therapy, such as hyperbaric oxygen (hyperbaric oxygen, HBO) treatment, had shown a definite effect on RP. The investigators' previous researches also found that the retinal vessel oxygen saturation in patients with RP who were older than 40 years were significantly lower than normal controls, suggesting that oxygen may play an important role in the development of RP. Besides, many studies have revealed that blue light could damage retina pigment epithelium cells and photoreceptor cell specially. Therefore, investigators will combine continuous oxygen therapy and blue light deprivation therapy in the treatment for RP in this study, in order to find a new strategy of treatment for RP.</detailed_description>
