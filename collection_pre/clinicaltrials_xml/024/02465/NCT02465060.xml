	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well treatment that is directed by genetic testing works in patients with solid tumors or lymphomas that have progressed following at least one line of standard treatment or for which no agreed upon treatment approach exists. Genetic tests look at the unique genetic material (genes) of patients' tumor cells. Patients with genetic abnormalities (such as mutations, amplifications, or translocations) may benefit more from treatment which targets their tumor's particular genetic abnormality. Identifying these genetic abnormalities first may help doctors plan better treatment for patients with solid tumors, lymphomas, or multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NCI-MATCH: Targeted Therapy Directed by Genetic Testing in Treating Patients With Advanced Refractory Solid Tumors, Lymphomas, or Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the proportion of patients with objective response (OR) to targeted study agent(s) in patients with advanced refractory cancers/lymphomas/multiple myeloma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the proportion of patients alive and progression free at 6 months of treatment with targeted study agent in patients with advanced refractory cancers/lymphomas/multiple myeloma. II. To evaluate time until death or disease progression. III. To identify potential predictive biomarkers beyond the genomic alteration by which treatment is assigned or resistance mechanisms using additional genomic, ribonucleic acid (RNA), protein and imaging-based assessment platforms. IV. To assess whether radiomic phenotypes obtained from pre-treatment imaging and changes from pre- through post-therapy imaging can predict objective response and progression free survival and to evaluate the association between pre-treatment radiomic phenotypes and targeted gene mutation patterns of tumor biopsy specimens. OUTLINE: STEP 0 (Screening): Patients undergo biopsy along with molecular characterization of the biopsy material for specific, pre-defined mutations, amplifications, or translocations of interest via tumor sequencing and immunohistochemistry. Consenting patients also undergo collection of blood samples for research purposes. STEPS 1, 3, 5, 7 (Treatment): Patients are assigned to 1 of 30 treatment subprotocols based on molecularly-defined subgroup. (See Arms Section) STEPS 2, 4, 6 (Screening): Patients experiencing disease progression on the prior Step treatment or who could not tolerate the assigned treatment undergo review of their previous biopsy results to determine if another treatment is available or undergo another biopsy. Patients may have a maximum of 2 screening biopsies and 2 treatments per biopsy. STEP 8 (Optional Research): Consenting patients undergo end-of-treatment biopsy and collection of blood samples for research purposes. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.</detailed_description>
