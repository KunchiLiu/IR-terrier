	<brief_summary>The presence of co-existence of cervical elongation in women of uterine prolapse may decrease the patients' satisfaction of uterine-preservation surgery for uterine prolapse, and additional surgery, such as Manchester surgery, may be needed to solve the problem.Thus the aim of this study is to investigate the risk factors of co-existence of cervical elongation in uterine prolapse.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Risk Factors for Co-existence of Cervical Elongation in Uterine Prolapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose: Thus the aim of this study is to investigate the risk factors of co-existence of cervical elongation in uterine prolapse. Patients and Methods: Between January 1994 and October 2014, all women underwent vaginal total hysterectomy in a medical center were enrolled in this study. Medical records were reviewed. Cervical elongation is defined as the presence of cervical length &gt;3.38 cm or cervix to corpus ratio &gt;0.79. Expected Results: The investigators will get the risk factors of co-existence of cervical elongation in uterine prolapse, and the result should be helpful for preoperative consultation, especially for uterine-preserving pelvic floor reconstruction surgery.</detailed_description>
