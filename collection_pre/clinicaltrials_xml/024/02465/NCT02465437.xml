	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability, Efficacy, and Pharmacokinetics of JBT-101 in Systemic Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part A of the study is an interventional, double-blind, randomized, placebo-control design will be used to test safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of JBT-101 in subjects ≥ 18 and ≤ 70 years of age with active diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis. The screening period is up to 28 days, with 84 days treatment period and 28 days follow-up off active treatment. Part B of the study is an interventional, open-label design will be used. All subjects who complete dosing in Part A without permanent discontinuation of study drug and who pass repeat safety screening will be eligible for enrollment. The screening period is up to 28 days, with a 364 day treatment period and 28 day follow up after last dose of JBT-101.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Part A Diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis Have skin thickening from SSc in a body area suitable for repeat biopsy Disease duration ≤ 3 years from the first nonRaynaud's phenomenon or &gt;3 years and ≤ 6 years from the first nonRaynaud's phenomenon and high sensitivity Creactive protein &gt; 3 mg/L, high sensitivity interleukin6 &gt; 5 pg/mL, or increase in mRSS ≥ 5 points over the last 6 months with total RSS ≥ 12. Stable treatment for SSc for at least 28 days before Visit 1 Part B •Completion of dosing in Part A without permanent discontinuation of study product because of safety or tolerability reasons. Exclusion Criteria (Part A and B): Severe or unstable systemic sclerosis Significant diseases or conditions other than systemic sclerosis that may influence response to the study product or safety; Any one of the following values for laboratory tests at Screening: 1. A positive pregnancy test (or at Visit 1); 2. Hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL 3. Neutrophils &lt; 1.0 x 10^9/L 4. Platelets &lt; 75 x 10^9/L 5. Creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/min according to modified CockcroftGault equation 6. Serum transaminases &gt; 2.0 x upper normal limit 7. Total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x upper limit of normal Any other condition that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, is clinically significant and may put the subject at greater safety risk, influence response to study product, or interfere with study assessments.</criteria>
