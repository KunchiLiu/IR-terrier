	<brief_summary>Dysfunction of regulatory T (Treg) cells has been detected in diverse autoimmune diseases, which can be promoted by interleukin-2 (IL-2). In a previous small sample trail performed by the investigator's group, the investigators found that the Low-dose IL-2 was effective and well tolerated in active SLE, and the effect was associated with selective modulation of CD4+ T cell subsets. This clinical study will confirm the efficacy and safety of low dose IL-2 treatment in SLE. The investigators perform a single-centre, double-blind pilot trial with hrIL-2 in SLE.The investigators evaluate the effectiveness and safeness of low-dose hrIL-2 for Systemic lupus erythematosus by randomized controlled study (hrIL-2 (N = 30) versus placebo group (N = 30)).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot-Study With Low-dose hrIL-2 for the Treatment of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each SLE patients (n=60) with Scores&gt;=8 on SLEDAI received low-dose IL-2 or placebo (active group: placebo group =1:1, 1 million units every other day subcutaneously (HrIL-2 1X 106, ip, Qod) for a period of 14 days. After a 14-day rest, another cycle started) for 3 cycles. The end points were safety and clinical and immunologic response.</detailed_description>
