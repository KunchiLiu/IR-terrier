	<brief_title>The Clinical Efficacy of Next Science Wound Gel (NXTSC) in the Healing of Chronic Wounds</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Determine the effect on wound treatment outcomes using a novel antimicrobial wound gel (NXTSC) for the treatment of infected wounds as the sole topical treatment of microbial infection at the wound site. 2. Determine the effect on wound treatment outcomes using a novel antimicrobial wound gel for the treatment of infected wounds when this gel is used in conjunction with the current standard of care infection controls to treat microbial infection at the wound site. 3. Determine the effect on wound treatment outcomes using standard of care treatment. (SOC).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. The subject must have a fullthickness chronic wound for greater than one month. 2. The subject must be at least 18 years of age. 3. The ulcer to be biopsied must be greater than 1 centimeter in area. 4. The subject must be able to give informed consent. 1. Medical or emotional risk associated with the potential biopsy that outweighs the risk of not taking a biopsy as determined by the investigator. 2. Those patients that have significant contributions from other disease processes such as arterial disease (Ankle Brachial Index [ABI] less than .7, OR Transcutaneous Partial Oxygen Pressure [TCpO2 ] less than 20) will be considered to have mixed vascular disease producing their wound and will be excluded from the study.</criteria>
