	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the dosages of recombinant human serum albumin/granulocyte colony-stimulating factor fusion protein by injection for preventing neutrophilic granulocytopenia among chemotherapy patients. Conduct Pharmacokinetics (PK) study on recombinant human serum albumin/granulocyte colony-stimulating factor fusion protein with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor injection as a control.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Recombinant Human Serum Albumin/Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor Fusion Protein</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Brief Protocol: Treat the patients taking Taxotere+Epirubicin+Cyclophosphamide (TEC) treatment or Taxotere+Epirubicin (TE) treatment chemotherapy with the study medicine or positive control during the period between two chemotherapy treatments. - Positive control：recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor injection. - Targeted patients: breast cancer - Grouping: Group 1: 1.2 mg recombinant human serum albumin/granulocyte colony-stimulating factor fusion protein with TEC or TE treatment; Group 2: 1.5 mg recombinant human serum albumin/granulocyte colony-stimulating factor fusion protein with TEC or TE treatment; Group 3: positive control with TEC or TE treatment. - Number of patients: 216 - Concomitant medicines will be conducted.</detailed_description>
