	<brief_summary>Delirium, as a common complication of hospitalization, poses significant health problems in hospitalized patients. Though about a third of delirium cases can benefit from intervention, detecting and predicting delirium is still very limited in practice. A common characterization of delirium is changes in activity level, causing patients to become hyperactive or hypoactive which is manifested in facial expressions and total body movements. This pilot study is designed to test the feasibility of a delirium detection system using movement data obtained from 3-axis wearable accelerometers and Microsoft Kinect sensor, in conjunction with electronics medical record (EMR) data to analyze the relation of whole-body movement as well as facial expressions with delirium.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Motion Analysis of Delirium in the ICU</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to assess the potential of motion and facial expression data for detecting delirium in ICU patients by comparing motion and facial expression patterns in delirium and control group. In this study, the investigators will use ActivePalTM accelerometer to record each subject's movement patterns. Also, a processed video using the KINECT application-programming interface to identify patient facial expressions and movement patterns. A total of 40 participants will be enrolled with delirium and 20 patients without delirium will be used as control group. Motion profiles will be compared in the motorically defined subgroups (hyperactive, hypoactive, normal) based on accelerometer and Kinect data. Then differences in facial expression, number of changes in postures and percentage of time spent moving between motorically defined subgroups and in delirium and control group. EMR data will also be used to assess the feasibility of detecting delirium by additionally including information on related risk factors.</detailed_description>
