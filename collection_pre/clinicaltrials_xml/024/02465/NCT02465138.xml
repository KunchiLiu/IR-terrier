	<brief_summary>Determine if IV ketorolac is an effective agent in the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis. Determine if IV ketorolac provides improved post-procedure analgesia. Determine if systemic mediators of inflammation are reduced in patients receiving IV ketorolac following ERCP.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Trial of IV Ketorolac to Prevent Post-ERCP Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute pancreatitis is the most common major complication of both diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), accounting for substantial morbidity and an annual expenditure of approximately 150 million annually.(1,2) Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) have been shown to be effective in multiple prospective randomized controlled trial for the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis.(3-6) NSAIDs are postulated to inhibit phospholipase A2 and prostaglandin synthesis, which plays an important role in the inflammatory cascade in acute pancreatitis. Rectal suppository indomethacin (a potent COX-2 inhibitor) has been effective in preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis in clinical trials and is now recommended for routine use for ERCP by the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.(7) ToradolÂ® (ketorolac), an NSAID available in IV form, is a more potent COX-2 inhibitor and analgesic than indomethacin.(8,9) Ketorolac is routinely used postoperatively following major surgery to assist in pain control particularly following orthopedic procedures. IV ketorolac has never been evaluated for the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis.</detailed_description>
