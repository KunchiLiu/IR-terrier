	<brief_summary>TERAVECT is a phase III randomized study of patients with digestive neuroendocrine tumors after complete surgical resection of liver metastases treated with In111-Pentetreotide-based adjuvant radiotherapy. In this study, targeted radionuclide therapy is used at an earlier stage of the disease.The objective is to target residual tumor cells and/or micrometastases which escaped surgical resection. Given the poor prognosis associated with recurrence, this treatment should prevent relapse.</brief_summary>
