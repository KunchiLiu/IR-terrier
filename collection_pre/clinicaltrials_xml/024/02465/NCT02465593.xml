	<brief_summary>This phase Ib/II study is a prospective, open-label, single arm, nonrandomized study of PEP503(radio-enhancer). There are 2 portions in this study. - Escalation phase (Part Ib): A 3 + 3 dose escalation study design will be adopted in this phase to identify the recommended injection volume of PEP503 for intratumor injection. - Expansion phase (Part II): Following the confirmation of the recommended volume of intratumor injection, 18 additional patients will be enrolled at the recommended volume level to evaluate for efficacy.</brief_summary>
