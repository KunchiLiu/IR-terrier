	<criteria>Male or female subjects ≥18 years of age; Histological or cytological confirmation of adenocarcinoma of the colon or/and rectum; Subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) whose disease progressed or who were intolerant to standard chemotherapy based on fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and an antiEGFR therapy if RAS wildtype. This progression must be during or within 4 months following the last administration of standard therapies. Measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, Version 1.1. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 Adequate bonemarrow, liver, and renal function Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception when sexually active during the study and for at least 8 weeks after the last study drug administration. Prior treatment with an antiangiogenic agent; Congestive heart failure of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 2 or worse; Unstable angina (angina symptoms at rest), newonset angina (begun within the last 3 months). Myocardial infarction less than 6 months before start of study drug; Cardiac arrhythmias requiring antiarrhythmic therapy (beta blockers or digoxin are permitted) Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt;140 mmHg or diastolic pressure &gt;90 mmHg despite optimal medical management); Ongoing acute or chronic infection (&gt; Grade 2 NCICTCAE v 4.03); Arterial or venous thrombotic or embolic events such as cerebrovascular accident (including transient ischemic attacks), deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (except for adequately treated catheterrelated venous thrombosis occurring more than one month before the start of study medication) events within 6 months of study enrollment. Subjects being treated with lowweight heparin are allowed to participate as long as dose is limited to prophylactic use. Any history of or currently known brain metastases (head CT/MRI will be performed during screening period if brain metastases are suspected) Previous or concurrent cancer that is distinct in primary site or histology from colorectal cancer within 5 years before study entry, except for curatively treated cervical cancer in situ, in situ ductal breast cancer, nonmelanoma skin cancer and superficial bladder tumors; Last chemotherapy dose or any other anticancer therapy administered in less than 4 weeks from start of study treatment; Use of therapeutic anticoagulation; Proteinuria &gt; 3.5 g/24 hours measured by urine proteincreatinine ratio from a random urine sample (Grade 3, NCICTCAE v 4.03) on urinalysis screening result. If there is medical history of proteinuria, previous urinalysis results should be considered and/or performed so at least 2 results separated by at least 2 weeks are available; History of interstitial lung disease with ongoing signs and symptoms at the time of informed consent; Nonhealing wound, nonhealing ulcer, or nonhealing bone fracture; Subjects with evidence or history of any bleeding diathesis, irrespective of severity; Any hemorrhage or bleeding event ≥ Grade 3 NCICTCAE v 4.03 within 4 weeks prior to the start of study medication; Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; History of active hepatitis B or C, or chronic hepatitis B or C requiring treatment with antiviral therapy; Pregnancy or breastfeeding.</criteria>
