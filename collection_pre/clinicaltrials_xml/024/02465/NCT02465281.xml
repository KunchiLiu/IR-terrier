	<brief_summary>The objective the preliminary study is: 1. to identify correlations between brain lesions and sensorimotor impairments in stroke. 2. to identify a potential effect of time on correlations between brain lesions and sensorimotor impairments by comparing the results in patients with sub-acute stroke versus patients with chronic stroke. 3. to identify possible patterns between brain lesions and sensorimotor impairments that might increase our understanding in stroke recovery and guide further tailor-based neuro-rehabilitation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to investigate arm and hand function after stroke and how the location of the brain lesion affects arm and hand function. We are hoping to collect data in the form of assessments what you feel and how your arm moves, surveys about activities in daily life and well-being, and we will perform 1 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan. MRI scans are loud but painless; nothing is injected. With MRI, we collect images from the brain.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria for healthy subjects are: medically stable; 18 99 years of age; able to hear the instructions given during the study Inclusion criteria for stroke patients are: at least 6 months poststroke; medically stable; 18 99 years of age; subcortical or cortical infarct confirmed with MRI; Minimental State Exam &gt; 24/30 (Folstein et al., 1975); able to hear the instructions given during the study; able to comprehend the instructions given during the study; able to commit time to participate in a 612weeks rehabilitation program Exclusion criteria for healthy subjects are: having ever experienced a stroke or another brain injury or illness related to the brain that has lasting effects or effects experienced at the moment of recruitment; severe sensory impairments such that different movements of the finger, hand or wrist are not reliably felt; contractures in tested arm that hinder persons from keeping the outstretched arm in a relaxed position; interfering comorbidities (e.g. fracture, cancer, peripheral neuropathy); exhibit contraindications to enter the magnetic field of the 3T (pacemakers, metal parts in the body etc); pregnant or nursing mother; adults lacking capacity to consent Exclusion criteria for stroke patients are: insular or cerebellar infarcts/brain lesions; unilateral spatial neglect, identified by a standard neuropsychological assessment (Bell's test (score/35, Gauthier et al., 1989); aphasia; apraxia (TULIA, Vanbellingen et al., 2011); severe sensory impairments such that different movements of the finger, hand or wrist are not reliably felt; contractures in the hemiplegic arm that hinder patients from keeping the outstretched arm in a relaxed position; interfering comorbidities (e.g. fracture, cancer, peripheral neuropathy); patients currently receiving therapy for their hemiplegic arm, the latter in order to avoid confounding treatment effects; exhibit contraindications to enter the magnetic field of the 3T (pacemakers, metal parts in the body etc); pregnant or nursing mother; adults lacking capacity to consent</criteria>
