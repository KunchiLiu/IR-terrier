	<brief_summary>The investigators are trying to determine the therapeutic effect of the music glove and conventional hand exercise program to the subacute stroke patients. All participants will be randomized into two groups: AB and BA. They will all exercise at least 3 times a week for 3 weeks with a minimal 3 hours exercise time per week. Participants will receive the other intervention at 3-month post stroke date. Clinical evaluations will be performed at baseline, post therapy after first intervention, 3-week post intervention follow up, 3-month post stroke, post therapy after second intervention, 3-week post second intervention follow up, and 6-month post stroke follow up visits.</brief_summary>
