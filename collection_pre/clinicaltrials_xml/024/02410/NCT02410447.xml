	<brief_summary>Chronic soft tissue wounds of the lower limbs are painful and debilitating condition that significantly reduce the quality of life of the patient. They often do not respond to conservative treatments or advanced wound managements. Focused and defocused extracorporeal shock wave therapy can be a viable alternative therapeutic strategy. The purpose of the study was to examine the effects of defocused extracorporeal shock wave treatment on chronic soft tissue wounds of the lower limbs, in terms of the rate of wound healing and pain control.</brief_summary>
