	<criteria>Patient age &gt; 25 years old and &lt; 80 years old Patients with reoccurrence of brain tumor The principal investigator or coPI must review MRI and CT findings based on the radiologic assessment provided they meet the following imaging criteria (as established in the clinical trial 09177): OR Patients with newly diagnosed GBM and one of the following options: Eligible for surgery after the last research scan. Significant residual disease after initial surgery The principal investigator or coPI must review MRI and CT findings and agree with the presence of significant residual disease Treatment (nonsurgical) naïve Karnofsky Performance Score ≥ 70 Laboratory values: Serum creatinine &gt;2.5 mg/dL. AST (SGOT) &gt;2.5x ULN. Bilirubin (total) &gt;1.5x ULN. Serum calcium &gt;11 mg/dL. Pregnant or breastfeeding (if a female is of childbearing potential, and unsure of pregnancy status, a standard pregnancy test should be done). If an initial biopsy demonstrates neoplasm other than GBM Presence of any other coexisting condition which, in the judgment of the investigator, might increase the risk to the subject. Presence of serious systemic illness, including: uncontrolled intercurrent infection, uncontrolled malignancy, significant renal disease, or psychiatric/social situations, which might limit compliance with study requirements Prior treatment. Other serious illness (es), which might preclude completion of this, study or interfere with determination of causality of any adverse effects experienced in this study.</criteria>
