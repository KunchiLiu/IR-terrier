	<brief_summary>This study is a prospective, double-blind, randomized comparison study of different anesthesia methods in rhytidoplasty surgery. The study is designed to determine whether post-operative side-effect profiles in patients undergoing elective cosmetic facelift surgery can be decreased through the use of propofol/ketamine anesthesia with bispectral monitoring (PKA-BIS) rather than general anesthesia, without increasing intra-operative time, side-effect profiles, or patient recall. Approximately 30 subjects undergoing facelift surgery performed by the principal investigator will participate.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PKA-BIS arm receives the following medications: clonidine 0.1-0.2mg glycopyrrolate 0.2mg propofol infusion titrated to BIS of 60-75 ketamine 50mg + additional ketamine not to exceed 200mg aggregate dosage throughout the case local anesthetic (lidocaine/marcaine mix) General Anesthesia arm receives the following medications: Pre-operatively: Pepcid 20mg Scopolamine 1.5mg transdermal patch Versed 2mg Zofran 8mg Reglan 10mg Glycopyrrolate - dose determined by anesthesiologist During the case, medication choices and dosing were dependent on the anesthesiologist - all general anesthesia cases received inhalational anesthetic (type of anesthetic also varied based on anesthesiologist's choice)</detailed_description>
