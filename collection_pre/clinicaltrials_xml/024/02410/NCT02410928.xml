	<brief_summary>Recurrent nerve palsy is a complication of thyroidectomy. Most surgeons want to visualize the vocal cords after tyroidectomy. The aim is to compare the direct laringoscopy, videolaringoscopy, fiberoptic laringoscopy and ultrasonography methods in terms of efficacy, duration and hemodynamic responses during the procedure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of the Vocal Cord Imaging Techniques After Thyroidectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The vocal cord will be visualised after the extubation with one of the following methods: direct laringoscopy videolaringoscopy fiberoptic laringoscopy ultrasonography The of efficacy of the method (0= not able to visualize the vocal cords, 1= the vocal cords were visualized) duration of the procedure and hemodynamic responses (heart rate, mean arterial pressure) during the procedure will be compared between the groups.</detailed_description>
