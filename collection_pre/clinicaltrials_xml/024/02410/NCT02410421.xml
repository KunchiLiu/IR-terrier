	<brief_summary>Although repetitive trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective therapy for resistant depression, it still fail to remit up to 70% of these patients. We hypothesize that personalizing the procedure using functional MRI to better select dysfunctional regions and robotic coil placement to stimulate these regions homogeneously, will increase its efficacy. Individualized rTMS will be compared to traditional rTMS procedure and to trans-cranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In this small proof of principle study our primary outcome measure will be the correction of the MRI anomalies. Symptoms reduction and the proportion of remitters will be secondary outcome measurements.</brief_summary>
