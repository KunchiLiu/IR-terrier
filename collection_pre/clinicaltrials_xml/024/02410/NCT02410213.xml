Screening TSAT &lt; 20% Screening Hemoglobin &lt; 11 g/dL For subjects who are receiving an erythropoietin stimulating agent (ESA): stable ESA therapy (+/ 20% of current dose) for &gt; 8 weeks prior to the qualifying screening visit and no ESA dosing or product changes anticipated for the length of the trial Known hypersensitivity reaction to any component of Ferric Carboxymaltose. Subject previously randomized and treated in this study or any other clinical study of Ferric Carboxymaltose (FCM or VIT45). Body mass index (BMI) â‰¤ 5th percentile for age (see APPENDIX 2) Male or Female subject 1 year of age weighing &lt; 12kg. History of acquired iron overload, hemochromatosis or other iron accumulation disorders. Chronic kidney disease subjects on hemodialysis. Screening Ferritin level &gt; 300ng/mL Subjects with significant severe diseases of the liver, hemopoietic system, cardiovascular system, psychiatric disorder or other conditions which on the opinion of the investigator may place a subject at added risk. Any active infection. Known positive hepatitis B antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C viral antibody (HCV) with evidence of active hepatitis. Known positive HIV1/HIV2 antibodies (antiHIV). Anemia due to reasons other than iron deficiency (i.e. hemoglobinopathy). Subjects treated with vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency are permitted. Intravenous iron and /or blood transfusion in the 4 weeks prior to screening. Immunosuppressive therapy that may lead to anemia (i.e. cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil). Note steroid therapy is permitted. Administration and / or use of an investigational product (drug or device) within 30 days of screening. Alcohol or drug abuse within the past six months. Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating, or sexually active female who are of childbearing potential not willing to use an acceptable form of contraceptive precautions during the study.
