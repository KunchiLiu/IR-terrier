	<brief_title>CBT-I Intervention for Insomnia in Newly Diagnosed Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study will be a randomized controlled trial design. Participants will be randomized to either a CBTI treatment or a wait list control condition. The intervention is SHUTi, a validated web based version of CBTI, which will take place over seven weeks and will include a combination of face to face and telephone sessions, and email updates. All participants will have a face to face meeting with the doctoral student at enrollment. During the intervention period, all participants will be contacted by telephone at week 1, 3, and 6 to check in and to encourage participant engagement. However, during phone calls with control participants, no advice regarding sleep will be given and if participants ask, they will be informed that such advice can be provided in a few weeks if they choose to crossover to the treatment condition at the end of the study. Participants in SHUTi will additionally be provided the the doctoral student's phone number and will be encouraged to contact her if they have any questions during the intervention. They will also have the option of setting up appointments for face to face meetings during a clinic appointment if they desire additional therapist guidance. Pretreatment, all participants will complete a two week sleep diary and multiple self report measures. At the end of the intervention, all participants will complete a two week sleep diary and multiple self report measures again.</detailed_description>
