	<brief_summary>Overview of Study Design: This is an open phase II, single-arm, multi-center study to evaluate progression free survival in patients receiving ixazomib in combination with thalidomide and dexamethasone (ITD) followed by an ixazomib maintenance phase of a maximum period of 12 months. The patient population will consist of adult male and female patients with multiple myeloma (MM) with relapsed and/or refractory disease after at least one prior treatment line. In case of enrollment patients will receive ixazomib 4.0mg at days 1, 8, 15, thalidomide 100mg at days 1 to 28 (50mg in patients aged ≥75 years), and dexamethasone 40mg (20mg in patients aged ≥75 years) at days 1, 8, 15 of a 28-day treatment cycle. The proposed number of cycles is 8. Treatment will be discontinued in case of progressive disease or in case of no response after 4 cycles (≤ SD after 4 cycles). After discontinuation of therapy an end of treatment visit (EOT) will be performed within 14 days after the last dose of the last combination treatment cycle. After 8 cycles of ITD therapy, maintenance treatment with 4.0mg ixazomib (3.0mg in patients aged ≥ 75 years at first day of maintenance phase) on days 1, 8, 15 of 28-day cycles will be administered to patients with ≥ MR for a maximum period of 12 months. Patients who completed less than 8 cycles of ITD treatment do not qualify for maintenance phase. Follow-up visits will be performed in 3-monthly intervals until the last patient on ixazomib maintenance therapy has concluded or discontinued the maintenance phase. A safety analysis will be conducted after enrollment of the first 6 patients and completion of at least two cycles in every patient.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Male or female patients 18 yrs or older. 2. Voluntary written consent 3. Patients in need of therapy with a diagnosis of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who had at least one prior treatment line 4. Patients must have measurable disease defined by at least 1 of the following criteria: Serum Mprotein ≥ 10g/l Urine Mprotein ≥ 200mg/24h Serum free light chain assay: involved serum light chain ≥ 10mg/dl provided that free light chain ration is abnormal 5. Life expectancy &gt; 3 months 6. ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) ≤ 2 7. • ANC ≥ 1.000/mm3 and platelet count ≥ 50.000/mm3 Total bilirubin ≤ 2 x ULN ALT and AST ≤ 3 x ULN GFR ≥ 15ml/min as calculated by cockroftGault equation 8. Female patients who: Are older than 50 years and postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, OR Are surgically sterile, OR If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 2 effective methods of contraception at the same time, from 4 weeks before starting study therapy through 90 days after the last dose of study drug, OR Agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.) Are informed and understand the possible consequences of the teratogenic potential of thalidomide Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status postvasectomy), must agree to one of the following: Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 90 days after the last dose of study drug, OR Agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.) Are informed and understand the possible consequences of the teratogenic potential of thalidomide 9. Disease free of prior malignancies for ≥ 2 years with exception of curatively treated basal cell, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma "in situ" of the cervix or breast if they have undergone complete resection. 1. lactating females or have a positive serum pregnancy test 2.
