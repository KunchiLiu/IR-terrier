	<brief_title>A Trial of CM-AT in Children With Autism With All Levels of FCT (The Blum Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autism is clearly a significant cause of disability in the pediatric population. Many children with Autism exhibit impaired protein digestion which may or may not manifest in self-restricted diets. The inability to digest protein affects the availability of essential amino acids in the body. CM-AT is designed to enhance protein digestion thereby potentially restoring the pool of essential amino acids. Essential amino acids play a critical role in the expression of several genes important to neurological function and serve as precursors to key neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine. CM-AT is a proprietary enzyme that is designed as a granulated powder taken three times daily.</detailed_description>
