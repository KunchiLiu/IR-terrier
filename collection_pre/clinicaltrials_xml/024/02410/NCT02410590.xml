	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this trial is to compare the preference between two strategies of neuromuscular blocking (NMB) / reversal in adult obese patients undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgery: Rocuronium + Sugammadex versus Succinylcholine + Cisatracurium + Neostigmine/Atropine. This will be done evaluating the average verbal numerical scale (VNS) scores obtained from surgeons blinded to the drugs administered. The primary hypothesis is that the strategy "Rocuronium + Sugammadex" provides a better surgical visual field in obese participants undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgery than the strategy "Succinylcholine + Cisatracurium + Neostigmine/Atropine" as measured by VNS scores.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>must be obese, with a Body Mass Index ≥30.0 to ≤50. must be scheduled to undergo an elective abdominal laparoscopic surgery, under general anesthesia. (Participants are expected to remain in the hospital for at least 24 hours following surgical procedure.) must be categorized as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Class 1, 2, or 3. clinical laboratory tests within normal limits or clinically acceptable to the investigator/sponsor. sexually active females of childbearing potential must agree to use a medically accepted method of contraception while receiving protocolspecified medication and for the 30 days after stopping the medication. Medically accepted methods of contraception include condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent, diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide, medically prescribed IUD, inert or coppercontaining IUD, hormonereleasing IUD, systemic hormonal contraceptive, and surgical sterilization (eg, hysterectomy or tubal ligation). Postmenopausal women are not required to use contraception. Postmenopausal is defined as at least 12 consecutive months without a spontaneous menstrual period. Each sexually active male subject with a female partner(s) of childbearing potential must also provide written informed consent to provide information regarding any pregnancy. has anatomical malformations that may lead to difficult intubation. is known or suspected to have neuromuscular disorders that may affect NMB and/or trial assessments. history of previous abdominal laparoscopy procedures. must not currently (within past 6 months) meet DSMIVTR criteria for substance abuse or dependence (excluding nicotine). history of a chronic pain condition (requiring continuous/daily pain medication prior to surgery). females who have given birth to one or more children in the last 12 months, or are pregnant or intend to become pregnant between randomization and &gt;Day 30 pregnancy followup contact [premenopausal female of childbearing potential]. evidence of acute cholecystitis. dialysisdependency or suspected of having severe renal insufficiency (defined as estimated creatinine clearance of &lt;30 mL/min). significant hepatic dysfunction that would prevent participation in the trial, based on the summary of product characteristics of the study drugs. history of or family history of malignant hyperthermia. known allergy to trial treatments (rocuronium, sugammadex, succinylcholine, cisatracurium, neostigmine, atropine) or their excipients, to opioids/opiates, or other medication used during general anesthesia. expected transfer to intensive care unit after surgery. must continue to receive toremifene or fusidic acid during the trial. has participated in another clinical trial within 30 days of signing the informed consent form of the current trial.</criteria>
