	<brief_title>E-Compared-CH: Comparative Effectiveness Research on Internet-based Depression Treatment - Swiss Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Depression is a common mental disorder with a negative impact on mental well-being, quality of life, and social and work-related functioning both in the short and longer term. Additionally, depression is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, health care utilization and health care costs. On a population level, depression is one of the most costly diseases. The economic costs of depression were estimated at â‚¬136.3 billion (EU25) in 2010 in the EU and are still rising. European health care systems face the challenge of improving access to cost-effective treatments while simultaneously working to sustain budgetary stability in times of economic austerity. Internet-based depression treatment appears a very promising alternative to current routine depression treatment strategies. Meta-analyses have demonstrated the clinical effectiveness and potential cost-effectiveness of Internet-based treatment for depression in controlled research setting. Internet-based treatment thus has the potential to keep depression treatment affordable, as it enables mental health care providers to reach out to large populations needing depression treatment at a better cost-effectiveness than those of standard treatment as usual (TAU), but with similar levels of clinical efficacy and quality of care. The trials will be conducted in 8 European countries. Objective To compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of blended CBT and TAU in secondary care Methods In Switzerland, a randomized-controlled trial will be carried out in secondary care, comparing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of CBT and TAU for adults with major depressive disorder (MDD). Respondents will be followed until 12 months after baseline (measures will be taken at BL, 12 weeks, 18 weeks, 6 months and 12 months).</detailed_description>
