	<brief_summary>Perinatal depression is a significant concern, particularly for low-income women. Many cases of perinatal depression are complicated by comorbidities such as post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, anxiety, and intimate partner violence. Providing perinatal mental health services to women in home visiting programs could have considerable public health significance. This study will develop and test an integrated model of mental health services embedded within home visitation (HV) programs. This model will (1) incorporate a protocol for systematic screening and referral; (2) strengthen formal linkages between HV programs and other components of service systems; (3) promote the capacity of service systems to provide evidence-based early intervention and treatment for depression; and (4) facilitate the receipt of early intervention and treatment services for perinatal depression and comorbid conditions. This will be the first model to our knowledge that systematically integrates screening, referral, and early intervention and treatment for perinatal depression and associated comorbidities within HV programs. The specific aims are: 1. To develop an integrated model of perinatal depression care within HV programs. This integrated model ("SCRIPT") will incorporate screening, referral, and individualized prevention and treatment services. 2. To assess the feasibility of implementing the SCRIPT model with high fidelity in two HV programs. One HV program—DRUM Healthy Families—will use paraprofessionals as interventionists while the other program—M&amp;I Nursing—will use nurses and social workers as interventionists. 3. To determine the impact of the SCRIPT model on depressive symptoms and major depressive episodes.</brief_summary>
