	<brief_summary>Excessive mechanical forces can cause complications of dental implants and their suprastructures (crowns and bridges), and can possibly be destructive for the bone and soft tissues around the implants. Sleep bruxism (grinding and clenching of the teeth during sleep) is considered as an important source of mechanical forces in the oral environment. Therefore, in this study, the investigators will investigate whether sleep bruxism is associated with implant and peri-implant complications.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Planned for treatment with implantsupported fixed suprastructure(s). 18 years of age or older. Opposing teeth of implantsupported fixed suprastructure(s) are restored with removable artificial teeth. Patients categorized in the classes 3 or higher according to the ASA system for classification of physical status. Use of occlusal splint, mandibular repositioning appliance or any other bruxism mitigating device during sleep. Active periodontitis at the time of implant placement. Known allergy to Grindcare® electrode material. Patients with a pacemaker. Swollen, infected or inflamed tissues or skin eruptions, e.g. phlebitis, varicose veins etc. in the placement area of the Grindcare® electrode. Pregnant women will not be treated with dental implants. Pregnancy after placement of implants will not be a reason to stop participation of the subject in the study.</criteria>
