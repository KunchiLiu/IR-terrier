	<brief_title>An Evidence Based Protocol for Oxytocin Administration in Vaginal Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A traditional practice in many US hospitals includes use of 10-40 IU of Oxytocin mixed in various volumes of crystalloid administered at an unspecified and uncontrolled rate (quite often off the pump) in order to restore uterine tone and minimize routine blood loss in the third stage of labor. Many practitioners question high dose oxytocin regimens, timing and duration of Oxytocin administration for postpartum hemorrhage prophylaxis. Given the lack of a universally accepted, evidence based protocol, this study aims at comparing the efficacy of a traditional approach of administration of Oxytocin with an evidence-based designed algorithm.</detailed_description>
