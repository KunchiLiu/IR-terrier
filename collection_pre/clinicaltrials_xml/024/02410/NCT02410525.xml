	<brief_summary>In this study, radioactive PF-06427878 will be administered, through a vein, alone and with 2 different oral doses of non-radioactive PF-06427878 to healthy, adult, male subjects. Positron emission tomography will be used to characterize tissue distribution. The study will also characterize how the study drug behaves in the body, its safety, and how the body tolerates it.</brief_summary>
