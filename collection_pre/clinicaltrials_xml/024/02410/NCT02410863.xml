	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multi-center, clinical phase II study to explore the correlation of the genetic make-up of the treated tumor before start of therapy and to correlate clinical response at 8 weeks as well as metabolic response at 2 and 8 weeks with genetic features of the tumor. It will be conducted as a rationale optimization of targeted therapy in BRAF naïve and pretreated patients. Prerequisite for all patients is the availability of tumor sample at start of treatment in order to determine the underlying driver mutation (BRAF mutational status) as well as molecular composition by next generation sequencing (NGS) and assessable lesions for biopsy at week 2. Melanoma patients in stage III (non-resectable) and stage IV are sorted into Cohort A,B or C according to their previous BRAF-treatment and treated with dabrafenib and trametinib (cohort A and C) or dabrafenib (cohort B).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this open-label, multi-center, clinical phase II study melanoma patients in stage III (non-resectable) and stage IV are sorted into Cohort A,B or C according to their previous BRAF-treatment: Cohort A (BRAFi naïve): Patients who have not received prior BRAFi or MEKi-therapy. Dabrafenib (BRAFi) and trametinib (MEKi) will be administered orally at their recommended doses for combination therapy of 150 mg twice daily (BID) and 2 mg daily (QD). Clinical endpoint is clinical response at week 8. Metabolic response will be assessed at week 2 and 8. Treatment will continue until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Cohort B (BRAFi rechallenge): Patients with complete or partial (CR/PR) response as best response to previous BRAFi treatment (including but not limited to dabrafenib, vemurafenib), discontinuation of this therapy after progression and different therapy for &gt; 3 months prior to enrollment. Dabrafenib (BRAFi) will be administered orally at its recommended monotherapy dose of 150 mg twice daily (BID). Clinical endpoint is clinical response at week 8. Metabolic response will be assessed at week 2 and 8. If patients will be classified metabolically as "non-responders" at week 2 they will be switched to the dabrafenib / trametinib combination therapy. After week 8 all patients of cohort B will be treated with the dabrafenib / trametinib combination therapy until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Cohort C (BRAFi / MEKi rechallenge): Patients with CR/PR as best response to previous BRAFi / MEKi combination therapy, discontinuation of this therapy after progression and different therapy for &gt; 3 months prior to enrollment. These patients will receive dabrafenib and trametinib at their recommended combination therapy doses of 150 mg twice daily (BID) and 2 mg daily (QD). Treatment will continue until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Survival will be assessed every 3 months after the final dose of BRAFi / MEKi until the end of the follow-up phase for the individual patient. Follow up phase for each subject is 1 year following first treatment dose. End of study will be at recruitment finished plus 1 year post start of treatment of last patient thus ensuring that 1 year survival rate can be estimated. Biopsies taken before start of treatment, after 2 weeks (+/- 4 days) and after progressive disease will be analyzed by Next generation sequencing (NGS), immunohistochemistry (IHC), phosphorplex Luminex as well as by reverse phase protein array in order to determine the magnitude of suppression of downstream signaling as well as reactivation of adaptative mechanisms. Rebiopsy is mandatory after 2 weeks and in case of progressive disease in order to determine mechanisms of adaptation of the signaling pathway downstream. The experimental molecular data will be analyzed in correlation with clinical response at week 8 (defined as partial or complete response according to RECIST) and metabolic responses at weeks 2 and 8 (responders are defined as those patients with changes of &gt;66% in the Standard Uptake value (SUVmax) between interim PET and baseline PET.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. ≥ 18 years of age. 2. Signed written informed consent. 3. Histologically confirmed cutaneous melanoma that is either Stage IIIc (unresectable) or Stage IV (metastatic), and determined to be BRAF V600E/K mutationpositive by the central laboratory. Subjects with ocular or mucosal melanoma are not eligible. 4. Assessable lesion for biopsy at week 2 not inferring with RECIST measurements (Biopsies for genetic/biomarker analyses must be taken from lesions not required for disease assessment) 5. Measurable disease, i.e., present with at least one measurable lesion per RECIST, version 1.1 for the definition of a measureable lesion. 6. For Cohort A: Must NOT have received prior treatment with BRAF or MEK inhibitor. If a prior systemic therapy (such as but not limited to chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic, vaccine and/or investigational treatment) in metastatic disease has been administered, four weeks or more since last systemic treatment must have passed. Must have recovered from any acute toxicity associated with prior therapy. 7. For Cohort B: Must have shown PR/CR during prior treatment with a selective BRAF inhibitor (including but not limited to dabrafenib, vemurafenib) that was discontinued due to tumor progression and received subsequent alternative treatment (such as but not limited to surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic, vaccine and/or investigational treatment), with a period of at least 3 months since last intake of a selective BRAF inhibitor. 8. For Cohort C: Must have shown PR/CR during treatment with selective BRAF/MEK combination treatment that was discontinued due to tumor progression and received subsequent alternative treatment (such as but not limited to surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic, vaccine and/or investigational treatment), with a period of at least 3 months since last intake of BRAF/MEK inhibitor 9.
