	<brief_summary>This study is a single center open-label randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of calcitriol plus losartan therapy in subjects with type II diabetes and macroalbuminuria.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intervention Using Vitamin D for Elevated Urinary Albumin Treated With Losartan in Diabetes (IDEAL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators propose to test the efficacy and safety of a combined regimen of calcitriol and losartan in subjects with type II diabetes (T2DM) with macroalbuminuria. Should the investigators study confirm the hypothesis that the proposed novel regimen is superior to the current practice of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade, the study would significantly advance the care of subjects with type II diabetes and kidney disease in Qatar and worldwide. In this regard it is worth noting that the prevalence of end stage renal disease in Qatar is 202 subjects per million population. This would translate into fewer subjects requiring dialysis or transplantation, an enormous benefit to individuals and society.</detailed_description>
