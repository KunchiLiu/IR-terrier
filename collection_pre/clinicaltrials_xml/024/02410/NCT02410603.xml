	<brief_title>Isolating and Testing Circulating Tumor DNA and Soluble Immune Markers During the Course of Treatment for Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our plan is to collect blood from patients with advanced stage lung cancer who are scheduled to undergo systemic therapy. In this study we will utilize a novel technology for circulating tumor DNA detection in order to evaluate their presence in patients with lung cancer by comparing blood samples at six time points. We will obtain baseline blood and then collect blood at five time points during the course of the patient's chemotherapy treatments and at the end of treatment. These same blood collections will be used for the detection of soluble immune markers and evaluation of PBMCs.</detailed_description>
