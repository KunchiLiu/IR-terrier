	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the bronchial inflammation and hyperresponsiveness after oil supplementation. Before and after oil supplementation the investigators measure decrease in lung function after exercise-challenge in a cold chamber and increase of inflammatory markers in the blood.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bronchial Inflammation and Hyperresponsiveness After Oil Supplementation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects suffering form exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) usually have a normal lung function testing at rest and show a decrease in lung function when they do sports or an exercise-challenge. In a previous study the investigators could show, that the combination of exercise test and inhalation of cold air ist more sensitive and specific than exercise-challenge in ambient temperature. It is known that omega - 3 -fatty acids could reduce the production of inflammatory mediators. In this study the investigators will investigate the protective effect of oil supplementation with middle-chain and polyunsaturated fatty acids in an exercise-induced asthma provocation model. Therefore the investigators will measure the decrease in lung function and a increase of inflammatory markers in the blood before and after oil supplementation. Before and after the exercise-challenge the investigators will measure spirometry and body plethysmography. The investigators want to examine if the body plethysmography is more sensitive in the measurement of exercise induced bronchoconstriction than spirometry. The investigators hypothesize that the oil supplementation can reduce bronchial inflammation and hyperresponsiveness.</detailed_description>
