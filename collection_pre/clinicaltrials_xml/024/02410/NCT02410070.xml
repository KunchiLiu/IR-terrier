	<brief_title>A Comparison of Minimal Approach With Conventional Approach for Distal Radial Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to compare a minimal invasive approach with the conventional flexor carpi radialis approach for volar plating of distal radial fractures. From January 2011 to September 2012, 157 patients with distal radial fractures were allocated into group A (n=83) and B (n=74). Patients in group A were treated through a 1.5 to 2-cm long incision, and patients in group B were treated through the conventional flexor carpi radialis approach. All fractures were fixed with volar plates. Patients were assessed range of motion of the wrist, grip strength of the hand, and pronation strength of the wrist. Results were analyzed with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences 13.0. A P &lt; 0.05 was statistically significant.</detailed_description>
