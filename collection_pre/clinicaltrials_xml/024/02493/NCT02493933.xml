	<brief_summary>To evaluate the effect of oral Phytoestrogen or Isosorbid mononitrate or N-acetyl cysteine as an adjuvant to clomiphene citrate on induction of ovulation and pregnancy outcomes in patients with PCOS. In this three-arm open RCT, 240 PCOS infertile women were randomly divided to 3 groups for induction of ovulation. Group A, [PE group, n= 80] patients received CC 100mg/d plus oral Phytoestrogen120 mg/ day and patients in Group B, [ISMN group, n=80] received CC 100 mg/d plus 20 mg Isosorbid mononitrate and Group C, [NAC group, n=80] patients received CC 100 mg/d plus NAC 1200 mg/day.</brief_summary>
