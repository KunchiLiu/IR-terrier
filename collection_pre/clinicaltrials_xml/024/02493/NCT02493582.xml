	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Apatinib combined with cytokine-induced killer cell (CIK) vs Apatinib alone as the third line therapy for advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients with wild-type EGFR</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Study of Apatinib Plus CIK as the Third Line Therapy for Advanced Lung Adenocarcinoma Patients With Wild-Type EGFR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>400 patients with stage IIIB &amp; IV lung adenocarcinoma who had received surgery and chemotherapy,will be randomly divided into group A（Apatinib plus CIK treatment ) or group B（Apatinib), and the randomize ratio will be 1:1. Patients in group A will receive 3 cycles of CIK treatment (every 1 year) and Apatinib (continuous).Patients in group B will receive only Apatinib (continuous) .</detailed_description>
