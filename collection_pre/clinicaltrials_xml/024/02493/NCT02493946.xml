	<brief_summary>The purpose of the protocol is to demonstrate the safety and the efficacy of a single injection of a new formulation of Clostridium Botulinum toxin type A haemagglutinin complex (BTX A HAC NG) to improve the appearance of moderate to severe glabellar lines (the lines between the eyebrows) and to assess the long term efficacy and safety of BTX-A-HAC NG after repeated injections.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a multicentre study conducted in two periods. Subjects will first be enrolled to enter the double blind (DB) period Cycle 1. Subjects who are eligible for retreatment will then be offered to enter open label (OL) Cycles 2 to 5 as DB roll-over subjects. Once recruitment of the DB period is complete, the study will enrol additional BTX-na√Øve subjects (hereafter referred to as OL de novo subjects) into the OL period Cycle 1. All OL de novo subjects who are eligible for retreatment will also be offered to enter OL Cycles 2 to 5. A total of 580 subjects (180 subjects randomised in the DB period and an additional 400 de novo subjects in the OL period) are planned to complete the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Provision of written informed consent prior to any study related procedures. Male or female subjects between 18 and 65 years of age. Have moderate or severe (Grade 2 or 3) vertical glabellar lines at maximum frown at Baseline (Day 1), as assessed by the ILA using a validated 4 point photographic scale. Have moderate or severe (Grade 2 or 3) vertical glabellar lines at maximum frown at Baseline (Day 1), as assessed by the SSA using a validated 4point categorical scale. Are dissatisfied or very dissatisfied (Grade 2 or 3) with their glabellar lines at Baseline (Day 1), as assessed by the subject's level of satisfaction. Have a negative pregnancy test (for females of childbearing potential only). No childbearing potential is defined as postmenopausal for at least 1 year, surgical sterilisation at least 3 months before entering the study, or hysterectomy. Have both the time and the ability to complete the study and comply with study instructions. Previous treatment with any serotype of BTX. Any prior treatment with permanent fillers in the upper face including the glabellar lines area. Any prior treatment with any dermal fillers in the upper face including the glabellar lines area within the past 3 years and/or skin abrasions/resurfacing (whatever the interventional technic used) within the past 5 years, or photo rejuvenation or skin/vascular laser intervention within the past 12 months. Any planned facial cosmetic surgery during the study. A history of eyelid blepharoplasty or brow lifts within the past 5 years. An inability to substantially reduce glabellar lines by physically spreading them apart or lack of capacity to frown. An active infection or other skin problems in the upper face including the glabellar lines area (e.g. acute acne lesions or ulcers). Use of concomitant therapy, which in the investigator's opinion, would interfere with the evaluation of the safety or efficacy of the investigational medicinal product (IMP), including medications affecting bleeding disorders (antiplatelet agents and/or anticoagulants given for treatment or prevention of cardio/cerebro vascular diseases). Pregnant women, nursing mothers, or women who are planning a pregnancy during the study, or believe they may be pregnant at the start of the study. Throughout the course of the study, women of childbearing potential must use a reliable form of contraception (e.g. oral contraceptives for more than 12 consecutive weeks, or spermicide and condoms). Treatment with an experimental drug or use of any experimental device within 30 days prior to the start of the study and during the conduct of the study. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any component of BTXAHAC NG. Clinically diagnosed significant anxiety disorder, or any other significant psychiatric disorder (e.g. depression) that might interfere with the subject's participation in the study. Use of medications that affect neuromuscular transmission, such as curarelike non depolarising agents, lincosamides, polymyxins, anticholinesterases and aminoglycoside antibiotics, within the past 30 days. A history of facial nerve palsy. Marked facial asymmetry, ptosis, excessive dermatochalasis, deep dermal scarring, or thick sebaceous skin. The presence of any other condition (e.g. neuromuscular disorder or other disorder that could interfere with neuromuscular function), laboratory finding or circumstance that, in the judgement of the investigator, might increase the risk to the subject or decrease the chance of obtaining satisfactory data to achieve the objectives of the study.</criteria>
