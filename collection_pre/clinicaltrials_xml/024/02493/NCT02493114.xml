	<brief_title>Functional Status in Patients Undergoing Curative Treatment for Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preliminary evidence suggests that patients with lung cancer experience a decrease of exercise tolerance and muscle strength during the course of their treatment. The underlying mechanisms and impact of this change has not yet been investigated. In light of this, our trial will prospectively follow a convenience sample of 70 patients with lung cancer who are treated curatively. Patients will be assessed before, during and at the end of the treatment (surgery and/or chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy). The aims of the study are to 1. Investigate the influence of curative treatment for lung cancer on functional and maximal exercise tolerance (primary outcome). 2. Investigate the metabolic changes underlying changes in exercise tolerance during curative treatment for lung cancer (primary outcome). 3. Investigate the relationship between changes in exercise tolerance, daily physical activity, pulmonary function and skeletal muscle function during curative treatment for lung cancer (secondary outcome). 4. Investigate the relationship between changes in exercise tolerance and self-reported quality of life, functional status, feelings of anxiety and depression and symptoms during curative treatment for lung cancer (secondary outcome). 5. Investigate the relationship between physical activity and exercise tolerance on one hand and comorbidities, hospitalisations and cancer-related and all-cause mortality on the other hand after curative treatment for lung cancer (exploratory outcome).</detailed_description>
