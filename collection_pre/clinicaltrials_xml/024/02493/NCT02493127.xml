	<brief_summary>Objectives: To determine the association between priming and measurements of hand function such as grip strength Primary null hypothesis: There is no difference in grip strength (best of three attempts) as a percent of the opposite hand between patients that complete the standard Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) compared to patients that complete the positively adjusted PCS. Secondary null hypotheses: There is no difference in grip strength (last of three attempts) as a percent of the opposite hand between patients that complete the standard PCS compared to patients that complete the positively adjusted PCS. There is no difference in grip strength (best of three attempts) before and after completing the questionnaires between patients that complete the standard PCS compared to patients that complete the positively adjusted PCS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Priming of Questionnaire Content on Grip Strength in Patients With Hand and Upper Extremity Illness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Priming affects all aspects of human behavior. Prior research by the investigators' group determined that completing a positively phrased version of the pain catastrophizing scale (PCS) primed patients to report less disability on average than completing the standard PCS. The influence of priming can be better understood by determining if it also affects direct measurements of hand function such as grip strength measures.</detailed_description>
