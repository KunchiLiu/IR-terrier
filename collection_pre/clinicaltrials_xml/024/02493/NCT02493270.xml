Smokers that were willing to quit received periodontal treatment and concurrent smoking cessation therapy. Periodontal maintenance was performed every 3 months. A calibrated examiner, blinded to smoking status, assessed periodontal status, gathered demographic and behavioural information with a structured questionnaire and measured air carbon monoxide concentration measurements.</brief_summary>
