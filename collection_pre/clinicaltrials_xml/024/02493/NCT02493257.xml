	<brief_summary>The proposed study seeks to investigate the effect of intranasal capsaicin treatment in patient with Non-allergic irritant rhinitis (NAIR), as well as evaluate optical rhinometry (ORM) as a means to quantify symptomatic improvement in NAIR patients during and after treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intranasal Capsaicin Treatment for Non-Allergic Irritant Rhinitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A study by Lambert et. al. (2012) was able to objectively identify patients with NAIR by intranasal capsaicin challenge followed by assessment with optical rhinometry. Studies have shown that capsaicin therapy can improve symptoms of patients historically identified with NAIR via visual analog scale (VAS) rating of symptoms and symptom surveys; however, there has been no study evaluating the capsaicin therapy on patients objectively identified as NAIR patients. Multiple studies have demonstrated that intranasal capsaicin can improve nasal symptoms of NAIR patients. Regarding the usage of capsaicin, there is a product on the market: Sinus Buster which has capsaicin as the active ingredient. Numerous research papers have evaluated the efficacy and safety of Sinus Buster for the treatment of congestion in non-allergic rhinitis patients. However, the diagnosis of NAIR in these previous studies was based primarily on history. In addition, the primary outcome in these studies was symptomatic without any objective evaluation. The goal of this study will be two-fold: with patients objectively identified as NAIR patients via the optical rhinometer, we will re-evaluate the therapeutic action of intranasal capsaicin on the management of rhinitic symptoms. We expect that the patients will show significant improvement in their symptoms. We will then use optical rhinometry as a means to objectively monitor changes in symptoms in NAIR patients. We expect that post treatment, patients will no longer have the positive response previously seen on intranasal capsaicin challenge before receiving treatment. We hope to be able to establish optical rhinometry as an objective measurement of symptom improvement for NAIR symptoms, along with the subjective patient surveys.</detailed_description>
