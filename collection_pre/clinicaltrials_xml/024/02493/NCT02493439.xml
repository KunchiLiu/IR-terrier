	<brief_title>A Positive Activity Intervention to Promote Wellbeing in Romanian Immigrants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies have shown that groups of immigrants may face a series of problems unique to the process of immigration, such as working, legal, social, and mental and physical health problems. BPS is a guided imagery exercise that requires participants to envision themselves in the future, achieving desired goals in different areas of their lives. This exercise has shown efficacy improving optimism, future expectancies and positive affect compared to a control condition, in general population. Taking into account the prior literature, the aim of the present study is to carry out a randomized controlled study in order to replicate the findings about the effects of BPS on optimism, mood and affect in an immigrant population. The design employed in this study is similar to the used in other studies.</detailed_description>
