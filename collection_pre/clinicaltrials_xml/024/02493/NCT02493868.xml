	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of intranasal esketamine plus an oral antidepressant compared with an oral antidepressant (active comparator) plus intranasal placebo in delaying relapse of depressive symptoms in participants with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) who are in stable remission after an induction and optimization course of intranasal esketamine plus an oral antidepressant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Intranasal Esketamine Plus an Oral Antidepressant for Relapse Prevention in Adult Participants With Treatment-resistant Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind (neither the researchers nor the participant know what treatment the participants is receiving), active-controlled, multicenter (more than 1 study site) study in participants with TRD to assess the efficacy of intranasal esketamine plus an oral antidepressant compared with an oral antidepressant (active comparator) plus intranasal placebo in delaying relapse of depressive symptoms. The study will consist of 5 phases: Screening/Prospective Observational Phase (4-7weeks) for direct-entry participants only, Open-label Induction Phase (4-weeks) for direct-entry participants only, Optimization Phase (12-weeks; open-label for direct-entry participants and double-blind for transferred-entry participants), Maintenance Phase (variable duration; double-blind for all participants) and Follow-up Phase (2-weeks). Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For DirectEntry Participants At the time of signing the informed consent form (ICF), participant must be a man or woman 18 (or older if the minimum legal age of consent in the country in which the study is taking place is greater than [&gt;]18) to 64 years of age, inclusive At the start of the screening/prospective observational phase, participant must meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM5) diagnostic criteria for singleepisode major depressive disorder (MDD) (if singleepisode MDD, the duration must be greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 2 years) or recurrent MDD, without psychotic features, based upon clinical assessment and confirmed by the MiniInternational Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) At the start of the screening/prospective observational phase, participant must have an Inventory of Depressive SymptomatologyClinician rated ( IDSC30) total score of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 34 At the start of the screening/prospective observational phase, participants must have had nonresponse (less than or equal to 25 percent [%] improvement) to greater than or equal to (&gt;=1) but less than or equal to (&lt;=) 5 oral antidepressant treatments taken at adequate dosage and for adequate duration, as assessed using the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGHATRQ ) MGHATRQ and documented by medical history and pharmacy/prescription records, for the current episode of depression. In addition, the participant is taking different oral antidepressant treatment (on the MGHATRQ) for at least the previous 2 weeks at or above the minimal therapeutic dose The participant's current major depressive episode, depression symptom severity (Week 1 MADRS total score &gt;=28 required), and treatment response to antidepressant treatments used in the current depressive episode (retrospectively assessed) must be deemed valid for participation in a clinical study based on a SiteIndependent Qualification Assessment For TransferredEntry Participants The participant must have completed the doubleblind induction phase in ESKETINTRD3001 or ESKETINTRD3002 and must have demonstrated response at the end of that phase (&gt;=50% reduction in the MADRS total score from baseline [Day 1 prerandomization] at the end of the 4week doubleblind induction phase) Participants who have previously demonstrated nonresponse of depressive symptoms to esketamine or ketamine in the current major depressive episode, to all 4 of the oral antidepressant treatment options available for the doubleblind induction phase (ie, duloxetine, escitalopram, sertraline, and venlafaxine extended release [XR]) in the current major depressive episode (based on MGHATRQ), or an adequate course of treatment with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the current major depressive episode, defined as at least 7 treatments with unilateral/bilateral ECT Participant has received vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) or has received deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the current episode of depression Participant has a current or prior DSM5 diagnosis of a psychotic disorder or MDD with psychotic features, bipolar or related disorders (confirmed by the MINI), obsessive compulsive disorder (current only), intellectual disability (DSM5 diagnostic codes 317, 318.0, 318.1, 318.2, 315.8, and 319), autism spectrum disorder, borderline personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, or narcissistic personality disorder Participant has homicidal ideation/intent, per the investigator's clinical judgment, or has suicidal ideation with some intent to act within 6 months prior to the start of the screening/prospective observational phase, per the investigator's clinical judgment or based on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) Participants with history of moderate or severe substance or alcohol use disorder according to DSM5 criteria</criteria>
