	<detailed_description>The investigators plan to conduct a waitlist control trial. Intervention consists of a combination of computerized cognitive behavioral therapy and arousal-based Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy. During the latter component, the physiological variables of participants, such as pulse rate and EEG, will be continuously monitored and presented as feedback to them. Participants will have to deliver speeches to videotaped audiences while striving to regulate their physiological arousal.</detailed_description>
