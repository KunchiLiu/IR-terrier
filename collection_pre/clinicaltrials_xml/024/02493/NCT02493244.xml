	<brief_summary>Tears play a vital role in vision. A thin layer of tears is always present to cover the surface of the eye for optimal comfort and vision. There are several layers to the tear film, and the outer most layer is comprised of lipids. This lipid layer prevents evaporation of the tears and may be disrupted in people suffering from symptoms of dry eye. Cleaning eyelids with Cliradex wipes have shown to be effective in reducing dry eye symptoms in some patients, and the purpose of this study is to evaluate the tear film lipid layer thickness before and after one months treatment with Cliradex Wipes.</brief_summary>
