	<brief_summary>Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder associated with widespread pain that dramatically impacts patient's quality of life. Its exact cause has not yet been identified, however recent studies have indicated that fibromyalgia is associated with significant imbalance of the connectivity within brain networks associated with pain, decreased functional connectivity in the descending pain-modulating system, and increased activity in the pain matrix related to central sensitization. It has been suggested, therefore, that treatments that induce coherent neuronal activity, and/or stimulate synchronization of dysregulated brain circuitry, have significant benefits, improving pain management and enhancing patient's quality of life. Rhythmic Sensory Stimulation (RSS) is an example of a non-invasive treatment that is thought to indirectly stimulate neuronal coherence. The present research proposal aims to determine the effectiveness of Rhythmic Sensory Stimulation with 40 Hz sound on the treatment of fibromyalgia. The proposed treatment involves 30 minutes of daily rhythmic vibroacoustic stimulation at 40 Hz, 5 days per week, for 5 weeks. The treatment is self-administered by the patients at home with the Sound Oasis Vibroacoustic Therapy System (VTS) 1000 portable device. Measures of pain severity, fibromyalgia symptoms, sleep quality, and depression, will be compared before and after treatment between the treatment and control groups. The results of the present study will help to better understand the effectiveness of Rhythmic Sensory Stimulation to the treatment of chronic pain disorders, such as fibromyalgia, and contribute to the development of future studies to investigate the neural driving effects of therapies based on Rhythmic Sensory Stimulation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder associated with widespread pain that dramatically impacts patients' quality of life. Its exact cause has not yet been identified, however, recent studies indicate that fibromyalgia is associated with significant imbalance of the connectivity within brain networks associated with pain, decreased functional connectivity in the descending pain-modulating system, and increased activity in the pain matrix related to central sensitization. It has been suggested that treatments that stimulate or induce coherent neuronal activity, and synchronize dysregulated brain circuitry, have significant benefits improving pain management and enhancing patients' quality of life. An example of a non-invasive treatment that is thought to indirectly stimulate neuronal coherence is Rhythmic Sensory Stimulation (RSS) in gamma frequencies. RSS stimulates the mechanoreceptors in the body using low-frequency sound (e.g., 40 Hz) by means of speakers in a chair. Previous research demonstrates significantly improved pain management in several pain conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, low-back pain, sports injuries); however, little is known about the effect of RSS with low-frequency sound on fibromyalgia. The use of RSS to treat fibromyalgia was first explored very recently and findings indicate that this treatment could be effective for individuals with fibromyalgia given that 40 Hz low-frequency sound stimulation indirectly stimulates neuronal coherence. The present research aims to determine the effectiveness of RSS with 40 Hz sound for treating individuals with fibromyalgia. Aim: The present study aims to examine and determine the effectiveness of RSS at 40 Hz with sound in improving pain management and quality of life among patients with fibromyalgia. Intervention: The proposed treatment involves 30 minutes of daily rhythmic vibroacoustic stimulation at 40 Hz, 5 days per week, for 5 weeks. The treatment is self-administered by the patients at home with the Sound Oasis Vibroacoustic Therapy System (VTS) 1000 portable device. Measures of pain severity, fibromyalgia symptoms, sleep quality, and depression will be compared before and after treatment between the treatment and control groups. Outcomes: It is expected that patients undergoing RSS at 40 Hz will have significantly different scores after treatment on all outcome measures examined in comparison to the control group. The results of the present study will help to better understand the effectiveness of RSS for treatment of chronic pain disorders, such as fibromyalgia, and contribute to the development of future studies to investigate the neural driving effects of therapies based on RSS.</detailed_description>
