	<brief_title>Autoantibodies on Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most patients experience variable degrees of functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI), predominantly in the first months after lesion. In SCI animal models, autoantibodies are pathogenic and their titers rise up at the time when spontaneous recovery stops. The aim of this study is to determine the autoantibody profiles after SCI and to infer their relation with functional recovery. To achieve this, autoantibody profiles will be determined from a serum blood sample and functional recovery will be evaluated accordingly to standardized scales.</detailed_description>
