	<brief_summary>The prediction of dangerousness remains a delicate subject, relevant in current psychiatry. Scalable psychopathological elements identified in schizophrenia and mood disorders are considered as most at risk for crime committing. The French High Authority of Health (HAS) recommends to identify and prevent risk situations of violence and to develop research at this level. Some authors have worked on criminal career and became interested in risk factors for aberrant driving behaviors but also in environmental or clinical elements accompanying these phases. To our knowledge, no specific study about contextual elements before misconduct and which could lead to aberrant driving behaviors among individuals diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder has been described to date The investigators propose to follow individuals diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder in prison during 6 months in order to list their conduct disorders and contextual elements upstream of these misconducts. The investigators will also study the effect of contextual factors related to judicial steps on the appearance of aberrant driving behaviors.</brief_summary>
