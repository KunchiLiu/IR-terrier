	<brief_title>Ombitasvir/ABT-450/Ritonavir (Ombitasvir/ABT-450/r) and Dasabuvir Therapy With Low Dose Ribavirin (RBV), Full Dose RBV or RBV Add-On in Treatment Naive Genotype 1a Hepatitis C Virus Infected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A study to evaluate the effect of RBV on second phase plasma HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) decline in subjects who receive ombitasvir/ABT-450/ritonavir and dasabuvir with full dose RBV compared to ombitasvir/ABT-450/ritonavir with low dose RBV or without RBV in treatment-naive HCV genotype (GT) 1a-infected adult subjects.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Screening laboratory result indicating HCV genotype 1 (GT1) a infection. 2. Chronic HCV infection. 3. Subjects must be noncirrhotic. 4. Subjects must be able to understand and adhere to the study visit schedule and all protocol requirements as well as voluntarily sign and date an institutional review board (IRB) approved informed consent. 1. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. 2. Positive test result for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or antihuman immunodeficiency virus antibody (HIV Ab) positive immunoassay. 3. Clinically significant abnormalities or comorbidities, other than HCV infection, that make the subject unsuitable for this study or treatment. 4. Current enrollment in another interventional clinical study. Previous use of any HCV treatments including pegylated interferon (pegIFN), ribavirin, or any direct acting antiviral agent, either investigational or approved, for HCV including protease inhibitors, nucleoside or nonnucleoside polymerase inhibitors, or NS5A inhibitors. 5. History or solid organ transplant. 6. Screening laboratory analysis that shows abnormal results.</criteria>
