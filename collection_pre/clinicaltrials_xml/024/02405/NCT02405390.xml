	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate if intubation with video laryngoscopy (VL) will result in less head motion and therefore less cervical motion when compared with direct laryngoscopy (DL). The aim of the study is to determine the amount of head motion (extension, flexion and rotation) when using Storz C-Mac® video laryngoscopes and direct laryngoscopes. Secondarily, the study will also measure the number of attempts to properly intubate and the time required for intubation with either technique.</brief_summary>
