	<brief_summary>Occipital stroke is associated with homonymous visual field defects (occurring on one side of the visual field). Despite spontaneous recovery, some degree of defect is often permanent. Currently, no treatment exists for such visual field defects.The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of a type of electrical brain stimulation method, transcranial alternating current stimulation, in reducing these type of visual field defects in their chronic stage.</brief_summary>
