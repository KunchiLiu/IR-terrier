	<brief_summary>Overdose with potential deadly outcome is a serious problem among opioid abusers, not least in Norway. To save lives, immediate treatment with a Î¼-opioid antidote such as naloxone is required. The purpose of this study is to explore the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of naloxone in healthy volunteers under opioid influence.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacodynamics and Arteriovenous Differences of Naloxone in Healthy Participants Exposed to an Opioid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy volunteers will be brought into a state of opioid influence in a well-known, short acting, controlled and safe manner using remifentanil. This will create a strong opioid effect inducing a miosis, reduced respiration and reduced sensation to pain, all three strong indicators of opiates. Naloxone will counteract these effects, which can be measured as a change in pupillary size. Blood samples for both naloxone and remifentanil will be also be taken. Naloxone is a well-known, well-tolerated drug with an excellent safety profile over many decades of use. The formulation used in this trial holds market authorization. Care will be taken not to include opioid users in this study as naloxone would precipitate acute withdrawal. Also possible drug misusers will be excluded as well as people who have access to remifentanil and infusion equipment in their daily work, although the abuse potential of this highly specialised drug is minimal. By weighing syringes before and after discharge the reliability of the dose delivered will be confirmed.</detailed_description>
