	<brief_summary>Objective: to describe and compare the implementation of two cancer survivorship care tools: (1) 'My Care Plan': a patient-initiated tool and (2) 'Survivorship Care Plan Builder': a provider-initiated tool. The results of this study will be used to (1) provide an initial assessment of the two survivorship care planning tools and (2) inform the design and conduct of a larger study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patient and Provider Initiated Survivorship Care Planning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background/Rationale: In a 2005 report 'From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in Transition', the Institute of Medicine recommended that cancer patients completing treatment receive a summary of the care received and a plan outlining follow-up care needs. Taken together these materials are referred to as a 'Survivorship Care Plan', or SCPs. Based on this recommendation from the IOM, a number of organizations developed survivorship care plan templates. Two of these templates, 'Survivorship Care Plan Builder' and 'My Care Plan,' were developed by Journey Forward, a collaboration among the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, UCLA Cancer Survivorship Center, Oncology Nursing Society, WellPoint, Inc., and Genentech (http://journeyforward.org/). These tools are available free of charge to those wishing to use them. As the time and effort required to complete SCP documents have been found to be barriers to implementation, this study aims to explore the use of these two tools. Research Questions: 1. What processes are undertaken to implement survivorship care planning? - How do these processes differ between the patient-initiated My Care Plan and provider-initiated Survivorship Care Plan Builder? 2. What is the feasibility of implementing survivorship care planning? - Does the feasibility differ between the patient-initiated My Care Plan and provider-initiated Survivorship Care Plan Builder? 3. What is the value of survivorship care planning to both patients and providers? - Does the value differ between the patient-initiated My Care Plan and provider-initiated Survivorship Care Plan Builder? Study Design: This is a pilot randomized study. Cancer patients completing acute treatment with a participating provider will be randomized to either the patient-initiated My Care Plan tool or provider-initiated Survivorship Care Plan Builder. The investigators will describe and compare how each tool is implemented in practice, the feasibility of completing each tool, and the value of the tools to patients and providers. The study will use quantitative and qualitative measures of implementation, feasibility, and value.</detailed_description>
