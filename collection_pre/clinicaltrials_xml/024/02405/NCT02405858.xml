	<brief_title>A Study of Abiraterone Acetate in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Participants Who Responded Poorly to the First-line Combined Androgen Blockade Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 4, non-randomized, multi-center (when more than one hospital work on a medical research study), open label (identity of study drug will be known to participant and study staff), single arm study of abiraterone acetate to investigate its efficacy and safety in participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who failed the first-line combined androgen blockade (CAB) therapy. The study consists of Screening Phase (28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1), Treatment Phase (up to 2 years), Post Treatment Phase (30 days after the last dose of study drug). Participants will receive 1000 milligram (mg) (four 250 mg tablets) of abiraterone acetate orally once daily. In addition, 5 mg of oral prednisolone will be concomitantly administered twice a day (10 mg per day). A 28-daily dosing cycle will be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity is observed. The total duration of study will be 2 years. Participants will be primarily evaluated for PSA response. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants who have histologically or cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma of the prostate without neuroendocrine differentiation or small cell histology Participants who had prostatespecific antigen (PSA) progression defined as a rise of PSA at least 1 week apart resulting in 25 percent (%) increase in PSA with last PSA greater than (&gt;) 2 nanogram per milliliter (ng/mL) (according to PCWG2) after antiandrogen withdrawal Participants who had PSA progression within a year after the start of firstline CAB therapy, or who had PSA progression without having a normal PSA level (less than [&lt;] 4.0 ng/mL) in the firstline combined androgen blockade (CAB) therapy Participants who have not been treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy (including estramustine) for the treatment of prostate cancer (neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy is only allowed if the last dose is greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 1 year from the scheduled date of initial administration of abiraterone acetate) Participants who have target or nontarget metastatic abnormalities either on screening bone scan, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) A participant who has known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to abiraterone acetate or its excipients A participant who has severe liver dysfunction (ChildPugh Score C), active or symptomatic viral hepatitis or chronic liver disease A participant who has received other hormonal therapy, including any dose of finasteride, dutasteride, any herbal product known to decrease PSA levels (example: Saw Palmetto and PCSPES) within 4 weeks prior to the scheduled date of initial administration of abiraterone acetate A participant who has had surgery or local prostatic intervention within 4 weeks prior to the scheduled date of initial administration of abiraterone acetate A participant who has active infection or other medical condition that would make prednisolone use contraindicated</criteria>
