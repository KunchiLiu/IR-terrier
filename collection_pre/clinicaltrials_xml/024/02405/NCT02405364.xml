	<brief_summary>The purpose is to determine whether induction and consolidation treatment with Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone (CRd), within an intensive program, warrant further investigation in clinical trials.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Front-line Therapy With Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone Induction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to evaluate the sCR rate of the combination of carfilzomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients at the completion of consolidation therapy. It's a multicenter, open label, non randomized, phase II study. 46 patients will be enrolled. Induction: 4 cycles of 28 Days with Carfilzomib/Lenalidomide and dexamethasone Stem Cell Harvest: High dose Cyclophosphamide with intensification consolidation: 4 cycles of 28 Days with Carfilzomib/Lenalidomide and dexamethasone Maintenance : Lenalidomide 13 cycles of 28 days</detailed_description>
