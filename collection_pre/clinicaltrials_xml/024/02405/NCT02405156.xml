	<detailed_description>This prospective double-blind, randomized, clinical trial, will be conducted at Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital.

Data recording: 1. Duration of complete abortion. 2. Post abortion bleeding. 3. Incomplete delivery of the placenta necessitates evacuation under anesthesia. 4. Hemoglobin and hematocrit after 24 hours from abortion to estimate the decrease in hemoglobin level. 5. Recording maternal morbidities. 6.
