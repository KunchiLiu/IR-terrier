	<detailed_description>Though the diagnostic properties of Corus CAD have been evaluated in previous observational studies, there are limited data regarding how primary care clinicians are using the results of the test in the care and management of patients with symptoms suggestive of angina in the African-America patient population. This retrospective study is designed to examine the relationship between the Corus CAD score and patterns of care regarding cardiology referral or further cardiac diagnostic testing in an African-American patient population single-center site. This is a retrospective study, designed to be conducted at a single-center in the US. The study will conduct a one-time data abstraction from approximately 500 patient medical charts who received Corus CAD testing, by order of the Principal Investigator. Limited demographic data and patient data pertaining to cardiology referral or advanced diagnostic testing will be collected. All data will be collected anonymously. IRB approval will be requested with a waiver of informed consent, as no identifying information will be collected. This retrospective study is designed to understand the patterns of care, including referrals for cardiac care and testing (including referrals to a cardiologist, exercise stress testing, cardiac computerized tomography angiography (CCTA), invasive cardiac angiography (ICA)) within an African-American patient population.</detailed_description>
