	<brief_summary>The BIPPED study seeks to determine whether wound healing, in particular diabetic foot ulcers, can be monitored using electrical bioimpedance analysis (BIA). BIA measures the resistance of biological tissue to the passage of a very small electric current applied with electrodes. Different types of tissue, due to cell structure, hydration and vascularization, have specific electrical characteristics. The BIPPED study aims to provide experimental data for the development of a BIA sensor for monitoring of wound healing in chronic wounds.</brief_summary>
