	<brief_summary>Obesity is directly related to an increased risk of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, and overall mortality. Weight loss is effective in decreasing these risks and to reduce disease severity. Bariatric surgery is an effective therapy for sustained weight loss and type 2 diabetes (T2D) remission in most of the morbidly obese patients. But there is also a significant number of individuals with an inappropriate response to bariatric surgery. Two recent retrospective studies assessed the role of genetic load as a predictor of this response, but the results are still unelucidated. The aim of this study is to assess whether a selection of genetic variants may allow us to identify individuals who will have a satisfactory response after bariatric surgery in terms of weight loss and T2D remission.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY FACTOR AS A PREDICTOR OF TYPE 2 DIABETES REMISSION AND WEIGHT LOSS AFTER BARIATRIC SURGERY</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A retrospective case-control study of 100 women who underwent bariatric surgery (Roux-en-Y laparoscopic gastric bypass): 50 pacients who were diabetic before surgery: 15 cases with less than 40% of the excess weight loss (EWL) and 35 cases with more than 75% EWL, matched with 50 non diabetic controles: 15 patients with less than 40%EWL and 35 with more than 75%EWL after one year. All individuals were analyzed with a genetic score from Nutri inCode. The predictive ability was analyzed by discrimination (area under the ROC curve), sensitivity and specificity and a score was calculated.</detailed_description>
