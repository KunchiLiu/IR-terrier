	<brief_summary>Cervical incompetence is a relatively complex disorder from the diagnostic and therapeutic point of view. Despite established diagnostic criteria, it is not easy for the specialist in clinical practice to establish limits in complicated cases. Cervical cerclage is the technique classically used to avoid pregnancy loss or preterm birth in patients with cervical incompetence. Although numerous studies support its efficacy, it remains a controversial method, given what the technique implies for the clinician and patient. Difficulties and potential risks of its insertion and inconveniences and side effects for the patient still exist. The recently published promising results of the use of the pessary to prevent preterm birth in women with a short cervix offer new prospectives for the management of prematurity prevention. The short learning curve, good cost-effectiveness and, most importantly, low side effects, render the pessary a tool of great potential.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis To ascertain whether the cervical pessary can reduce the preterm delivery rate to below 37 weeks in women with cervical incompetence, at least from 33.5% to 26.6%, as does cervical cerclage. Objectives The main aim is to evaluate the results of the cervical pessary compared with those of cerclage in patients diagnosed with cervical incompetence. Secondary aims will include assessment of morbility produced by the pessary compared with cerclage and acertain the economic impact of pessary use in these patients. Methods Longitudinal, prospective, randomised pilot study. Inclusion criteria - Singleton pregnancy - 12+0 - 25+6 weeks of gestation - Minimum age: 18 years - History of 3 or more late miscarriages, 3 or more premature births, 3 or more late miscarriages or premature births altogether or history of one or more preterm births or pregnancy losses in the second trimester and cervical length &lt; 25mm before 25+6 weeks. Sample size: 60 women, 30 in the pessary group and 30 in the cerclage group. Randomisation will be made by an electronic database especially designed for it at 1:1. The primary outcome is delivery before 34 weeks. Secondary outcomes are preterm birth rate before 28 and 37 weeks, associated maternal side effects, maternal and foetal complications and neonatal morbidity and mortality.</detailed_description>
