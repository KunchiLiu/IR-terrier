	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if performing blood tests and imaging scans at different time points during chemotherapy can help researchers predict if patients with DLBCL will respond to treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Visits: If you are found to be eligible, you will have the following tests and procedures performed during the 2 cycles of your already-scheduled chemotherapy. Within 5 days before Cycle 1 of chemotherapy: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of the disease. You must fast (not eat or drink anything except water) for at least 6 hours before this blood draw. On Days 2 and 3 of Cycles 1 and 2 of chemotherapy, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check the status of the disease. You should fast for at least 6 hours before the Day 3 blood draw. On Day 4 of Cycles 1 and 2 of chemotherapy: - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check the status of the disease. You must fast for at least 6 hours before this blood draw. - During Cycle 1 only, you will have an FDG-PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease. On Day 14 (+/- 5 days) of Cycles 1 and 2 of chemotherapy: °Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of the disease. You must fast for at least 6 hours before this blood draw. Within 5 days before the end of Cycle 2 of chemotherapy: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of the disease. You must fast for at least 6 hours before this blood draw. - You will have an FDG-PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease. Some of the blood collected on this study may be banked at the MD Anderson Lymphoma Tissue Bank under MD Anderson Protocol 2005-0656. You will be given a separate consent form that describes this banking. Length of Study: Your participation on this study will be over after the End-of-Study Visit. End-of-Study Visit: Within 21 days (+/- 5 days) after the start of Cycle 2 of chemotherapy, you will have an FDG-PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease. If the scan shows that the disease does not appear to be getting better, you will have a fine needle aspiration (FNA), core needle biopsy, and/or an excisional biopsy to check the status of the disease. To collect an FNA, a small amount of tissue is withdrawn through a needle. To perform a core needle biopsy, a sample of tissue is removed using a hollow core needle that has a cutting edge. To perform an excisional biopsy, the affected area is completely removed by cutting it out. Follow-Up: Researchers may collect information from your medical record after your participation in this study is over to check how you are doing. This is an investigational study. FDG-PET/CT scans on this study are performed using FDA-approved and commercially available methods. Up to 50 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age 18 years or older at the time of screening. 2. Subject/legal representative willing and able to provide written informed consent. 3. Histologically confirmed aggressive Bcell DLBCL, including FL transforming to DLBCL. 4. Willing to provide existing relapseconfirmatory DLBCL tumor sample. 5. Relapsed from or refractory to at least one treatment containing rituximab combined with anthracyclinebased chemotherapy. 6. CT scans showing involvement of 1 or more clearly demarcated lesions with a long axis &gt; 1.5 cm and short axis &gt;/=1.0 cm. 7. Baseline FDG PET/CT scans must demonstrate at least one hypermetabolic lesion as defined by the Deauville criteria (52) localizing to CTdefined anatomical tumor sites. 8. Suitable candidate for therapy with highdose chemotherapy and ASCT as determined by the treating physician. 9. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2. 10. Life expectancy of &gt;/=12 weeks as estimated by the treating physician. 11. Negative serum betahuman chorionic gonadotropin (BetahCG) test (women of childbearing potential only). 12. Adequate organ function defined as follows: Serum creatinine &lt;/= 1.5 × ULN or calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt;/= 50 mL/min as determined by the CockcroftGault equation. 1. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the interpretation of study results or subject safety including nonmalignant FDG avid diseases such as sarcoidosis or other granulomatous disease. 2. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. 3. Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study where they are receiving nonstandard salvage chemotherapy, (i.e., concurrent enrollment is allowable if the patient is receiving standard salvage chemotherapy and research imaging is allowed). 4. History of serious allergy or reaction to any component of RICE or RDHAP formulations that would prevent administration.</criteria>
