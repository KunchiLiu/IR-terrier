	<brief_title>Determine the Prevalence and Severity of Asthma in HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospectively clinically phenotype and the prevalence of asthma in HIV infected patients in the Duke ID Clinic - HIV infected asthmatic subjects meeting clinical definitions for asthma compared to HIV uninfected asthma subjects identified at the DAAAC and HIV infected non-asthmatic subjects. - Prospective immunological phenotyping - HIV-infected asthma subjects prospectively identified and clinically phenotyped compared to HIV-uninfected asthma subjects identified at the DAAAC and HIV infected non-asthma subjects. Regarding the sampling method of probability sample: All samples for HIV infected asthmatic patients, HIV uninfected asthmatic patients and HIV infected non-asthmatics patients will be analyzed. Retrospectively determine overall asthma prevalence and severity among HIV-infected patients. Retrospective immunological phenotyping (circulating cytokines) of HIV-infected patients utilizing available specimens in the Duke HIV Specimen Biorepository - HIV-infected asthmatic subjects meeting asthma definition compared to overall asthma prevalence in U.S. population - HIV-infected asthma subjects meeting asthma definitions compared to matched HIV-infected non-asthma subjects</detailed_description>

Willing and able to give informed consent and adhere to visit/protocol schedules. Negative pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential For asthma patients: known or possible diagnosis of asthma for at least one year Antibiotic administration for upper respiratory infection within the prior 30 days Greater than 10 pack a year smoking history No prior use of steroids (systemic) within the past 3 months Underlying illnesses that may result in altered lung function Students or employees who are under direct supervision of any Project or Core PI/Director. Pregnant or nursing mothers. Poorly controlled concomitant conditions as determined by the investigator. Subjects who have had an elective procedure (for example, colonoscopy, cystoscopy, etc.) within less than 2 weeks of the procedure date cannot be enrolled in the HIV Asthma study Subjects must delay enrollment by 2 weeks into the HIV Asthma study if they have received a single dose of systemic steroids</criteria>
