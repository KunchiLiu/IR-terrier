	<brief_summary>The human fetus swallows over 200 ml of amniotic fluid per kilogram of weight each day and such swallowing is essential for normal small bowel development.Growth factors found in the amniotic fluid have been shown to promote proliferation of fetal intestinal cells. As feeding intolerance is a common problem among premature neonates, the investigators will study the role of enteral administration of simulated amniotic fluid solution in prevention of feeding intolerance and NEC in premature neonates.</brief_summary>
