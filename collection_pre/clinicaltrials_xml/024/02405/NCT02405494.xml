	<brief_summary>Liquid foams can be formed by trapping pockets of gas in a beverage. The primary objective of this study is to test the individual contribution, and possible interaction, of the liquid volume and gas to liquid volume ratio (i.e. %overrun (%OR, defined as 100 x [gas volume/liquid volume]) of a beverage to its satiating properties.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Liquid Volume and the Amount of Incorporated Gas Into a Carbohydrate/Protein Beverage on Satiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is not known how the liquid and gas volumes of a liquid foam contribute to its satiating properties and how and if these factors interact. The best way to assess these parameter combinations and their interactions is to use a special statistical approach named "Response Surface Methodology" (RSM). The current study therefore has a Central Composite Design with 9 foams differing in liquid volume and in ratio of gas to liquid volume (%overrun, which is defined as 100 x gas volume/liquid volume). Each subject will be appointed to a single parameter combination and receives this parameter combination twice, separated by a one-week wash-out period. On both test days subjects' self-assessment of feelings of satiety and physical discomfort will be recorded during 4 hours post-consumption of the treatment using Electronic Visual Analogue Scale.</detailed_description>
