	<detailed_description>This is a blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study. All subjects who meet the inclusion requirements and no exclusion criteria will be entered into an up to 14 day screening phase. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive Injectafer or Placebo on days 0 and 5. All treated subjects will be followed for efficacy and safety for 42 days. Subjects will visit the clinic on days 0 and 5 for treatment, and then on days 14, 28, and 42.
