	<brief_summary>Available data suggest that low dose aspirin may be a safe, widely available and inexpensive intervention that may significantly reduce the risk of preterm birth. However, this possibility needs to be proven in a properly designed randomized controlled trial (RCT) with preterm birth as the primary outcome. Such a clinical trial in a racially, ethnically and geographically diverse population could best be accomplished by the established infrastructure of the Global Network for Women's and Children's Health Research (GN).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aspirin Supplementation for Pregnancy Indicated Risk Reduction In Nulliparas (ASPIRIN)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Preterm birth (PTB) remains the leading cause of neonatal mortality and long term disability throughout the developed and developing world. Though complex in its origins, a growing body of evidence suggests that first trimester administration of low dose aspirin (LDA) holds promise to reduce the rate of PTB substantially. Hypothesis: The investigators' primary hypothesis is that nulliparous women with no more than two previous first trimester pregnancy losses who are treated with LDA daily beginning between 6 0/7 weeks and 13 6/7 weeks gestational age (GA) through 36 0/7 weeks GA will reduce the rate of preterm birth from all causes. Study Design Type: Prospective randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded multicenter clinical trial (patient level 1:1). Population: Nulliparous women between the ages of 18 (or local age of majority) and 40 with no more than two previous first trimester pregnancy losses or any second trimester spontaneous pregnancy loss, a singleton pregnancy between 6 0/7 weeks and 12 6/7 weeks GA confirmed by ultrasound, and no contraindications to aspirin. Other medical conditions, such as sickle-cell anemia, may be considered a contraindication per the judgment of the site investigator. Intervention: Daily administration of low dose (81 mg) aspirin [also known as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)], initiated between 6 0/7 weeks and 13 6/7 weeks GA and continued to 36 0/7 weeks GA compared to an identical appearing placebo. Compliance and outcomes will be assessed biweekly. Outcomes: The primary outcome is to determine whether daily LDA initiated between 6 0/7 weeks and 13 6/7 weeks and continued to 36 0/7 weeks reduces the risk of preterm birth (birth prior to 37 0/7 weeks of pregnancy) by 20%. This will be determined based on assessed date of delivery in comparison to the projected estimated date of delivery, independent of whether or not the preterm delivery is iatrogenic or spontaneous. Secondary outcomes include: - Preeclampsia and eclampsia - Small for gestational age - Perinatal mortality Other secondary outcomes of interest are: Maternal outcomes: - Vaginal bleeding - Antepartum hemorrhage - Postpartum hemorrhage - Maternal mortality - Late abortion - Change in maternal hemoglobin Fetal outcomes: - Rate of preterm birth &lt;34 0/7 weeks of pregnancy - Birth weight &lt;2500g and &lt;1500g - Fetal loss - Spontaneous abortion - Stillbirth - Medical termination of pregnancy</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Nulliparous women between 18 40 years of age. Minors who are ≥ 14 years of age may be enrolled if permitted by the country's ethical guidelines. No more than two previous first trimester pregnancy losses No medical contraindications to aspirin; Single live intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) between 6 0/7 and 13 6/7 weeks GA corroborated by an early dating ultrasound and with heart rate greater than &gt;110 bpm. Women prescribed daily aspirin for more than 7 days; Multiple gestations; Fetal anomaly by ultrasound (Note most fetal anomalies are not detectable by ultrasounds done at this early gestation. Subsequent discovery of a fetal anomaly is not viewed as an exclusion.); Hemoglobin &lt; 7.0 gm/dl at screening; Any other medical conditions that may be considered a contraindication per the judgment of the site investigator (e.g., Lupus, Type 1 Diabetes, or any other known significant disease) Blood pressure ≥ 140/90 (Systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 and diastolic ≥ 90 at screening)</criteria>
