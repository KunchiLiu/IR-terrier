	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine weather treatment with anthocyanins will affect lipid profile, markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in addition to antioxidative level in serum to the better in persons with increased risk of dementia. The purpose of this study is to examine weather treatment with anthocyanins will increase the score of relevant tests of cognitive function.

	<detailed_description>Design, method and material: The investigators will first do an open pilot study (Phase 1) where 30 people will receive anthocyanins for 16 weeks. By an indication of positive results in this phase, the investigators aim to do an placebocontrolled randomised prospective parallel group study (Phase 2). The investigators aim to recruit persons with increased risk of cognitive reduction: persons over 50 years with stable coronary heart disease (CAD) from the cardiology department Stavanger University Hospital. In addition will persons with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia be included from the memory outpatient clinic, Stavanger University Hospital. Blood will be taken by venepuncture by an experienced nurse, centrifuged and handled in according to standardized procedures. The analyzes will be done by the Alzheimer Centrum, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm. The patients will be tested in relevant tests of cognitive function at inclusion and after 16 weeks. At inclusion the patients will be tested in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Geriatric depression scale (GDS) to make sure that the patients meet the inclusion criteria. At inclusion and after 16 weeks the patients will be tested in Word List Memory Word List Recall Word List Recognition, Trail Making Test A + B and Stroop Word and Colour test.</detailed_description>
