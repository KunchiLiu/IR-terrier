	<brief_summary>The WHO, states that age related cataracts account for 51 percent of worldwide blindness and affect about 20 million people. Surgery with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation is the first line treatment for cataracts, thus there is an on going effort to improve IOL design and performance. It is planned to compare three different IOL designs in a psychophysical test setting. Most IOL testing is done in 2D scenarios such as Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity or contrast sensitivity testing. The use of 3D scenario would allow testing a more real-life situation. As various downsides of different IOL designs have been reported, testing of IOLs before surgical implantation is a promising approach to maximise patient satisfaction. Known deficiencies include amongst others reduced contrast sensitivity or light intensity. To test three different IOL designs, it is planned to have 2D healthy young subjects look through a stable, table mounted spectacle frame, in which the different IOLs can be inserted. This allows for subjective testing of IOL's in a 2D and 3D scenario.</brief_summary>
