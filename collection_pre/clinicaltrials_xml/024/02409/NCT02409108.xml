	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to gather information on how safe the hyperthermia treatment delivered via the Exatherm-TBH (the device that will heat your blood and deliver it back to you), added to the best supportive care is to patients who have advanced persistent or recurrent, unresectable Non Small Cell Lung Cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perfusion-Induced Hyperthermia in Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One potential candidate for a new approach to advanced lung cancer therapy is hyperthermia because lung cancer cells are thermo-sensitive, with significantly reduced heat shock protein (HSP) expression. Moreover, hyperthermia (42°C) causes repression of genes involved in the cell cycle and cellular growth and proliferation. Upon exposure to hyperthermic conditions, HSP expression is increased in normal cells. However, when cancer cells are exposed to hyperthermia, they initially express significantly less HSPs than normal cells, which sensitizes them to hyperthermia. Mild hyperthermia (43°C for less than two hours) induces extensive double-stranded DNA fragmentation and, at a later time, apoptosis in murine thymocytes. In cells with irreparable levels of DNA damage, apoptosis is the means of elimination.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of Stage IIIB or Stage IV of nonsmall cell lung cancer and have received at least two lines of FDAapproved or National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) accepted systemic therapy and progressed through, or not tolerated, such therapy. Subjects whose tumors harbor an exon 19 deletion or exon 21L858R EGFR mutation must have progressed on or had intolerance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Subjects whose tumors harbor an AKL translocation must have progressed on or had intolerance to crizotinib (or any FDA approved ALK inhibitor). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2 Life expectancy of greater than 3 months. Age ≥18 years. There is no restriction on the number of prior therapies allowed for this disease and prior radiation and chemotherapy is allowed, provided the subject has recovered from all grade 2 or greater toxicity prior to enrollment. Patient understands the nature of the procedure, is willing to comply with associated followup evaluations, and provide written informed consent prior to the procedure Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C, or monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab, cetuximab or panitumumab) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered to &lt; grade 2 adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. Patients with stroke or TIA within 90 days prior to enrollment; or peripheral vascular disease requiring intervention within the 90 days prior to enrollment; or any known hemodynamically significant lesion or embolic plaque. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below: leukocytes ≥3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL total Bilirubin, AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR)&gt; 60 as defined by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula Thromboplastin Time (PTT) &lt; 35 sec) Patients with uncontrolled seizure disorder, spinal cord compression or carcinomatous meningitis. Patients with a mental disorder, psychiatric illness/social or concussion which would inhibit their ability to provide informed consent or prevent compliance with followup. Patients with high risk of cardiovascular event such as severe uncontrolled hypertension (&gt;170/110 systemic blood pressure on therapy), or pulmonary hypertension (greater than .5 systolic blood pressure ST elevation myocardial infarction within 30 days prior to enrollment; unstable angina or significant, untreated arrhythmias within 30 days prior to enrollment. Patients with moderate to severe heart failure, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV, liver dysfunction with total bilirubin &gt;2. 5 upper limit of normal, or serum creatinine &gt;2.5 mg/dL or any form of dialysis; within 30 days prior to enrollment. Patients with a major surgical procedure or other investigational agents within 30 days before study enrollment. Patients with known, untreated or progressive brain metastases will be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. Pregnant women are excluded from this study Prior malignancy except for adequatelytreated basal cell (or squamous cell) skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer for which the patient has been diseasefree for three years. Patients with documented contraindication to anticoagulation therapy such as heparin induced thrombocytopenia or a documented coagulopathy or hematologic disorder that would contraindicated undergoing treatment and use of the associated anticoagulant agents required during treatment. Patients with documented active bacterial, viral or fungal infection, untreated systematic peptic ulcer disease, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or serious concurrent medical disease that could limit survival to less than 3 months. HIVpositive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for harm when exposed to hyperthermia, as well as negative interactions of these medications with hyperthermia.</criteria>
