	<brief_summary>Microalbuminuria (MA) is an independent cardiovascular risk factor in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. However, in the setting of type 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria could be a marker of either early diabetic nephropathy or diffuse endothelial dysfunction. At present, there are no biomarkers that permit us to discriminate between these two conditions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Microalbuminuria as a Cardiovascular Risk Factor (PRECISED Substudy)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A hypothesis free approach by using proteomic/metabolomic analyses in the urine samples of selected populations seems an appropriate approach by which to explore this issue. In addition, a driven hypothesis in the same groups of patients based on a sensitive marker of kidney injury also seems appropriate. Urinary levels of KIM-1(Kidney Injury Molecule-1 ) have been found elevated in experimental diabetic nephropathy even before that MA . In addition, urinary levels of KIM-1 were found significantly elevated in type 1 diabetic patients with MA, in comparison with diabetics with normoalbuminuria and non-diabetic healthy controls. Moreover, low urinary KIM-1 levels at baseline were associated with the regression of MA during a follow-up of 2 years . Therefore, it could be hypothesized that the presence of MA + KIM-1 in urine samples would indicate renal injury rather than endothelial dysfunction.</detailed_description>
