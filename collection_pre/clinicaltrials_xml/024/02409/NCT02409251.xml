	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to assess the effect of a simple intervention (a combination of education and feedback) on Antinuclear Antibody (ANA) testing. This aim was chosen because of the known overuse of many laboratory tests, of which ANA testing is one. As overuse of ANA tests can have negative consequences (both for patients and society), the investigators designed an intervention to see how this would influence Antinuclear Antibody testing by rheumatologists.</brief_summary>
