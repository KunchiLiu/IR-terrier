	<brief_summary>This is a study planned to determine and compare immunogenicity and reactogenicity of DTP-HB-Hib vaccine of SIIL delivered either with disposable-Syringe Jet Injector (DSJI) or disposable-syringe needle in total 340 Indian infants aged 6 to 8 weeks at the time of enrollment. It will provide information to aid managers, device regulatory control officials, immunization programs, and clinicians who make decisions on safe clinical practice standards.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing DTP-HB-Hib by Disposable-Syringe Jet Injector To Vaccination By Needle And Syringe In Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, observer blind, non-inferior, parallel group, multi-centre clinical study to determine and compare immunogenicity and reactogenicity of DTP-HB-Hib vaccine of Serum Institute of India Ltd. delivered either with disposable-Syringe Jet Injector (DSJI) or disposable-syringe needle in total 340 Indian infants. Sera samples will be analyzed by ELISA for seroconversion / seropositivity for each individual component of vaccine i.e. Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, Hepatitis B (HBsAg) and Hemophilus Influenza B at 28 days after administration of a third dose of the vaccine.</detailed_description>

Parents of subjects willing to give written informed consent. 4. Parents willing to comply with study protocol. 5. Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and screening evaluation including clinical examination. 6. The participant should be the resident of study area 1. Infant subject participating in other clinical trial or planned participation in another clinical trial during the present trial period. 2. Infant with congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, malignancy or receiving immunosuppressive therapy such as systemic corticosteroids therapy for a period of â‰¥ 1 week. 3. Infant with history of allergy or systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine component or history of a lifethreatening reaction to the trial vaccine or a vaccine containing the same substances. 4. Infant with any chronic illness including hepatic, renal, respiratory, CVS, endocrine and neurological illness. 5. Infants who have received blood or bloodderived products in the past. 6. History of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and hepatitis B or Haemophilus influenzae type b (confirmed either clinically, serologically or microbiologically). 7. Previous history of vaccination against the diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis or Hib. 8. Known history of a bleeding disorder contraindicating intramuscular vaccination. 9. History of any neurological disorder or history of seizure (febrile or afebrile), or encephalopathy, encephalitis, hypotonichyporesponsive episode. 10. History of febrile illness at the time of inclusion is a temporary exclusion criterion. 11. Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, endocrine, autoimmune, cardiovascular, metabolic, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by medical history, and physical examination tests, which in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with the study objectives 12. Infant with any other condition, which, in the opinion of the investigator would jeopardize the safety or rights of the infant participating in the study or making it unlikely the subject could complete the protocol</criteria>
