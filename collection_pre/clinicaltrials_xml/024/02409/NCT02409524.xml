	<brief_title>An Individualized Anti-Cancer Vaccine in Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or primary liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. It accounts for 90% of all liver cancers. More than 80% of patients present with advanced or unresectable disease. For patients with vascular invasion and/or metastases, the only approved therapy that offers a survival advantage is Sorafenib (Nexavar®). While palliative systemic chemotherapy other than Sorafenib is sometimes offered for HCC, there is no evidence that any chemotherapy has any meaningful therapeutic benefit, especially in overall survival. Subjects in the current study will have completed at least 90 days of sorafenib treatment. Subjects will continue sorafenib as tolerated while receiving experimental therapy. The experimental dosing schedule has four segments: (1) priming, which consists of intradermal AlloStim alone; (2) vaccination, which consists of intradermal dosing of AlloStim+CRCL; (3) activation, which consists of an intravenous infusion of AlloStim; and (4) booster, which consists of monthly intradermal injections of CRCL alone</detailed_description>
