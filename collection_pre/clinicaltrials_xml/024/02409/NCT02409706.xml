	<brief_summary>This study aims to explore the frequency and types of micronutrient deficiencies in a sample of UK children with CHD using standard and novel markers in blood. The study will also explore whether micronutrient deficiencies increase the risk of complications after heart surgery. This study will identify any nutrient deficiencies that need monitoring in clinical practice.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Congenital heart disease (CHD) is one of the most common birth defects in the UK. Children with CHD are at risk of underfeeding and undernutrition. This is due to both the increased nutritional requirements of the disease and sometimes clinical management, which often hinders delivery of optimal nutrition.There are as yet no studies assessing micronutrient body stores in children with CHD or whether micronutrient deficiencies predict poor clinical outcomes, such as post-operative complications, after major cardiac operations. This study aims to explore the frequency, types and associations of micronutrient deficiencies in children with CHD using standard and novel markers in blood. The study will also explore whether micronutrient deficiencies increase the risk of complications after heart surgery. This study will identify any nutrient deficiencies that need monitoring in clinical practice.</detailed_description>
