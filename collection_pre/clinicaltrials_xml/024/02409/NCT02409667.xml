	<brief_summary>To demonstrate in the patient pool of PASI 90 responders at Week 24 that secukinumab 300 mg s.c. when administered at a longer dosing interval is non-inferior to secukinumab 300 mg s.c. every 4 weeks treatment with respect to maintaining a PASI 90 response rate at Week 52.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Main 1. Chronic plaquetype psoriasis diagnosed for at least 6 months prior to Screening and candidate for systemic therapy. 2. Moderate to severe psoriasis at Baseline as evidenced by: PASI ≥ 10 and IGA mod 2011 score of 3 or higher (based on a scale of 0 to 4) and BSA affected by plaquetype psoriasis of ≥ 10%. Main 1. History of exposure to any biologic drug taken for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis or any other indication including but not limited to antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, anti interleukin (IL)12/23, or any antiIL 17A or IL 17A receptor (IL 17AR) antibody. 2. History of hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or to drugs of similar chemical classes. 3. Forms of psoriasis other than chronic plaquetype (eg, pustular, erythrodermic and guttate psoriasis). 4. Druginduced psoriasis (ie, new onset or current exacerbation from betablockers, calcium channel inhibitors or lithium). 5. Ongoing use of prohibited psoriasis treatments (eg, topical or systemic corticosteroids, ultraviolet (UV) therapy). 6. Ongoing use of other nonpsoriasis prohibited treatments. Washout periods detailed in the protocol have to be adhered to. All other prior nonpsoriasis concomitant treatments must be at a stable dose as detailed in the protocol before initiation of study drug. 7. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) laboratory test (&gt; 5 mIU/mL). 8. Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using effective methods of contraception during dosing of study drug and for 16 weeks after stopping study drug. 9. Active ongoing inflammatory diseases other than psoriasis that might confound the evaluation of the benefit of secukinumab therapy. 10. Underlying condition (including, but not limited to metabolic, hematologic, renal, hepatic, pulmonary, neurologic, endocrine, cardiac, infectious or gastrointestinal conditions) which, in the opinion of the Investigator, significantly immunocompromises the patient and/or places the patient at unacceptable risk for receiving an immunomodulatory therapy.</criteria>
