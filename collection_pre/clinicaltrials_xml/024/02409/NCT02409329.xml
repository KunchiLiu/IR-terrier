	<brief_summary>Approximately one in three persons with diabetes are nonadherent to their medications. Nonadherence is more common among low income, racial/ethnic minorities with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and is a strong, independent predictor of having poor glycemic control, being hospitalized, pre-mature mortality, and higher healthcare costs. Theory-based adherence promotion interventions are more effective than atheoretical, adhoc approaches, and are needed for patients at highest risk of nonadherence. A well-validated theoretical model, the Information—Motivation—Behavioral Skills (IMB) model, has informed effective medication adherence promotion interventions for patients with HIV and hypertension, and should inform adherence interventions in diabetes. Moreover, widely available technologies, such as mobile phones, offer a means to deliver adherence interventions to a broad range of patients, including low income, racial/ethnic minorities at high risk of nonadherence. The goal of this research is to use the IMB model to inform the content and functionality of a mobile phone-delivered medication adherence promotion intervention, ensure intervention content is clearly communicated (i.e., uses simplified text and plain language), and evaluate intervention effects on adherence and glycemic control among low-income adults with T2DM receiving primary care at Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). This interdisciplinary research will greatly enhance our understanding of how to address social-cognitive barriers to adherence among high-risk patients with diabetes, how to leverage mobile devices to support high-risk patient populations in general; and how to better design interventions to improve services for low-income, diverse patients, as well as other high-risk groups. Knowledge gained form this work may also inform interventions to reduce disparities in adherence, glycemic control, and other diabetes outcomes.</brief_summary>
