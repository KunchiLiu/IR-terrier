	<brief_title>Influence of BIIAL Following PPH on Dorsal Clitoral Artery Blood Flow and FSFI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women who underwent bilateral internal iliac artery ligation due to postpartum hemorrhage in Gaziantep Cengiz Gokcek Maternity Hospital, Gaziantep Turkey and Near East University, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mersin, Turkey comprise the study group. The control group consists of age-matched healthy women who delivered in last 2 months. Dorsal clitoral artery Doppler examinations will be performed in both case and control groups regularly in the postoperative period in 3rd and 6th months, in order to evaluate the possible effects of BIIAL on clitoral blood flow. Ultrasound is performed using a Mindray DC-7 Ultrasound System (China) equipped with linear 7.5 MHz probe. Each woman was scanned in the gynecological position. The translabial probe is placed on the clitoris sagittally and transversely without applying any pressure force. After identifying the clitoral artery using colour flow mapping, the Doppler probe is positioned over the vessel and at least three sequential Doppler wave forms are obtained. The following parameters are analysed: peak systolic velocity (PSV), end diastolic velocity (EDV), resistive index (RI), pulsatile index (PI) and systolic/diastolic (S/D) ratio. The measurements are performed by the same radiologist. Finally a Female Sexual Fantasy Questionnaire (FSFQ) is performed.</detailed_description>
