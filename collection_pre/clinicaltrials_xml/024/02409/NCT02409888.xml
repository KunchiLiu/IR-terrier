	<criteria>Study inclusion criteria are such that study participants must: 1. meet a Diagnostic and Statistical ManualIV (DSMIV) alcohol abuse or dependence diagnosis based on the Diagnostic Interview Schedule IV (DISIV); 2. consume a weekly average of at least 24 standard drinks during the baseline period to include at least 5 episodes of heavy drinking; 3. agree not to seek additional alcohol or other substance abuse treatment during the study period; 4. be at least 18 years of age; and 5. be sufficiently proficient in their English speaking ability to interact effectively with the research interviewer. Individuals assessed as having a drug diagnosis that is more severe than their alcohol diagnosis (e.g., cocaine dependence and alcohol abuse, IV drug use), a serious psychiatric diagnosis (e.g., uncontrolled schizophrenia or major depression) as well as those meeting criteria for organic brain impairment, as measured by the minimental status examination section of the DISIV will be precluded from study participation. In addition, individuals reporting current enrollment in a substance abuse treatment program, mandated to substance abuse treatment by a court order, or severely socially unstable (e.g., homeless) also will be precluded from study participation.</criteria>
