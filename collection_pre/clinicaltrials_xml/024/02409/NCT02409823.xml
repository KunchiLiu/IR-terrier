	<brief_summary>Antipsychotic drugs are characterized by blocking dopaminergic D2 receptors. They have been found to be effective and safe for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder, or psychotic symptoms in the context of Parkinson's disease. Atypical antipsychotics have lower blocking potency on D2 receptors, at the time that interact with serotoninergic, adrenergic and histaminergic receptors, among others. Quetiapine extended-release has the same clinical efficacy as the immediate-release formulation, but reduces the amount of daily doses, possibly contributing to increased treatment adherence. The purpose of this registry is to explore adherence to treatment, the occurrence of adverse drug reactions and the clinical outcomes in a sample of patients under treatment with atypical antipsychotics in several Central American countries. For this study, clinical data will be extracted from the medical records of 1000 patients with schizophrenia, depressive disorders or Parkinson's Disease with hallucinations. Occurrence of adverse drug reactions, namely weight gain, somnolence, extrapyramidal reactions and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension; adherence to treatment; and changes in quality of life and clinical status will be assessed during the first 8 weeks of treatment.</brief_summary>
