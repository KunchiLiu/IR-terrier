	<brief_summary>There are different protocols to treat gum diseases. One relevant differential aspect is related to time. There are protocols that usually takes one to two months to be completed while other are completed within 24 hours. Although both protocols seem to provide clinically similar improvements, there are some positive aspects related to the short-term one. Among them lower number of clinical sessions, easier schedule and costs advantages. However, there are many other relevant aspects that can be helpful for patients and clinicians decisions regarding type of treatment. This study evaluates if and how clinically effective protocols used to treat periodontitis affect quality of life related to individual's oral statuses. In addition, the experiences of fear, anxiety and pain before and after these specific protocols are monitored.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Periodontitis Treatment on Quality of Life and Experiences of Fear, Anxiety and Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most randomized controlled clinical trials regarding the effects of non-surgical periodontal treatment have focused on objective parameters. Their effects on patient-centered variables have been received very little attention. After determining clinical therapeutic efficacy, this study compared over 6 months the effects of two different forms of non-surgical periodontal therapy - scaling and root planing per quadrant (SRP) and one-stage full-mouth disinfection (FMD) - on scores of quality of life, fear, anxiety and pain of moderate chronic periodontitis. Initially, the sample size was calculated considering protocols' clinical efficacy. Specifically for the present study it was verified if the initial sample size would be enough for analysis of the subjective variables. Patients registered in dental care centers from University of Taubate, Taubate - Sao Paulo, Brazil and Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte - Minas Gerais, Brazil were informed about the objectives and methods of the study, being consecutively included in the study only after signing an informed consent form. Selected participants were randomly allocated to one of the treatment groups by a closed envelope system. According to the designated group, participants receive either conventional quadrant scaling in four weekly sections or full-mouth scaling within 24 hours. Two experienced trained periodontists carried out debridement procedures of both protocols with manual Gracey and McCall curettes and Hirschfield files. Specific validated instruments were used to evaluate subjective variables. Oral Impacts on Daily Performance (OIDP) and Oral Health and Quality of Life (OHQoL-UK) measured quality of life while Dental Fear Survey (DFS), Dental Anxiety Scale (DAS) questionnaires and, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) measured experienced fear, anxiety and pain, respectively.</detailed_description>
