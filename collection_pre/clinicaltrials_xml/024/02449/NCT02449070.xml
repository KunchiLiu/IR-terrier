	<brief_title>Effects of Nicorandil on Cardiac Infarct Size in Patients With ST-segment Elevation Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study objective : To investiage whether nicorandil treatment reduce infarct size measured by cardiac MRI at 6 months after primary PCI Allocation : 1. Nicorandil arm : Recieve nicorandil 4 mg i.v. before undergoing PCI, additionall 2mg i.c. just before 1st ballooning, additionall 2mg i.c. just before stenting, After successful PCI, 10 mg/day (or 5 mg/day) p.o. for 6 months. 2. Control arm : Recieve standard treatment including PCI, but avoid nicoranil and adenosine. Follow-up and Measurement : Cardiac MRI scans are scheduled at 5 days and 6 months after primary PCI. Clinically followed upto 6 months after parimary PCI.</detailed_description>
