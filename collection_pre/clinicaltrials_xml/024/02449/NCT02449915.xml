	<brief_title>Improvement of Pain Following Robotic Sacrocolpopexy and Rectocele Repair for Pelvic Organ Prolapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the last 20 years, laparoscopic surgery has assumed an important role in gynecological surgery. Unfortunately, patient surveys indicate there has been little improvement in the incidence and severity of postsurgical pain in the past two decades. Postoperative pain is a common complaint, occurring in 5-15% of patients and has been shown to significantly contribute to overall patient dissatisfaction. It can lead to increased consumption of opioids, with subsequent nausea, delayed bowel function, and prolonged postoperative recovery. In an attempt to address pain related complications with port-site wounds, various methods of pain control have been attempted. Currently, no standard of care exists and management is based on surgeon and anesthesiologist preferences. This study seeks to determine if the injection of liposomal bupivacaine to laparoscopic port sites and rectocele repair incisions at the completion of a robotic sacrocolpopexy with concomitant rectocele repair will result in decreased postoperative pain compared to injection of placebo. The secondary aim of the study is to determine which port site, if any, is the most painful after robotic sacrocolpopexy.</detailed_description>
