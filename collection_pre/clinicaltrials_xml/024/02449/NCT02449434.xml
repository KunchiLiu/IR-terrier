Written consent will be obtained from those accepting the request. An interviewer-led, previously validated questionnaire will question their frequency and timing of dietary acid intake, tooth brushing and any habits associated with dietary acid intake. This will be followed by a Basic Erosive Wear Examination. The process will take 7-8 minutes and the participant is free to withdraw at any time</detailed_description>
