	<brief_summary>The perfusion of microvascular free flaps is inevitable for completion of reconstruction in the head and neck area. In some patients microvascular anastomosis is impossible because of arteriosclerotic changes, different oncological interventions, and consecutive vessel depletion at the neck. The aim of the project is to establish an innovative system for extracorporeal perfusion of microvascular free flaps after ingrowth of new vessels from the wound bed have taken place. Afterwards, no further perfusion of the vascular pedicle is required for free flaps to survive and provide functional and aesthetic reconstruction.</brief_summary>
