	<brief_summary>This is a prospective examination of ribonucleic acid (RNA) extracted from tumor material of breast cancer patients treated with a neo-adjuvant therapy. The RNA will be analysed for expression of estrogen receptor (ER 1), progesterone receptor (PgR), HER2 and Ki-67 with MammaTyper™. According to the determined values for the individual parameters at least 4 subtypes can be distinguished to date - Luminal A-type - Luminal B-type - HER2-type - Triple-negative-type As non-clinical endpoint, the agreement of new subtyping with Immunohistochemical methods will be evaluated. As clinical objective, the 5 year Distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) and Overall survival (OS) will be reevaluated according to the new subtyping.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Re-Examination of Tumor Material and Re-Evaluation of Patient Data From Patients Treated With Neo-adjuvant Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tumor material collected from patients who received neoadjuvant therapy either with four cycles of doxorubicin 60 mg/m² plus pemetrexed 500 mg/m² on day 1 every 21 days followed by four cycles of docetaxel 100 mg/m² on day 1 every 21 days or four cycles of doxorubicin 60 mg/m² plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m² on day 1 every 21 days followed by four cycles of docetaxel 100 mg/m² on day 1 every 21 days will be re-analyzed with the MammaTyper Kit. The Kit is an in-vitro molecular diagnostic test for molecular subtyping of breast cancers into Luminal A &amp; B, HER2 and Triple negative. It allows quantitative detection of the RNA expression status of the genes for estrogen receptor (ESR1), PgR, HER2 and Ki-67 on the basis of their mRNA present in the samples. This prospective diagnostic study will investigate the subtyping-results of the MammaTyper™ analysis and will compare them to the subtyping of the former immunohistochemical analysis performed. Based on the MammaTyper™-subtypes the efficiency of the therapy regimen and the outcome will be re-evaluated from the patient data.</detailed_description>
