	<brief_title>LH Hormone Pulsation in the Luteal Phase in GnRH Antagonist IVF Cycles Triggered by GnRH Agonist for Final Oocyte Maturation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About two decades ago the GnRH antagonist has been used in IVF cycles to prevent premature LH surge. In recent review GNRH antagonist has been found comparable to GnRH agonist in term of live birth rate but with reduced risk of OHSS. another advantage of using GnRH antagonist is the ability to use GnRH agonist for final oocyte maturation which has been shown to nearly eliminate the risk of OHSS. The exact mechanism of this risk reduction is still unknown. Our aim is to do a frequent blood tests every 20 minutes for 6 hours duration in the day of ovum pick up or the day of embryo transfer to measure the level of LH, estradiol and progesterone in women triggered with GnRH agonist for final oocyte maturation.</detailed_description>
