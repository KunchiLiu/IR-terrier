	<brief_title>Nano Drug Interventional Therapy Using Digital Subtraction Angiography（DSA） for Liver Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>By enrolling patients with liver cancer adapted to enrolled criteria, this study will document for the first time the safety and the short and long term efficacy of nano drug interventional therapy using digital subtraction angiography（DSA）for liver cancer. The nano drug is made by mixing Gemzar® with Compound Glycyrrhizin Injection. The nano drug's size is detected by laser diffraction particle size analyzer.</detailed_description>
