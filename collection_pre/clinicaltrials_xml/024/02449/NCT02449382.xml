	<brief_summary>The patients with severe hypernatremia who received conventional treatment are often undertreated. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) can effectively remove solute or water from circulation system. Several case reports demonstrated that CVVH could effectively decrease serum sodium concentration of the patients with severe hypernatremia. The use of CVVH for acute severe hypernatremia in critically ill patients could improve patient survival by effectively decreasing the serum sodium concentration to a normal level.</brief_summary>
