	<brief_summary>This prospective, longitudinal study of Chinese American immigrants will examine whether psychosocial factors (e.g., acculturative stress, social isolation, discrimination) are associated with markers of type 2 diabetes risk over time, and whether such associations are mediated by inflammatory pathways.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Biobehavioral Model of Diabetes Risk in Chinese Immigrants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is now well-documented that immigration to the US leads to increased risk for various chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes. The increased diabetes risk observed among Chinese immigrants has been primarily attributed to changes in diet and weight gain following immigration, but these changes can only partially explain disparities in disease risk. Models of immigrant health suggest that the stress of adapting to life in a new country has a considerable impact on physical health. However, few studies have considered the psychosocial impact of immigration upon biomarkers of health and disease risk. Therefore, this longitudinal study of US Chinese immigrant men and women will examine: (1) whether psychosocial factors (e.g., acculturative stress, social isolation, discrimination) are associated with markers of type 2 diabetes risk over time; and (2) whether the association between psychosocial factors and diabetes risk markers is mediated by inflammatory pathways.</detailed_description>
