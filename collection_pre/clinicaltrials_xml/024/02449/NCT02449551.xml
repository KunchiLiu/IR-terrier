	<brief_summary>Volitinib is a potent and selective small molecule c-Met kinase inhibitor. Volitinib was found to inhibit c-Met kinase at the enzyme and cell levels with IC50s of 4 nM for both enzyme and Met phosphorylation in the cell. Consistent with its potent enzyme and cell activity, volitinib was found to inhibit cell growth in vitro against tumors with c-Met gene amplification in the absence of HGF stimulation with IC50s generally below 10 nM. It also potently inhibited HGF-stimulated cell proliferation against tumors with c-Met overexpression or carrying a HGF/c-Met autocrine loop. This study is a single-arm, phase II study of votilinib in patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma harboring MET amplification as a third line treatment Volitinib 800 mg will be administered orally once a day for 21 days as one cycle. To investigate the efficacy of volitinib in patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma harboring MET amplification.</brief_summary>

Are currently enrolled in, or discontinued within the last 21 days from, a clinical trial involving an investigational product or nonapproved use of a drug or device, or concurrently enrolled in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study. 2. Any previous treatment with MET inhibitors 3. Patients with second primary cancer, except: adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer, curatively treated insitu cancer of the cervix, or other solid tumours curatively treated with no evidence of disease for ≤5 years. 4.

Treatment with any investigational product during the last 21 days before the enrollment (or a longer period depending on the defined characteristics of the agents used). 7. Patients receiving any systemic chemotherapy, radiotherapy (except for palliative reasons), within 3 weeks from the last dose prior to study treatment (or a longer period depending on the defined characteristics of the agents used). The patient can receive a stable dose of bisphosphonates or denusomab for bone metastases, before and during the study as long as these were started at least 4 weeks prior to treatment. 8. With the exception of alopecia, any ongoing toxicities (&gt;Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects grade 1) caused by previous cancer therapy. 9.
