	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to identify biomarkers for acute intake of beer and alcohol in individuals with a high or low habitual intake. Furthermore, we wish to identify compounds and metabolites in different types of beer and alcohol, which can serve as compliance markers for intake under the test conditions (blood tests and urine samples). We also wish to determine the acute effects of these beverages on plasma glucose and insulin response, compared to regular soda.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identification of Biomarkers for Acute Intake of Beer and Alcohol and Acute Effects on Plasma and Insulin Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is designed as a randomized, 4-way single-blinded cross-over intervention study. The participants are randomized individually to the order by which they shall receive 4 test meals. There will be implemented a standardized lunch which includes respectively 1) Light/alcohol-free (Tuborg Super Light 0,1% alcohol), 2) Regular lager (4,6% alcohol), 3) Strong beer(7,2% alcohol) and 4) a control drink without alcohol but with the same energy content (carbohydrate and protein) as the average of the other beverages ("sportsdrink"). Besides 330 ml of each test drink, each test meal consists of grilled cheese sandwiches (Tulip Food Company) and the amount of toast adjusted according to the type of drink served with each meal, so the content of macronutrients is the same in each meal. The study includes 16-20 participants, randomized as to which order they will receive the 4 test meals with a washout period of at least 6 days in between test days. Upon arrival the test persons are asked to urinate (baseline sample), and at the 1st visit they are then weighed, height is measured and body composition (bioimpedance) is measured. After resting briefly, a baseline blood sample is taken and blood pressure is measured (1st and 4th visit). 45 minutes after start of the test meal the first postprandial blood sample is taken, and again after 45, 120 and 180 minutes. Urine is collected again at 0-90 min, 90-180 min and 3-24 hours after the test meal. Participants are provided with containers and equipment for this purpose, and must submit samples on an ongoing basis to the Dept. of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy man or woman in the age group 1860 years Likes and tolerates pasta, tomatoes and cheese, and is not a vegetarian or vegan, since meat (beef and pork) is included in the standardized dinner, breakfast and in the test meal Habitual alcohol intake (high: up to 7/14 units per week for women/men) or low: 02 units per week for both genders Tolerates alcohol Systematic infections, psychiatric conditions and metabolic disease, and any clinical condition and other condition/situation, which according to the experimenter's assessment makes the person unfit to participate in the study Donation of a larger amount of blood (more than 24 ml) e.g. in connection with donation or other scientific research study, during the study and 3 months before start of the study Alcohol intake above the Danish Health and Medicines Authority's recommended 7 respective 14 drinks (units) per week for women and men Have or have had a drug addiction Allergy or intolerance to any of the tested drinks, or to any other foods included in the study. The participant will be specifically screened for possible alcohol allergy or intolerance Nursing, pregnancy or planned pregnancy.
