	<brief_summary>There is preliminary evidence that a dynamic T2 Preparations Puls sequence by cardiac magnet resonance imaging can differentiate between oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. In adult patients with inborn heart defects this has not yet been researched. Therefore,patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunt, septal and atrio-septal shunt should be examined. Also, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease should be examined. The aim of this study is the validation of a novel magnet resonance sequence in terms of a distinction of oxygenated blood to deoxygenated blood in comparison to invasive method of measuring cardiac catheterization.</brief_summary>
