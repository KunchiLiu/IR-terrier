	<detailed_description>This is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study to designed evaluate the effect of a 300 mg dose of tralokinumab administered subcutaneously every 2 weeks on airway inflammation in adults with asthma inadequately controlled on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) with or without other controllers. Approximately 80 subjects will be randomized.
