	<brief_title>Nano Drug Interventional Therapy Using Digital Subtraction Angiography（DSA） for Lung Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>By enrolling patients with lung cancer adapted to enrolled criteria, this study will document for the first time the safety and the short and long term efficacy of nano drug interventional therapy using digital subtraction angiography（DSA）for lung cancer. The nano drug is made by mixing Gemzar® with Compound Glycyrrhizin Injection. The nano drug's size is detected by laser diffraction particle size analyzer.</detailed_description>
