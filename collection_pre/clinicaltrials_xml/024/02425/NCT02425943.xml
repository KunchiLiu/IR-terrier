	<brief_summary>Study is designed to 1. to assess the long-term safety of Sculptra Aesthetic in immune-competent subjects as a single regimen for correction of wrinkle assessment score (WAS) 2 to 4 nasolabial fold (NLF) contour deficiencies and other facial wrinkles in which deep dermal grid pattern (cross-hatch) injection technique is appropriate. 2. to evaluate the time to onset, duration, severity, relationship to Sculptra Aesthetic and/or injection procedure, and outcome of all adverse events during the course of the study, by Fitzpatrick skin type. 3. to evaluate the change in the WAS from baseline to post-treatment follow-up time points at Months 6, 13, and Years 2, 3, 4, and 5 in NLFs and other facial wrinkles. 4. to evaluate Investigator/subject global assessments at Months 6, 13, and Years 2, 3, 4, and 5.</brief_summary>

Subjects with an American Society of Anesthesiologists' Physical Status Classification System Score of ≥P3 (P3 = a subject with severe systemic disease). 11.

Viral, chemical, or any active hepatitis within the past year. 13. Planned surgical procedures with incisions and suturing in the area to be treated during the course of the study. 14. Planned major facial aesthetic procedure/plastic surgery (eg, rhinoplasty [with or without implant], facelift, congenital defect repair, etc) during the course of the study. 15. Subjects who have or plan to use exclusionary treatments/medications/ devices, as described in the protocol. 16.
