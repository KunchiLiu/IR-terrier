	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: Prucalopride can mimic electrical stimulation of the abdominal vagus nerve and has an anti-inflammatory effect. Aims: In the present pilot study, the investigators want to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of prucalopride. The following aims are formulated: 1. to show that prucalopride has a similar inflammatory effect as abdominal vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) 2. to evaluate whether prucalopride leads to accelerated post-operative recovery</brief_summary>
