	<brief_title>Registry of Right-to-left Shunt Detection by Contrast-enhanced Transcranial Doppler in Chinese Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective multicenter study of Chinese population. Participants (normal individuals without migraine and migraineurs) are included after standardized diagnostic procedures (TCD and c-TCD). For migraineurs with large RLS further examinations (c-TTE and brain MRI) are required. Up to 10 study sites nationwide will be needed to recruit the planned participant population during a 1-year period. The information of each participants will be registered, including basic facts, the longitudinal headache history, frequency, location, quality, intensity, duration, accompanied symptoms, precipitating and exacerbating factors, with or without aura, MIDAS and HIT-6 questionnaire.</detailed_description>
