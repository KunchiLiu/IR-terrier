	<brief_summary>PHASE: IV TYPE OF STUDY: With direct benefit DESCRIPTIVE: multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled trial INCLUSION CRITERIA: Adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who failed corticosteroids and immunosupressive therapy, or are intolerant to immunosuppressors. All included patients will be naïve to anti-TNF therapy. Active disease at golimumab treatment initiation defined as a MAYO score ≥6 and with an endoscopic sub score ≥2. OBJECTIVE: To determine the proportion of patients with continued clinical response (CCR) and endoscopic remission at week 108, after discontinuation or de-escalation of golimumab treatment at year 1 in the subgroup of patients in continuous clinical response (CCR) and with mucosal healing (MH) (endoscopic Mayo score of 0 or 1) at week 54. STUDY DESIGN: Induction Phase : Week 0: golimumab 200mg- Week 2: golimumab 100 mg- Week 6: golimumab 50 mg Phase I : Week 10-Week 54 • Patients with primary clinical response* : Standard regimen with golimumab 50 mg Q4W (or 100 mg Q4W if &gt; 80 kg) • Patients without primary clinical response* : Optimization to 100 mg Q4W (or combination therapy with azathioprine if &gt; 80 kg or switch from azathioprine to methotrexate if already on azathioprine at golimumab initiation or patient with known intolerance to thiopurines) • Early escape at Week 18: Primary non-responders who are still not responding at week 18 to dose optimization at Weeks 10 and 14 will be considered treatment failures and will be followed up (call or visit) at week 54 for safety. - Clinical response is defined as a decrease from baseline in the Mayo score ≥30% and ≥3 points, accompanied by either a rectal bleeding sub score of 0 or 1 or a decrease from baseline in the rectal bleeding sub score ≥1 Phase II : Week 54-Week 108 • Patients with CCR and MH at week 54 and on golimumab 50 mg every 4 weeks: Stop golimumab and continuation of thiopurines or methotrexate if on combination therapy • Patients with CCR and MH at week 54 and on golimumab 100 mg every 4 weeks: De-escalation to 50 mg every 4 weeks and continuation of thiopurines or methotrexate if on combination therapy • Restart/Escalate golimumab on flare (defined in section 4 of the protocol) to the phase I dose; 50 mg q4wk or 100mg q4wk (similar to the phase I regimen)</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>NUMBER OF PATIENTS: 200 patients INCLUSION PERIOD: 18-24 months STUDY DURATION: 48 to 54 months MAIN EVALUATION Primary endpoints - Phase I (week 10-54): proportion of patients in continuous clinical response (CCR) and with mucosal healing (MH; endoscopic Mayo score of 0 or 1) at week 54 - Phase II (week 54-108): proportion of patients in CCR with mucosal healing (endoscopic Mayo score of 0 or 1) at week 108, after discontinuation or dose de-escalation (from 100 to 50 mg) of golimumab treatment at year 1 in the subgroup of patients in continuous clinical response (CCR) and with mucosal healing (endoscopic Mayo score of 0 or 1) at week 54 Data base lock, data analysis and display (publication) of phase I will happen when all included subjects have completed the 54 week visit. SECONDARY EVALUATION For all included patients: - Factors associated with treatment success (see primary endpoints) - Clinical remission at week 54 - Clinical remission at week 108 - Partial MAYO score at weeks 54 and 108 - PRO2 (Partial Mayo minus PGA) at weeks 54 and 108 - Continuous clinical response between study inclusion and week 108 - Steroid-free clinical remission at weeks 54 and 108 - Mucosal healing (endoscopic score MAYO 0-1) at weeks 54 and 108 - Changes in faecal calprotectin levels from baseline at week 30, 54 and 108 - Colectomy between W0 and W108 - UC-related hospitalizations throughout the trial - Histological remission at W54 and W108, (Geboes score) - PRO: Fatigue (FACIT), IBD Disability Index, QoL (SHS-IBD VAS) - PK data (golimumab trough levels and antibodies against golimumab) - Proportion of pts with LOR after discontinuation or dose de-escalation in phase II - Predictors of LOR after discontinuation or dose de-escalation in phase II - Proportion of patients who regained response and remission after flare AND restart of golimumab in Phase II. For the subgroup of patients who are primary non-responders to golimumab at week 10, we will assess the efficacy of treatment optimization, including the percentage of patients achieving continuous clinical response and endoscopic remission at one year.</detailed_description>

Active disease at golimumab treatment initiation defined as a partial MAYO score ≥ 6 with an endoscopic sub score ≥ 2. Patients concurrently treated with oral corticosteroids will receive a stable dose (prednisone 20 mg/day for at least 2 weeks) before baseline. Patients are allowed stable dosages of 5aminosalicylates as concurrent therapy, but 5aminosalicylate use is not an entry criterion for the trial. Patients are allowed stable dose of thiopurines (azathioprine or 6mercaptopurine stable dose for at least 4 weeks).
