	<brief_summary>Peroperatively observative study in pediatric orthopedic center in Lyon, France. 50 pediatric patients included in this study, to improve the diagnosis of hidden lesions of the medial meniscus associated with lesions of the anterior cruciate ligament. All the patients need a reconstruction of the ACL because of chronic knee instability. All the patients underwent a multi portal arthroscopy during the ACL reconstruction : anteromedial and anterolateral and after intercondylar and posteromedial. The study consists in a peroperatively arthroscopic look, in order to diagnose lesions of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus which could be missed in MRI and anteromedial and anterolateral arthroscopy. Statistics of this lesions are used to study prevalence and diagnosis capacity of this procedures. First, the surgeon did a classic knee arthroscopy. Secondarily, he did an intercondylar portal and after a posteromedial portal.</brief_summary>
