	<brief_title>Safety and Immunogenicity With Two Different Serotype 2 Potencies of Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine (TDV) in Adults in Singapore</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The vaccine being tested in this study is Takeda's Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine Candidate (TDV). TDV is being tested to protect people against dengue fever. This study will look at safety and the amount of antibodies to dengue fever formed in people who are administered a high-dose of TDV (HD-TDV) compared to TDV. The study will enroll approximately 400 patients. Before being assigned to a treatment group participants will be screened for previous exposure to the dengue virus. Dengue naïve and previously exposed participants will then be randomly assigned (by chance) to one of the two treatment groups—which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need): - HD-TDV 0.5 mL subcutaneous injection - TDV 0.5 mL subcutaneous injection All participants will receive a single injection on Day 1. Participants will be asked to record any symptoms that may be related to the vaccine or the injection site in a diary card for 28 days after vaccination. This multi-center trial will be conducted in Singapore. The overall time to participate in this study is 12 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, including a final visit 1 year after receiving their dose of TDV.</detailed_description>
