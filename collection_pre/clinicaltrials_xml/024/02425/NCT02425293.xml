	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of standardized patient education on asthma control. In collaboration with two health insurance companies, pharmacists and pneumologists, patients with asthma were recruited. They completed the "Asthma Control Test (ACT)" and the "Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC 5A)" questionnaire to assess asthma control and patients' satisfaction with the health care service they received. Additionally, patients were offered the possibility to participate in a patient education seminar run by the Swiss lung leagues or the Swiss allergy centre (aha!). After one year, patients were asked to complete the questionnaires again. Comparisons of intraindividual changes and differences regarding ACT and PACIC 5A between patients with and without patient education were made.</brief_summary>
