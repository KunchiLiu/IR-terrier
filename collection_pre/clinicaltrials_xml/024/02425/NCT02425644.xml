	<criteria>Male and female subjects aged 18 to 55 years with established diagnosis of MS McDonald 2010 with relapsing course from onset (i.e., RRMS and SPMS with superimposed relapses). Subjects must have active disease evidenced by one or more MS attacks with onset within the period of 12 to 1 months prior to randomization, or by two or more MS attacks with onset within the 24 to 1 months prior to randomization, or with one or more gadoliniumenhancing (Gd+) lesion(s) of the brain on an MRI performed within 6 months prior to randomization. Enrolled subjects must be ambulatory (EDSS score of up to 5.5 inclusive) and may be treatmentna√Øve or previously treated with MS disease modifying therapy. Subjects with significant medical conditions or therapies for such conditions (e.g., cardiovascular, pulmonary, immunological, hepatic,ophthalmological conditions) or lactating or pregnant women are not eligible to enter the study. Subjects with contraindications to MRI or with clinically relevant medical or surgical conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the subject at risk by participating in the study are not eligible to enter the study.</criteria>
