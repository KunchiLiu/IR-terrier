	<brief_summary>This multicenter, randomized, double-blind study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) administered with nab-paclitaxel compared with placebo in combination with nab-paclitaxel in participants with locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have not received prior systemic therapy for metastatic breast cancer (mBC). The safety of single-agent nab-paclitaxel has been determined in previous studies of participants with mBC and the safety data to date suggest that atezolizumab can be safely combined with standard chemotherapy agents.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Metastatic or locally advanced, histologically documented TNBC characterized by absence of human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2), estrogen receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor (PR) expression No prior chemotherapy or targeted systemic therapy for inoperable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC Eligible for taxane monotherapy (i.e., absence of rapid clinical progression, lifethreatening visceral metastases, or the need for rapid symptom and/or disease control) A representative formalinfixed, paraffinembedded tumor specimen in paraffin blocks, or at least 20 unstained slides with an associated pathology report documenting ER, PR, and HER2 negativity. Participants with fewer than 20 unstained slides available at baseline, and not fewer than 12 unstained slides will be eligible upon discussion with Medical Monitor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 Measurable disease as defined by RECIST v1.1 Adequate hematologic and endorgan function Known central nervous system (CNS) disease, except for treated asymptomatic CNS metastases Leptomeningeal disease Pregnancy or lactation History of autoimmune disease Prior allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplantation Positive test for human immunodeficiency virus Active hepatitis B or hepatitis C Receipt of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to randomization, during treatment, or within 5 months following the last dose of atezolizumab/placebo</criteria>
