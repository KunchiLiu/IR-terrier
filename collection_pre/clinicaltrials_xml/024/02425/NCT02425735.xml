	<brief_title>Safety and Efficiency of γδ T Cell Against Hepatocellular Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Liver tumor will be removed using tumor reducing surgery such as cryosurgery. PBMC of the patient will be separated from peripheral blood. After making them potential cancer killer γδ T Cell and DC-CIK, they will be infused to the patients as an immunotherapy treatment.</detailed_description>
