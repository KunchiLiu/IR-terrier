	<brief_title>Safety and Efficiency of γδ T Cell Against Non Small Lung Cancer ( Without EGFR Mutation)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non small lung cancer will be removed using tumor reducing surgery such as cryosurgery. PBMC of the patient will be separated from peripheral blood. After making them potential cancer killer γδ T Cell and DC-CIK, they will be infused to the patients as immunotherapy.</detailed_description>
