	<brief_summary>Previous pilot study has demonstrated that the novel multi-endodiathermy retinectomy is feasible, effective and safe for inferior retinal redetachments in the silicone oil-filled eyes of adults over a 3-month observation. Here, the investigators conduct this randomized and multicenter clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety between multi-endodiathermy retinectomy and relaxing retinectomy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Study of Multi-endodiathermy Retinectomy Versus Relaxing Retinectomy for Retinal Re-detachment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The relaxing retinectomy is a useful surgery for retinal re-detachment in eyes with silicone oil filled. However, it has some obvious disadvantages such as the cut of the normal retina surrounding, leaving a large area of retinal deficiency and significant exposure of retinal pigment epithelium and choroid membranes. We proposed a novel multi-endodiathermy retinectomy as a potential surgery. A pilot study has demonstrated that the novel multi-endodiathermy retinectomy is feasible, effective and safe for inferior retinal redetachments in the silicone oil-filled eyes of adults over a 3-month observation. Here, the investigators conduct this randomized and multicenter clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety between multi-endodiathermy retinectomy and relaxing retinectomy.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Age 1860 years, male or female; The primary retinal detachment was caused by ocular trauma, and the vitreous body is filled with silicone oil now; The presence of inferior retinal redetachment located among 39 o'clock. Location of the redetached retina is not mainly in the inferior of the eye; The fundus is unobservable because of severe corneal opacity; The contralateral eye is nonfunctional; Serious heart, lung, liver and kidney dysfunction.</criteria>
