	<brief_title>Phase 1 Single Subcutaneous Dose Study of MLN1202</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single dose, phase 1 study in healthy Japanese and Caucasian male adults. Japanese subjects will be assigned to Cohort J1 (at a dose of 75 mg), Cohort J2 (105 mg), Cohort J3 (150 mg), or Cohort J4 (450 mg) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled manner, while Caucasian subjects to Cohort C1 (at a dose of 75 mg) or Cohort C2 (150 mg) in an open-label manner. Takeda has made a business decision to terminate this study due to portfolio re-prioritization. There were no safety or efficacy concerns.</detailed_description>
