	<brief_title>Improving Embryogenesis by Adding Growth Factors to In Vitro Human Culture Media</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The IVF culture media design and upgrade underwent many ideas during the last 3 decades, we suppose that adding growth factors ( Insulin-like growth factor I, Insulin-like growth factor II, transforming growth factor-beta and epidermal growth factor ) as a promoting growth factors to Lifeglobal culture media might improve embryo development in vitro so we decide to design a trial to compare the embryogenesis by sibling Oocytes of the same patient between to arm of the same culture media and the same culture condition but with one arm with growth factors and the other is traditional one and closely monitor the outcome within the 2 arms and record the results.</detailed_description>
