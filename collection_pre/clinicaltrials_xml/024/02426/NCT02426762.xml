	<brief_title>Quick Skin Sealant in Closure of Surgical Wound After Laparoscopic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Study design: A prospective cohort study - Populations: Patients who have confirmed diagnosis of gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), inflammatory bowel disease and diverticula decide to receive laparoscopic surgery. - Surgical techniques: laparoscopic operations should be successfully performed with a 3-4 cm minimal incision left for sample retrieval. In all, about five trocar-associated mini incisions and a sample-retrieval incision would be left prior to skin closure. - Skin closure: A quick skin sealant would be applied to achieve a seal, without any suture made under the skin. - Postoperative treatment: An enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) bundles would be applied for enrolled subjects. As for wound management, additional wound cares are not required. Patients can take shower at postoperative day 3 (POD3). - Primary endpoint: The primary study endpoint is freedom from surgical site infection (SSI) within 30 days. The incidence of surgical site infection with the first 30 days after surgery would be explored.</detailed_description>
