	<brief_title>Effects of Lentil Consumption on Post-prandial Blood Glucose and Insulin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible participants will undergo a total of 6 study visits. During each visit, a fasted blood sample will be taken by fingerprick, and approximately 500µL of blood will be dripped into a collection tube. The participant will then consume a meal of either: white bread, white rice (or white potato), or white rice with lentils (or white potato with lentils). White bread will be consumed on the first study visit and the rest of the meals will take place in random order in the visits following. Each meal will provide a total of 50g available carbohydrate. Six more blood samples will be taken by fingerprick at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after the beginning of the meal.</detailed_description>
