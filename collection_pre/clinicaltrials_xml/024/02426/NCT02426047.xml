	<brief_summary>The modified Atkins diet (MAD) has been shown to be effective in treating intractable epilepsy. Approximately 55% of the patients started on the diet are women of childbearing age and women with epilepsy often have a pattern of seizures that correlates with their menstrual cycle, called catamenial epilepsy. The investigators have observed that despite an overall reduction in seizure frequency, some women on the MAD continue to have breakthrough seizures in a catamenial pattern. The investigators hypothesize that women with a history of intractable epilepsy who have been on the modified Atkins diet for at least 3 months and have a catamenial seizure pattern will tolerate and be compliant with the addition of a daily amount of betaquik® (a liquid emulsion of medium chain triglycerides) for a 10 day time interval starting 2 days prior to and encompassing the primary catamenial pattern.</brief_summary>
