	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to evaluate, after surgery for chronic anterior shoulder instability using a Latarjet technique with positioning of the bone block via an SEM positioning tool, the value of the contribution of a shoulder scan at 3 months post surgery in the decision to return to activity early as conditioned by the quality of the bone block consolidation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of this study are to assess: A. the position of the block according to a shoulder scan at 3 months post-surgery B. functional scores (Constant, Walch-Duplay) at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months post surgery. C. Complications: osteoarthritis, lysis of the block. D. pain. E. date of return to full activity. F. patient satisfaction concerning care (visual analog scale at 6 months post-surgery).</detailed_description>
