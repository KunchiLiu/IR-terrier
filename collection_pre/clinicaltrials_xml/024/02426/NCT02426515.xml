	<brief_summary>This study is looking to see whether cooling the face using a special cooling device (HilothermÂ®) before and during the removal of wisdom teeth will reduce the pain and discomfort patients feel after the procedure. The surgical removal of lower third molars (wisdom teeth) is arguably the most commonly performed surgical procedure worldwide. If this study shows that application of cold before and throughout the procedure is a simple way to reduce post-operative symptoms, it could benefit thousands of patients every year.</brief_summary>
