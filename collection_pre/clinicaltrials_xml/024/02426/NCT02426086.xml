	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the percentage of spleen (largest lymph organ in the body) response and symptom response of 2 dose regimens of imetelstat in participants with intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF) who are relapsed after or refractory to Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate Activity of 2 Dose Levels of Imetelstat in Participants With Intermediate-2 or High-Risk Myelofibrosis (MF) Previously Treated With Janus Kinase (JAK) Inhibitor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), multicenter (more than one hospital, medical school team or medical clinic work on a medical research study) study of 2 dosing regimens (treatment arms) of single-agent imetelstat in participants with intermediate-2 or high risk myelofibrosis (MF) whose disease is relapsed after or refractory to Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor treatment. Enrollment in the study may be approximately 160 participants if enrollment in Arm 1 is resumed after the second interim review. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening Phase (21 days before randomization); single-blind Treatment Phase (from randomization until study drug discontinuation); and Follow up Phase (until death, lost to follow-up, withdrawal of consent or study end, whichever occurs first). Participants in Arm 1 will receive imetelstat 9.4 milligram (mg)/kilogram (kg) intravenously (IV) for every 3 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study end and Arm 2 will receive imetelstat 4.7 mg/kg IV for every 3 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study end. Participants in Arm 2 may continue with their current imetelstat dose or have it increased to 9.4 mg/kg at the investigator's discretion. Percentage of spleen response and symptom response will be evaluated primarily. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
