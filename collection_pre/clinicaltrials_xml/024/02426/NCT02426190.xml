	<brief_summary>The objective of the KAROS study is to compare rehabilitation outcomes between 3 proposed protocols and a current standard of care protocol for the purpose of identifying better practice for outpatient rehabilitation among patients with single total knee replacement. The 3 advanced protocols involve use of an anti-gravity treadmill and/or the patterned electrical neuromuscular stimulation (PENS). Both medical modalities have been cleared by the FDA to be used in medical rehabilitation, including total knee replacement.</brief_summary>
