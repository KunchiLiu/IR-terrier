	<brief_title>Dietary Education Intervention Impact on Dietary Protein Intake in PD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malnutrition is highly prevalent in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, and protein malnutrition will adversely affect outcomes. The investigators develop a dietary education intervention for PD patients to improve fundamental food knowledge that will increase protein intake to target level of 1.2 g/kg of protein intake per day. In additional the dietary intervention will provide information about sodium, phosphorus, calcium intake. To more effectively deliver the intervention, the investigators explored a technology using social media in China called wechat. The purpose of this study is to test whether a dietary intervention can be more effective when delivered using wechat compared to a traditional patient education intervention delivered during routing clinical visits.</detailed_description>
