	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate associations between early structural cellular injury and microvascular alteration with progression of septic organ dysfunction according to total SOFA-Score (an ICU-scoring system - the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score). Patients will be monitored for renal (TIMP-2, IGFBP7), and intestinal biomarkers (plasma i-FABP) in conjunction with kidney and muscle vascular bed microvascular perfusion analysis assessed by contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS). In parallel, a comprehensive analysis of patients' immunological status will be conducted using an established, on-site immune monitoring panel. The ultimate goal of this study is an early identification of septic patients developing multiorgan dysfunction which may facilitate a timely novel intervention in the future to improve outcome.</brief_summary>
