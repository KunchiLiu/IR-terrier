	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of liposomal Bupivacaine infiltration into the shoulder to continues nerve block with Bupivacaine on postoperative pain control and functional outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exparel for Postoperative Pain Management in Shoulder Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>liposomal bupivacaine analgesia will provide improved postoperative pain control, reduction in amount of opioid supplementation, decreased complications and faster return to function compared to current standard of care pain management for patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty and shoulder surgery for proximal humerus fractures.</detailed_description>
