	<brief_title>Impact of Ostom-i Alert Sensor on Quality of Life in Patients With Ileostomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with ileostomy have impaired quality of life related to their ileostomy (Person et al. DCR. 2012; 55: 783 - 787; Scarpa et al. Colorectal Dis. 2010; 12: 914 - 920). Although patients with ileostomy have better overall quality of life compared with colostomy patients (Silva et al. Worl J Surg. 2003; 27: 421-424), the liquid nature of the ileostomy effluent predisposes these patients to bag overfilling and dehydration more so than colostomy patients (Paquette et al. DCR 2013; 56: 974-979). This may be specifically important in populations with long term or permanent ileostomy. Overfilling and breakage/leakage of the ileostomy bag can also affect patient's ability to function in social environments, go out in public, have intimate relationships with significant others, and interfere with sleep patterns (due to high output and nighttime overfilling of the ileostomy bag). The Ostom-i Alert is a novel device developed by a patient with ileostomy and now FDA approved in the United States. The device is a sensor that clips onto any ostomy bag and sends a Bluetooth signal to a mobile device app. An alarm lets the patient know before the stoma bag is at risk for overfilling and leaking. The potential advantage is that the device can prevent unexpected bag overfilling, breakage, and nighttime accidents. This may therefore lead to improved quality of life. The volume and output recordings can also be stored and emailed to the patient's health care providers, with potential to reduce ostomy related dehydration through more accurate volume recording and sharing. While the device has many applications, the purpose of this research study is to specifically evaluate patient quality of life after application of the Ostom-i Alert compared with standard ostomy care.</detailed_description>
