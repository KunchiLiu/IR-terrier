The subject is known to have history of intolerance to any Fanhdi® containing substance 6. The subject is known to have history of anaphylactic reaction(s) to blood or blood components 7. Subjects presenting severe platelet dysfunctions due to drugs (aspirin, other NSAIDs, etc.) or other pathologies (uremic thrombopathy, hematological diseases) 8. Immunocompromised subjects or HIV positive that have less than 400 CD4+/microliters, a viral load &gt;400 copies/ml, platelet count lower than 100x10e9/l, present any additional factor that elevates the risk of bleeding or that have a life expectancy less than 1 year 9. Subjects presenting anemia (hemoglobulin &lt;11 g/dl) 10. Subjects diagnosed with metabolic diseases that are not clinically controlled, such as diabetes mellitus, that could potentially interfere with the interpretations of the study 11. The subject is participating in another clinical study involving an investigational treatment, or participated within the past month 12. If it is anticipated that the subject will be treated with other products containing FVIII or VWF different from Fanhdi® during a period of one year 13. The subject is unlikely to adhere to the protocol requirements of the study 14. Any subject that does not dispose of a frozen plasma sample prior to the first infusion of Fanhdi®</criteria>
