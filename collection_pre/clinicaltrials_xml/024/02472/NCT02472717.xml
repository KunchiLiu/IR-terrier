	<brief_title>Psoriatic Arthritis Treated With Liraglutide Therapy: a QUality of Life and Efficacy Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether short-term (12-week) administration of the GLP-1R agonist, liraglutide, will improve joint and skin swelling in patients with active Psoriatic Arthritis compared to placebo. Background: Psoriatic Arthritis is a systemic inflammatory T-cell disorder affecting the joints and spine, and is associated with an elevated risk for Type 2 Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease. In addition to classical effects on glycemic-lowering, GLP-1R agonists are anti-diabetes agents which also have anti-inflammatory properties that may be clinically useful for patients with inflammatory diseases, particularly those with co-morbid metabolic disease. While a few small exploratory studies in patients with psoriasis have demonstrated that GLP-1R agonists reduce the severity of skin plaques, dedicated prospective, randomized mechanistic studies evaluating potential mechanisms by which GLP-1R agonists exert anti-inflammatory action(s) in humans with inflammatory disease is lacking. Objectives: Primary objective is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of short-term liraglutide (GLP-1R agonist) administration on the severity of joint and skin inflammation in patients with active Psoriatic Arthritis. Secondary objectives are to determine whether short-term liraglutide administration in patients with active psoriatic arthritis will 1) modify the degree of impaired glucose tolerance, underlying b-cell function and cardiovascular risk factor profiles, 2) improve patient-centered outcomes such as quality of life and functionality, 3) modify specific sub-populations of T-cells and affect their differentiation and activation, and 4) modify activation of circulating immune cells, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and hormones. Design: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, Phase II. Patient population: 34 patients between with active Psoriatic Arthritis meeting CASPAR (ClASsification criteria for Psoriatic ARthritis). Intervention: Participants will be randomized (1:1) to liraglutide (1.2 mg sc daily) or to placebo (sc daily) for 12 weeks. Endpoints: The primary endpoint of this study will be the proportion of patients who experience a 20% ACR (American College of Rheumatology) improvement response following liraglutide therapy as compared to placebo.</detailed_description>
