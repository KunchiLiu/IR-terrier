	<criteria>1. Patients ≥18 years of age, of either sex that have signed informed consent / been well informed by the treating physician. 2. DME based on investigator's clinical evaluation and demonstrated using fundoscopic photography and spectral domain OCT. 3. Mean central foveal thickness (central subfield thickness) ≥350 microns in the study eye as measured using spectral domain OCT. 4. Vision impairment (20/60 to 20/400 using Snellen visual acuity equivalent) related to DME. 5. Previous treatment in the study eye with laser photocoagulation for DME, including focal/grid and panretinal, at least 3 months prior to the screening visit and ≥3 monthly antiVEGF treatments (group 1). 6. Previous treatment in the study eye with laser photocoagulation for DME at least 3 months prior to the screening visit (group 2) and treatment with an intraocular antiVEGF therapy not possible. 7. Patients considered as insufficiently responsive to prior therapy for DME, as defined by the study physician. 1. IOP &gt;21 mmHg at screening in the study eye. 2. Historical rise in IOP &gt;25 mmHg following treatment with an intravitreal corticosteroid in the study eye. 3. Use of ≥2 IOPlowering medications to control IOP at screening in the study eye. 4. Patients that have vitreomacular traction in DME and opaque media in the study eye. 5. Patients with severe proliferative diabetic retinopathy requiring pan retinal photocoagulation in the study eye. 6. Pregnant or breastfeeding. 7. Patients diagnosed with active angiographic central vein ischaemia prior to screening in the study eye. 8. Patients that have received pan retinal photocoagulation or undergone cataract surgery in the 3 months prior to the study start date in the study eye. 9. Patients with contraindications according to the current SPC: 1. The presence of preexisting glaucoma. 2. Active or suspected ocular or periocular infection. 3. The patient is hypersensitive to the active agent or to one of the excipients.</criteria>
