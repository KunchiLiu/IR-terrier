	<brief_summary>Crohn disease (CD) is an idiopathic, chronic, relapsing and remitting inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract with a high risk for complications and need for surgical interventions, particularly in children. Immunomodulators and biologic therapies are effective at inducing and maintaining remission in pediatric CD, yet there is no proven strategy for reducing exposure to medications once sustained remission has been achieved. Diet has been proven to impact disease activity in CD and may allow for sustained drug-free remission. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether pediatric CD patients in long-standing remission remain in remission longer after stopping medications if they follow the Crohn's Disease Exclusion Diet (CDED). The hypothesis is that subjects on the CDED will have longer time-to-relapse as opposed to those on an unrestricted diet.</brief_summary>
