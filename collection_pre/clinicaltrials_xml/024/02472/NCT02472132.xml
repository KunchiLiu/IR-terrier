	<brief_summary>Central venous catheter (CVC) is an essential tool in the management of both medical and surgical patients. Establishing venous access is critically important and is sometimes technically challenging. Among the many indications for point of care ultrasound (POCUS), ultrasound-guided venous catheter placement is well described and increasingly used. This study was designed to evaluate the utility of peri procedural transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) as a tool for positioning CVC and for ruling out complications.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Central venous catheter (CVC) is an essential tool in the management of both medical and surgical patients. Establishing venous access is critically important and is sometimes technically challenging. Among the many indications for point of care ultrasound (POCUS), ultrasound-guided venous catheter placement is well described and increasingly used. This study was designed to evaluate the utility of peri procedural transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) as a tool for positioning CVC and for ruling out complications. The study population will be screened at the internal wards and medical intensive care unit of Soroka Medical Center. Research candidates' files will be screened routinely by a study coordinator. The study population will be enrolled according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The primary objective for the study is to evaluate whether the use of POCUS in CVC insertion can help inaccurate CVC tip placement, detect misplacement and complications and better than chest X ray.</detailed_description>
