	<brief_title>Way to Cure: Developing Effective Strategies to Promote Adherence to Hepatitis C Therapy Among Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 3-arm trial will field test the efficacy of "Way to Cure" intervention on medication adherence in Hepatitis C for 12 weeks. As part of routine clinical care all patients will receive medication counseling regarding proper use and side effects by trained nurses or pharmacists depending on the clinical site. Arm 1: Control (n=20) - Monitoring caps will be set into "quiet mode". This mode sends daily adherence data to the Way to Health platform each time the participant opens the pill bottle, however, does not remind the participant to take the medication. In the event no electronic signal is received by the platform for 96 hours, the RA will call the participant to assess any usability or connectivity issues. Arm 2: Intervention - Reminders/Feedback (n=20) - Patients will receive tailored text message reminders to take the medication if in case the interval from last cap opening is &gt;30 hours (greater than 6 hours overdue). Patients will receive weekly text messages with summary cumulative adherence scores. Arm 3: Intervention - Reminders/Feedback and Financial Incentives (n=20) - In addition to reminders with missed doses and weekly adherence feedback, patients in this arm will be eligible to receive a financial incentive each week they demonstrate perfect &gt;85% adherence. The weekly adherence feedback message will also alert patients whether they earned the incentive for the past week.</detailed_description>
