	<brief_title>Dose-effect Relationship of Rt-PA on ICH Evacuation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The minimally invasive surgery (MIS) plus recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is one of the best choices in the treatment of a large-scale deep supratentorial intracerebral hematoma. It uses hardware access technology, in a relatively short time to enter the hematoma center with favourable accuracy and safety. The dose of rt-PA range from 0.3 mg to 4.0 mg in different research。We propose to determine the optimal dose of rt-PA with three dose control groups.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 1880. GCS &lt; 14 or a NIHSS &gt; or equal to 6. Spontaneous supratentorial ICH ≥ 20 mL diagnosed using radiographic imaging (CT, CTA, etc.) Symptoms less than 24 hours prior to diagnostic CT(dCT) scan (an unknown time of symptom onset is exclusionary). Sixhour clot size equal to the most previous clot size (within 5 mL) as determined by additional CT scans at least 6 hours apart using the ABC/2 method. Intention to initiate surgery between 12 and 72 hours after after diagnostic CT. First dose can be given within 76 hours after dCT (delays for post surgical stabilization of catheter bleeding). SBP &lt; 180 mmHg sustained for 6 hours recorded closest to time of randomization. Historical Rankin score of 0 or 1. Negative pregnancy test. Infratentorial hemorrhage (any involvement of the midbrain or lower brainstem as demonstrated by radiograph or complete third nerve palsy). Irreversible impaired brain stem function (bilateral fixed, dilated pupils and extensor motor posturing), GCS ≤ 4. Intraventricular hemorrhage requiring treatment with extraventricular drainage (obstruction of third and fourth ventricles). Ruptured aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), vascular anomaly, Moyamoya disease diagnosed with radiographic imaging. Any irreversible coagulopathy or known clotting disorder. or having the experience of the use of anticoagulant drug. Platelet count &lt; 100,000, INR &gt; 1.7, or an elevated prothrombin time (PT) or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Positive urine or serum pregnancy test in premenopausal female subjects without a documented history of surgical sterilization. Any concurrent serious illness that would interfere with the safety assessments including hepatic, renal, gastroenterologic, respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrinologic, immunologic, and hematologic disease. Historical Rankin score greater than or equal to 2.</criteria>
