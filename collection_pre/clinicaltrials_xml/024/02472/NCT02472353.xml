	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to determine if co-administration of metformin and doxorubicin in breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy will reduce the number of patients who develop a significant change in left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of Metformin to Reduce Cardiac Toxicity in Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, open-label, phase II design pilot study in patients with breast cancer requiring neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Eligible patients will be equally randomized to either receive metformin plus standard of care therapy or standard of care therapy alone. Patients receiving metformin will continue drug until the doxorubicin-containing cycles are complete, unless unacceptable toxicity occurs or the patient decides to withdraw from the study. Both arms of the study will undergo echocardiograms with contrast at baseline, upon completion of doxorubicin-containing cycles (within 28 days of completion), and at the one-year and seven-year time points. Additionally biomarker labs will be obtained to explore if there is a correlation between change in cardiac activity and the activity of metformin. If willing, all enrolled patients will provide a sample of whole blood for further exploratory analysis. Symptoms reported during the study will be correlated with know single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found during an exploratory genomic analysis.</detailed_description>
