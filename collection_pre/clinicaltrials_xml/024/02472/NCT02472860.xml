	<brief_title>Feasibility and Effectiveness of Computerized Cognitive Training in Adolescents With Autism Spectrum Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Given the limited options for treatments to improve the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), strategies that could target secondary features of the condition and improve quality of life for affected individuals are critical. Neuroplasticity-based cognitive training has been found to improve cognition in youth with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and in adults with schizophrenia. In this trial, the investigators are seeking to extend the relevance of computerized cognitive training to youth with ASD. Given the literature, the investigators hypothesize that computerized cognitive training will produce gains in untrained cognitive tasks and behavioral ratings of executive functions in youth with ASD. The investigators will assess aspects of attention and executive functions in 30 affected youth and randomize them 1:1 to either neuroplasticity based cognitive tests or enjoyable age-appropriate computer games not intended to improve cognition. Cognition will be assessed again after 15 hours of training over 6 weeks and then again at a three month follow up.</detailed_description>
