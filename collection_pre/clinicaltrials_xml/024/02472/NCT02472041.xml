	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the comparison of two of re-expansion pulmonary physiotherapy in patients with chest tube. The study group received intermittent positive pressure intervention and the control group received incentive spirometry intervention associated with manual operation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Reanimator Muller in Patients With Chest Tube</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All the re-expansion methods increase lung volume increasing gradient of transpulmonary pressure (PL) representing the difference alveolar pressure and pleural pressure. Spontaneous deep breath increases the PL by reducing pleural pressure (active breathing exercises, breathing supporters and manual operation). Muller resuscitator consists of a pneumatic valve feature designed to operate with medical oxygen. It is used intermittently or continuously for pulmonary re-expansion, with lower load imposed work, and increase the efficiency of gas exchange by improving volumes, lung capacity and breathing pattern, and reverse atelectasis. However, studies show the paucity of data in the literature regarding the Muller Resuscitator in different forms and respiratory rehabilitation protocols. In addition, studies show lack of standardization of methods and resources used in respiratory therapy in patients with chest tube.</detailed_description>
