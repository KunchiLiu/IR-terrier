	<brief_summary>Taste perception plays an important role in maintaining nutritional balance. Gustatory evoked potentials (GEP) can be detected in response to an intermittent stimulation of the gustatory receptors by a primary flavour. GEP are non invaisve, painless and safe. The aims were to establish a reliable recording of GEP in Humans and to determine physiological variations of the gustatory evoked cerebral activity, by recording gustatory evoked potentials in different physiological situations (different intensities of taste solutions, after feeding or fasting, with different taste...). Healthy volunteers were included in this study. GEP were recorded in 9 cortical sites by EEG sensors (10/20 system), in front of the primary and the secondary gustatory cerebral areas, referenced against ear lobes.</brief_summary>
