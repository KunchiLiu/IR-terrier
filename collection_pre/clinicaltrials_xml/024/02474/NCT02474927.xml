	<brief_summary>The clinical trial is a Phase II open label, single-arm pilot study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combination therapy with carfilzomib, plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulins for AMR after lung transplantation and elucidate important clinical and immunologic phenotypes and mechanisms associated with these outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Therapy With Carfilzomib for the Antibody-Mediated Rejection Diagnosis in Lung Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective of the proposed clinical investigation is to evaluate the effects of carfilzomib in addition to conventional therapy on short-term outcomes after the diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection in lung transplant recipients. In this study, Carfilzomib will be administered at a dose of 20 mg/m2 on two consecutive days, each week for three weeks (Days 1 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16) to constitute one therapeutic cycle. Carfilzomib may be administered for 1-2 complete cycles in the study. Patients will be followed for the duration of their hospital admission after enrollment. Post treatment follow-up will also occur on Days 42 and 90.</detailed_description>
