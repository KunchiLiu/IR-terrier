	<brief_summary>Recent breakthroughs in antiretroviral (ARV)-based prevention provide new opportunities to rethink HIV prevention and treatment strategies, especially for key populations such as Female Sex Workers (FSWs). Antiretroviral (ARV)-based prevention of HIV transmission has the potential to have a profound population-level impact on the course of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Several recently completed randomized controlled trials of HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) have shown efficacy at reducing HIV acquisition in high-risk populations. How to translate these trial results into population-level effects is the next critical step. PrEP "demonstration" projects, in collaboration with local stakeholders and at sites of routine care for high-risk populations provide an opportunity to move promising research results into actual public health benefits. With these key features in mind, the investigators propose a HIV PrEP demonstration project in FSW in Dakar, Senegal, West Africa. The objective of the proposed demonstration project with Tenofovir DF/Emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) among Female Sex Workers (FSW) in Dakar Senegal is to build a sustainable HIV PrEP program for FSW in Dakar, Senegal while demonstrating the feasibility of providing daily oral PrEP with Truvada (TDF/FTC) for 12 months to the enrolled FSW at Ministry of Heath run clinics (IHS, and Pikine, Mbao, Rufisque and Diamniadio Health Centers). Critical milestones for this demonstration project with be feasibility, uptake, acceptability, use of TDF/FTC PrEP and programmatic retention of FSWs in Dakar MoH clinics. The investigators have assembled an expert team from RARS,The University of Washington, and Westat that have had greater than 2 decades of collaboration on HIV related projects in FSWs in Senegal. The investigators expect the results of this project will show that Senegal provides a unique opportunity to assess acceptability, feasibility, uptake and effectiveness of oral HIV PrEP at reducing HIV transmission in a high-risk FSW population.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN This is a two-phase study, consisting of the following: PHASE I - The feasibility evaluation for this study will take several forms. - Observations - Field-based assessment of service delivery at each of the five sites; - In-depth interviews - With policy makers, program managers, and service providers, as well as other community members and leaders; and - Focus groups with registered and unregistered female sex workers (FSW). PHASE II - This will be a prospective demonstration study of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (FTC/TDF) for FSW with 12 months of follow up and a 3-month accrual period. A total of 1500 FSW will be enrolled. OBJECTIVES Primary Objectives: - Build a sustainable HIV PrEP program for FSW in Dakar, Senegal. - Demonstrate the feasibility of providing daily oral PrEP with FTC/TDF for 12 months to FSW at Ministry of Health (MoH)-run clinics (Institut d'Hygiène Sociale (IHS), Pikine, Mbao, Rufisque and Diamniadio Health Centers) in Dakar. POPULATION &amp; SAMPLE SIZE PHASE I: - 10 Key Informants: Policy makers, program managers, and service providers, as well as other community members and leaders. - Focus Group Participants: 8 Registered and 8 Unregistered HIV-negative FSW age 18 or older. PHASE II: • 1500 HIV-negative FSW age 18 or older recruited from five public health centers in Dakar: IHS, Pikine, Mbao, Rufisque and Diamniadio Health Centers. PROTOCOL EVALUATIONS - PHASE I: Qualitative data from observations, key informant interviews, and focus groups will be collected, analyzed and used to inform the implementation of Phase II. - PHASE II: Quantitative data will be collected using behavioral measures and clinical and laboratory evaluations. Data from electronic monitoring will also be collected. STUDY DURATION 24 months REGIMEN Daily oral PrEP with FTC/TDF for 12 months</detailed_description>
