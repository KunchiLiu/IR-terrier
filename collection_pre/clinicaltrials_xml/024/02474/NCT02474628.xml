	<brief_summary>Intervention studies do not account for high within-individual variation potentially compromising the magnitude of an effect. Repeat administration of a treatment allows quantification of individual responses and determination of the consistency of responses. The investigators aim to determine the consistency of metabolic and exercise responses following repeated administration of sodium bicarbonate (SB). Design and Methods: 15 physically active males will complete six cycling capacity tests at 110% of maximum power output (CCT110%) following ingestion of either 0.3 gâˆ™kg-1Body Mass of SB (4 trials) or placebo (PL, 2 trials). Blood pH, bicarbonate, base excess and lactate will be determined at baseline, pre-exercise, post-exercise and 5-min post-exercise. Total work done (TWD) will be recorded as the exercise outcome.</brief_summary>
