	<brief_summary>In the past it was shown, that medial partial meniscectomy (MPM) leads to an increase of the knee adduction moment (KAM) during walking. Other researches found out that an increase of the KAM is an important factor contributing to degeneration joint disease of the knee (osteoarthritis). Today, medial menicus repair (MMR) is favoured by many knee surgeons, because preserving as much of the meniscus as possible is assumed to delay degenerative joint disease. The investigators hypothesize significant differences in knee adduction moments between patients treated with partial medial meniscectomy vs. patients treated with medial meniscus repair (hypothesis 1; major hypothesis). Additionally, it is hypothesized that: the mentioned groups differ with respect to other kinetic and kinematic key parameters of gait (hypothesis 2) and that the knee adduction moment correlates with the clinical outcome as determined by a typical knee score (hypothesis 3).</brief_summary>
