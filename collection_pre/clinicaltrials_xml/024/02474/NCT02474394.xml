	<brief_title>Effects of Videolaryngoscope on Intraocular Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The stability of the intraocular pressure plays an important role during ophthalmic surgery. The systemic blood pressure, aqueous humor dynamics, choroidal blood volume, central venous pressure, extra-ocular muscle tone, and also conventional laryngoscopy affect the intraocular pressure.It was shown that the new devices for laryngoscopy, such as video laryngoscopes provide minimal hemodynamic changes when compared to direct laryngoscopes. However there is no current data about the effects of the intubation with McGrath videolaryngoscope on intraocular pressure. The main objective of this study to compare the effects of the McGrath Series 5 video laryngoscope and Macintosh laryngoscope on intraocular pressure during laryngoscopy.</detailed_description>
