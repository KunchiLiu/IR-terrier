	<brief_title>Real World Treatment Study of AZD9291 for Advanced/Metastatic EGFR T790M Mutation NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of single agent AZD9291 in a real world setting in adult patients with advanced or metastatic, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation-positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), who have received prior EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Study site(s) and number of patients planned: Approximately 1500 patients will be recruited in Europe. The recruitment will be increased beyond that as the study will expand in other regions of the world (America, Asia). Study Design This will be an open-label, single-arm, multinational, multicenter, real world treatment study. Target patient population: Adult patients (fulfilling the definition of "age of majority" per local regulations) with locally advanced (stage IIIB) or metastatic (stage IV) NSCLC with confirmed T790M mutation, who have received prior EGFR-TKI therapy. Investigational product (IP), dosage, and mode of administration: AZD9291 is an oral, potent, selective, irreversible inhibitor of both EGFR-TKI sensitising and resistance mutations in NSCLC with a significant selectivity margin over wild-type EGFR. AZD9291 will be administered orally as one 80 mg tablet once a day. Duration of IP administration: Patients may continue to receive AZD9291 as long as they continue to show clinical benefit, as judged by the investigator, and in the absence of discontinuation criteria). The study will be closed in each participating country as soon as possible following national reimbursement of AZD9291 in that country (up to a max of 90 days post reimbursement). Enrolment will be closed within 6 months after market license approval in that country or at national reimbursement, whichever is sooner. Patients withdrawing from the treatment prior to national reimbursement will be followed up as part of this study. Patients on treatment will receive commercial supply until documented disease progression as per investigator assessment. In the event that national reimbursement should not be granted following a reasonable time after market license approval in the country, the study will be closed in a maximum period of 18 months after the last patient is enrolled in that country. If applicable, timelines for conversion to commercial drug will be agreed with local bodies which may include regulatory agencies, ethics committees, and institutions. Patient will be followed until death or lost to follow-up. Study measures: Data collected will include patient demographics, information needed to determine patient eligibility (including medical history, past and current disease characteristics, and tumor EGFR mutational status), AZD9291 exposure, investigator-reported efficacy (including tumor response and disease progression), overall survival (OS), and safety (including serious adverse events [SAEs], adverse events leading to dose modification, and adverse events of special interest [interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis-like events, and QTc prolongation events]). Statistical methods: All data will be presented for the overall full analysis/evaluable set, and also by cohorts defined by number and type of previous treatment lines for the advanced disease. Descriptive statistics will be used for all variables, as appropriate. Continuous variables will be summarised by the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarised by frequency counts and percentages for each category. OS and PFS will be summarized using Kaplan-Meier estimates of the median time to death or censoring and quartiles together with their 95% confidence intervals.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Provision of signed and dated written informed consent by the patient or legally acceptable representative prior to any studyspecific procedures 2. Adults (according to each country regulations for age of majority) 3. Locally advanced (stage IIIB) or metastatic (stage IV) EGFRm NSCLC, not amenable to curative surgery or radiotherapy, with confirmation of the presence of the T790M mutation 4. Prior therapy with an EGFRTKI. Patients may have also received additional lines of treatment 5. World Health Organization (WHO) performance status 02 6. Adequate bone marrow reserve and organ function as demonstrated by complete blood count, biochemistry in blood and urine at baseline (please refer to IB for guidance) 7. ECG recording at baseline showing absence of any cardiac abnormality as per exclusion criterion #6 8. Female patients of childbearing potential must be using adequate contraceptive measures, must not be breast feeding, and must have a negative pregnancy test prior to start of dosing. Otherwise, they must have evidence of nonchildbearing potential 9. Male patients must be willing to use barrier contraception, i.e., condoms 1. Previous (within 6 months) or current treatment with AZD9291 2. Patients currently receiving (or unable to stop use at least 1 week prior to receiving the first dose of AZD9291) any treatment known to be potent inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 3. Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including uncontrolled hypertension, active bleeding diatheses, active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus, or significantly impaired bone marrow reserve or organ function, including hepatic and renal impairment, which in the investigator's opinion would significantly alter the risk/benefit balance. 4. Patient with symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases who is neurologically unstable or has required increasing doses of steroids to manage CNS symptoms within the 2 weeks prior to start AZD9291 administration; 5. Past medical history of ILD, druginduced ILD, radiation pneumonitis requiring steroid treatment, or any evidence of clinically active ILD 6. Any of the following cardiac criteria: 1. Mean resting corrected QT interval (QTcF) &gt; 470 ms using Fredericia's formula : 2. Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of resting ECG (e.g., complete left bundle branch block, third degree heart block, second degree heart block) 3. Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic events 7. Any unresolved toxicity from prior therapy CTCAE &gt; grade 3 at the time of starting treatment 8. History of hypersensitivity to excipients of AZD9291 or to drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to AZD9291</criteria>
