Spirometry following salbutamol showing FEV1 ≥40% of predicted normal and FEV1/FVC ratio &lt;0.7 for COPD subjects. 4. Spirometry without salbutamol showing FEV1 ≥50% of predicted normal for asthma subjects. 5. Ability to use the CRC749 inhaler. 1. Other chronic or active respiratory disorder or symptoms of, or treatment for a COPD or asthma exacerbation during the 28 days preceding screening. 2. History of long QT syndrome or screening ECG with QTcF greater than 480 milliseconds. 3. Current evidence of, or history within the 6 months prior to screening of unstable ischemic heart disease, NYHA Class III/IV left ventricular failure, or myocardial infarction. 4.
