	<brief_summary>pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is the standard operation for treatment of patients with benign and malignant pancreatic and periampullary diseases. Despite improved surgical technique and postoperative care, the mortality rate after PD is high reaching up to 30%, due to high incidence of postoperative complications . Pancreatic fistula (PF) is the one of the most frequent complications of PD and the major contributor to postoperative morbidity The aim of this study to evaluate the effect of the perioperative octreotide use after PD for prevention of the postoperative pancreatic fistula. The secondary outcomes are overall postoperative complications, mortality and the cost benefit relationship of the use of the perioperative octreotide.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sandostatin in the Prevention of Postoperative Complications After Pancreaticoduodenectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be a prospective randomized controlled trial for perioperative use of octreotide in patients after PD for pancreatic and periampullary tumours from May 2015 to April 2016 in Gastroenterology surgical center, Mansoura University, Egypt. The primary outcome of the study is the effect of perioperative use of octreotide on the rate of development of postoperative pancreatic fistula in patients after PD for pancreatic and periampullary tumours. The secondary outcome is postoperative overall complications, mortality, duration of the hospital length of stay and cost-benefit relationship of perioperative use of octreotide. Enrolled patients will be randomized to either the octreotide or the placebo group. The randomization process will be done using closed envelop method and will be withdrawn by a nurse after pancreaticoduodenectomy . Patients in the octreotide group will receive sandostatin 100ug SC every 8 hours daily staring from the day of operation to the postoperative day 7. Patients in the placebo group will receive saline administered in a similar manner.</detailed_description>
