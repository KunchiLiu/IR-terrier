	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, open-label study. After more than 24 weeks NA treatment, HBeAg positive CHB patients who achieved HBV DNA&lt;1000copies/ml but HBeAb negative, will be randomized (1:1) into 2 study arms as follows: Arm A: Peginterferon alfa-2a 180μg /wk plus NA 1 piece qd for 48 weeks Arm B: Entecavir 0.5mg qd for 48 weeks</brief_summary>
