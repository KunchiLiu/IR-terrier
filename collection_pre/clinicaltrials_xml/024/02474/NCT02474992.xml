	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to compare a social network-based behavioral intervention known as microclinics to standard HIV clinical care alone in helping patients receiving HIV care on Mfangano, Remba and Ringiti Islands, Kenya remain adherent to clinic appointments. The study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of microclinics on reducing gaps in clinical care, HIV viral load and HIV-related stigma, compared to standard HIV clinical care alone. By doing this research study, the investigators hope to learn whether microclinics are a useful social strategy for improving delivery of HIV treatment in rural Kenya.</brief_summary>

Participants who miss a study visit by &gt;3 days but return to clinic before recruitment takes place are still eligible for study enrollment. Missed visits must have occurred within the previous 90 days at the time of eligibility assessment to meet this inclusion criteria. Must currently reside on Mfangano, Remba or Ringiti Island. Must be conversant with one of the commonly spoken languages within the study area (i.e. DhoLuo, Swahili or English; prior experience indicates that this represents &gt;99% of the adult population). Must be ≥18 years of age as of the date of study eligibility. Eligible participants who reside in the Mfangano East sublocation will be excluded from participation in this study. Many of these patients have already participated in the microclinic intervention as part of the Mfangano Island Healthy Network Impact Study. Participants planning on moving permanently out of the study area within the next six months will be excluded. Participants who, should they be randomized to the intervention arm, would be unwilling to participate in a microclinic will be excluded from study enrollment.</criteria>
