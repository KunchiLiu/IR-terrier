	<brief_summary>This research study is for liver transplant recipients and their respective living donors. The purpose of this study is: 1. To see if it is safe for liver recipients to receive one dose of donor reactive T regulatory cells (Tregs) 2. To see if the Tregs allows a liver recipient to take less, or completely stop medications normally taken after receiving an organ transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Donor Alloantigen Reactive Tregs (darTregs) for Calcineurin Inhibitor (CNI) Reduction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Doctors give drugs called immunosuppressants (IS) to people who receive a liver transplant. IS must be taken every day to prevent the body from injuring the transplanted liver by a process called rejection. Liver transplant recipients usually have to take these drugs for the rest of their lives. These drugs have harmful side effects. Researchers are looking for ways to keep a transplanted liver working normally with as little IS medications as possible. Finding a way to lower and then stop these medications will allow the liver recipient to avoid unwanted side effects. Another area of research looks at how blood cells work to reject or accept an organ transplant. Studies show that some of the recipient's own cells, called T regulatory cells (Tregs), may play a part in accepting the transplanted liver and preventing rejection. A recipient's Tregs can be grown in the laboratory to increase their number. Exposing the recipient's Tregs to the liver donor's cells will stimulate the Tregs that recognize the liver donor to grow vigorously. Giving these "donor reactive" Tregs back to the transplant recipient through a vein (intravenously) might allow a liver transplant recipient to take lower doses of IS, or perhaps to stop them altogether, without rejecting the liver. The study team will collect information about the Treg infusion, liver tests and drug doses during IS withdrawal, and any problems that may arise in the study. Blood, liver tissue, and buccal (cheek) cells will be collected for research tests.</detailed_description>

Be 36 months or more posttransplant AND 2. Without evidence of recurrent HCC defined as: AFP within normal limits for performing laboratory; Confirmatory chest CT and Confirmatory CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis. 11. If history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) , recipients must be: 1.

Systemic illness requiring or likely to require recurrent or chronic immunosuppression (IS) drug use 12. Any chronic condition for which anticoagulation cannot be safely interrupted for liver biopsy 13. Positive pregnancy test 14. Participation in any other studies that involved investigational drugs or regimens in the preceding year 15. Any other condition, in the investigator's judgment, that increases the risk of darTregs infusion or prevents safe trial participation 16. Unwilling or unable to adhere to study requirements and procedures 17. Screening liver biopsy with any of the following histological criteria, as determined by the reading of a central pathologist. darTregs Infusion Subjects must meet all criteria below to receive darTregs infusion: 1.
