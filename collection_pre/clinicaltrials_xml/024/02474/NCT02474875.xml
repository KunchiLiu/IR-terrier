	<brief_summary>Education of pain physiology is described as an educational session or sessions describing the neurobiology and neurophysiology of pain, and pain processing by the nervous system. There is compelling evidence that an educational strategy addressing neurophysiology and neurobiology of pain can have a positive effect on pain, disability, catastrophization, and physical performance in chronic musculoskeletal pain disorders. Although pain physiology education has been studied in patients with chronic low back pain, chronic whiplash, and chronic fatigue syndrome in combination with widespread pain, studies in fibromyalgia (FM) are limited to a 2013 study with limited results. The investigators propose a study with a higher dose of education of pain physiology (i.e. a higher number of educational sessions and total education time) to study if this generates a larger treatment effect in patients with fibromyalgia.</brief_summary>
