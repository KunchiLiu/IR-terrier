	<brief_summary>This study is investigating the pharmacokinetic profile (i.e. the way the product is processed by the body) of a proprietary curcumin formulation compared to an unformulated curcumin product. Subjects will take a single dose of either the proprietary formulation or comparator product and the blood levels of curcumin and curcumin metabolites will be measured over a period of 48 hours.</brief_summary>
