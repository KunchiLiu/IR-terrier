	<brief_title>A Community-based, Behavioral Intervention to Improve Screening for Hepatitis C Among High-risk Young Adults in Wisconsin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People who inject drugs (PWID) are at high risk for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection if they share contaminated injection equipment with others. Many are infected but are unaware of it, making it likely they will transmit the virus to others if they share contaminated injecting equipment. Problems related to hepatitis C can be avoided if people know their status by getting tested and referred to treatment. In this study, the investigators will recruit eligible PWID in several cities in Wisconsin using a social networks strategy, in which clients who receive services at a syringe exchange program are asked to refer peers who also inject drugs to participate in the study. All participants will undergo a baseline computerized risk assessment that elicits information about hepatitis C status, previous testing, transmission risk behaviors, and overdose risk. Participants will then be randomly-assigned to receive either standard risk reduction counseling from a prevention specialist, or computerized tailored risk reduction messages that are specific to their reported risk behaviors, attitudes and beliefs. A follow-up assessment will be completed after 3 months to evaluate changes in behavioral risk and intention to undergo HCV screening. A database will be searched to determine which participants returned for HCV screening within 12 months of enrollment, and of those, which ones tested positive for HCV.</detailed_description>
