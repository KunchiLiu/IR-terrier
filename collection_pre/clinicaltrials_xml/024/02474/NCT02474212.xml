	<brief_summary>To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the thromboprophylactic agent enoxaparin in postoperative cardiac surgery patients by comparing plasma anti-Xa activity when enoxaparin is administered either as a continuous intravenous infusion or subcutaneous bolus once daily. After informed consent, 80 elective on pump CABG patients with a clinical indication for post-operative thromboprophylaxis will be studied in the Tampere University Hospital Heart Central. The study will consist of two independent parts. In the first part of the study twenty elective CABG patients will be randomised to receive subcutaneous enoxaparin (Klexane®, Sanofi-Aventis) 40 mg thromboprophylaxis every 24 hours for three days. Another twenty patients will be randomised to receive the same dose of enoxaparin (40 mg) daily as continuous intravenous infusion for three days (72 hours). In the second part of the study twenty elective CABG patients will be randomised to receive subcutaneous enoxaparin (Klexane®, Sanofi-Aventis) 0,5 mg/ kg twice a day. Another twenty patients will be randomised to receive enoxaparin 1 mg/kg daily as continuous intravenous infusion for three days (72 hours).</brief_summary>
