	<brief_title>EMD and/or Bone Substitute for the Treatment of Class II Furcations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To clinically evaluate the treatment of mandibular class II furcation defects with enamel matrix derivative (EMD) and/or a bone substitute graft make of beta tricalcium phosphate/hydroxyapatite (βTCP/HA). Forty-one patients, presenting a mandibular class II buccal furcation defect, probing pocket depth (PPD) ≥ 4 mm and bleeding on probing, will be included. They will be randomly assigned to the groups: 1- EMD (n = 13); 2- βTCP/HA (n = 14); 3- EMD + βTCP/HA (n = 14). Relative gingival margin position (RGMP), relative vertical and horizontal attachment level (RVCAL and RHCAL) and PPD will be evaluated at baseline and 12 months. The mean horizontal clinical attachment level gain will be considered the primary outcome variable.</detailed_description>
