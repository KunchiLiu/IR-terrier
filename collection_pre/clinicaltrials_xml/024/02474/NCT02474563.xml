	<brief_title>Observational Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Bortezomib, Melphalan, Prednisone (VMP) in Participants With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a prospective, open-label, multicenter, observational study. Participants who received bortezomib, Melphalan, Prednisone(VMP) therapy for Multiple myeloma (MM) that was not eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation will be enrolled in the study. The study will consist of Screening phase; VMP therapy phase (9cycles); Follow-up phase (2 years from the day when the first cycle was started). Participants visited each institution for evaluation for 2 years from the date of baseline evaluation and first VMP administration (duration of treatment, 9 cycles; follow-up visits, every 3 months after the end of the treatment). Participants receiving VMP therapy will be primarily evaluated for 2-year progression-free survival rate. Participants safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
