	<brief_summary>No single type of laser or set of laser parameters is appropriate for all type of irides. Pure Nd:YAG laser iridotomy is very effective in the light color irides. It was considered as the gold standard for iridotomy. It, however, is less effective and causes some complication such as iris hemorrhage especially in patients with dark iris.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Nd:YAG Laser and Sequential Double Frequency YAG-Nd:YAG Laser Iridotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>By using the double frequency YAG to make the initial bore and the Nd:YAG laser to complete the perforation, the technique should be able to effectively combine most of the advantages of both lasers whilst avoiding their disadvantages. It is possibly the ideal iridotomy technique to use in the Asian irides. The investigators aim to study the energy use for laser iridotomy comparing between the two techniques as well as objectively measure the variables associated with complications.</detailed_description>
