	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter, open-label study with blinded assessment of the efficacy of subcutaneous secukinumab compared to Fumaderm速, in 200 adults with moderate to severe plaque type psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy. The study consists of 2 periods: a screening period of at least one week and up to four weeks, and a treatment period of 24 weeks. During the screening period eligibility of the patients is confirmed. Eligible patients are randomized 1:1 to treatment arm A or B at week 0. Patients in treatment arm A receive secukinumab administered at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 and are followed up for assessments of the study endpoints until week 24. Patients in treatment arm B receive daily doses of Fumaderm速 p.o.. Safety and efficacy measurements of secukinumab and Fumaderm速 will be performed throughout the study and up to week 24.</brief_summary>
