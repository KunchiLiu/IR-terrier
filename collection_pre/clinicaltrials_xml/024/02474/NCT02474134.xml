	<brief_title>Comparison Study of PF530 and Betaferon in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind, randomised, two-treatment cross-over study in healthy adult subjects to compare the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of PF530 and Betaferon. Half of the subjects will be randomised to receive PF530 first and Betaferon second, and the other half will be randomised to receive the drugs in reverse sequence. Each study participant will complete two 7-day study periods (Period 1 and Period 2), separated by a 14-day washout period. In Part I of the study, 12 subjects will be enrolled for an initial assessment. In Part II, up to 36 additional subjects may be enrolled.</detailed_description>
