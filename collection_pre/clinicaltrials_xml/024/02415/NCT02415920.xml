	<brief_summary>This study investigates whether oxytocin, a neuropeptide known for its role in social bonding, influences the outcomes of persuasive communications. Participants will be given either oxytocin or a placebo. Then, participants will view several videos discussing opinions that they agree and/or disagree with. Participants' physiological and psychological responses to the videos in the different conditions will be compared.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Influence of Intranasal Oxytocin on Communication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oxytocin is a naturally occurring hormone, commonly known for its role in social approach, bonding, and trust.. The present study is designed to investigate whether and how oxytocin may affect communication outcomes--specifically, by influencing patterns of eye contact and other non-verbal behaviors. Gaze patterns play an important role in perceptions of a speaker's likeability, competence, and persuasiveness, and oxytocin has been found to increase gazing at the eye region. Healthy adult volunteers will intranasally administer either 24 IU of oxytocin or a placebo (saline) solution. Participants will then view videos of speakers presenting opinions on various socio-political issues which the participants either agree or disagree with. Patterns of non-verbal behavior and physiological reactions (e.g., eye contact, changes in heart rate and cortisol) will be assessed during the procedure. Participants will also complete questions about their psychological reactions (e.g., anger, receptiveness) to the opinions presented in the videos.</detailed_description>
