	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to assess the blood levels of Coenzyme Q10 in healthy subjects when administered Omega Q Plus® Resveratrol for 28 days.The secondary objective of the study is to determine if statin use has an impact on the blood levels of Coenzyme Q10 when administered Omega Q Plus® Resveratrol for 28 days. The safety objectives will include assessment of safety evaluations as determined by: - laboratory tests - CBC, electrolytes (Na, K, Cl), glucose, creatinine, AST, ALT, GGT, and bilirubin - vital signs - heart rate and blood pressure - adverse events</brief_summary>
