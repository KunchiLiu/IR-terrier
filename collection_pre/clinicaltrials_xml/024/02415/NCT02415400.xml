	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if Apixaban is safer than a Vitamin K Antagonist given for 6 months in terms of bleeding in patients with an irregular heart beat (atrial fibrillation) and a recent heart attack or a recent procedure to open up a blood vessel in the heart. All patients would also be taking a class of medicines called P2Y12 inhibitors (such as clopidogrel/Plavix) and be treated for up to 6 months. The primary focus will be a comparison of the bleeding risk of Apixaban, with or without aspirin, versus a Vitamin K antagonist, such as warfarin, with or without aspirin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Apixaban in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation, Not Caused by a Heart Valve Problem, Who Are at Risk for Thrombosis (Blood Clots) Due to Having Had a Recent Coronary Event, Such as a Heart Attack or a Procedure to Open the Vessels of the Heart</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be recruited from either inpatient coronary care or general medical units, or recruited from outpatient cardiology offices. Masking: Apixaban: Open label. VKA: Open label. Acetylsalicylic acid film coated tablet: Double Blinded. Placebo matching Acetylsalicylic acid film coated tablet: Double Blinded.</detailed_description>
