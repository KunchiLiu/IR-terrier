	<brief_title>Cardiovascular MRI and Cardiopulmonary Exercise Capacity After Neonatal ASO) in Young Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After ASO obstruction of the transposed coronary arteries with resulting reduced perfusion of the heart at stress or abnormities of the right ventricular blood flow resulting in increasing heart rate as well as abnormities in pulmonary flow can appear. In this single centre trial a large homogeneous group of young adults after surgery for transposition of the great arteries (TGA), the so called artery switch operation (ASO), will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart at rest and under drug- induced stress to receive data of the functional status of the heart and its perfusion as well as data of the pulmonary arterial perfusion. Also obstruction of the pulmonary arteries will lead to reduced perfusion and cardiopulmonary exercise capacity. Therefore the MRI data will be compared to cardiopulmonary exercise capacity data determined by cardio pulmonary stress test (CPX) concerning the feasibility of a correlation of the data and possible generalisation of the results leading to long term assessment of coronary perfusion and myocardial status after ASO for recommendations of physical activity of the young adults.</detailed_description>
