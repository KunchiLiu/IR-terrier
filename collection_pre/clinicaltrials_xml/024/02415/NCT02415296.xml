	<brief_summary>The Internet medium is particularly vector for gambling problems. Since the opening of the online gambling sector in France, no screening for excessive gambling behaviours is provided for by the law, although it is known that preventive actions are more effective if they are implemented early in the gambler's career. The investigators propose to develop a model for screening excessive gambling practices based on the gambling behaviours observed on French gambling websites, coupled to a clinical validation. The objective is to lead to early preventive measures directed towards the more vulnerable gamblers and adapted for each type of gambling. This study will therefore contribute to setting up an innovative measure of prevention, to inform and protect gamblers as early as possible.</brief_summary>
