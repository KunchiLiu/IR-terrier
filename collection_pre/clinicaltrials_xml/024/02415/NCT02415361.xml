	<brief_summary>In Norway, 100-120 children are born with CLP (1.9 per 1,000 live births) each year. Parents of infants with CLP need information and support, especially with feeding immediately after birth. These needs are often not met. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of systematic follow ups of parents with infants with CLP performed by a special trained nurse. Parental information needs, parental coping and stress and infant growth and feeding will be explored and compared to a control group receiving standard care. 26 parents (mothers and fathers) or more shall be included in each group according to specific criteria. The control should be examined first. Both groups will answer questionnaires 3 times during the child's first year.</brief_summary>
