	<brief_title>Tailored Bowel Preparation According to Bristol Stool Form Scale</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colonoscopy is the standard approach for evaluating the colon currently. Thorough bowel cleansing is critical for adequate visualization of colonic mucosa during colonoscopy. Inadequate bowel cleansing results in adverse consequences for the examination, including lower adenoma detection rates, longer procedural time, lower cecal intubation rates, shorter intervals between examinations and an estimated 12-22% increase in overall colonoscopy cost.Unfortunately, despite advances in bowel preparation methods, up to one-third of all colonoscopies are reported to have an inadequate bowel preparation. The Bristol stool form scale ( BSFS) was developed in 1988 by O'Donnell LJD et al and was widely applied in both gastrointestinal study and clinical practice. BSFS divides human stool into 7 different styles according to its moisture content. In our clinical work, we find that it is prone to gain poor bowel cleansing quality in patients who pass type 1or 2 stool. Unfortunately, there is lacking of study on tailored bowel preparation according to Bristol stool form scale. Thus, we intend to develop an easy, practical, BSFS based tailored bowel cleansing regimen, in order to serve clinical work and research.</detailed_description>
