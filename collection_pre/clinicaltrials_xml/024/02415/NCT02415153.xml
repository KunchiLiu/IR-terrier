	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of pomalidomide in treating younger patients with tumors of the brain or spine (central nervous system) that have come back or are continuing to grow. Pomalidomide may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread and may also stimulate the immune system to kill tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pomalidomide in Treating Younger Patients With Recurrent, Progressive or Refractory Central Nervous System Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of pomalidomide, in children from &gt;= 3 years to &lt; 21 years of age with recurrent, progressive or refractory central nervous system (CNS) tumors when given once daily for 21 consecutive days of a 28-day course. II. To describe the toxicity profile and dose-limiting toxicities of pomalidomide in children from &gt;= 3 years to &lt; 21 years of age with recurrent, progressive or refractory CNS tumors. III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of pomalidomide when administered orally in children from &gt;= 3 years old to &lt; 21 years of age with recurrent, progressive or refractory CNS tumors and study the association of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters with age and steroid use. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore the preliminary efficacy of pomalidomide in this patient population as defined by radiographic response rate, duration of response, and event-free survival (EFS) within the confines of a Phase 1 study. *For the purposes of this study, long-term stable disease will be considered a response (defined as stable disease for &gt;= 6 courses). II. To investigate a relationship between pomalidomide dose and exposure with radiographic response and changes in immune function (for example, T-cell subsets, natural killer [NK] cell activity, granzyme B and circulating levels of interleukin [IL]-12, IL-2, IL-15, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]). OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive pomalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 26 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.</detailed_description>

however, it is recommended that anticonvulsant levels be checked periodically as clinically indicated if possible Patients on alternative supplements should strongly be encouraged to discontinue them prior to enrollment; if they opt to continue, they may enroll on study as long as they have been receiving the supplement for at least 30 days, there is NO evidence of hepatic, renal or other organ dysfunction, administration is approved by the PI, and administration is documented in the study diary Patients must be on a stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids for 5 days prior to enrollment; patient may be taking therapeutic doses of steroids during the initial dose escalations and prior to defining an RP2D; this should be recorded in the database; once the RP2D has been established, enrollment may be limited based on steroid use;*physiologic replacement doses will be defined on this protocol as no more than 0.75 mg/m^2/day of dexamethasone or equivalent of steroids; doses higher than this will be considered therapeutic All races and ethnic groups are eligible for this study Patients should have no significant worsening in clinical status for a minimum of 2 days prior to enrollment Patients must be able to swallow whole capsules Patients should undergo a repeat MRI prior to enrollment if there is a significant worsening or new neurologic symptoms in the interval between the eligibility scan and start of protocol therapy The repeat scan will act as a new baseline and the eligibility scan for these patients Karnofsky performance scale (KPS for &gt; 16 years of age) or Lansky performance score (LPS for =&lt; 16 years of age) assessed within 14 days of enrollment must be &gt;= 50 Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,000/mm^3 Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mm^3 (unsupported, defined as no platelet transfusion within 7 days and recovery from nadir) Hemoglobin &gt;= 8 g/dL (may receive transfusions) Total bilirubin =&lt;

two weeks must have elapsed if patients received polyethylene glycol (PEG) formulations Pregnant or breastfeeding patients are excluded; female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test at the time of enrollment; in addition, female patients of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy tests within 10 14 days prior to starting pomalidomide (can use enrollment pregnancy test if within the 1014 day limit) AND again within 24 hours prior to initiation of pomalidomide; this protocol defines the following childbearing potential risk categories as: Female child/young adult of childbearing potential as a female who has: Achieved menarche and/or breast development, in Tanner stage 2 or greater Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months) Note: amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential Patients of childbearing or child fathering potential must use medically acceptable form(s) of birth control as stated within the pomalidomide Pregnancy Risk Minimization Plan, which includes abstinence, while being treated on this study; true abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient; periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception Female patients of childbearing potential agree to and will have had effective contraception without interruption for 28 days before starting pomalidomide The patient or parent/guardian is able to understand the consent and is willing to sign a written informed consent document according to institutional guidelines Patients with any clinically significant unrelated systemic illness (e.g., serious infections or significant cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or other organ dysfunction), that in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate protocol therapy, put them at additional risk for toxicity or would interfere with the study procedures or results Patients with a history of any other malignancy will not be eligible Patients with radiationassociated gliomas will not be eligible Patients with a history of noncentral line related thrombosis, more than one prior centralline related thrombosis, or known coagulopathy will not be eligible; patients with a first degree family member with a known coagulopathy will be excluded, and therefore, obtaining a family history is essential when possible; patients actively on anticoagulation therapy are not eligible Patients with a prior history of serious allergic reactions associated with thalidomide or lenalidomide Patients who are receiving any other anticancer or investigational drug therapy are excluded Patients taking a known moderate to potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 2 (CYP1A2) are excluded; pomalidomide is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 and cytochrome P450 family 3, subfamily A (CYP3A); pomalidomide is also a substrate for permeability (P)glycoprotein (Pgp) Patients who in the opinion of the investigator are unwilling or unable to return for required followup visits or obtain followup studies required to assess toxicity to therapy or to adhere to drug administration plan, other study procedures, and study restrictions Patients who have received pomalidomide in the past are not eligible; patients who have prior treatment with other immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) (thalidomide, lenalidomide) ARE eligible if they meet all other eligibility criteria and did not have "significant toxicity" associated with lenalidomide or thalidomide use; a "significant" toxicity will be defined as one that required a dose reduction or discontinuation due to toxicity; please discuss any questions with the PI</criteria>
