	<criteria>1. Subject ≥ 18 years old. 2. Subjects with nonruptured or ruptured intracranial aneurysm that is referred for endovascular treatment. 3. Parent vessel with a diameter of ≥ 2.0 mm and ≤ 4 mm. 4. Subject understands the nature of the procedure and provides voluntary written informed consent in accordance with the requirements of this study protocol. 5. Subject is willing to participate in the telephone followups and to return to the investigational site for the postprocedure followup evaluations. 1. Angiogram demonstrating that the aneurysm is not appropriate for endovascular treatment (i.e.: severe intracranial vessel tortuosity, stenosis, intracranial vasospasm not responsive to medical therapy). 2. Mycotic or traumatic aneurysm. 3. Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the territory of the target aneurysm. 4. Two or more aneurysms (&gt;2mm) in associated distribution. 5. Hunt and Hess Scale (HHS) of IV or V at inclusion for subject with ruptured aneurysms. 6. Life expectancy of less than 6 months as determined by the treating physician. 7. A planned staged procedure (i.e. a procedure where entire treatment with the devices (e.g. coils/stents) is completed over separate sessions). 8. Previous neurointerventional or neurosurgical procedure of any kind within 30 days prior to the study procedure. 9. Intracranial mass (tumor, abscess, or other infection), or undergoing radiation therapy for carcinoma or sarcoma of the head or neck region. 10. Unsuitable for the antithrombotic and/or anticoagulant therapies 11. Serum creatinine level &gt; 2.5 mg/dl within 7 days prior to index procedure 12. Known hypersensitivity or allergies to cobalt, nitinol metal, nickel, or sensitivity to contrast media, 13. Evidence of an acute myocardial infarction (MI) within 30 days prior to the index procedure. 14. Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation or known cardiac disorders likely to be associated with cardioembolic symptoms. 15. Subject is pregnant</criteria>
