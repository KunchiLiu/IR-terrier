	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to assess whether transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can be used to successfully guide an epidural catheter to a targeted thoracic level in pediatric patients. The catheter will be placed in the epidural space under real-time TEE imaging and assistance by a trained TEE operator (this could include an anesthesiologist or cardiologist).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to assess whether transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can be used to successfully guide an epidural catheter to a targeted thoracic level in pediatric patients. The catheter will be placed in the epidural space under real-time TEE imaging and assistance by a trained TEE operator. The primary outcome is to determine the success rate achieved using TEE guidance to thread an epidural catheter to a targeted thoracic spinal level. Post-operative radiograph will be used to confirm catheter position. The secondary outcomes include analysis of catheter tip position within the epidural space as anterior, lateral or inferior to the spinal cord. Further, efficacy of the catheter will be determined using the following criteria from previous studies: Hemodynamic response at skin incision analyzed by heart rate and systemic blood pressure changes using the no change in HR or BP or changes &lt; 20% from baseline were considered "sufficient block" to surgical stimulation, while HR or BP changes &gt; 20% from baseline were considered "not sufficient block" to surgical stimulation.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>pediatric patients scheduled to undergo cardiothoracic surgery or interventional cardiology diagnostic procedures under general anesthesia. All subjects will also be scheduled to undergo postoperative chest xray as a routine part of their clinical care, so no additional exposure to ionizing radiation will occur due to this study. patients with known esophageal abnormalities, lesions or disease that would disqualify the patient for the use of TEE as standard procedure. We will further exclude any patients that are solely undergoing TEE diagnostic procedures and only include patients that are already scheduled to undergo procedures where TEE is used as part of routine surgical preparation.</criteria>
