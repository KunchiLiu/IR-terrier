	<brief_summary>Depression adversely affects quality of life in COPD patients, associated with higher rate of exacerbations, admissions and mortality. However, local prevalence rate of depression in geriatric COPD patients remains unknown. Though BODE index is superior to FEV1 in prediction of depression in COPD, it is unclear which domain of BODE correlates best with depression. Furthermore, with multiple confounding factors, it's ambiguous that whether frequent exacerbation is an 'independent' predictor for depression among COPD patients. The objective of this study is i.) to study the local prevalence rate of depression in geriatric COPD patients, ii.) to identify risk factors for depression especially looking at the any independent relationship between frequent exacerbations, various domains of BODE index and depression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevalence and Predictors of Depression in COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a multi-centers, cross-sectional study, conducted in Kwong Wah Hospital and Wong Tai Sin Hospital, Hong Kong SAR. Age and comorbidity-matched COPD and control subjects were recruited from clinics. Depressive symptoms were measured by a validated Chinese version of Geriatric Depression Scale short form (GDS - 15 items) with 2 cut-off points. A score of 8 or above was considered significant depressive symptoms while the cut off score of 5 or above was for patients with mild depressive symptoms. Prevalence rates of depressive symptoms were measured in both COPD and control groups. Predictors for depression (GDS = or&gt; 8) were determined using univariate and multivariate analysis.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>aged 60 or above, with stable COPD suggested clinically and postbronchodilator spirometry FEV1/FVC ratio &lt;0.7. Patients were excluded if they had coexisting pulmonary diseases like active pulmonary tuberculosis, interstitial lung diseases etc; if they were too demented or physically incapacitated to participate e.g wheelchairbound for bedbound.</criteria>
