	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to examine whether orally ingested oat avenanthramides (AVA) in oat flour cookies are bioavailable in humans by measuring plasma and urine concentrations of AVAs and their potential metabolites after ingestion. The blood and urine concentrations will be quantified at several different time points after the oat flour cookies are consumed to characterize the "concentration-time profile".</brief_summary>
