	<detailed_description>For most people work is an integral part of their life which not only secures their life standards, but also forms the basis for social participation and personal growth. If someone's workability is limited as a result of health problems, medical rehabilitation can often help to regain strength and capabilities, and to continue to work in a productive way and remain healthy. In cooperation with the Deutsche Rentenversicherung Oldenburg-Bremen health psychologists at Jacobs University Bremen are investigating what contributes to the success of such medical rehabilitation treatments. The focus is to understand which measures are helping people during and subsequently to their treatment in the clinic.Therefore voluntary participants will be asked to fill out a questionnaire when arriving at the rehabilitation facility and will subsequently invited to participate in two motivational telephone interviews after six and 12 months. Personal, social and contextual factors, measures and offers, as well as goals, plans and behaviors, will be taken into consideration to evaluate the effectiveness of medical rehabilitation on returning to or continuing to work.</detailed_description>
