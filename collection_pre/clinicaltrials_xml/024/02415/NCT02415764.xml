	<brief_summary>Our team will develop a prototype game (OnTrack&gt;The Game) in which users play the role of a person who has experienced First Episode Psychosis and move through animated role-playing scenarios, learning practical tips for engaging in care, playing mini-games to develop self- advocacy skills, and seeing stories of hope and recovery (brief video vignettes). The game is designed in an engaging comic book style in which the player is presented with realistic situations designed to promote engagement and the development of trusting relationships. Following development of the prototype, the investigators will conduct a pilot study to develop preliminary data to determine feasibility of a large-scale Phase 2 effectiveness study. This pilot study aims to demonstrate proof of concept for OnTrack&gt;The Game. The investigators will recruit a sample of patients/consumers (n=25) from OnTrackNY sites that offer services for those experiencing their first psychotic episode. Quantitative data will be collected through baseline and follow up surveys that utilize instruments to measure knowledge and attitudes about recovery, perceptions of stigma, feelings of empowerment and sense of hopefulness. The investigators will also conduct semi-structured interviews with a subset of participants to explore engagement in treatment and attitudes toward the game.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In light of research supporting early first episode psychosis (FEP) intervention models as well as the efficacy of video gaming to engage young people with FEP in treatment, the connection between the two needs to be explored. A gaming tool for first-episode psychosis has the potential to improve patient care; and, decrease stigma associated with schizophrenia. Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that Phase 1 of this study will demonstrate that the videogame is comprehensible, engaging and easy to maneuver. The investigators hypothesize that the results from the pilot study will suggest that this technologically innovative tool has potential to enhance positive outcomes of research-tested interventions, such as OnTrackNY, for individuals with FEP. Approach: Our team will develop a prototype game (OnTrack&gt;The Game) in which users play the role of a person who has experienced FEP and move through animated role-playing scenarios, learning practical tips for engaging in care, playing mini-games to develop self- advocacy skills, and seeing stories of hope and recovery (brief video vignettes). The game is designed in an engaging comic book style in which the player is presented with realistic situations designed to promote engagement and the development of trusting relationships.
