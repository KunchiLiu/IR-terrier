	<brief_summary>The purpose of this phase 3 randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ACTIMMUNE® (interferon-γ 1b) in the treatment of Friedreich's Ataxia (FA) and to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of ACTIMMUNE® in FA patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of ACTIMMUNE® Dose Escalation in Friedreich's Ataxia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 90 subjects who meet the study eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive SC doses of either ACTIMMUNE® TIW or matching placebo TIW for a total of 26 weeks; the study drug dose (or corresponding volume of placebo) is planned to be escalated on a weekly basis over the first four weeks of treatment (from 10 μg/m² to 25, 50, and 100 μg/m² or equivalent volumes of placebo). The dose may be reduced, interrupted, or held based on tolerability.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written informed consent and child assent, if applicable. FA confirmed by genetic testing with two expanded guanineadenineadenine (GAA) repeats. FA functional stage of &gt;1 to &lt;5 and ability to walk 25 feet with or without an assistive device. Male or female subject between the ages of 10 and 25 years, inclusive. If female, the subject is not pregnant or lactating or intending to become pregnant during the study, or within 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test result at Screening, a negative urine pregnancy test result at Baseline, and agree to use a reliable method of contraception throughout the study and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Any unstable illness that in the investigator's opinion precludes participation in the study. Use of any investigational product within 30 days prior to randomization. A history of substance abuse. Presence of clinically significant cardiac disease (as determined by the investigator based on electrocardiogram [ECG] and echocardiogram results at Screening). Specifically, an ejection fraction of &lt;40% or a prolonged QT interval (&gt;50% of cycle duration) will result in exclusion. If the investigator notes any other clinically significant abnormalities on the ECG or echocardiogram, the subject may be eligible if they are provided clearance from a cardiologist. History of hypersensitivity to IFNɣ or E. coliderived products. Presence of moderate or severe renal disease (estimated creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min) or hepatic disease (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] or alanine aminotransferase [ALT] &gt;2x the upper limit of normal) as evidenced by laboratory results at Screening. Clinically significant abnormal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, or platelet count as evidenced by laboratory test results at Screening.</criteria>
