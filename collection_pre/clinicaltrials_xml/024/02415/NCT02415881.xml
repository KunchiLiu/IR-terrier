	<brief_title>Phase I Panitumumab IRDye800 Optical Imaging Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I trial that is designed to evaluate the safety of escalating dose levels of conjugated panitumumab-IRDye800 used in subjects with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) that undergo surgery with curative intent. Safety data from this trial will be studied to assist in the selection of dose levels of panitumumab-IRDye800 for future research. It is hoped that this study will also help in finding better methods for identifying cancer intraoperatively for a more complete surgical resection.</detailed_description>
