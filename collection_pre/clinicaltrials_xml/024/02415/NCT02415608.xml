	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies ibrutinib to see how well it works in treating patients with systemic (affecting the entire body) mastocytosis that has spread to other parts of the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment (advanced). Systemic mastocytosis is a disease in which too many mast cells (a type of immune system cell) are found throughout the body. Mast cells give off chemicals such as histamine that can cause flushing (a hot, red face), itching, abdominal cramps, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, low blood pressure, and shock. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of mast cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ibrutinib in Treating Patients With Advanced Systemic Mastocytosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the response rate to ibrutinib in patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis (SM) (aggressive systemic mastocytosis [ASM] or mast cell leukemia [MCL], or SM-associated hematologic non-mast cell disorder [AHNMD]) by the end of 6 cycles (6 months). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the tolerability and safety profile of ibrutinib in patients with advanced SM. II. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ibrutinib in a subset of patients with advanced SM. III. To evaluate changes in histopathology (blood and bone marrow) of patients with advanced SM in response to ibrutinib therapy. IV. To evaluate changes in mastocytosis related symptom scores and quality-of-life (QOL) using a modified Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPNSAF). V. To evaluate the duration of response (DoR) and time to response (TTR). VI. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival. OUTLINE: Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving an unconfirmed or confirmed clinical improvement (CI), partial response (PR), or complete response (CR) by the end of course 6 will be permitted to continue maintenance courses of ibrutinib on an ongoing basis until loss of response/progressive disease, or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 6 months thereafter.</detailed_description>

females of nonchildbearing potential are those who are postmenopausal greater than 1 year or who have had a bilateral tubal ligation or hysterectomy Patients who have received any investigational agent, chemotherapy, interferonalpha, or 2chlorodeoxyadenosine (2CdA, cladribine) within 30 days prior to day 1; or monoclonal antibody =&lt; 6 weeks prior to first administration of study treatment (patients with an AHNMD with progressive leukocytosis who require control of their counts are permitted to be given hydroxyurea) Patients presenting with an AHNMD requiring immediate cytoreductive therapy or targeted drugs (e.g. acute myeloid leukemia [AML]) History of other malignancies, except: Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease present for &gt;= 3 years before the first dose of study drug and felt to be at low risk for recurrence by treating physician Adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence of disease Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease Concurrent systemic immunosuppressant therapy (eg, cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, etc., or chronic administration [&gt; 14 days] of &gt; 10 mg/day of prednisone) within 28 days of the first dose of study drug (prednisone should not be started during screening or be given during the study for treatment of mastocytosis) Vaccinated with live, attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug Recent infection requiring systemic treatment that was completed =&lt;

patients who are positive for hepatitis B core antibody or hepatitis B surface antigen must have a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result before enrollment; those who are PCR positive will be excluded Major surgery within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug Any lifethreatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction that, in the investigator's opinion, could compromise the subject's safety or put the study outcomes at undue risk Currently active, clinically significant cardiovascular disease, such as uncontrolled arrhythmia or class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association Functional Classification;
