	<brief_title>Short-Term Response of Thoracic Spine Manipulation With or Without Trigger Point Dry Needling for Mechanical Neck Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neck pain is common, and return to duty rates after medical evacuation from theater for spinal pain is low. Muscles comprise the majority of the stability for the cervical spine, yet neck muscle function can be altered in the presence of pain. Research has consistently shown the benefit of including thoracic spine manipulation (SMT) in the treatment of patients with mechanical neck pain. Emerging evidence is now also showing promising benefit of including trigger point dry needling (TDN) for the treatment of mechanical neck pain. Treatment regimens commonly address anterior cervical stabilizing musculature, but little is known regarding the response to treatment of the deep posterior stabilizing musculature. This study will assess the short term response of thoracic SMT with or without TDN in 58 subjects with a primary complaint of mechanical neck pain. Subjects will be randomized to receive 2 treatment visits approximately 2-3 days apart of either SMT+sham TDN or SMT+TDN. TDN will be directed to the upper trapezius and deep cervical extensor muscles of the neck. Outcomes of interest will be changes in function and pain. Assessments will be made at baseline, immediately after the first treatment, at the 2nd treatment, and approximately 5-7 days after the 2nd treatment visit. A subgroup of 20 subjects (10 per group) will also have the upper trapezius and deep cervical extensor muscle activation assessed via shear wave elastography, and deep cervical flexor activation assessed via the craniocervical flexion test.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age 1864 years and eligible for military health care 2. Primary complaint of mechanical neck pain provoked by posture, movement or palpation of neck musculature, with or without unilateral upper extremity symptoms. 3. Presence of active trigger points in either the upper trapezius or deep cervical extensor muscles. 4. Able to make one initial appointment at the Army Medical Department Center and School at Fort Sam Houston, one treatment visit approximately 23 days after the initial visit, and then a final outcome visit approximately 57 days after 2nd visit. 5. No less than 10 points (050 range) on the Neck Disability Index. 1. Prior history of whiplash injury resulting in neck pain which required medical treatment. 2. Any prior physical therapy, chiropractic, acupuncture treatment or injections for neck pain within the past 3 months. 3. History of cervical spine surgery. 4.
