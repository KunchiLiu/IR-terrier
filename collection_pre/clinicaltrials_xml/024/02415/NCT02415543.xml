	<brief_summary>This study aim to compare the efficacy and safety of Single incisional Laparoscopic Total Extraperitoneal(SIL-TEP) Inguinal Hernia Repair and traditional Laparoscopic Total Extraperitoneal(TEP) Inguinal Hernia Repair in day surgery. This study also aim to improve the surgical-related technical details and the device design. In addition, this study also evaluate the operability of SIL-TEP in term of a day surgery item and try to provide the basis for SIL-TEP day surgery guildline, so as to promote the SIL-TEP technology in the investigators country.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SIL-TEP vs TEP for Inguinal Hernia Repair in Day Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomizedï¼Œcontrolled trail. It compared Single Incisional Laparoscopic Total Extraperitonea(SIL-TEP) with traditional Laparoscopic Total Extraperitoneal(TEP) Inguinal Hernia Repair in condition of day surgery. Laparoscopic hernia repair technique including two tyes, TEP and TAPP, which were recognized as mordern minimally invasive technique. Laparoscopic hernia repair were recommended by the Association of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland (ASGBI) and European Hernia Society Guideline (EHS) as the first choice for primary inguinal hernia. Compared with TAPP, TEP was performed much more frequently for its advantages of avoiding abdominal visceral injury. Traditional TEP hernia repair involves 3-port insertions: one incision of 2cm in para-umbilical region for the camera and two smaller incisions of 5mm each in the midline for the surgical instruments. Some surgeons think the second and third ports could led to bowel and bladder injury. Early literatures showed that bowel injuries and bladder injuries were observed in TAPP or TEP hernia repair. Since 2009, Cugura JF and Filipovic-Cugura J led their teams for a preliminary exploration of SIL-TEP. Later, several cases were reported about this surgical technique globally. Since then, a number of retrospective studies about the comparation of SIL-TEP and traditional TEP were carried. Yang GP et al found that SIL-TEP had a longer operation time than traditional TEP, but in terms of postoperative complications and incision aesthetics. Tu Wenbin et al thought that SIL-TEP was effective and also had advantages in postoperative pain, postoperative complications and time in hospital. Several other reports also had similiar opnions. However, randomized controlled trial related to this suject is quite limited. Our study aim to compare the efficacy and safety of SIL-TEP and traditional TEP surgery with a RCT design and also aim to improve the surgical-related technical details and the device design. Our study also evaluate the operability of SIL-TEP in term of a day surgery item and try to provide the basis for SIL-TEP day surgery guildline, so as to promote the SIL-TEP technology in our country.</detailed_description>
