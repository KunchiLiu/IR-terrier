	<brief_title>Relaxation Before Debriefing and Memorization in High Fidelity Simulation in Healthcare</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Resident in advanced medical training participated to high fidelity simulation education program in Lyon. This is part of a curriculum and each year they go throw a specific simulation session in groups of 3 to 8 residents with same specific thematic education goals. 3 to 4 differents scénario are run every simulation session during 4 to 5 hours, every day 2 similar session are run with 2 different groups of same level residents. Alternatively 1 or 2 resident act during a scenario while the others observe in a teletransmission room. Debriefing follows the critical scenario in witch resident are involved. The investigators are testing the effects of five minute of conversational relaxation before the debriefing on the anxiety level and memorization of key points each scénario on participant and observer. Relaxation is done reading a text outloud by an instructor before the debriefing. Each scenario is run in the morning and the afternoon and alternatively have relaxation or not. evaluation is done on participant of the scenario and resident observer of the situation. The Investigators ask participant for demographic data, anxiety scale test, multiple anxiety visual analogic scale. At the end of every scenario 5 clinical key point of teh scenario are exposed. At 3 month the investigators call back every participant to ask them to remember these 5 points for the scenario they were involved in and one of the other they observed.</detailed_description>
