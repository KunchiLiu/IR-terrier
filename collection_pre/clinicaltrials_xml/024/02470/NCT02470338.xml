	<brief_summary>This study is to show that the investigators believe the Modified Brostrӧm Procedure can be completed without a routine ankle arthroscopy. Routine ankle arthroscopy, if determined not to be necessary in all cases, is a waste of resources in terms of operating room, surgeon, and staff time as well causing an increase in hospital financial expenses. Most importantly, this procedure is morbid. Ankle arthroscopy forces a patient's foot into distraction for up to one hour, exposes the patient to potentially longer anesthesia exposure that is unnecessary, increases infectious risks, and requires exposure at the portal sites near superficial nerves.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modified Brostrӧm Procedure With and Without Possible Arthroscopy for Lateral Ankle Instability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this investigation is to determine if ankle arthroscopy is necessary in the treatment of routine ankle instability without evidence of intra-articular pathology on MRI. Our study population will include those individuals whose ankle MRI is inconclusive or negative for intra-articular pathologies, and intra-articular ankle pain is not a predominant presenting symptom. Although it is our current practice at WBAMC not to conduct an ankle arthroscopy on this group of patients, there is a debate in the literature on whether the arthroscopy should be conducted. Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine the MBP with and without ankle arthroscopy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Able to independently consent for surgery 2. Able to demonstrate an understanding of study procedures 3. Adult patient 18 years of age or older 4. All active duty soldiers, Veterans, dependents 5. Ability to comply with study procedures for the entire length of the study 6. Presence of lateral ankle instability meeting operative criteria listed in 6.2.1 with documented failed conservative measures such as: physical therapy, ankle braces, and rest 1. Unable to obtain medical clearance for surgery 2. Recent (1 month) febrile illness that precludes or delays participation 3. History of or suspected of drug/alcohol abuse, as these patients may not be compliant with physical therapy. All patients are required to be immobilized for 6 weeks after surgery 4. Pregnant women, this is an elective procedure and a MBP or ankle arthroscopy is not typically offered to pregnant women. Screening for pregnancy is done as part of standard of care</criteria>
