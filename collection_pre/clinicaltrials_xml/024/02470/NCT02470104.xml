	<detailed_description>The investigators hypothesize that the gut microbiota during bone marrow transplant could be influenced by administration of enteral donor breast milk. This study will attempt to address this hypothesis, by feeding donor breast milk to young children undergoing transplant, and serially comparing the gut microbiota in children receiving human milk, with those receiving conventional feeding.</detailed_description>
