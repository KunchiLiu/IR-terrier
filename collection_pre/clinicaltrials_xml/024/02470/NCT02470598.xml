	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to observe the effect of adapted APD (aAPD) on maintenance and/or improvement of the hydration status of more than 250 PD patients, and to observe the tolerability of the therapy over a long period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PD-Improved Dialysis Efficiency With Adapted APD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In some studies it has been observed that the use of a combination of short dwell/small volume and long dwell/large volume can improve the effectiveness of APD. However, these studies have been performed in a small number of patients during a short observation period. The aim of this study is to assess the hydration status of PD patients treated with aAPD and observe its development during one year using the BCM-Body Composition Monitor (BCM), a bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) device. In addition, it is intended to observe the variability of aAPD prescriptions and their influence on the hydration status of the patients. This is a purely non-interventional, observational study, where treatment decisions are completely guided by the discretion of the attending nephrologists.</detailed_description>
