	<brief_summary>In the past few years, studies have evaluated the effect of systemic use of sodium alendronate, especially in the treatment of structural bone defects caused by periodontal diseases. This study evaluated the effects of non-surgical periodontal treatment associated with the topical application of 1% sodium alendronate on clinical and topographical parameters. Chronic periodontitis patients were recruited for the present study and were monitored at 3 and 6 months after baseline examinations. A placebo gel was used as control.</brief_summary>
