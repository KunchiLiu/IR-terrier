	<brief_title>Web-based Lifestyle Trial Among Men With Prostate Cancer: Prostate 8</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a PI-initiated, randomized, unblinded, clinical trial of a technology-based 3 month lifestyle intervention vs. usual care among men with low risk prostate cancer. We will recruit and consent 76 men with prostate cancer at UCSF. The subjects will be asked to complete questionnaires, 7 days accelerometer measurement, body measurements (weight, waist, hip, pulse, blood pressure) and collection of blood specimen at baseline and 3 months. Subjects will be randomized into two arms (Intervention Group and Control Group). The Intervention Group (N=38) will have access to the lifestyle website and an activity monitor (e.g., Fitbit), receive text messages, and be provided with individualized lifestyle recommendations. The Control Group (N=38) will have standard of care and be asked to continue with their usual lifestyle habits. They will receive access to the lifestyle website and be provided with individualized lifestyle recommendations at 3 months.</detailed_description>
