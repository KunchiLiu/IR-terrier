	<brief_summary>There is a move towards personalized medicine in cancer care, and significant effort is underway to evaluate new targeted therapeutics for the treatment of ovarian cancer. One way to identify potential new drug targets is by screening a drug library to determine whether drugs in the library target key kinase or enzymatic sites in cellular signaling pathways. Previous preclinical work and pilot studies demonstrated that ketorolac (a type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) inhibits GTPase activity in ovarian cancer cells retrieved from the post-operative peritoneal cavity. The purpose of this study is to confirm that this inhibitory effect is ketorolac driven and not a specific effect of the post-operative peritoneal compartment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of GTPase Inhibition by Post-operative Intravenous Ketorolac in Ovarian Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Drug repurposing, screening a library of FDA approved agents, can identify agents that are clinically available and for which pharmacology and pharmacokinetics are known and preclinical data can be generated rapidly without the subsequent need for GMP (good manufacturing practice) new drug production. Small GTPases, including members of the Rab, Ras and Rho families, are attractive targets for the development of cancer therapeutics based on their pivotal roles in protein trafficking, proliferation/survival and cytoskeletal organization, respectively. Ketorolac tromethamine is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that was identified in previous in-silico drug screens to be an inhibitor of GTPases. In a previous phase 0 clinical study, ketorolac was administered intravenously to ovarian cancer patients following optimal cytoreductive surgery. Ovarian cancer cells were obtained at the time of surgery, prior to ketorolac administration, and at various times after ketorolac dosing. Analysis of GTPase activity in these specimens showed a time-dependent inhibition of Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPase activity. The purpose of this study is to confirm that the effect is ketorolac driven and not a specific effect of the post-operative peritoneal compartment.</detailed_description>
