	<brief_title>a Bike Application to Support Cardiac Patient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study investigates the use of a mobile cycling application for patients with a cardiac disease that was developed by the Expertise Centre for Digital Media of Hasselt University in collaboration with the Faculty of Medicine &amp; Life Sciences of Hasselt University. During the pilot study, the use of the cycling application and its impact on fear and motivation of patients with a cardiac disease during the rehabilitation is studied. The cycling application will be used on a smartphone, in combination with a wrist-worn heart rate monitor. During the study, the patients will use the cycling application for one month, in which they can make use of the cycling application each time they are cycling outdoor in their home environment. Through questionnaires and interviews, the patients' experiences with respect to fear and motivation will be collected. Furthermore, the usability of the cycling application is evaluated through these questionnaires and interviews.</detailed_description>
