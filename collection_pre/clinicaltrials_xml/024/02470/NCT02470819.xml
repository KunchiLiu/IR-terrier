	<brief_title>Genomic and Proteomic Profiling Targets Influenced Treatment in Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To explore the impact of targeted therapy for breast cancer suggested by proteomic and genomic profiling using RPMA, targeted resequencing, IHC analysis, WGS, RNA-seq, and Exome sequencing on progression-free survival. When a molecular target cannot be identified, the patient will be treated with a therapy selected on an empirical basis by the investigator/treating physician at the individual site and will be followed for survival status. Only available, FDA-approved agents will be used.</detailed_description>
