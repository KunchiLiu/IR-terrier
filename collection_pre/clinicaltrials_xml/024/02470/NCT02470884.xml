	<brief_summary>A prospective multi-center, single arm feasibility study to assess the safety and performance of the Boston Scientific Fully Absorbable Scaffold.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FAST Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Boston Scientific Fully Absorbable Scaffold is a device/drug combination product providing a mechanical structure for vascular lumen support (the scaffold component) and a pharmacological agent (everolimus) targeted toward reducing the injury response that leads to restenosis after scaffold implantation. The Boston Scientific Fully Absorbable Scaffold is intended to improve the luminal diameter in subjects with ischemic heart disease due to de novo native coronary artery target lesions ≤ 12 mm in length with reference vessel diameter ≥ 2.75 mm and ≤ 3.25 mm. Subjects who are candidates for PCI for the treatment of a de novo native coronary artery lesion will be screened according to the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects will be considered enrolled once they have signed the informed consent form and an attempt has been made to implant the fully absorbable study scaffold. During the index procedure 1 target lesion in a de novo native coronary artery may be treated. Up to 1 non-target lesion in a separate epicardial vessel may be treated with a commercially approved DES</detailed_description>

(Women of childbearing potential who are sexually active must agree to use a reliable method of contraception from the time of screening through 12 months after the index procedure) Subject is a woman who is pregnant or nursing (A pregnancy test must be performed within 7 days prior to the index procedure in women of childbearing potential) Planned treatment of more than 1 target lesion and 1 nontarget lesion (see below "Multiple Interventions During Index Procedure") Planned treatment of the target lesion with more than 1 scaffold Target lesion is located in the left main Target lesion is located within 3mm of the origin of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, left circumflex (LCX) coronary artery or right coronary artery (RCA) Target lesion is located within a saphenous vein graft or arterial graft or will be accessed via a saphenous vein graft or an arterial graft Target lesion involves a side branch &gt;2.0mm in diameter Target lesion involves a clinically significant side branch &lt;2.0 mm in diameter that has a clinically significant stenosis at the ostium. Target lesion and/or target vessel proximal to the target lesion is moderately to severely calcified Excessive tortuosity or extreme angulation proximal to or within the target lesion Target lesion is restenotic from a previous stent implantation Thrombus, or possible thrombus, present in the target vessel Nontarget lesion to be treated during the index procedure meets any of the following criteria: Located within the target vessel Located within a bypass graft (venous or arterial) Left main location Chronic total occlusion Involves a complex bifurcation (e.g., bifurcation lesion requiring treatment with more than 1 stent) Restenotic from previous intervention Subject has unprotected left main coronary artery disease (&gt;50% diameter stenosis)</criteria>
