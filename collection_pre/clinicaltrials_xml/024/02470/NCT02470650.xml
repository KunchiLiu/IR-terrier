	<detailed_description>Secondary objectives: - patients with virologic response ratio at 48 weeks (less than 50 plasma viral load) - Change in the number of CD4 cells at 48 weeks - Change in body composition and mineral density bone (body and lumbar) measurement with DEXA (bone mineral density scan) at 48 weeks - Change in markers of renal function (creatinine clearance, glomerular filtration rate - eGFR - estimated rate) and renal tubular function at 48 weeks - Rate of mortality and clinical progression at 48 weeks - general tolerability and safety: adverse events (AA) and serious AA description</detailed_description>
