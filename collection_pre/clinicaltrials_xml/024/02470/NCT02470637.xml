	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To assess the dose-response pattern of the glucose consumption (GIR-AUC0-end) of 3 different single doses of Afrezza inhaled Technosphere insulin and of 3 single doses of subcutaneous (SC) insulin lispro in a euglycemic clamp setting. Secondary Objectives: To assess the dose proportionality of insulin exposure (INS-AUClast) of 3 different single doses of Afrezza inhaled Technosphere insulin and of 3 single doses of SC insulin lispro in a euglycemic clamp setting. To assess the pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics of 3 different single doses of Afrezza inhaled Technosphere insulin and of 3 single doses of SC insulin lispro in a euglycemic clamp setting. To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of 3 different single doses of Afrezza inhaled Technosphere insulin and of 3 single doses of SC insulin lispro in a euglycemic clamp setting. To assess the safety and tolerability of 3 different single doses of Afrezza inhaled Technosphere insulin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Dose Clamp Study to Evaluate Concentration-time Profile and Metabolic Activity of 3 Dose Levels of Afrezza and 3 Dose Levels of Insulin Lispro in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The total study duration for one patient is approximately 6.7 to 22.7 weeks (minimum to maximum duration, excluding screening). The duration of the study includes a screening period of 3 to 28 days (D -28 to D -3), 6 treatment periods of 1 or 2 days each (1 overnight stay), a washout period of 7 to 28 days (preferentially 7 days between consecutive dosing), and an end-of-study visit of 7 to 14 days after the last study drug administration.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : Male or female patients, between 18 and 65 years of age, inclusive, with diabetes mellitus type 1 for more than one year, as defined by the American Diabetes Association. Total insulin dose of &lt;1.0 U/kg/day. Body weight between 50.0 and 95 kg, inclusive, body mass index between 18.5 and 29 kg/m², inclusive. Fasting serum Cpeptide &lt;0.3 nmol/L. Glycohemoglobin (HbA1c) ≤75 mmol/mol (≤9%). Stable insulin regimen for at least 2 months prior to study (with respect to safety of the patient and scientific integrity of the study). Certified as otherwise healthy for type 1 diabetes mellitus patient by assessment of medical history and physical examination (cardiovascular system, chest and lungs, thyroid, abdomen, nervous system, skin and mucosae, and musculoskeletal system), unless the Investigator considers any abnormality to be clinically irrelevant and not interfering with the conduct of the study (with respect to safety of the subject and scientific integrity of the study). Having given written informed consent prior to undertaking any studyrelated procedure. Nonsmoking at least for the last 6 months before screening (to be confirmed by urine cotinine &lt;500 µg/L). Pulmonary function test at screening: forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) &gt;70% of the individual prediction according to the equation of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). Exclusion criteria: Severe hypoglycemia resulting in coma/seizures or requiring assistance of another person, and/or hospitalization for diabetic ketoacidosis in the last 6 months before screening visit. Frequent severe headaches and/or migraine, recurrent nausea and/or vomiting (more than twice a month). Presence or history of drug hypersensitivity, or allergic disease diagnosed and treated by a physician. History or presence of drug or alcohol abuse (alcohol consumption more than 40 g per day). If female, pregnancy (defined as positive betahuman chorionic gonadotropin [βhCG] blood test), breastfeeding at screening and before any treatment periods (defined as positive βhCG urine test). Any medication (including St John's Wort) within 14 days before inclusion or within 5 times the elimination halflife or PD halflife of the medication, with the exception of insulins, thyroid hormones, lipidlowering, and antihypertensive drugs and if female with the exception of hormonal contraception or menopausal hormone replacement therapy; any vaccination within 28 days before inclusion. Presence or history of any acute or chronic obstructive bronchopulmonary disease including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and cancer. Upper respiratory tract infection within 8 weeks before screening. Known hypersensitivity to insulin lispro or Afrezza Technosphere insulin and excipients. Inability, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or a designee, to adequately inhale Afrezza powder. Any history or presence of deep leg vein thrombosis or a frequent appearance of deep leg vein thrombosis in firstdegree relatives (parents, siblings, or children). The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
