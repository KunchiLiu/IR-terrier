	<brief_summary>Little is known about the prevalence of small bowel polyps in patients with sporadic Duodenal/Ampullary polyps. The investigators aim to investigate the prevalence of small bowel polyps in patients with sporadic (ie not related to FAP or PJS) duodenal/ampullary adenomas by performing small bowel capsule endoscopy and comparing the results to those acquired from a control cohort undergoing VCE for accepted indication at our centre.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevalence of Small Bowel Polyps in Patients With Sporadic Duodenal Adenomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigation for suspected SB tumors is an acceptable indication for VCE. SB polyps occur frequently in patients with FAP/PJS and in patients with FAP, they are significantly more common in patients with Duodenal/Ampullary polyps. Little is known about the prevalence of small bowel polyps in patients with sporadic Duodenal/Ampullary polyps. The primary hypothesis is that patients with sporadic (ie not related to FAP or PJS) duodenal/ampullary adenomas have a higher prevalence of small bowel polyps compared with patients undergoing VCE for various indications who have not had a duodenal polyp diagnosed or removed. Patients who have had a previous diagnosis and/or treatment of a duodenal/ampullary polyp at Westmead hospital will receive VCE examination. Control population will consist of age matched controls having VCE for OGIB/IDA at Westmead hospital. Patients will be required to have had a documented colonoscopy within the previous three years. If colonoscopy was not performed within this time frame, the patient will have a colonoscopy as part of the study protocol.</detailed_description>
