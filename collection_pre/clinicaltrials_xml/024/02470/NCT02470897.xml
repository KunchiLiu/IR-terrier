	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of stereotactic body radiation therapy while using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) planning to help avoid radiation to normal tissue in patients with prostate cancer. Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a specialized radiation therapy that sends x-rays directly to the tumor using small, high doses of radiation over several days and may cause less damage to normal tissue. This treatment schedule allows for a higher dose of radiation to be administered over a shorter overall treatment period in comparison to standard radiation therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy With Boost Using Urethral-Sparing Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy Planning in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the incidence of genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) acute and late toxicity for patients treated with prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with simultaneous integrative boost, urethral ring sparing, and enhanced prostate localization (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI\-computed tomography [CT] fusion). II. To also evaluate the incidence of GU and GI acute and late toxicity for patients treated with prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with a more conventional and uniformly delivered dose of 7.25 Gy/fraction to the prostate. III. Disease-free survival: disease-free failure events include local progression, distant progression, biochemical failure as defined by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) Phoenix definition, and death from any cause. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate patient quality of life (QOL) using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite 26 (EPIC-26) for evaluation of the QOL for up to 3 years after the completion of SBRT. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Patients unable to undergo MRI, whose MRI proves technically inadequate for delineating needed anatomic structures, or who decline to enroll on Arm A are assigned to Arm B. ARM A: Patients undergo 5 fractions of moderate dose SBRT with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) every other day for 10 days following urethral-sparing IMRT planning. ARM B: Patients undergo 5 fractions of uniform dose SBRT every other day for 10 days following undergo urethral-sparing IMRT planning. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks, at 4, 8, and 12 months, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then every 12 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
