	<brief_title>Identifying Molecular Drivers of Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study involves looking at the DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites in blood and tissue samples collected from subjects and linking them to their health information. By doing so, researchers hope to discover the underlying molecular causes of human diseases with the hope that this information can be used for the development of diagnostic tests and more effective treatments.</detailed_description>
