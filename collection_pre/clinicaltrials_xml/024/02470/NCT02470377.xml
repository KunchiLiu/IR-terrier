	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to determine whether external neuromodulation using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can reduce the perception of self-motion that is experienced by individuals with mal de debarquement syndrome (MdDS). Mal de debarquement is translated as the "sickness of disembarkment," and refers to the chronic feeling of rocking dizziness that occurs after exposure to passive motion. Treatment for MdDS is limited and morbidity is high. The goal of the study is to determine whether rTMS can suppress the rocking dizziness of MdDS and to determine whether imaging and electrical biomarkers can aide in more effective targeting. The investigators will make correlations between functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and specific clinical features to determine whether functional connectivity between particular hubs in the brain correlate with clinical improvement.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants will maintain web-based diaries of their symptoms for two weeks prior to treatment with rTMS. Up to 20 treatments with rTMS with either anatomically or functionally determined targets will be administered. Treatments will be preceded by an fMRI scan and EEG recording prior to the first rTMS treatment and will be followed by an fMRI and EEG after the last treatment. Post treatment diaries will continue for up to 12 weeks after rTMS administration.</detailed_description>
