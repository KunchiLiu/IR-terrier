	<brief_summary>A multi-site, randomized-read order, retrospective, paired-design evaluation of the Omnyx™ Integrated Digital Pathology (IDP) system with de-identified and previously signed-out cases from all major organ systems. Pathologist will read and diagnose cases on a conventional light microscope and on the Omnyx™ IDP system for Whole Slide Images (WSI) with a randomized read order. College of American Pathologists (CAP) cancer protocol checklists will be used to capture diagnostic reporting. Diagnoses rendered by site Reading Pathologists will be captured on CAP checklists and compared directly to the Ground Truth (GT) diagnosis for both modalities.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Omnyx™ Integrated Digital Pathology System in the Primary Diagnosis of Surgical Pathology Specimens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following the FDA issued guidance document, "Informed Consent for In Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies Using Leftover Human Specimens that are Not Individually Identifiable"- 2006, the specimens are surgical pathology samples from leftover human specimens from clinical cases, archived and previously signed-out across the majority of surgical pathology subspecialties</detailed_description>
	<criteria>• All surgical pathology samples from preidentified list provided by FDA Gross evaluation only specimens (including hardware and specimens that do not require microscopic review for diagnosis) Immunofluorescence specimens Fluidbased specimens Intraoperative consultation specimens only (frozen preparation) Specimens from which a slide(s) fails quality control according to user manuals and training and issue(s) cannot be remediated at the time of procurement and overlabeling; this includes having too many labels such that slide damage or scanner failure is likely (as outlined in Omnyx user manuals). Specimens for which any slide (other than a blank) that should be in the case part cannot be located</criteria>
