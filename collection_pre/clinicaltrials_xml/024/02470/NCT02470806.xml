	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to compare the clinical efficacy of two types of NPWT systems; - tNPWT systems that has successfully completed a coding verification request with CMS and has the following capabilities (e.g., range of negative pressure, connective tubing, canister, foam or gauze filler, and approved for home use) and, - a portable, canister-less, battery operated, disposable single-use NPWT system (PICO) to see if there are any observed differences with regard to the clinical efficacy of the two devices.</brief_summary>
