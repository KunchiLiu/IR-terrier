	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized clinical study was to evaluate the efficiency of Er,Cr:YSGG laser irradiation combined with a resin based tricalcium silicate material and calcium hydroxide (CH) in direct pulp capping for 3 months follow-up period.Sixty permanent vital teeth without symptoms and radiographic changes were randomly assigned to 4 groups (n=15): Gr 1: The exposed area was sealed with CH paste, Gr 2: The treated area was sealed with CH paste following Er,Cr:YSGG laser irradiation at an energy level of 0,5 W without water and 45% air, Gr 3: Resin based tricalcium silicate material (TheraCal LC) was applied directly to the exposed pulp, Gr 4: TheraCal LC was applied following irradiation with Er,Cr:YSGG laser.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CH is used as gold standard in pulp capping procedures due to its beneficial properties such as induction of mineralization and inhibition of bacterial growth; however tunnel defects and cell inclusions in dentin bridges formed by CH may lead to leakage and bacteria penetration resulting in loss of vitality. TheraCal LC is a new light-cured, resin-modified, tricalcium silicate based material designed to use for direct and indirect pulp-capping aiming to achieve a bond to composite resins thus reducing micro-leakage.The formulation of TheraCal LC containing tricalcium silicate particles in a hydrophilic monomer provides significant calcium release that stimulates hydroxyapatite and secondary dentin bridge formation The use of laser for direct pulp capping has been suggested for the considerable advantages of lasers including decontamination effect, biostimulation effect, hemostatic and coagulant effect.The erbium, chromium-doped:yttrium, scandium, gallium and garnet (Er,Cr:YSGG) laser which is a relatively new device has been reported to ablate dental hard tissues thanks to its high absorption in water and also strong absorption by the hydroxyl radicals present in the hydroxyapatite structure</detailed_description>
