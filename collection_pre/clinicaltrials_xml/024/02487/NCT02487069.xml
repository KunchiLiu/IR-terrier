	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) from sibling matched donor (SMD),matched unrelated donor (MURD) and haploidentical related donors(HRD) in the treatment of hematologic malignancy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Allo-HSCT With Alternative Donor in Treatment of Hematologic Malignancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remains the only curative therapy for a majority of malignant hematologic diseases, especially acute leukemia. HSCT from SMD offers the best results for these diseases, but lack of this donor resource has restricted its wide application. HSCT from MURD provides another option, but MURDs still cannot satisfy all patients due to unsuccessful donor searches. Almost all patients have an available related donor with whom they share a single HLA haplotype (ie, haploidentical related donor), and it owns the advantage of immediate availability, especially for those who urgently need transplantation.The results of transplantation from HRD have improved significantly over the past few years. However, the results from such haploidentical transplantation have not formally been compared with those of transplantation in patients contemporaneously using SMDs and MURDs for hematologic malignancy.</detailed_description>
