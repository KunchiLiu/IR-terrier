	<brief_title>Treatment of Hypertrophic Scars Using Fractional Laser and Fractional Laser-assisted Topical Corticosteroid Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertrophic scars are common conditions that cause persistent symptom and can lead to severe psychosocial impairment. Intralesional corticosteroid have been a mainstay in the treatment of hypertrophic scars. However, there are many disadvantages of corticosteroid injection such as severe pain, skin atrophy, skin thinning, steroid acne, telangiectasia and hypopigmentation. Recent reports propose new treatment methods for hypertrophic scars with the use of fractional ablative lasers to create zones of ablation of the skin that may assisted the penetration of drugs to the skin.</detailed_description>
