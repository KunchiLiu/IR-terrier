	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the combined effect of melatonin and donepezil on improving sleep and behavior in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders. Melatonin is a natural neurohormone that helps regulate sleep and wake cycles. Donepezil is used to improve mental function for people with Alzheimer's disease. Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders are more likely to have problems sleeping than other children. This difficulty has been linked to daytime behavioral problems and family stress.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Both male and female children Ages 4 to 17 1/2 years Diagnosis with Autism Spectrum Disorder on the basis of the clinical judgment of an autism specialist, preferably using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule or the Autism Diagnostic InterviewRevised. Abnormal electroencephalogram in the past month Cardiovascular problems Asthma Respiratory disease Peptic ulcer disease Renal or hepatic dysfunction (abnormal blood urea nitrogen/creatinine or 2 times elevated liver transaminases) Urinary tract obstruction Underweight (body mass index &lt; 5th percentile compared to age and sex matched population) Other serious illness Use of any of the following drugs that might interact with study medications (anticholinergics, systemic corticosteroids, phenobarbital, peginterferon, betablockers or any drug that may cause arrhythmias). Drugs that induce or inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 and cytochrome P450 3A4 (enzymes important for drug metabolism) will be allowed because any effects of such medications are likely to be lost in individual variability due to genetic polymorphisms. Use of medications affecting sleep (including melatonin or donepezil). Children on these will have to discontinue them for 4 weeks before enrollment in the trial in order to establish an appropriate behavioral baseline, and agree to discontinue use for the duration of the trial.
