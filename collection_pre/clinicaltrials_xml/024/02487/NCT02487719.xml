	<brief_summary>Examination of iron supplements routinely used in pregnancy to compare these with one another regarding effectiveness in the prevention of iron deficiency. Determination of ferritin / hemoglobin every pregnant woman under the first routine check. Classification into one of three subgroups (group 1: iron sulfate, Group 2: iron polymaltose, Group 3: multivitamin- multimineral) depending on the measured values. Repetition of hemoglobin every 8 weeks, at the entrance to birth and postpartum day 1, additional provision of ferritin at the entrance to birth. In addition, registration of each child's birth weight and gestational age.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Different Iron Supplements for Prevention of Anemia in Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Worldwide, iron deficiency is the most common shortage in women of childbearing age and also the most common cause of anemia. The prevalence of iron deficiency in young not pregnant women is 10-30%. During pregnancy take Frequency and importance of iron deficiency. Through organic growth and development of fetoplacental Unit and by maternal tissue formation, uterus growth and strong Expansion of maternal blood volume increases the pregnant woman the iron requirement for a Multiple. Starting from a non-pregnant state in the daily requirement of about 1 mg increasing this to 4-5 mg. Even with optimum food selection and a secured Increase of intestinal absorption in pregnancy, there is a negative Iron balance. The consequences are a depletion of iron stores (Serum ferritin &lt;15 mcg / L) and a qualitative and quantitative disturbance of maternal Erythropoiesis with increased hypochromic and microcytic erythrocytes up to the occurrence anemia. The increased iron requirement is the background to a general recommendation an iron prophylaxis during pregnancy. However, this is possible due Reinforcement of gastrointestinal symptoms usually only from the 12th week of pregnancy is recommended. All pregnant women receive from the 12th week of pregnancy a multivitamin supplementation for the most important trace elements and vitamins. According to the guidelines of the Department of Obstetrics of USZ should a pregnant woman after the 12th week of pregnancy at a marginal ferritin &lt;50mcg / l prophylactically receive additional iron and so anemia can be prevented. The aim of the study is on the one hand today's conventional iron supplements Maltofer Fol and Gyno-Tardyferon to examine their effectiveness, in particular with regard to the difference between two- and trivalent iron. On the other hand are at the usual multivitamin supplements. Women with normal iron stores at the beginning with respect to their effectiveness in preventing a depletion of these stores will be examined. Another aspect to be examined the occurrence of manifest iron deficiency anemia among called iron prophylaxis. According to ferrtin value at first pregancy check, patients are enrolled after informed consent. ferritin &gt;50 mcg/L means patient will be randomized in eiter iron sulfate or iron polymaltose group. Ferritin &gt; 50 mcg/L means pt will reeive multivitamin - multimineral containing iron. At midpregancy ferritin value is routinely checked as well at entering delivery floor at term.</detailed_description>
