	<brief_title>Obese Pregnant Women: Optimizing Fetal Ultrasound</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ultrasound examination for fetal anomaly is especially challenging in obese gravida. The foetus is more likely to have congenital anomalies and imaging in these patients is technically more difficult. The investigators hypotheses that an earlier ultrasound with alternative technics will improve the quality and thereby improve the identification of anomalies. By using transvaginal ultrasound and abdominal ultrasound at the window just above the symphysis, were the subcutaneous fat is known to be thinner, the investigators hope to achieve a better overview. This will be done by evaluating fetal ultrasound at three different gestational ages (GA); GA 13, 15 and 21 weeks.</detailed_description>
