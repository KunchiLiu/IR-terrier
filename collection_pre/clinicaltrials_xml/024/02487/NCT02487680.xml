	<brief_summary>It has previously been shown in healthy overweight subjects, that table water including a defined amount of amino acids and chromium can decrease the postprandial glucose. In this study, the effect of this table water on glucose excursions after a test meal containing a defined amount of available carbohydrates, protein and fat will be studied in healthy subjects. The study will be conducted in a cross -over design, double blinded and placebo controlled including 20 participants. The primary endpoint of the study is the incremental area under the curve for plasma glucose (iAUCgluc) within 180 minutes after ingestion of the meal.</brief_summary>
