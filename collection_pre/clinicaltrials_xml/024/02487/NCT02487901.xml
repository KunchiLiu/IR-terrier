	<brief_title>Comparison of Ultrasonic Osteotome and Conventional Drill Osteotome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ultrasonic bone osteotome has been utilized in various surgical field, but the use in neurosurgery especially in spine surgery is not widely spread. The tissue selectivity of ultrasonic osteotomy may enhance operative time and reduce tissue trauma. Moreover, bony fusion rate may be increased because of low thermal injury to the bone. In the present study, we are going to compare bony fusion rate after cervical laminotomy either with ultrasonic osteotome or conventional drill.</detailed_description>
