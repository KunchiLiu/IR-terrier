	<brief_summary>Isolated thrombocytopenia is a common and severe complication of HSCT, which often leads to an increased risk of life-threatening hemorrhage, frequent requirement of platelet transfusions and extended hospital stays, representing a challenging clinical problem. Current treatments for thrombocytopenia after HSCT are frequently unsatisfactory in platelet recovery and for preventing potentially fatal bleeding complications. Therefore, it is urgent to explore an effective therapy to improve the outcomes of thrombocytopenia after HSCT. Previous studies have demonstrated that decitabine, a hypomethylating agent, may reduce platelet transfusions in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. The investigators conducted an prospective clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficiency of rhTPO and decitabine in the treatment of thrombocytopenia following HSCT.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Isolated thrombocytopenia is a frequent and severe complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). It often leads to an increased risk of life-threatening hemorrhage, frequent requirement of platelet transfusions and extended hospital stays, representing a challenging clinical problem. Current treatments for thrombocytopenia after HSCT, including thrombopoietin, interleukin-11, immunoglobulin, methylprednisolone and rituximab, are frequently unsatisfactory in platelet recovery. Therefore, it is urgent to explore an effective therapy to improve the outcomes of thrombocytopenia after HSCT. Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a cytokine that drives thrombopoiesis by stimulating the differentiation of stem cells into megakaryocytes and promoting megakaryocyte proliferation and polyploidization. Decitabine was approved for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) as a DNA methylation inhibitors. Studies in vitro show that decitabine enhances platelet release and megakaryocyte maturation. Here, the investigators performed a prospective clinical trial, in order to investigate the safety and efficiency of rhTPO and decitabine in the treatment of thrombocytopenia following HSCT.</detailed_description>
