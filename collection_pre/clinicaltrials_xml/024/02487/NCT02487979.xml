	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well glembatumumab vedotin works in treating patients with osteosarcoma that has come back (recurrent) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Monoclonal antibodies, such as glembatumumab vedotin, may find tumor cells and help kill them.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glembatumumab Vedotin in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Osteosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate whether CDX-011 (glembatumumab vedotin) therapy either increases the disease control rate at 4 months in patients with recurrent measurable osteosarcoma as compared to an historical Children's Oncology Group (COG) experience or produces an objective response rate in patients without previous eribulin (eribulin mesylate) treatment. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the feasibility and toxicity profile of CDX-011 in patients with recurrent osteosarcoma. II. To describe the pharmacokinetics of CDX-011 in adolescents and young adults with recurrent osteosarcoma enrolled at COG sites and COG phase I consortium sites only. III. To determine if there is a relationship between tumor GPNMB expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and response to CDX-011 therapy. IV. To estimate, in the cohort of patients previously treated with eribulin, the proportion who will experience disease progression during the first 4 months of CDX-011 therapy and the proportion of patients who experience a Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)-defined complete or partial response. OUTLINE: Patients receive glembatumumab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 18 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.</detailed_description>
