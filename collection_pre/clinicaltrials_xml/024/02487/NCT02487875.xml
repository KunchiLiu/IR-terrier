	<brief_summary>Background: Individuals with COPD may present reduced peripheral muscle strength, which leads to impaired mobility. Comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) should include strength training, in particular to lower limbs. Furthermore, simple tools for the assessment of lower extremity muscles' performance are required. Objectives: To assess the muscle strength of COPD patients by the sit-to-stand test (STST) as compared to the one-repetition maximum (1-RM), considered as the gold standard in non-laboratory situations, and to evaluate the responsiveness of STST to a PR program with specific strength training (SPR), compared to usual PR program (UPR). Methods: 60 moderate-to-severe COPD inpatients were randomly included into either the SPR or into the UPR. 30-sec STST, 1-min STST, 1-RM and 6MWT were assessed before and after PRs.</brief_summary>
