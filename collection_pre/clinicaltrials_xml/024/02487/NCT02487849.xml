	<brief_summary>The combination of optimal cytoreductive operation (according to Desktop II criteria), HIPEC with Carboplatin 800 mg/m² KOF (Körperoberfläche) and following platinum-based systemic chemotherapy should be executed In patients with platinum-sensitive recurrence of ovarian carcinoma. Condition for HIPEC is attainment of optimal cytoreduction (R0) and experts judgement of a complication-free prolongation of narcosis after finishing the surgery. HIPEC will be administered additionally to standard therapy. If HIPEC was executed the number of systemic given platinum-based chemotherapy decreases for one cycle. This regime should be investigated in terms of safety of performance, quality of life for the patients and consequences for the following systemic chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HIPEC After Secondary Cytoreductive Operation in Patients With Platinum-sensitive Recurrence of Ovarian Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In occurence with a platinum-sensitive recurrence of EOC survival can be prolonged by a recurrence-operation, if macroscopical tumor-free status (optimal cytoreductive operation) can be reached in combination with a platinum-based standard-chemotherapy. Several studies showed that the combination of optimal cytoreductive operation and HIPEC is a secure method of treatment. In comparison to operation and standard-chemotherapy it has a significant positive influence on survival rates. A hyperthermal intraperitoneal chemotherapy with Carboplatin is possible without severe side-effects. The combination of optimal cytoreductive operation (according to Desktop II criteria), HIPEC with Carboplatin and following platinum-based systemic chemotherapy should be carried out in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrence. Condition for applying HIPEC is reaching optimal cytoreduction (&lt;0.5 cm visible tumour rest at the end of operation) and according to expert opinion a complicatin-free prolongation of narcosis after finishing the operative intervention. HIPEC is carried out additionally to standard therapy. If it can be carried out, the amount of systemically administered patinum-based chemotherapy is reduced for one cycle. This regime should be tested on safety in performance, quality of life for patients, and consequences for the following systemic chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
