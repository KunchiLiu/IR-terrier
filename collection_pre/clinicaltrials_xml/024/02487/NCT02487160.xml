	<criteria>1. ≥ 22 years of age, of any race and either gender 2. Operable, age related cataract grade in both eyes 3. Patients who require an intraocular lens (IOL) power in the range of 15 D 30 D only 4. Able to comprehend and sign a statement of informed consent 5. Calculated lens power within the available supply range 6. Planned cataract removal by phacoemulsification 7. Potential postoperative visual acuity of 0.2 Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (logMAR) or better in both eyes 8. In good general and ocular health 9. Patients with preoperative astigmatism ≤1.0 D Note: Corneal incisions made to reduce astigmatism will not be allowed during the course of the study. 10. Clear intraocular media other than cataract in study eyes 11. Preoperative Best Corrected Distance Visual Acuity (BCDVA) worse than 0.2 logMAR 12. The subject must be able to undergo second eye surgery between 7 days and 30 days of the first eye surgery 13. Able to competently complete testing 14. Willing and able to attend study visits 1. Previous intraocular surgery 2. Preoperative photopic pupil size of &lt; 2.75 mm 3. Previous corneal refractive surgery 4. Any inflammation or edema (swelling) of the cornea 5. Subjects with diagnosed degenerative visual disorders (e.g. macular degeneration or other retinal disorders ) that are predicted to cause future acuity losses to a level worse than 0.2 logMAR 6. Subjects who may reasonably be expected to require a secondary surgical intervention at any time during the study (other than neodymiumdoped yttrium aluminium garnet (nd:YAG) capsulotomy) 7. Amblyopia 8. Clinically significant ptosis 9. Clinically severe corneal dystrophy (eg., epithelial, stromal, or endothelial dystrophy), keratitis, keratoconjunctivitis, keratouveitis, keratopathy, or kerectasia 10. Diabetic Retinopathy 11. Extremely shallow anterior chamber, not due to swollen cataract 12. Microphthalmia 13. Previous retinal detachment 14. Previous corneal transplant 15. Severe dry eye 16. Recurrent severe anterior or posterior segment inflammation of unknown etiology 17. Systemic medications that may confound the outcome or increase the risk to the subject in the opinion of the Investigator [tamsulosin hydrochloride (Flomax) or other medications with similar side effects (floppy iris syndrome)] 18. Rubella or traumatic cataract 19. Iris neovascularization 20. Glaucoma (medically controlled or uncontrolled) 21. Aniridia 22. Chronic severe uveitis 23. Optic nerve atrophy 24. Corneal decompensation 25. Greater than 1.0 D of astigmatism 26. History of corneal disease (e.g., herpes simplex, herpes zoster keratitis, etc.) 27. Pseudoexfoliation syndrome 28. Iris atrophy 29. Pupil abnormalities (e.g., corectopia) 30. Aniseikonia 31. An acute or chronic disease or illness that may confound the results of this investigation (e.g., immunocompromised, connective tissue disease, clinically significant atopic disease, diabetes, and any other such disease or illness) 32. Pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant during the course of the trial Note: Subjects who become pregnant during the study will not be discontinued; however, data may be excluded from the effectiveness analyses because pregnancy can alter refraction and visual acuity results. 33. Participation in another clinical trial within 30 days of study start</criteria>
