	<brief_summary>In adulthood, limited mobility and pain are very common and often the first clear sign of functional decline. The loss of independent mobility is related to higher rates of functional disability and mortality; however, it is also susceptible to interventions through exercises. With aging, changes in peripheral and central nervous system also occur, which lead to degradation of the sensory receptors as well as a loss of muscle mass and coordination. However, both, structural and functional dysfunctions of the nervous system, can be mitigated by increasing physical activity. The aim of this study is therefore, to study the effects on pain and functional capacity of a therapeutic exercise training program in an adult people sample. The therapeutic exercise machines proposed in this trial have not been previously analyzed and provide insight into this field due to their design. The design of this new machines allows the adaptation to each concrete clinical situation by the adjustment of different parameters such as feedback, range of movement, time of repetition, intensity, speed and rhythm, which facilitate motor control training.</brief_summary>
