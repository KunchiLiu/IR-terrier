	<brief_summary>Epidemiological data suggest, that not only sugar-based, but also artificially sweetened soft drinks may play a role in the development of diabetes. Recent studies in animals and humans have shown, that artificial sweeteners (AS) influence metabolic responses after glucose ingestion, possibly alter the intestinal microbiome and even modulate incretin release. Data on human subjects are sparse and controversial, especially in a long-term manner. We therefore conduct a cross-over study to assess metabolic response to sweetened vs. non-sweetened soft drinks, which are consumed over a period of 4 weeks.</brief_summary>

Metabolic assessment will be based on oral glucose tolerance tests.</detailed_description>
