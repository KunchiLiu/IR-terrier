	<brief_summary>The study is a non-randomized, multi-center safety and feasibility trial of Aneufix ACP-T5 to treat patients with Isolated type II endoleak in the presence of a non-shrinking AAA sac following an EVAR procedure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Study of ANEUFIX: a Novel Approach to Treat Type II Endoleaks Using ACP-T5</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigational device is called Aneufix, more specifically the model ACP-T5, which is a product treating the endoleak by blockage of backflowing blood vessels, i.e. by filling the 'endoleak void and nidus of feeding artery and exit of existing draining arteries'.</detailed_description>

	<mesh_term>Endoleak</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Persistent type IIa or IIb endoleak (more than 6 months postEVAR or postembolization procedure); AND 2. Volume of the 'endoleak void' can be determined upfront; AND 3. An EVAR without circulatory complications; AND 4. An endoleak confirmed by CT scan in preceding 6 weeks demonstrating the high likelihood of the isolated nature of the endoleak; AND 5. An aneurysm sac either growing in contours after EVAR (per European Guidelines) or being stable in size (nonshrinking sac) as documented in the preceding 6 weeks by means of echo (or alternative visualization technique); AND 6. An aneurysm sac that can be punctured in translumbar approach ; AND 7. Possibility to withhold antithrombogenic medication temporarily; AND 8. Ability and willingness to undergo the translumbar procedure under local anesthesia in a CT scan; AND 9. Be older than 45 years. 1. Patient not able or willing to give written Informed Consent; OR 2. Patient undergoing emergency procedures; OR 3. Patient with traumatic vascular injury; OR 4. Patient with hemostatic disorder or who is clinically unstable; OR 5. Patient with a too high risk of abdominal sac rupture to allow safe radiological and scanographic assessments; OR 6. Patient who is allergic to contrast media or anticoagulants; OR 7. Patient with renal impairment (serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl or &gt; 176 mmol/l); OR 8. Patient who is participating in another trial with an investigational drug or medical device; OR 9. Patient with a life expectancy of less than 12 months.</criteria>
