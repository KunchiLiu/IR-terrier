	<brief_summary>The aim of this clinical study is to asses the effect of ultrasonic periodontal debridement associated to locally delivered doxycycline (20%) by PLGA microspheres on chronic generalized periodontitis treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Locally Delivered Doxycycline Adjunct to Nonsurgical Periodontal Therapy.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty patients with chronic periodontitis and a minimum of seven pockets (&gt;5 mm) in non-molars teeth that bled on probing will be selected. Patients will be randomly assigned to ultrasonic periodontal debridement followed by local application of doxycycline by PLGA microspheres (DB+DOX) and periodontal debridement followed by administration of void PLGA microspheres (DB). Plaque, bleeding on probe, clinical attachment level (CAL), and probing depth (PD) will be recorded at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Subgingival biofilm samples will be collected from initially moderate (5 to 6 mm) and deep (â‰¥7 mm) pockets at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months. Polimerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis will be used to detect the frequency of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Tannerella forsythia (Tf), Treponema denticola (Td), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), and Prevotella intermedia (Pi).</detailed_description>
