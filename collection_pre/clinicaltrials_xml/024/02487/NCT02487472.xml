	<brief_title>Burden of Herpes Zoster and Post-herpetic Neuralgia Among People ≥ 50 Years Old in France</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- An observational, prospective cohort study of patients ≥ 50 years old with a Herpes Zoster (HZ) diagnosis, carried out by a national random sample of community first line practitioners concerned by HZ diagnosis: general practitioners, dermatologists and ophthalmologists. - All patients ≥ 50 years old with a HZ diagnosis (as the primary diagnoses and without history of previous HZ) during approximately 6 months inclusion period will be included in the HZ cohort, until total study target is achieved. - All Patients of the HZ cohort presenting a Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) 3 months after onset of the HZ rash onset will be included secondarily in the PHN cohort - Patients of the HZ cohort will be followed-up for 3 months (i.e. 1 and 3 months after HZ rash onset) and patients of the PHN cohort will be followed-up for additional 6 months (i.e., 6 and 9 months after HZ rash onset) using phone interviews with a nurse. - 250 cases of HZ and 40 cases of PHN are expected, with the hypothesis of 16% of PHN 3 months after HZ rash onset.</detailed_description>
