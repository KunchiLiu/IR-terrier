	<brief_summary>For many years, the treatment of jaundice due to head pancreatic adenocarcinoma is based on the endoscopic biliary stent. This technique has been shown to be preferable to a surgical shunt. Recently, adjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX regimen (clinical trial) has revolutionized the treatment of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma increasing overall survival in a major way. This design will also be developed in patients with neoadjuvant tumor called "borderline" (the limit of the resectability). However, several conditions (protocol) are required to consider the implementation of this design : age ≤ 75 years, PS 0 or 1, good hematological parameters and bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the ULN. In addition, a randomized study showed that preoperative biliary stent treatment, despite a success rate of 94%, is associated with more complications than surgery fast (related gesture bladder). It would be interesting to analyze, prospectively, the fate of a series of patients with cancer of the pancreatic head with compression of the lower part of the bile duct, PS 0 or 1 and for which the only limit to FOLFIRINOX design is jaundice or high risk of jaundice.</brief_summary>
