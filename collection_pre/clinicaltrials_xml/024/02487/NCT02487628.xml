	<brief_title>Evaluation of HQ® Matrix Soft Tissue Mesh for the Treatment of Inguinal Hernia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HQ® Matrix Soft Tissue Mesh is a warp-knitted, multifilament, bioengineered scaffold which is comprised of the silk fibroin protein of the Bombyx mori (B. mori) silkworm. The porous network structure makes it soft and pliable and convenient to implant. The mesh is mechanically strong, biocompatible, and long-term bioresorbable. The pore size is suitable for macrophage migration and recruitment, which hinders bacteria growth. The mesh is provided in single sheets of varying widths and lengths and may be cut to the shape or size desired for a specific application. It is sterile and for single-patient use only. ULTRAPRO® Partially Absorbable Lightweight Mesh (Ethicon, Inc.) is manufactured from approximately equal parts of absorbable poliglecaprone-25 monofilament fiber and non-absorbable polypropylene monofilament fiber. Designed for open and laparoscopic hernia repairs, it allows surgeons the versatility to perform various hernia repairs with a single technology. It offers excellent strength with minimal foreign body mass, to allow patients to heal more naturally with increased comfort and mobility.</detailed_description>
