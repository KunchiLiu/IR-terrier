	<brief_summary>The study evaluates the gene-environment interaction of the COMT-genotype on the effects of the phytocannabinoids delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol or a combination of both on induction of psychotic symptoms, endocannabinoid levels in human body fluids, neuronal processing, and neural oscillations. In addition the effects of the phytocannabinoids on lipid levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid, cognition, neural synchrony and neuronal processing assessed by EEG and fMRI.</brief_summary>
