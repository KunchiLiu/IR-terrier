	<brief_summary>The needle stimulation pad is a self-care device, which has been promoted for pain control and well-being. The aim of the study was to test the efficacy of the pad for chronic/recurrent low back pain treatment. Patients with non-specific chronic or recurrent low back pain were selected from a large health insurance company database and advised to use the pad daily for two weeks; outcomes were assessed at baseline, weeks 2 and 14. Primary outcome measure was pain intensity at week 2; secondary outcome measures included the Oswestry disability index (ODI), health-related quality of life (SF-36), the fear avoidance beliefs questionnaire (FABQ), analgesic medication consumption and safety.</brief_summary>
