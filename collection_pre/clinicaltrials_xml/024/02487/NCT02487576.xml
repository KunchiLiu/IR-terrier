	<brief_title>The CLOCK Study - A Human Dietary Intervention Study on Peripheral Circadian Clocks and Energy Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this cross-over study, healthy male participants are randomly allocated to one of two study groups: In study group (A) participants consume isocaloric carbohydrate-rich meals (65% Carbohydrates; 20% Fat; 15% Protein) in the morning and fat-rich meals (35% Carbohydrate; 50% Fat; 15% Protein) in the evening for four weeks. After a washout-phase participants consume isocaloric fat-rich meals in the morning and carbohydrate-rich meals in the evening for another four weeks. Study group (B) receives the same interventions in the reversed order.</detailed_description>
