	<brief_summary>Inflammation and oxidative stress are common findings in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) undergoing conservative treatment, in addition to being associated with atherosclerotic process, are related also to the progression of CKD. In this regard, resveratrol, a phenolic compound with recognized antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, can play an important role in the control of metabolic disorders associated with CKD, since it can modulate the mechanisms involved in inflammation and oxidative stress cycle. Resveratrol is capable of promoting the activation of the transcription-related factor-2 nuclear factor erythroid factor 2 (Nrf2) , a nuclear factor with anti-inflammatory properties, and SIRT-1, a protein also associated with the reduction of inflammation. These two factors, in their turn, are able to inhibit / antagonize the activity of the nuclear factor ÎºB (NF-kB), a transcription factor that participates in the inflammatory response. Although it is a promising treatment, there are no studies evaluating the effects of resveratrol supplementation in patients with CKD. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the effects of resveratrol supplementation on inflammation and oxidative stress in patients undergoing conservative treatment of CKD.</brief_summary>
