	<brief_title>Physician Coaching to Reduce Opioid-related Harms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project addresses the urgent need to promote the adoption of evidence-based practices in healthcare by pilot-testing an innovative implementation strategy. The implementation strategy aims primarily to reduce variation in opioid prescribing practices for chronic pain in primary care settings. The standard approach to improving medical practice involves groups of clinical experts reviewing the literature to produce clinical guidelines based on scientific evidence, and disseminating those guidelines by publishing them in medical journals. A clinical guideline has been developed for opioid prescribing for chronic non-cancer pain using this type of approach. The implementation strategy for promoting uptake of the guideline in primary care settings tested in this study consists of three innovations: (1) a process for translating clinical guidelines into a checklist-based implementation guide for clinicians, (2) a physician peer coaching model, and (3) implementation support using tools from systems engineering. This project teams the experts who developed the guideline for opioid prescribing with experts in implementation science and primary care to translate the guideline into an actionable, checklist-based implementation guide. If the implementation strategy is effective in this pilot test, it will be used in a larger cluster-randomized trial to test it against other approaches to evidence-based practice adoption.The long-term goal of this research is to improve the adoption of evidence-based practices in primary care by producing a generalizable model of change.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>At each of the 4 coaching intervention sites, we aim to recruit between 37 clinical care providers with prescribing authority (e.g., primary care physicians, midlevel practitioners, etc.) to participate in interviews and focus groups. All clinic staff (e.g., medical assistants, office staff) are welcome to participate in coaching site visits and follow up correspondence, but only staff with prescribing authority will be considered research participants. Residents will be excluded.</criteria>
