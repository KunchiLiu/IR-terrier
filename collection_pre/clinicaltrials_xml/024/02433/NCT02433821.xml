	<brief_summary>The neck pain comes from disturbances related to the cervical spine, of multifactorial origin and is considered a frequent problem of disability. Pilates is a physical conditioning method that has been widely used to improve posture and develop body awareness. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of the Pilates method in the control of pain, function and quality of life in patients with chronic mechanical neck pain. Methods: 64 patients with chronic mechanical neck pain will be selected and randomized into two groups: intervention and control. Both groups will be assessed for pain, function, quality of life and medication intake. The intervention group will hold Pilates sessions for three months, with two sessions per week. The control group will continue with the usual drug treatment. Both groups will be instructed to use 750mg acetaminophen every 6 hours if there is pain, but consumption of the drug will be controlled. Although the symptoms of neck pain are common in the population, no study has investigated the effects of the Pilates method as a possible treatment for neck pain. The hypothesis is that the Pilates method can offer benefits to these patients.</brief_summary>
