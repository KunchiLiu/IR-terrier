	<brief_title>RESponders and QUadripolar LV Lead in CRT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is limited by a high proportion of non-responders. Pacing activation from proximal area with a left quadripolar lead might improve the depolarization pattern. To explore the effect of CRT pacing on cardiac activity, the investigators will enroll approximately 180 patients who already underwent CRT-D implantation with a quadripolar LV lead. After implant, as clinical practice, the device will be programmed with distal LV pacing configuration, after 6 months in patient non-responders to CRT therapy the pacing configuration will be changed (proximal configuration). After 12 months in patients non-responders will be changed the pacing configuration again, choosing, if it is possible, a multi point pacing (pacing activation from multiple separated left ventricular (LV) sites).</detailed_description>
