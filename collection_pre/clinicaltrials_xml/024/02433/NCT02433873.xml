	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of an IMO nutritional supplement on gut microbiome, gut health, and body weight. Two formulations of the supplement will be evaluated; thus, there will be three study arms: Supplement A, Supplement B, and placebo. Stool samples will be analyzed for bacterial DNA. The gut bacterial DNA, body weight, and gut health data will be compared across supplement and placebo groups. Primary Aim 1: To evaluate the effect of the IMO supplement on gut bacterial abundance, diversity, and gene function across intervention and placebo groups, and across two doses of the intervention. Secondary Aim 1: To evaluate the effect of the IMO supplement on gut health across intervention and placebo groups, and across two doses of the intervention. Secondary Aim 2: To evaluate the effect of the IMO supplement on body weight across intervention and placebo groups, and across two doses of the intervention. 60 subjects, randomized to three arms (20 each: Supplement formula A, Supplement formula B or placebo) will take a daily dose of Supplement A, Supplement B, or placebo for 8 weeks. The supplement is a light syrup liquid. Ingredients that are in the supplement are: isomalto-oligosaccharide, water, mannitol, maltose, glucose, and glycerol. Ingredients that are in the placebo are: high maltose corn syrup (Satin Sweet™), water, and mannitol. Dose will be 500 mg during the first 4 weeks and then 1000 mg for second 4 weeks. Subjects will be instructed to take 500 mg/day of the supplement or placebo the first four weeks and 1000 mg/day of the supplement or placebo for the second four weeks. Subjects will be blinded as to whether they are receiving placebo or supplement. After screening and once enrolled, subject involvement includes visits to George Mason University, being weighed, dropping off stool samples, and completing a survey on gut health. Stool samples will be analyzed for bacterial DNA. The gut bacterial DNA, weight, and gut health data will be compared across supplement and placebo groups.</brief_summary>
