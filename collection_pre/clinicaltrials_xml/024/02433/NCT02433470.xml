	<brief_summary>In the study the investigators aim to test whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)-induced pain reduction is in association with functional changes in the brain measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Hypothesis: Transcranial direct current stimulation can reduce the perception of pain in patients with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, which is in association with changes in the brain measured via MRI.</brief_summary>
