	<brief_summary>The key aims of the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Cohort-Study (SMSC) are 1. To maintain a long-term cohort (&gt;10 years) representative of the MS population currently living in Switzerland. This requires effective measures to limit drop-outs and the continuous recruitment of MS patients and 2. To conduct a systematic follow-up with standardized, high quality collection of clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, as well as body fluids. The significant heterogeneity within the diagnostic entity and phenotype of multiple sclerosis (MS) is incompletely understood. A central and necessary prerequisite of further advance is a sufficient amount of high quality clinical and paraclinical (imaging, body fluids) patient data. Nested projects will address specific research topics, and facilitate collaboration of the most qualified investigators within the group of SMSC investigators. The nested projects will focus on the: 1. Development and validation of diagnostic and prognostic markers of spontaneous disease evolution and therapeutic response. 2. Exploration of the safety and impact on long-term disability of existing and next generation MS treatments 3. Individualized therapy: A number of highly active but potentially also harmful therapies have lately been established for the treatment of MS. To date, due to the lack of individual prognostic markers patients may not receive aggressive therapy due to safety concerns, or patients with benign disease may receive expensive and potentially harmful treatments without the need for it.</brief_summary>
