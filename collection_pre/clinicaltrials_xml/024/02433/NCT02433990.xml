	<brief_title>Risk Factors for Acquired Cardiovascular Disease in Adults With Congenital Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advances in surgical and clinical management of patients with congenital heart disease has made survival to adulthood an expectation. Today there are more than 1 million adult survivors of congenital heart disease, but increasing age brings additional concerns for this patient population. Although the literature remains scarce, existing evidence suggests that inactivity, obesity, diabetes, cancer, and acquired cardiovascular disease may be at least as prevalent in patients with congenital heart disease, if not more so, than in an age-matched general population. Acquired cardiovascular disease is likely to impact substantially on long-term survival and quality of life in these patients with palliated and already fragile hearts. This research study is to determine the risk factors for acquired heart disease, in adults with congenital heart disease. This knowledge is important to develop and target ways to prevent or delay the onset of acquired heart disease in adults with congenital heart disease.</detailed_description>
