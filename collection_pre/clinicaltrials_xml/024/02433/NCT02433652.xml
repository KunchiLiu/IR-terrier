	<brief_summary>Infection with dengue viruses is the leading cause of hospitalization and death in children in many tropical Asian countries, and the development of a dengue vaccine is a top health priority. This study will evaluate the ability of a single dose of a trivalent dengue vaccine to protect against infection with an attenuated candidate DENV-2 vaccine, administered 6 months after the trivalent dengue vaccine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating the Safety and Protective Efficacy of a Single Dose of a Trivalent Live Attenuated Dengue Vaccine to Protect Against Infection With DENV-2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are 4 types of dengue virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4), each capable of causing dengue illness ranging from a mild illness to life-threatening disease. This study will evaluate a trivalent live attenuated dengue admixture vaccine that contains 3 different monovalent dengue vaccine candidates, representing 3 of the 4 dengue serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-3, and DENV-4). Study researchers will evaluate the safety and protective efficacy of a single dose of the trivalent dengue vaccine against viremia and rash induced by infection with an attenuated DENV-2 virus (rDEN2Δ30-7169), administered 6 months after the trivalent dengue vaccine. This study will enroll healthy adults with no history of previous flavivirus infection. At Day 0 (study entry), participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the trivalent dengue vaccine admixture or placebo. On Day 180, all participants will receive the rDEN2Δ30-7169 vaccine. Study visits will occur on Days 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 21, 28, 56, 90, 150, 180, 184, 186, 188, 190, 192, 194, 196, 201, 208, 236, 270, and 360. Visits will include physical examinations and blood collection. All participants will record their temperature 3 times a day for 16 days after each vaccination.</detailed_description>

Reliable methods of contraception include: hormonal birth control, condoms with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, surgical sterilization, intrauterine device, abstinence (6 months or longer since last sexual encounter). All female participants will be considered having childbearing potential except for those with hysterectomy, tubal ligation, tubal coil (at least 3 months prior to vaccination), or postmenopausal status documented as at least 1 year since last menstrual period. Exclusion Criteria for Second Vaccine: Anaphylaxis or angioedema following the first dose of vaccine Females only: Currently pregnant, as determined by positive betaHCG test or breastfeeding Evidence of clinically significant neurologic, cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, rheumatologic, autoimmune, or renal disease by history, physical examination, and/or laboratory studies Behavioral, cognitive, psychiatric disease that in the opinion of the investigator affects the ability of the participant to understand and cooperate with the requirements of the study protocol Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator would jeopardize the safety or rights of a participant to understand and cooperate with the requirements of the study protocol Any significant alcohol or drug abuse in the past 12 months that has caused medical, occupational, or family problems, as indicated by participant history History of a severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis Severe asthma (emergency room visit or hospitalization within the last 6 months) HIV infection, by screening and confirmatory assays HCV infection, by screening and confirmatory assays HBV infection, by HBsAg screening Any known immunodeficiency syndrome Use of anticoagulant medications Use of corticosteroids (excluding topical or nasal) or immunosuppressive drugs within 28 days prior to or following inoculation.
