Able to receive the first dose of rivipansel within 24 hours from administration of the first dose of IV opioids for this hospitalization. Non compliance with study procedures in the double blind study (B5201002). Occurrence of any severe and/or generalized cutaneous manifestation or any other adverse event during participation in Study B5201002 that was related to study drug and which would therefore make it inappropriate for the subject to receive rivipansel in the current study. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results. Clinically significant deterioration in renal function in Study B5201002. Pregnant female subjects, breastfeeding female subjects and male and female subjects of childbearing potential who are unwilling or unable to use a highly effective method of contraception.
