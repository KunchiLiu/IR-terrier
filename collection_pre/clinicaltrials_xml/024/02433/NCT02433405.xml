	<detailed_description>The study population consisted totally 60 subjects consulted to Bulent Ecevit University, Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Periodontology whose age and sex were matched. According to study design, subjects were divided into three groups based on their periodontal parameters. Patients suffering from chronic periodontitis formed the group 1 (n: 20), patients with plaque induced gingivitis formed the group 2 (n:20) and periodontal healthy patients were inserted in group 3 (n:20). After gently drying the area, GCF was sampled with filter paper using the intracrevicular method (Periopaper, ProFlow, Inc., Amityville, New York, USA).Two milliliters (ml) of peripheral blood was collected from each individual with sterile syringe from the antecubital fossa by venipuncture, and to separate serum component sample centrifuged at 3000g for 5 min, and immediately stored at −40°C until assayed. The quantity of Fetuin-A and SAA protein concentration in the samples were analyzed by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) procedures using commercially available kits. The Spearman's rank correlation test was used to detect the relationship between GCF and serum SAA and Fetuin-A with GI and CAL. All tests were performed using statistical software (SPSS Inc., version 22.0, Chicago, IL, USA). The mean ± standard deviation with mean rank values were calculated for each parameter, based on the patients as the statistical unit. P &lt; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</detailed_description>
