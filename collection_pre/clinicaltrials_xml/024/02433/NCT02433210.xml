	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to confirm the safety and clinical effectiveness of Nipro ELISIO-15H and to compare its performance characteristics and hemocompatibility with those of the commercially available dialyzers in U.S.A., Gambro Polyflux Revaclear and Fresenius F160NRe. 10 stable patients will be dialyzed 3 times/week with each dialyzer over 3 weeks. Blood samples for several parameters will be collected during hemodialysis to assess the performance and hemocompatibility of the dialyzers under study. Data thus collected will be analyzed for comparison by standard statistical analysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Study Comparing Basic Performance and Hemocompatibility of 3 Different Dialyzers in Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current patients receiving dialysis treatment for end stage renal disease and who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be entered into the study. These patients will continue on their standard dialysis regimen as stated in the clinics Standard Operating Procedures. Each patient will be studied for three weeks with each week starting with a dialyzer of a different manufacture but of comparable characteristics. Solute clearances and removal will be determined at each of the three dialysis sessions during the week. During session 2 of each week additional specimens will be taken to analyze for hemocompatibility. At the end of the study all clearances and the hemocompatibility markers for each dialyzer will be compared to one another as well as to the manufactures stated characteristics. Blood for the clearance and removal calculations will be taken at time 0, 60 minutes and 240 minutes. Blood for the hemocompatibility determinations will be taken at time 0, 15, 30, 60 and 240 minutes. Flow rates, anticoagulant therapy, erythropoietin therapy, venous and arterial pressures will also be recorded.</detailed_description>
