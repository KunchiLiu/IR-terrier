	<brief_title>Phase I Clinical Safety Study About Human Umbilical Cord Blood Monocyte in the Acute Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will use Umbilical Cord Blood cells (a special kind of cell that is believed to be a stem cell) isolated from UCB (blood obtained at birth from the umbilical cord blood of babies). StemCyte, a leading accredited UCB banking company with branches in the United States and Taiwan, will provide the units of UCB that match at least 6 out of 6 HLA (human leukocyte antigens) for transplantation. The HLA-matching is the same as that used to match cells and organs for transplantation so that the body does not reject the cells. Then cells injection by Intravenous in acute ischemic stroke patients.</detailed_description>
