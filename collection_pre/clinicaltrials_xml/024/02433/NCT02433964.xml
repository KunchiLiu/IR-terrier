	<brief_title>Evaluation of Therapeutic Effects of LED (627 +/- 10nm) The Initial Phase of the Ankle Sprains Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A variety of therapies for the treatment of sprains has emerged as they occur advances in technological applications. Therapy with coherent and non-coherent light is a treatment modality for a variety of musculoskeletal injuries. The main benefits certificates for phototherapy are the reduction of nociceptive processes, tissue remodeling, among others. The aim of the present paper is to analyze the changes caused by the use of LED (627 +/- 10 nm) with an energy density of 10 J / cm2 in 40 subjects divided into two groups (placebo and LED). All volunteers participating in this study had ankle inversion sprain grade II treated with the price technique. The study was performed in six days. And the results were verified by review of all individuals, through the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of pain, McGill Pain Questionnaire and Titrimetry. Measurements were performed at first, third and sixth day's of treatment.</detailed_description>
