	<brief_summary>Prospective, multi-center, single-arm, non-interventional and open-label registry. The purpose of the registry is to document use of Phased Radio Frequency Ablation (hereafter "Phased RFA") System in a real world patient population with atrial fibrillation and evaulate its performance. Gold AF will enroll a minimum of 1,000 patients who undergo Phased RFA in approximately 38 sites in Western, Central Europe, Israel and South Korea.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Postmarket Evaluation of the Phased Radio Frequency Ablation System (GOLD AF Registry)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This registry will collect data prospectively on patients with paroxysmal, persistent and longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation (hereafter "AF") undergoing Phased RFA treatment. Phased RFA will be applied according to the 'Intended Use' in CE mark release and product packaging. The treatment will be performed according to routine hospital practice and no additional tests are required specific to the registry. This registry will serve as a tool to collect clinical data in order to expand the knowledge base of safety, effectiveness and functionality of the Medtronic Phased RFA System in a real world patient population. The key measures collected for the patients will be inclusive of, but are not limited to, clinical data pertaining to AF and individual disease state(s) characterized by form of AF and underline diseases, Phased RFA procedure details including timing and catheters in use, procedure and system related adverse events, AF recurrence, re-ablations and left atrial flutter rate after the index Phased RFA procedure. Additionally, this study will provide further information in the evolving anticoagulation strategies (e.g. continuous versus bridging and vitamin K antagonist versus novel oral anticoagulants) in the setting of AF ablations. Patients will be followed minimum for 12 months and maximum for 14 months after the Phased RFA ablation procedure. The twelve month follow-up can be done by telephone if it is not standard of care in the hospital's practice. During the twelve month follow-up patients will be interviewed with a quality of life questionnaire and results will be compared to the quality of life questionaire completed before the procedure.</detailed_description>
