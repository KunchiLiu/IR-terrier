	<brief_summary>This study will examine the hypothesis that in obese asthmatics with metabolic syndrome; treatment with NOx + CLA is well tolerated, safe and will increase eNO while reducing airway oxidative stress. Allied with this, the investigators will define whether supplementing with this bioactive mediator modifies the airway microbiome, and reduces airway inflammation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of NOx and Conjugated Linoleic Acid on Asthmatics With the Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity is an asthma comorbidity associated with increased severity, poor control, reduced steroid responsiveness and greater exacerbation and healthcare utilization rates. These associations are not explained by having a greater degree of Th-2 inflammation. Rather, the obese asthma phenotype defined in several cluster studies, has paradoxically reduced levels of Th-2 biomarkers, including sputum eosinophils and exhaled nitric oxide (NO). The investigators previous research has shown that the inverse relation between increased body mass index (BMI) and reduced exhaled NO, may be explained by a metabolic imbalance characterized by lower L-arginine and greater asymmetric di-methyl arginine (ADMA) levels. Having a low L-arginine/ADMA ratio has been shown to inhibit and uncouple all isoforms of nitric oxidase synthase (NOS), thereby reducing NO bioavailability and promoting oxidative stress through enhanced superoxide production. In obese asthmatics, this imbalance not only correlates with exhaled NO, but also with lower FEV1% and poorer asthma-related quality of life. Yet the effect of obesity in asthma is unlikely to be solely dependent on a single mechanism. Other factors, such as increased Th1 and Th-17-mediated inflammation have been shown to occur in human and animal models. Given all of these potential avenues, it is imperative that an intervention is sufficiently pleiotropic that can, in addition to restoring airway NO levels, also reduce other obesity-related non-Th2 mechanism of inflammation. The investigators hypothesize that treatment with conjugated linolenic acid (CLA) + nitrate and nitrite (together known as NOx), will restore NO airway bioavailability, reduce oxidative stress and improve airway inflammation in obese asthmatics. To test this hypothesis, the investigators propose a phase II pilot study in which obese asthmatics with metabolic syndrome, will be treated orally with CLA+NOx for 12 weeks, in an open label study design to assess pre to post-intervention changes in airway and systemic biomarkers, and to determine the effects on lung function and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Participants will undergo a pre and post intervention bronchoscopy. The results obtained from this project will be greatly informative to our understanding of the obese - asthma pathophysiology and for the development of clinical trials to determine the potential benefit of this intervention in improving health outcomes.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adequate completion of informed consent process with written documentation Male and female patients, ≥ 18 65 yrs old Diagnosis of asthma: based on previous physician diagnosis and either baseline prebronchodilator FEV1 50% or greater predicted with a 12% or greater bronchodilator response to 4 puffs of albuterol or PC20 methacholine (16 mg) if no BD response. Spirometry results within the prior 24 months located in the subject's medical records can be used to determine eligibility, if available. All racial/ethnic backgrounds with a diagnosis of asthma for ≥6 months 12 subjects will need to meet the criteria for metabolic syndrome diagnosis based on having at least any three of: a) Triglycerides (≥150 mg/dl), b) HDL ≤ 50 mg/dl, c) diagnosis of diabetes, or on diabetes medication, or fasting blood glucose ≥ 100 mg/dl, d) waist circumference (≥40 inches males,≥ 35 inches females) e) diagnosis of hypertension, or on antihypertensive medication, or two consecutive blood pressure readings of ≥ 130/88 within 14 days obtained by a health care provider, or documented on home blood pressure monitor. 8 subjects will not need to meet this criteria for metabolic syndrome. Smoking history ≤10 pack years and no smoking in the last year BMI ≥ 30 ICS therapy 30 days on a stable dose (up to 1,000 mcg daily fluticasone equivalent) Asthma diagnosed at age 9 or later Respiratory tract infection within the last 4 weeks Oral or systemic CS burst within the last 4 weeks Asthmarelated hospitalization within the last 2 months Asthmarelated ER visit within the previous 4 weeks Significant or uncontrolled concomitant medical illness including (but not limited to) heart disease, cancer, diabetes Chronic renal failure (creatinine &gt; 2.0) at screening (Associated with higher ADMA levels) Current statins use (statins lower ADMA levels), patients may stop and reenroll after 2 weeks of stopping statins Positive pregnancy test Intolerance or allergy to the intervention drugs Current or recent (within 30 days) in an investigational treatment study. Unable or unlikely to complete study assessments or the study intervention (i.e. bronchoscopy) poses undue risk to patient in the opinion of the Investigator. Any kind of oral nitrates such as nitroglycerin or already taking supplements History of ICU admission/intubation due to asthma in the past year; More than three systemic corticosteroid requiring asthma exacerbations in the past year Systemic steroid dependent asthma (no daily oral steroids short term therapy for asthma exacerbation is permitted) Use of mouthwash containing chlorhexidine (lowers NO) within 1 week prior to screening and throughout the study Untreated sleep apnea Hgb A1C ≥7 Daily use of PPI's (Proton Pump Inhibitor) or H2 Blockers for GERD (it is permitted to take on an occasional basis no more than 1x per week. If participants wash out of these meds for 1 week, they can enroll)</criteria>
