	<brief_summary>In this study, up to 20 healthy individuals, 20 endo-ACAB patients, and 20 CABG patients undergo a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test after hospital discharge (for patients only). Exercise tolerance is compared between groups.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this prospective observational study, up to 20 healthy individuals (no history or presence of any chronic disease, sedentary), 20 endo-ACAB patients, and 20 CABG patients (matched for age, gender and BMI) undergo a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test after hospital discharge (for patients only).During this exercise test, following parameters are assessed at peak effort and at the second ventilatory threshold (determined by VE/VCO2 slope method): oxygen uptake (VO2), oxygen saturation (SaO2), carbon dioxide output (VCO2), resoiratory gas exchange ratio (RER), expiratory volume (VE), ventilatory equivalent for VCO2 (VE/VCO2), ventilatory equivalent for VO2 (VE/VO2), end-tidal O2 pressure (PETO2), end-tidal CO2 pressure (PETCO2), heart rate (HR), oxygen pulse (VO2/HR), cycling power output (W), tidal volume (Vt), respiratory rate (RR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), rate pressure product (RPP). Peak exercise effort is validated by RERpeak.</detailed_description>
