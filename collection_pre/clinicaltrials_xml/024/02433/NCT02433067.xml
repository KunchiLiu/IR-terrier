	<brief_title>Physical Activity Intervention on Myocardial Function in Patients With HER2 + Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective: To evaluate in patients with HER2 + breast cancer, treated only by trastuzumab, the impact of three months individualized physical activity intervention (45 minutes, 3 times per week) on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Secondary objectives: To evaluate the impact of physical activity intervention on body composition, muscle function, metabolic, hormonal and inflammatory responses, pain, fatigue and quality of life. This study examines patients aged 18 to 65 years, diagnosed with early breast cancer with HER2 overexpression confirmed histologically and eligible to receive treatment with trastuzumab (adjuvant). This study includes 3 assessments phases: baseline (T0), 3 months (T3) and 6 months (T6) for both arms. The programme is organised as follows: Arm A "standard oncologic care coupled with physical activity intervention (3 times / week) " for 3 months ; Arm B (control group) "standard oncologic care". Between T3 and T6, volontary physical activity level will follow by actimetry.</detailed_description>
