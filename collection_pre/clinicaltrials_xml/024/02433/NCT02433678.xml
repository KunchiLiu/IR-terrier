	<brief_title>An Investigation Into The Anti-hypertensive And Potential Anti-inflammatory Actions Of Dapagliflozin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two groups of 26 patients each (total 52 patients) with type 2 diabetes on oral agents will be included in the study. One group will be randomized to dapagliflozin (a dose of 5 mg daily will be titrated to 10 mg daily during the first week) while the other will be placebo. The patients will be treated for 12 weeks. Only half the patients (equal numbers in both groups) will be tested for the secondary endpoints related to postprandial and single dose induced changes. The primary endpoint of the study is to detect a significant difference in the percent change in fasting Nuclear factor-k B (NFκB) activation (DNA binding activity) in mononuclear cells (MNC) before and after dapagliflozin use (0 week vs. 12 weeks) as compared to placebo.</detailed_description>

Patients will be evenly distributed between the 2 groups based on statins, ARBs, TZDs and ACE inhibitors use. HbA1c ≤ 8.0% Use of GLP1 agonists or DPPIV or SGLT2 inhibitors therapy in the last 3 months. Risk for pancreatitis, i.e., history of gallstones, alcohol abuse, and hypertriglyceridemia. Coronary event or procedure (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass, surgery or coronary angioplasty) in the previous 3 months. Hepatic disease: Severe hepatic insufficiency and/or significant abnormal liver function defined as: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;3x upper limit of normal (ULN) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;3x ULN Total bilirubin &gt;2.0 mg/dL (34.2 µmol/L) Positive serologic evidence of current infectious liver disease including Hepatitis B viral antibody IGM, Hepatitis B surface antigen and Hepatitis C virus antibody (liver function tests more than 3 times the upper limit of normal) Renal impairment (serum eGFR &lt;60 ml/min) Any other lifethreatening, noncardiac disease Uncontrolled hypertension (BP &gt; 160/100 mm of Hg) Congestive Heart Failure class III or IV. Use of an investigational agent or therapeutic regimen within 30 days of study Participation in any other concurrent clinical trial pregnant or breastfeeding patients Volume depleted patients. Patients at risk for volume depletion due to coexisting conditions or concomitant medications, such as loop diuretics</criteria>
