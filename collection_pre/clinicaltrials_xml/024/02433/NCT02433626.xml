	<brief_summary>Activity of COTI-2 has been demonstrated in the OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer tumor model. With its p53- and AKT-based mechanisms of action, COTI-2 is anticipated to be highly relevant in treatment of patients with gynecologic malignancies. This study is designed primarily to assess the safety and tolerability of COTI-2 in patients with advanced and recurrent gynecologic and head and neck malignancies and to establish a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for future studies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Coti-2 for the Treatment of Advanced or Recurrent Gynecologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single arm, single center, open-label, Phase 1, first time in human study of COTI-2 in patients with recurrent ovarian,fallopian tube,primary peritoneal cancer, endometrial, cervical or head and neck cancer. COTI-2 will be self-administered as a single agent, orally, once daily for 5 days followed by 2 treatment-free days each week.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1. ≥18 years of age. 2. Willing and able to provide written informed consent to participate in this investigational study. 3. Cancer that is recurrent, metastatic, or unresectable and for which no effective or curative measures exist. Part 1: Ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal, endometrial, or cervical cancer Part 2: Ovarian or HNSCC, with histologically confirmed p53 mutations 4. Ability to attend all scheduled study visits 5. Measurable disease by physical examination or imaging as defined by RECIST v1.1 criteria or evaluable disease as defined by Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) CA125 criteria. 6. European Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1. 7. Life expectancy ≥3 months. 8. Adequate bone marrow, liver, renal, and cardiac function at study entry, assessed as follows: Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL; Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5 x 109/L; Platelet count ≥100 x 109/L; Prothrombin time (PT) or international normalize rate (INR) within normal limits; Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) within normal limits; Total bilirubin within normal limits; Alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) within normal limits; Calculated creatinine clearance &gt;50 mL/min; Urine protein &lt;500 mg or urine protein: creatinine ratio (UPC) &lt;1.0; and Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥55% (or the institutional lower limit of normal [LLN]) as evidenced on ECHO. 9. Prior chemotherapy, other investigational agents, or radiation must be discontinued for at least 28 days prior to the first administration of COTI2. Hormone treatments must be discontinued for at least 28 days prior to the first administration of COTI2. 10. Toxicity from prior therapy (except alopecia) has resolved to ≤Grade 1; in the event of toxicity that has not resolved to ≤Grade 1 but is considered stable, the patient may be eligible after discussion among the investigator and sponsor's medical monitor. 11. Physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant, postmenopausal, or negative pregnancy test and agree to use adequate contraception (e.g., oral contraceptive, double barrier method, intrauterine device, intramuscular contraceptive). 12. Patients enrolled in the expansion phase must be willing to undergo pre and postCycle 1 biopsies. 13. Patients enrolled in the escalation and expansion phases will be required to have archival tissue available for analysis. 1. Pregnant or lactating. 2. History of other invasive malignancies, with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer or successfully treated in situ carcinoma, if there is evidence of the malignancy being present within the last 3 years. 3. Inability to tolerate oral medications. 4. Any serious and/or unstable preexisting medical, psychiatric, or other condition (e.g., severe hepatic impairment) or current unstable or uncompensated respiratory or cardiac conditions which makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the study or which could jeopardize compliance with the protocol. 5. History of clinically significant or uncontrolled cardiac disease including but not limited to: 1. Myocardial infarction, 2. Angina pectoris, 3. Congestive heart failure of New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade &gt;2, 4. Ventricular arrhythmias requiring continuous therapy, or 5. Supraventricular arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation, which are uncontrolled. 6. Major surgery, excluding skin biopsies and procedures for insertion of central venous access devices, within 28 days prior to the start of COTI2. 7. Active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, fungal, or other opportunistic infection requiring systemic therapy. 8. Part 2: 1. The presence of or imminent occurrence of airway obstruction, unless tracheostomy in place. 2. HPVpositive status ( In HNSCC patients only)</criteria>
