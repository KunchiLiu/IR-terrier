	<brief_summary>Despite improved staging and operative techniques, the rate of incomplete resection (R1) of NSCLC has remained significant over the last decades. Patients with R1 resection have significantly worse survival compared to those with complete resection (R0). This is a phase I study that investigates the feasibility and safety of delivering Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) to patients with locally invasive NSCLC (cT3-4, N0-1) who are at risk for incomplete resection. Twenty patients with NSCLC will be treated with SBRT followed by surgery and appropriate adjuvant therapy. Patients will be divided into groups, of 5 patients each, treated with escalating doses (35, 40, 45 and 50 Gy) in 10 daily fractions. The primary outcome is the feasibility i.e. the ability to complete safely SBRT and surgery (within 6 weeks). Secondary outcomes include acute and late adverse events, R0/R1/R2 rates and secondary surrogates of feasibility. If successful, this study will lead to further evaluation of pre-operative SBRT in NSCLC.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients will be included if they are aged 18 years or older, with biopsy proven NSCLC, clinically staged T3T4 marginally resectable i.e. deemed at risk to achieve &lt;R0 resection (such as invasion of critical mediastinal or hilar structures, nodal extracapsular extension, chest wall, vertebral bodies, compromised bronchial stump margin, based on CT images of the chest). Patients also need to be pathologically staged N01 disease, with an SBRT CTV≤200cm3, based on planning CT images. ECOG status is required to be &lt;2 within 4 weeks prior to registration and patients must be deemed medically operable by the surgical team. Patients will be excluded if they are deemed medically inoperable by the surgical team and have a weight loss of ≥10% within 3 months prior to pathological diagnosis. Patients will also have no absolute contraindication to RT such as connective tissue disease, pacemakerdependent patient with the pacemaker receiving higher than tolerance dose, had no had previous RT to the current region of the study, that would result in overlap of RT fields, patients must have no plans to receive other local therapy while on study, except at disease progression, patients have not had other malignancy within 2 years prior to the study (other than nonmelanomatous skin cancers)</criteria>
