	<criteria>Subjects six (6) months of age and older Subjects who have: Failed to respond to the administration of at least one firstline agent (e.g., benzodiazepine or other emergent initial AED treatment), according to the institution's standard of care, and; Failed to respond to at least one secondline agent (e.g., phenytoin, fosphenytoin, valproate, phenobarbital, levetiracetam or other urgent control AEDs), according to the institution's standard of care, and; Not previously been administered a thirdline agent but have been admitted to an intensive care unit with the intent of administering at least one thirdline agent for at least 24 hours; or who have previously failed zero, one or more wean attempts from thirdline agents and are now on continuous intravenous infusions of one or more thirdline agents and in an EEG burst or seizure suppression pattern; or who have previously failed one or more wean attempts from thirdline agents and are now either not on at least one continuous infusion of a thirdline agent or are on one or more continuous infusions of thirdline agents but not in an EEG burst or seizure suppression pattern. Subjects with SRSE due to anoxic/hypoxic encephalopathy with highly malignant/ malignant EEG features Children (subjects aged less than 18 years) with an encephalopathy due to an underlying progressive neurological disorder Subjects who have any of the following: 1. a GFR low enough to warrant dialysis for whatever reason, but dialysis is not planned or noncontinuous dialysis is planned; 2. severe cardiogenic or vasodilatory shock requiring two or more pressors that is not related to thirdline agent use; 3. fulminant hepatic failure; 4. no reasonable expectation of recovery or lifeexpectancy of less than 30 days.
