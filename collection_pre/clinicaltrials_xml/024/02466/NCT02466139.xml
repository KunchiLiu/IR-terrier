	<brief_summary>The investigators conduct a prospective observational study on consecutive patients being admitted to a tertiary care-centre with infective endocarditis. The investigators' primary aim is to identify baseline clincal, laboratory and microbiological predictors of in-hospital events, mortality and 6-month mortality.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Clinical, Laboratory and Microbiological Predictors of Treatment Outcomes in Infective Endocaridtis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mortality and major complications among infective endocarditis remain high. In addition developing nations are crippled with a high incidence of culture-negative endocarditis and lack of wide availability of transesophageal echocardiography. We intended to identify predictors among admission clinical features, laboratory paramters and culture reports that can help risk stratify patients early in the course of treatment.</detailed_description>
