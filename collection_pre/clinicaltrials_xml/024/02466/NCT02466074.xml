	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate how improved cerebral blood flow affects the way in which newly formed MS lesions evolve into black holes. Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) will be treated with acetazolamide at different doses and obtain MRI to determine how much and in which regions of the brain cerebral perfusion improves.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role of Enhanced Cerebral Perfusion in Lesion Evolution</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cerebral perfusion is altered in many disease states, including MS. Altered perfusion has been seen in patients with all multiple sclerosis (MS) phenotypes and is well established as occurring early in relapsing-remitting disease. There are currently several potent anti-inflammatory medications available to treat patients with MS. All of these disease modifying therapies (DMTs) decrease the potential for new injury to varying degrees. However, despite their anti-inflammatory properties, DMTs are not known to enhance cerebral perfusion. Acetazolamide (ACZ) is a generic medication with a well-established safety and tolerability profile that is known to enhance cerebral perfusion in healthy subjects. This study will utilize various imaging techniques to determine the degree to which cerebral blood flow is improved in MS subjects after administration of ACZ.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Diagnosis of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis using revised McDonald criteria 2. Stable on either subcutaneous glatiramer acetate (Copaxone), interferon beta1b (Betaseron, Extavia), or interferon beta1a (Rebif) or intramuscular interferon beta1a (avonex). The term "stable" implies that the subject has not had change in therapy for any reason for the 12 months prior to study entry. 3. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 06.0 inclusive 4. Understood and signed written informed consent, obtained prior to the study subject undergoing any study related procedure, including screening tests. 1. Known hypersensitivity to sulfonamides or derivatives 2. Known history of renal or hepatic disease, cerebrovascular disease including stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, angina or congestive heart failure. 3. Evidence to suggest hyponatremia or hypokalemia, marked kidney dysfunction defined as creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dL or liver disease dysfunction defined as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than threefold upper limit of normal (ULN). 4. Evidence to suggest suprarenal gland failure. 5. Evidence of hyperchloremic acidosis. 6. Initiation of new immunosuppressant treatment after the subject becomes protocoleligible (except for corticosteroids) or enrollment in a concurrent trial. 7. Prior treatment with mitoxantrone, natalizumab, methotrexate, cladribine cyclophosphamide or other change in disease modifying therapy (DMT) within 6 months of initiation of study. 8. Subjects with any history of cytopenia. 9. History of pulmonary obstruction or emphysema. 10. Active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection or evidence of cirrhosis. 11. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positivity. 12. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus defined as HbA1c&gt;8% and/or requiring intensive management. 13. Uncontrolled viral, fungal, or bacterial infection (excluding asymptomatic bacteriuria). 14. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigators, would jeopardize the ability of the subject to tolerate treatment with ACZ. 15. Prior history of malignancy. 16. Positive pregnancy test or inability or unwillingness to use effective means of birth control. Effective birth control defines as: Refraining from all acts of vaginal intercourse (abstinence) Consistent use of birth control pills Tubal sterilization or male partner who has undergone vasectomy Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) Use, with every act of intercourse, of a diaphragm with contraceptive jelly and/or condoms with contraceptive foam 17. Presence of metallic objects implanted in the body that would preclude the ability of the subject to safely have MRI exams. 18. Psychiatric illness, mental deficiency, or cognitive dysfunction making compliance with treatment of informed consent impossible.</criteria>
