	<brief_summary>Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord and caused by mutations of the survival motor neuron 1 gene (SMN1). The investigators will conduct a systematic review of the contents and activities collected via a comprehensive case report form. Patients who fulfilled diagnostic criteria for SMA type 1 will be reviewed retrospectively.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Natural History of Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1 in Taiwan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to investigate the natural history of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 1 among patients in Taiwan. This study will provide further insights into the clinical course and pathogenesis of SMA. Several analyses will be conducted regarding overall survival, respiratory support, and nutritional support. The following outcome variables will be examined: correlation between SMA genotype and phenotype, survival, Age of onset and confirmed diagnosis, proportion of patients using respiratory support (non-invasive and invasive, reported as combined and separately), time to first use of respiratory support (non-invasive and invasive, reported as combined and separately), proportion of patients on permanent ventilation and time to permanent ventilation, number and average duration of hospitalizations, proportion of patients with gastrostomy, number of non-serious and serious respiratory infections, trend of growth parameter (e.g., weight).</detailed_description>
