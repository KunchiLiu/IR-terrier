	<criteria>1. 18 year of age or greater. 2. Diagnosis of primary open angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT). 3. Unmedicated (postwashout) intraocular pressure (IOP) ≥ 24 mm Hg at 2 eligibility visits (0800 hr), 27 days apart. If both eyes meet the IOP criteria, the eye with the higher IOP at Visit 1 will be designated as the study eye. If IOP in both eyes is the same, the right eye will be designated as the study eye. Note that both eyes will be treated. 4. Corrected visual acuity at Visit 1 in each eye +1.0 logarithm of minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) or better by Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) in each eye (equivalent to 20/200). 5. Able and willing to give signed informed consent and follow study instructions. 6. Subjects must have a documented history of ≥ 20% IOP reduction O.U. using any topical ocular prostaglandin/prostamide ocular hypotensive medication. Ophthalmic 1. Glaucoma: pseudoexfoliation or pigment dispersion component, history of angle closure or narrow angles judged to be occludable by the investigator. Note: Previous laser peripheral iridotomy is NOT acceptable. 2. IOP &gt; 36 mm Hg in either eye at any prerandomization study visit. 3. Known corticosteroidresponder as judged by investigator. 4. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the Investigational Product formulation (benzalkonium chloride, etc.), fluoroquinolone ophthalmic solution, or topical anesthetics, Povidone Iodine antiseptic, or diagnostic eye drops. 5. Previous glaucoma intraocular surgery or glaucoma laser procedures in either eye. 6. Refractive surgery in either eye . 7. Ocular trauma, extraocular or intraocular surgery or laser treatment within the past six months in either eye. 8. Evidence of ocular infection, inflammation, clinically significant blepharitis or conjunctivitis at baseline (Visit 1), or a history of herpes simplex keratitis in either eye. Note: mild blepharitis, allergy and dry eye is acceptable. 9. Ocular medication of any kind within 30 days of Visit 1 in either eye, with the exception of a) ocular hypotensive therapy (which must be washed out according to the provided schedule), b) lid scrubs (which may be used prior to, but not after Visit 1) or c) lubricating drops for dry eye (which may be used throughout the study). 10. Clinically significant ocular disease (e.g. uveitis, severe keratoconjunctivitis sicca) in either eye which might interfere with the study, including glaucomatous damage so severe that washout of ocular hypotensive medications for one month is not judged safe by the investigator (i.e., cupdisc ratio &gt; 0.8). 11. Central corneal thickness greater than 600 µm in either eye. 12. Any ocular abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry of either eye. 13. Significant media opacity in either eye that would exclude adequate posterior segment examination 14. Contraindications to pupil dilation in either eye. 15. Unwillingness to accept known adverse events of latanoprost such as eyelid and/or iris pigmentation, eyelash growth, etc. 16. History of macular edema, including cystoid macular edema, or current or recent (6 months) uveitis. 17. Planned intraocular surgery in either eye during study participation Systemic: 18. Clinically significant abnormalities (as determined by the treating physician) in laboratory tests at screening. 19. Known hypersensitivity or systemic contraindication to latanoprost or components of study medication. 20. Clinically significant systemic disease (e.g., myasthenia gravis, hepatic, renal, endocrine or cardiovascular disorders), which might interfere with the study. 21. Participation in any investigational study within 30 days prior to baseline. 22. Changes of systemic medication that could have a substantial effect on IOP within 30 days prior to screening, or anticipated during the study. 23. Any individual the investigator believes might suffer physical or mental harm by participating in this trial. Due to the current status of the preclinical safety program, women of childbearing potential who are pregnant, nursing, planning a pregnancy, or not using a medically acceptable form of birth control. An adult woman is considered to be of childbearing potential unless she is one year postmenopausal or three months postsurgical sterilization. All females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test result at the Visit 1 examination and must agree to use an acceptable method of contraception during the study.</criteria>
