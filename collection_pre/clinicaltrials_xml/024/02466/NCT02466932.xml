	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the effects of birth weight (BW) on ocular anterior segment parameters in preschool children using the Galilei Dual-Sheimpflug Analyzer (GD-SA). Children were measured by GD-SA and relationships between all anterior segment parameters obtained by this device and birth weight were analyzed.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Preschoolers, who were born heavier, had thicker cornea and lens, longer axial length, and flatter corneal curve. The thicknesses and axial curves of central cornea within 7mm may be particularly associated with BW.</detailed_description>
