	<brief_summary>Whether patients with stage II colon cancer should receive adjuvant chemotherapy or not is still on debate.MicroRNA(miRNA) is a promising tool. Investigators invented a tool consisting of 6 miRNA(miR-21、miR-20a-5p、miR-103a-3p、miR-106b-5p、miR-143-5p and miR-215) that was effective to identify one should accept adjuvant chemotherapy or not. Here investigators randomly assign patients to be assessed by classical pathological features or the miRNA tool of determining who should accept chemotherapy. Disease free survival and overall survival are the end points of observation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A 6 microRNA Tool for Stratifying Stage II Colon Cancer of Receiving Adjuvant Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators randomly assign patients to be assessed by classical pathological features(control group) or the miRNA tool(experimental group). Pathological features include poorly differentiated histology(exclusive of those cancers that are MSI-H),lymphatic/vascular invasion,bowel obstruction and &lt;12 lymph nodes examined.MicroRNA tool contains miRNA of miR-21、miR-20a-5p、miR-103a-3p、miR-106b-5p、miR-143-5p and miR-215. Investigators evaluate these miRNA status of surgical specimens using qRT-PCR and calculate their risk score(risk score =(0.108×status of miR-21-5p)+(0.086×status of miR-20a-5p)+(0.240×status of miR-103a-3p)+(0.095×status of miR-106b-5p)-(0.238×status of miR-143-5p)-(0.237×status of miR-215),low expression status equals 0 and high expression status equals 1). Investigators defined high risk patient if had any pathological features in control group or the score larger than 1 in the experimental group ,the others as low risk patient.The high risk group should receive adjuvant chemotherapy while the low risk group deserve observation. Primary endpoint is the disease free survival and overall survival.</detailed_description>
