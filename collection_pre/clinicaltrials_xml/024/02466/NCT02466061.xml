	<brief_summary>This randomized, controlled study evaluates the efficacy of weigh loss interventions in endometrial cancer survivors, using novel technology-based weight loss platforms. This is a multi-site, pilot feasibility study which will provide preliminary data to support a larger NIH funded, mult-center trial.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Aims The relationship between endometrial cancer (EC) and obesity is well established. However, few studies have examined the acceptability and potential efficacy of an intervention to promote weight reduction and alter cancer-associated biomarkers in endometrial cancer survivors. This investigation has two specific aims. Aim 1: To compare the efficacy of novel technology-based weight loss interventions: a) telephone encounters and wireless scales, or b) smart phone personalized text messaging as compared to c) an enhanced usual care group for women with obesity and a history of endometrial cancer. Hypothesis: Women in both the telemedicine and text intervention arms will lose significantly more weight than women in the enhanced usual care arm. Aim 2: 1a) To explore patients' understanding of the relationship between obesity and endometrial cancer and, 1b) to survey the acceptability of novel and different approaches to weight loss. Hypothesis: The investigators anticipate that this study will validate pilot data from a predecessor single-institution study demonstrating that &gt;25% of patients will not be aware of the association between excess body weight and endometrial cancer. Investigators also will assess the acceptability of various interventions designed to promote weight loss (i.e. in person counseling, phone-based, text messaging) and predict a greater interest in interventions that require fewer in-person visits to the clinic. Study Design Aim 1: - 3 arm randomized controlled trial, weight loss intervention - Pre and post intervention patient reported psychosocial measures - Pre and post intervention Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) to explore impact of weight loss on body fat distribution - Pre and post intervention analyses of the following biomarkers: insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1); adiponectin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), C reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 1-beta (IL1-beta), interleukin 2 (IL2), interleukin 6 (IL6), interleukin 7 (IL7), and interleukin 8 (IL8) Aim 2: Patient-reported survey to assess knowledge of correlation of Body Mass Index (BMI) with endometrial cancer incidence Study Population Aim 2: Adult women with biopsy-proven endometrial cancer (Types I and II), BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2. Aim 1: Aim 2 population plus Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) 0-1, no concurrent chemo or radiation therapy, and access to wireless internet and/or smart phone device.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Aim 2 1. Women 18 years of age or older and with biopsyproven endometrial cancer, 2. Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2 (based on most recent routine clinical measurement recorded in patient's medical record), 3. Must be able to read and speak English fluently, and 4. All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of the Aim 2 survey study and must give written informed consent for Aim 2 study activities in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines. (Aim 2 consent is obtained and documented as described on page 1 of the Endometrial Cancer Questionnaire). Aim 1 1. Woman who was recruited to and completed Aim 2 of the study, 2. Has completed prior surgical or other medical management and adjuvant endometrial cancer treatment, prior to starting Aim 1, 3. Is not receiving concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy at time of randomization AND, after randomization, it is not anticipated that the participant will need to receive concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy at any time during the Aim 1 intervention, 4. No evidence of active endometrial cancer disease as determined by physician evaluation prior to randomization, 5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 01 6. Life expectancy of at least one year, 7. Must have access to either wireless Internet, or a smart phone such as an Android or Apple iPhone, and 8. All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must sign and give written informed consent for Aim 1 study activities in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines. Aim 2 1. Must not have any other clinically significant medical disease or condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, may interfere with Aim 2 protocol compliance or a participant's ability to give informed consent. 4.3.2.2 Aim 1 2. Must not be participating in another weight loss program or taking weight loss medications, 3. No uncontrolled serious medical or psychiatric condition(s) that would affect the patient's ability to participate in the interventional study, e.g., uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic cardiac disease, or severe/uncontrolled depression as indicated by a Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) score &gt;19, or a score of ≥1 on the suicidal ideation item (#9 on the PHQ9) 4. No diagnoses of any other invasive malignancy other than endometrial cancer or nonmelanoma skin cancer which required active treatment currently or within the last 5 years. Carcinosarcoma is not excluded as the investigators are including women with Type I and II endometrial cancer. For the purposes of the trial, carcinosarcoma falls into the Type II category. 5. No diagnoses of autoimmune disorders (including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Siogren's syndrome, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), immunecompromised disorders (i.e., HIV/AIDS), 6. Not receiving at time of randomization, and not expected to receive at any time during the Aim 1 intervention, any medications that may affect the inflammatory markers of interest (i.e., steroids, immunosuppressants or transplant medications), and 7. Must not have any other clinically significant medical disease or condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, may interfere with Aim 1 protocol compliance or a participant's ability to give informed consent. 8. Must not be pregnant.</criteria>
