	<brief_title>A Comparison of Paediatric Weight Estimation Methods for Emergency Resuscitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A reliable paediatric weight estimation method is crucial for the physician attempting to resuscitate an injured child. When a patient is in a critical, life threatening condition or in mass casualty settings, actual body weight cannot be obtained by weight measurement instrument. Several resuscitation modalities, such as resuscitation medications, fluid replacement, and amount of electrical shock in defibrillation, are calculated according to patient body weight Besides from weight derived from children's parent which cannot achieve in some situations and vary in accuracy, Broselow tape is the gold standard currently for appraise children's weight from their length. However, this tape tends to underestimate weight and it is limited to use in children are less than 146 centimeters in length. Age- based weight estimation methods are the mathematical formulas to estimate weight from the children's age. The various methods described in the Advanced Paediatric Life support (APLS) both original and updated still have doubts about the accuracy and reliability. Both length- based and aged- based methods fail to resolve the overweight or obese and underweight children who have the same height or the same age. Mercy method is the new weight estimation method that incorporates the humeral length and mid-upper arm circumference to estimate the child weight. This method has been demonstrated both accuracy and reliability over other existing methods. This study will evaluate the validity, reliability and practicality of the previously mentioned pediatric weight estimation methods.</detailed_description>
