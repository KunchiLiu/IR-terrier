	<brief_summary>This study aims to evaluate a culturally appropriate, low cost and sustainable management plan for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Various randomized controlled trials confirmed that T2DM can be delayed with lifestyle intervention and programmes which promote improvements in diet, increased physical activity and weight loss. Translation of lifestyle intervention to real-life settings however remains a major challenge. The investigators therefore propose a diabetes management trial for T2DM patients using telemedicine. This project's innovations include the use of information technology to deliver messages to the physicians while similarly involving family members of diabetics to manage the patient's condition collectively. This creates a sense of well-being, empowering the individual as well as the community to be responsible for their own health and well-being</brief_summary>
