	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study of Synflutide HFA Inhaler and Seretide Evohaler in Healthy Volunteers With Charcoal Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A pivotal, single-dose, randomized, open-label, two-period, two-sequence, two-treatment, crossover, comparative bioavailability study for test drug Synflutide HFA 250/25 Inhaler and reference drug SeretideTM 250 EvohalerTM in healthy volunteers with charcoal block. Fifty healthy, male and female volunteers, 20-65 years of age, with a body mass index (BMI) within 18.0-30.0 kg/m2, inclusive, will be enrolled. A single dose of 4 puffs (eq. to fluticasone propionate 1000μg+salmeterol 100μg from valve) in each study period. Plasma samples will be assayed for fluticasone propionate and salmeterol using a validated analytical method according to the principles of Good Laboratory Practice.</detailed_description>
