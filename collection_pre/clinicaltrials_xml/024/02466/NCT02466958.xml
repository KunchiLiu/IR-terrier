	<brief_title>Trial of Levomilnacipran in Geriatric Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A 12-week pilot double-blind comparison of levomilnacipran (FETZIMA) to placebo for the treatment of geriatric depression. The investigators are interested in assessing the efficacy of levomilnacipran (LMIL) to placebo (PBO), and exploring the effects of antidepressant response on brain connectivity and neuroplasticity. This pilot study is designed to determine any differences in the efficacy, safety and tolerability of levomilnacipran compared to placebo, and to perform dose finding (20-120 mg per day) in 60 older depressed adults. The investigators anticipate that the LMIL will be superior to PBO in improving levels of depressive symptoms and rates of remission, as well as improving cognition, apathy, and quality of life. This proposal expands the investigator's focus on the biomarkers of neuroplasticity that have been used in several prior studies and demonstrated responsivity to antidepressant treatment. The purpose is to examine this directly in 60 older adults with major depression. This proposed trial will also serve as a pilot study to estimate the efficacy and tolerability of the drug in older depressed adults, and the dose-finding in this population.</detailed_description>
