	<brief_title>RhGM-CSF as Adjuvant Immunotherapy in Treating Stage III Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of rhGM-CSF as adjuvant immunotherapy for patients with resectable stage III colon cancers. Patients were randomly assigned to rhGM-CSF group or placebo group and treated with rhGM-CSF or placebo perioperation and during the adjuvant chemotherapy. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the antitumor immune effect of rhGM-CSF before surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy through DFS of 5 years and to observe the safety during the treatment in order to provide evidence for improvement in treating resectable colon cancer patients.</detailed_description>
