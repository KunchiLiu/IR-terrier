	<brief_title>Regorafenib in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be asked to participate in the study because they are aged 70 or older and require treatment for colorectal cancer that has spread to other parts of the body and has not gotten better with other treatment. Subjects will undergo some initial tests to ensure that they meet all criteria necessary to participate in the study. Once the subject has completed initial testing and meets eligibility criteria, the subject will begin treatment with 120 mg of regorafenib (3 tablets) each day for 21 days (3 weeks) in a 28 day cycle (4 weeks). After the first cycle, the doctor will discuss the possibility of increasing the dose to 160 mg (4 tablets) each day for 21 days (3 weeks) in a 28 day cycle (4 weeks) based on the subjects health status. During the study, assessments will be performed to monitor the subjects tolerance and response to the treatment. Regorafenib will continue as long as the subject is tolerating the treatment and the subjects colorectal cancer is either responding to treatment or remains stable.</detailed_description>
