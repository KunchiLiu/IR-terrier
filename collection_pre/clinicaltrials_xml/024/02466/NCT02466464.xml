	<detailed_description>Nosebleeds are a common condition which affect many Americans every day.The standard treatment in this hospital for nosebleeds that do not resolve with squeezing the nose or nasal spray is to place a nasal packing (aka nasal tampon) into the nose. This is an effective treatment in most cases, but patients may find it to be uncomfortable. The investigators will be comparing the standard nasal packing with a new type of powder which may also stop nosebleeds.</detailed_description>
