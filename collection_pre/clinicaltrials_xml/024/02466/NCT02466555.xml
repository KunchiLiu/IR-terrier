	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of the BEATS Music Therapy Program on the self-efficacy, trust, knowledge, and adherence of young adult patients with sickle cell disease during transition. Primary Hypotheses: Compared to baseline, young adult patients with sickle cell disease who receive the music therapy interventions will report: 1. Higher sickle cell self-efficacy as measured by the Sickle Cell Self Efficacy Scale (SCSES), 2. Higher trust in health care providers as measured by the Wake Forest Trust in the Medical Profession Scale, and 3. Higher sickle cell disease knowledge as measured by the Seidman Sickle Cell Knowledge Quiz. Secondary Hypotheses 1. Compared to the one year prior to the study period, young adults with sickle cell disease who receive the music therapy interventions will have a higher rate of adherence to clinic appointments during the one-year study period. Additional Questions 1. Do music therapy interventions influence attendance to scheduled blood transfusions? 2. Do music therapy interventions influence the rate of hospital utilization as measured by Emergency Department visits, Acute Care Clinic visits, and admissions during the study period compared to the previous year? 3. Do music therapy interventions influence adherence to hydroxyurea therapy for patients receiving hydroxyurea as measured by change in mean corpuscular volume (MCV) during the study period? 4. Do music therapy interventions influence adherence to iron chelation therapy for patients receiving iron chelation therapy as measured by ferritin count during the study period?</brief_summary>
