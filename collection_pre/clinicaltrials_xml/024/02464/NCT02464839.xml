	<brief_title>Prevalence and Clinical Characteristics of the Fungal Nail and Feet Infection in Patients With Hallux Valgus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hallux valgus is an abnormal deviation of the big toe away from the midline of the body or toward the other toes of the foot that is associated especially with the wearing of ill-fitting shoes-compare bunion. According to the previous studies, the association of nails and feet of disorder such as superficial fugal foot infection, abnormal nail shape and onychomycosis was reported. Nevertheless, nail disorders have been neglected for examination and treatment due to asymptomatic clinical manifestations and low effects in quality of life, even though it is the common dermatologic problem in general population. Nail disorders that coincidentally happen with foot deformities can cause by either onychomycosis or nail trauma. Unfortunately, clinical presentation of them is similar. Nevertheless onychomycosis is the common superficial fungal infection in Thai population. So that the empirical systemic treatment of onychomycosis in older patients by systemic therapy such as azoles group and terbinafine according to the standard regimen maybe induce serious side effects. If onychomycosis is suspected, the abnormal nail should be taken to confirm the diagnosis will be required. Therefore, this study was designed to demonstrate the prevalence of onychomycosis in hallux valgus patients. Additionally, all the prevalence of tinea pedis, the pattern of clinical manifestations, risk factors and coexistence foot deformities with hallux valgus were observed and recorded.</detailed_description>
