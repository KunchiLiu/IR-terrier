	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of JNJ-42847922 (change versus placebo) on sleep efficiency (SE) measured by polysomnography (PSG) after single and multiple dose administration to participants with insomnia disorder without psychiatric comorbidity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of JNJ-42847922 in Participants With Insomnia Disorder Without Psychiatric Comorbidity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), placebo-controlled, double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the identity of the assigned treatment), 2-way cross-over study of JNJ-42847922 participants with insomnia disorder without psychiatric comorbidity. The study consists of following phases: screening (28 days prior to Day 1), a double-blind treatment phase (consists of 5-day treatments, either JNJ-42847922 or placebo in subsequent 2-treatment periods, each separated with washout period of 5 to 9 days), and a follow-up examination (7 to 14 days after last dose administration). Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy male and female participants aged between 18 and 65 years, inclusive Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kilogram per square meters (kg/m^2) inclusive (BMI = weight/height^2) Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score more than or equal to (&gt;=) 15 at screening Insomnia: at screening participants will report both difficulties with sleep onset and sleep maintenance. Insomnia will furthermore objectively be established prior to enrollment per PSG recorded over 3 consecutive nights. Participants will sleep for 3 consecutive nights in the sleep center. First and second night data will be used to exclude any participant with restless leg syndrome, apnea, parasomnias or other sleep disorders. On the second and third night participants are required to meet objective inclusion criteria: 2night mean LPS of &gt;=30 minutes with no night &lt;20 minutes, and on both nights TST &lt;=6 hours and wake after sleep onset (WASO) &gt;30 minutes Participants must be healthy / medically stable on the basis of clinical laboratory tests, medical history, vital signs, and 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening and baseline Participant has current signs/symptoms of, liver or renal insufficiency; hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, significant cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurologic, hematologic, rheumatologic, or metabolic disturbances. Participants with noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus who are adequately controlled (not on insulin) may participate in the study History of epilepsy or fits or unexplained blackouts Clinically significant abnormal values for hematology, clinical chemistry or urinalysis at screening or admission Clinically significant abnormal physical and neurological examination, vital signs or 12lead ECG at screening or baseline Smoking &gt;=10 cigarettes/daily Insomnia related to restless leg syndrome, sleep breathing disorder, narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea, central sleep apnea, sleeprelated hypoventilation, circadian rhythm sleepwake disorders, substance/medicationinduced sleep disorder or parasomnias Nightshift worker or significantly shifted diurnal activity pattern</criteria>
