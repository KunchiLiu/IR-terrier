	<brief_summary>Non-attendance to out-patient endoscopic procedures is high among underserved blacks. The overall goal of this proposal is to evaluate the effect of directly involving a social contact (chosen by the patient) on completion and quality of out-patient endoscopy recommended for the patient by his/her primary care physician, or after scheduling by the gastrointestinal endoscopist. Improved adherence and better quality of procedures are postulated with involvement of social contacts.</brief_summary>
