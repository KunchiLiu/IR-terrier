	<brief_summary>Research goals include evaluating the relative impact of maternal nutritional status versus recent dietary intake on breast milk micronutrient composition, and evaluating the impact of a maternal lipid based nutrient supplement (LNS) on breast milk micronutrient composition.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short Term Response of Breast Milk Micronutrient Concentrations to a Lipid Based Nutrient Supplement in Guatemalan Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study includes a cross sectional and an interventional component. Maternal dietary intake and nutritional status will be compared to breast milk micronutrient composition in a cross sectional manner. The short term effect of maternal dietary intake on breast milk micronutrient composition will be examined using an intervention with a controlled diet and LNS. Infants will be test-weighed during the LNS intervention in order to calculate the infant micronutrient intake from the control and LNS intervention days. Mother-infant dyads will be recruited into the study and the order in which they will receive the 3 treatments will be randomized. All mothers will receive all treatments. The mothers will be invited to the clinic on 4 separate occasions. During the first study visit, maternal blood will be collected, anthropometric indices will be assessed, and food frequency and demographic characteristic surveys will be administered. During the 2-4 visits, the LNS intervention will take place. Mothers will arrive at the clinic fasted, and a fasted milk collection will occur. Subsequently, mothers will be provided 3 meals based on local foods with low-nutrient density. Milk will be collected for 8 hours at each infant feed (ad libitum). A 24 hour dietary recall will be conducted. Mothers will receive 1) no LNS, 2) A single dose of LNS with breakfast, or 3) A single dose of LNS split into 3 parts with their meals throughout the day. Infants will be test weighed before and after each feed to calculate their nutrient intake from breast milk and the impact of the different supplementation schemes on their nutrient intake.</detailed_description>
