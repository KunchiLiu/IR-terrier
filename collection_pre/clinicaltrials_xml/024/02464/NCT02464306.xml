	<brief_summary>A prospective study to assess the efficacy and safety of fidaxomicin in Solid Organ Transplant (SOT) recipients (heart, lung, kidney, liver, kidney-pancreas, and pancreas) with a first-episode of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fidaxomicin Versus Standard of Care Therapy in Solid Organ Transplant Recipients With Clostridium Difficile Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be treated with fidaxomicin 200 mg PO twice daily for 10 days. The rate of sustained clinical response (SCR; cure without recurrence at 30 days) will be assessed and compared to a historical cohort of SOT recipients who received standard of care therapy for CDI at our institution. The data for the historical control group will be collected under a separate IRB-approved protocol. Standard of care therapy will be considered oral or intravenous metronidazole and / or oral vancomycin. The study will be powered to show non-inferiority of fidaxomicin compared to standard of care treatment in SOT recipients.</detailed_description>
