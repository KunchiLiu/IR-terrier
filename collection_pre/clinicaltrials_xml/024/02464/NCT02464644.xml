	<brief_summary>Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) affects 1 in 5,000 people. The purpose of this study is to provide data regarding the frequency of common health conditions and the tolerability of therapies in HHT by using a questionnaire. This will be filled in by both people with HHT, and controls who will be members of the general population without HHT. The questionnaire has been designed primarily for web based entry, but can also be circulated in paper format on request</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Frequency of Common Medical Conditions in People With and Without HHT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) affects 1 in 5,000 people, usually causing nosebleeds, skin blood spots, and/or anemia as a result of bleeding from the nose or gut. The majority of people with HHT also have abnormal blood vessels (arteriovenous malformations) in internal organs such as the lungs, liver and brain. Management of this multisystem disorder is highly challenging. The Lead Applicant has spent 20 years working on this rare disease, and identified multiple areas where more evidence is required to assist clinicians and patients with this lifelong condition. A particular issue is what happens when people with HHT have other common medical conditions such as asthma, cancer, diabetes, or heart disease. Do they have the same pattern of problems as the general population? Can they use the same drugs? Are further safeguards needed? For these important questions, current advice can only be based on theoretical considerations and anecdotal data. The ultimate goal of this study is to use information derived from a questionnaire to provide evidence to assist clinicians treating people with HHT. Data will be entered from April 2012. Data will be analysed on average 6-8 months after entry.</detailed_description>
