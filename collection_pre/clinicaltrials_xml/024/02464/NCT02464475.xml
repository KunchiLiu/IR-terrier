	<brief_summary>Recent evidence suggested that the anterior insula cortex seems to be the main site of interoception. Several studies showed an association between change in insula function and interoception, bodily perception and consciousness in subjects with chronic pain. Although osteopathic research has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing pain, studies exploring the effect of osteopathy on interoception are lacking. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to explore the extent to which osteopathic treatment could modify interoception parameters both measuring brain functional connectivity and clinical questionnaires.</brief_summary>
