	<detailed_description>The purpose of this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial is to examine the equivalency of two different doses of dexamethasone when given intravenously as an adjuvant medication for postoperative pain management. Specifically, this study will investigate the prolongation of time to recovery of sensation following a lumbar plexus block in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasties. The investigators hypothesize that dexamethasone will prolong the sensory block time when compared to placebo and that similar results will be obtained in the 4 mg arm when compared to the 8 mg arm. The primary end point will be time to sensory recovery in the femoral nerve cutaneous distribution (part of the lumbar plexus) as determined by pin-prick sensation assessment. Secondary endpoints will include, but are not be limited to: time to first opioid administration, total opioid consumption over 30 hours, and rest and incident verbal numerical pain scores at 6,12,18,24 and 30 hours post block placement.</detailed_description>
