	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the metabolic and clinical results of two well recognized and accepted surgical techniques in the management of severe hyperparathyroidism in patients under regular dialysis treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Subtotal Parathyroidectomy or Total Parathyroidectomy With Autograft in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients Under Dialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective randomized trial in the surgical management of severe hyperparathyroidism of chronic kidney disease stage V under dialysis. Patients will be randomized and they will be submitted to subtotal parathyroidectomy or total parathyroidectomy with immediate heterotopic autograft of 45 or 90 fragments of parathyroid tissue.</detailed_description>
