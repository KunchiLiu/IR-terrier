	<brief_summary>The investigators propose tomosynthesis as a imaging method in between of x-ray and CT. The expected value of this project is the definition of proven indications for tomosynthesis, which allow replacing CT. Specific goals are the early detection of pulmonary consolidations / parenchymal changes as well as the monitoring of patients with ostesynthetic implants.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators propose tomosynthesis as a imaging method in between of x-ray and CT. The expected value of this project is the definition of proven indications for tomosynthesis, which allow replacing CT. Specific goals are the early detection of pulmonary consolidations / parenchymal changes as well as the monitoring of patients with ostesynthetic implants. This is a prospective, single-center, non-randomised, non-blinded trial with Tomosyntheis of Patients referred to the investigators institution to assess lung alterations and bone structure. All patients will undergo chest x-ray and tomosynthesis after informed consent. In addition they will undergo an ultralow-dose CT, wich is used as standart reference. The radiation dose of each method will be recorded. After completion of these three examinations, the participation in the study is completed.</detailed_description>
