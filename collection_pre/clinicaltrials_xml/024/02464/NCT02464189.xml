	<brief_title>Assessment of Asthma Knowledge Perception in Parents of Asthmatic Children. Pilot Study by Means of Q-KAP ( Questionnaire on Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to assess the knowledge, the attitudes and the practices of parents of asthmatic children. The study proposes the validation of Q- KAP by means of the recruiting of 390 parents of asthmatic children, recruited in the outpatient clinic of Pediatric Allergology &amp; Pulmonology (PAP) of Respiratory Disease Research Center (RDRC) within the Institute of Biomedicine and Molecular Immunology (IBIM) of the National Research Council (CNR) of Palermo (RDRC-IBIM CNR), Italy. Q-KAP will be given to one of the parents during their children medical examination. Q-KAP is a multiple answer questionnaire investigating on knowledge, attitudes and practices for what concerns Asthma. At the end of the recruitment time, data will be stored and analyzed in a dataset. The expected result is the identification of a tool able to assess knowledge, attitudes and practices of asthmatic children parents, but also the identification of a tool able to identify two groups of parents (well-experienced and bad-experienced) to assess if there is a link between a low degree of knowledge and a bad control of the disease.</detailed_description>
