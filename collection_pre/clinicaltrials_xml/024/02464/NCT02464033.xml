Males or females not willing to use adequate contraception, if sexually active, until 1 year after the last GADAlum and etanercept administration, respectively 18. Presence of associated serious disease or condition, including active skin infections that preclude subcutaneous injection, which in the opinion of the investigator makes the patient noneligible for the study. 19.

Active infection, including chronic and local infection or a history of previous tendency to serious infections, recent or ongoing uncontrolled bacterial, viral, fungal or other opportunistic infections, or known infection with active EBV or CMV 21.
