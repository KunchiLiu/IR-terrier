	<brief_summary>The aim of this randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the influence of luting agent, thickness and color of laminate veneers (LVs) and color of dental substrate on the optical properties of LVs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optical Properties of Light Cured Luting Agent on Laminate Veneer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The following date will be collected (i) the color of dental substrate obtained before and after dental preparation, (ii) the thickness and color of the LVs obtained before of the cementation procedures on white and black value background, (iii) and the final color of the LVs bonded to dental substrates obtained after cementation. For LVs cementation two cements will be used, the light-cured resin cement and the flowable composite, which will be randomly divided into two groups (n=31). The color of LVs will be performed with visual evaluation based on Vita and 3D Master scales and with a spectrophotometer Vita Easyshade (Vita Zahnfabrik / Bad Saeckingen, Germany) based on CIEL*a* b system. Data collected will be evaluated for translucency parameter (TP) and color variation (Î”E) according to luting agent, thickness and color of the LVs as well as color of dental substrate. Additionally, the color obtained with visual evaluation and with spectrophotometer will be compared to evaluate the level of agreement between the color observed by the operator and the color named by the spectrophotometer.</detailed_description>
