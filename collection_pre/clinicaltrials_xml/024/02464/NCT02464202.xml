	<brief_summary>The aim of this study lies in comparing the outcome of the proposed technique in a large sample size group to the outcome of the conventional tooth autotransplantation method and to provide sufficient evidence for improving the long-term success rate of the tooth autotransplantation procedure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of CBCT-based Tooth Replica in Tooth Autotransplantation to Improve the Outcome of Tooth Replacement in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>The subjects will be divided in two groups according to different surgical protocols. 1. Pediatric subjects (age between 918 years) treated with the CBCTbased replica procedure (prospective approach). Pediatric subjects (N=50) that missed their teeth due to agenesis or lost their permanent teeth due to trauma, caries, and endodontic failure and referred to dentistry department for replacement of the missing tooth by means of tooth autotransplantation. 2. Pediatric subjects (age between 918 years) treated with the conventional method (prospective and retrospective). Pediatric subjects (N=50) that missed their teeth due to agenesis or lost their permanent teeth due to trauma, caries, and endodontic failure and referred to dentistry department for replacement of the missing tooth by means of tooth autotransplantation. A matched control patient will be selected with the focus on a very similar surgical challenge, based on age, gender and a matching donor tooth with the same stage of root development and host bed. Potential participants (case and control) will be excluded if followup data are missing for the oneyear followup.</criteria>
