	<brief_title>Gum Arabic as Fetal Hemoglobin Agent in Sickle Cell Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>: High level of fetal haemoglobin (Hb F) decreases sickle cell anaemia (SCA) severity and leads to improved survival. Butyrate proved to increase HbF production in vivo and in vitro studies. Nonetheless, its short half-life limited its utilization in clinical practice. Gum Arabic (GA) is edible, dried, gummy exudate from Acacia Senegal tree. GA fermentation by colonic bacteria increases serum butyrate concentrations. The investigators hypothesized regular intake of GA will increase serum butyrate level. The latter will induce fetal hemoglobin production and ameliorate patients' symptoms. 47 patients hemoglobin SS aged 5-42 years, on regular follow up in Military hospital were recruited from April 2014 to January 2015 Patients received dose of G A 30g/day for 12 weeks. Hb F, complete blood count and Erythropoietin level were measured. The main outcome of interest was the level of HbF after 12 weeks.</detailed_description>
