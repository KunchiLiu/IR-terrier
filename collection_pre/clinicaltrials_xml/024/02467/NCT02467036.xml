	<brief_title>Family Based Treatment for Weight Loss With Breakfast Prescription</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this application is to evaluate the acceptability and initial efficacy of consumption of an egg breakfast, compared to a cereal breakfast, in the context of Family-based Behavioral Treatment (FBT) with overweight and obese children and their parents. Investigators will randomize 66 parents and their overweight and obese child (85-99.9%BMI) to FBT+egg or FBT+cereal groups. Families will eat their assigned breakfast (eggs or cereal) 5 out of 7 days during the 4 month FBT treatment. However, all other aspects of FBT will be the same in the two groups. Children and parents will complete assessments at three time points; baseline, post-treatment and 4-months post-treatment.</detailed_description>
