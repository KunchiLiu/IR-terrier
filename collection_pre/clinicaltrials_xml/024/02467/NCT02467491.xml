	<brief_title>A New Adaptive Physical Activity Technology in Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 12 older adults will be recruited in the Oak Hammock residential community to participate in a physical activity program using a new technology called Jintronix. Jintronix is an easy-to-use virtual physical activity platform designed for physical and occupational therapy. It combines common exercise movements, virtual games and motion sensing cameras to offer a fun and effective tool for physical activity. The exercises will be performed by each participant autonomously in the living room of the residential community following a specific schedule. The duration of the exercise program will be of 30 minutes for two days a week for a total of four weeks. The participants will be trained prior the beginning of the program in order to enter autonomously in the Jintronix platform and perform the exercises.</detailed_description>
