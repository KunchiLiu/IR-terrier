	<brief_summary>This is an intervention study of the effects of food preparation on the gut bacteria in patients with end stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis. This is a dietary intervention consistent of consuming low amounts of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), the products of protein and sugar interaction during food processing and preparation using high direct heat.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Food Preparation Effects on Gut Bacteria in Patients on Peritoneal Dialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gut microbes can influence numerous aspects of human biology. Alterations in the function and composition of gut microbial flora (gut microbiota) have been linked to different diseases such as obesity, diabetes and inflammation. Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs) are formed via the Maillard reaction, which consists of a complex network of non-enzymatic reactions involving the carbonyl groups of reducing sugars which react with the amino groups of proteins. AGEs are produced in vivo and being consumed. They have been implicated in increased risk of different diseases including atherosclerosis, CAD and kidney diseases. In this study, the investigators are evaluating the effects of consuming a low AGE diet in participants on peritoneal dialysis on the gut bacteria and inflammation.</detailed_description>
