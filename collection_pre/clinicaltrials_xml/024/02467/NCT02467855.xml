	<brief_title>Epidemiological Study in Thai Participants With Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study has been designed as a non-interventional, observational study to obtain information on hypertension treatment regimens and how well hypertension is controlled in Thai patients in real-life settings. Antihypertensive medications prescribed in this study will be at the discretion of the investigator and the standard of care practice at the particular study site. The study will enroll approximately 2000 patients. Participants with well-controlled hypertension on their current antihypertensive therapy will participate in the study for only 1 visit. Participants with history of hypertension who are uncontrolled on the current antihypertensive medications or participants with newly diagnosed hypertension (diagnosed within the past 4 weeks and uncontrolled on antihypertensive therapy) will be observed over the course of 12-16 weeks. These participants will make 3 visits to the study site. This multi-centre trial will be conducted in Thailand.</detailed_description>
