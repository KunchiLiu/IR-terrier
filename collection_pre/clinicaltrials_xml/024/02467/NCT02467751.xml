	<brief_summary>Metabolic profile in women of different body composition with polycystic ovary syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Will be performed case-control study with women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, according to the Rotterdam criteria and body mass index between 18 to 29.9. The control group will consist of women without Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, with a body mass index of 18 to 29.9 and no other comorbidities. In both groups collect anthropometric data such as age, weight, height, waist circumference and blood pressure. Exams will be requested: metabolic profile (total cholesterol (mg/dL) and fractions, triglycerides (mg/dL), blood count, liver function (U/L) and classical glycemic index (mg/dL); hormonal profile - insulin (uIU/ml), luteinizing hormone (IU/L), follicle stimulating hormone (IU/L), thyreostimulating hormone (uIU/ML), total and free testosterone (ng/ml), 17-hydroxyprogesterone (ng/ml), dehydroepiandrosterone (ng/ml), prolactin (ug/ml). Body composition (BMI) will be performed by absorption technique of two low energy beams emitted by X-ray - full body densitometry (DEXA). Expected result: To evaluate visceral fat and truncal of patients with diagnosis of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome without obesity.</detailed_description>
