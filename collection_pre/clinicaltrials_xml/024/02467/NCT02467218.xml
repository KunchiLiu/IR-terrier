	<brief_summary>Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic pain condition affecting several millions of Canadians. Although the etiology and pathophysiology are poorly understood, there is a well-recognized association between muscular pain in fibromyalgia and muscular hypoperfusion, hypoxia, abnormal muscle metabolism and oxidative stress. Currently there is no cure for FM. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies are directed to control symptoms such as pain, fatigue, non-restorative sleep and depression. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is an intermittent inhalation of 100% oxygen in a hyperbaric chamber at a pressure higher than 1 absolute atmosphere. Physiological effect of HBOT is based on a dramatic increase in the amount of dissolved oxygen carried by the blood which enables oxygenation of ischemic areas with compromised circulation. It also activates oxidant-antioxidant system, stimulates angio- and neurogenesis, modulates inflammatory response, induces brain neuroplasticity and possesses analgesic effect. While some interventions offer benefit for some patients, additional treatment alternatives are needed for patients with FM in whom currently available options are either ineffective or poorly tolerated. Given its physiological effect, HBOT could be considered as a potential therapy for treatment of underlying muscular hypoxia, optimizing oxidant- antioxidant system and controlling FM symptoms. The results from this study could therefore provide new information supporting the basic science underling the pathophysiology of this disease and stimulate novel therapies for patients suffering with FM.</brief_summary>
