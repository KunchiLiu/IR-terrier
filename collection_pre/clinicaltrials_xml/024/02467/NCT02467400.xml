	<brief_title>Dose Response and Receptor Selectivity of Beta-blocker Effects on Bone Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In postmenopausal women, who have increased sympathetic outflow, to test the hypothesis that treatment with low doses of a non-selective β-blocker (propranolol) will increase serum markers of bone formation and reduce markers of bone resorption (Aim 1a); and using increasingly β1-AR selective blockers (atenolol and nebivolol), to better define the β-adrenergic receptor selectivity (β1 versus β2) in the regulation of bone turnover by sympathetic outflow in humans.</detailed_description>
