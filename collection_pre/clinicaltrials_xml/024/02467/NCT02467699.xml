	<brief_summary>The knee prosthesis is a validated treatment for end-stage osteoarthritis, and this intervention usually provides a significant improvement in the quality of life of patients. However, a significant percentage of patients (up 30%) say disappointed with the outcome of the intervention. One hypothesis that could explain these poor results might be poor adaptation of the implants to the patient's anatomy, resulting in a non-physiological kinematics for the patient. Multiple studies try to obtain an individual adaptation of the intervention according to multiple criteria. The measurement of the kinematics of the knee before surgery could participate in this process.</brief_summary>
