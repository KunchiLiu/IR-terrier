	<brief_title>Polyethylene Glycol Loxenatide Pharmacokinetics Study in Subjects With Normal and Insufficiency Renal Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open, non-randomized, parallel-group, single-dose study that evaluated the pharmacokinetics of PEX168 when single dose administered with PEX168 in patients with renal insufficiency and normal renal function subjects. The total duration of each subject's participation in the study was approximately 45 days, which included up to a 14-day Screening Period, a 31-day PK sample collecting Period. Center: This study was conducted at two sites in the Third Xiangya hospital of Center South University and Shanghai Changhai Hospital.All subjects receives a single 200μg doses of PEX168 injected subcutaneously on Day 1.</detailed_description>
