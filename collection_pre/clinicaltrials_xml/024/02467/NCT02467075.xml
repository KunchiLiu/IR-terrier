	<brief_summary>This double-blinded placebo-controlled non-inferiority study will examine the incidence and significance of contrast-induced acute kidney injury following intravenous iodinated contrast material administration in subjects with stage IIIB or stage IV chronic kidney disease. Subjects will be scheduled for clinically indicated CT of the abdomen and/or pelvis to evaluate for suspected intra-abdominal infection. Subjects will be randomized to receive either weight-based low-osmolality iodinated contrast material or saline. The primary outcome measure will be the incidence of stage II AKI by AKIN criteria.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This double-blinded placebo-controlled non-inferiority study will examine the incidence and significance of contrast-induced acute kidney injury following intravenous iodinated contrast material administration in subjects with stage IIIB or stage IV chronic kidney disease. Subjects will be scheduled for clinically indicated CT of the abdomen and/or pelvis to evaluate for suspected intra-abdominal infection. Subjects will be randomized to receive either weight-based low-osmolality iodinated contrast material or saline. The primary outcome measure will be the incidence of stage II AKI by AKIN criteria. Secondary outcome measures will include AKI by other definitions (stage I AKI, traditional CI-AKI definition), hospital length of stay, 30-day readmission rate, number of additional percutaneous interventions within 30 days, number of additional CT examinations within 30 days, and 30-day mortality rate. All subjects will receive a minimum of 1 mL/kg/hr (max: 125 mL/hr) of volume expansion for at least three hours pre and three hours post-CT.</detailed_description>
