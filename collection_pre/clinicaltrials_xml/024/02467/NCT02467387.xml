	<criteria>1. Males and females ≥18 years of age 2. LVEF ≤35% on echocardiogram within 12 months of randomization to undergo MRI 3. Screening cardiac MRI at baseline with: Ejection fraction ≤40% No significant hyper enhancement on MRI scan in the opinion of the central imaging lab reviewer 4. Patients with nonischemic heart failure etiology, as documented by absent or nonobstructive coronary artery disease on xray angiography or coronary computed tomography 5. Patients with history of heart failure and treated for at least three months with GDMT 6. NYHA class IIIII symptoms 7. Ability to understand and provide signed informed consent 8. Reasonable expectation that patient will receive standard posttreatment care and attend all scheduled safety followup visits 1. Pregnant or nursing women or those of childbearing age and not using an effective method of contraception 2. History of stroke within 3 months 3. Cardiac surgery within 3 months prior to randomization or the likelihood of a requirement for such procedures during the study period 4. Current ICD or CRT or implantation planned within 6 months of infusion 5. Presence of clinically significant, uncorrected valvular heart disease, hypertrophic or restrictive cardiomyopathy, active myocarditis, or uncontrolled hypertension 6. History of cardiac arrest or lifethreatening arrhythmias within 3 months 7. Treatment with parenteral inotropic agents within 1 month of randomization 8. Anticipated cardiac transplantation within 1 year 9. Illness other than heart failure with life expectancy less than 1 year 10. Received an experimental drug or device within 30 days of randomization 11. Left ventricular assist device or implantation planned in the next 6 months 12. Patients with complex congenital heart disease 13. Uncontrolled seizure disorder 14. Presence of immune deficiency 15. Clinically significant hematologic, hepatic, or renal impairment as determined by screening clinical laboratory tests: Liver disease = ALT or AST &gt; 3x normal, alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin &gt;2x normal) Renal disease = estimated glomerular filtration rate as assessed by the MDRD formula &lt;30 ml/min Hematologic = Unexplained leukocytosis &gt;10 or hemoglobin &lt; 9gm/dl 16. Presence of any other clinicallysignificant medical condition, psychiatric condition, or laboratory abnormality, that in the judgment of the investigator or sponsor for which participation in the study would pose a safety risk to the subject 17. Inability to comply with the conditions of the protocol 18. Malignancy within the previous five years, except adequately treated basal cell carcinoma, provided that it is neither infiltrating nor sclerosing, and carcinoma in situ of the cervix 19. Active myocarditis or early postpartum cardiomyopathy (within six months). 20. Systemic corticosteroids, cytostatics, immunosuppressive drug therapy (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, cyclosporine, azathioprine, etc.), and DNA depleting or cytotoxic drugs taken within four weeks prior to study treatment 21. Porphyria 22. Allergy to sodium citrate or any "caine" type of local anesthetic 23. Any contraindication for gadolinium use for MRI 24. Patient scheduled for hospice care 25. Clinically relevant abnormal findings in the clinical history, physical examination, ECG, or laboratory tests at the screening assessment that would interfere with the objectives of the study or would preclude safe completion of the study. Abnormal findings could include: known HIV infection or other immunodeficiency state, chronic active viral infection (such as hepatitis B or C), acute systemic infections (defined as patients undergoing treatment with antibiotics), gastrointestinal tract bleeding, or any severe or acute concomitant illness or injury 26. Any other medical, social, or geographical factor that would make it unlikely that the patient could comply with study procedures (e.g., alcohol abuse, lack of permanent residence, severe depression, disorientation, distant location, or noncompliance)</criteria>
