	<brief_summary>The primary outcome is to compare the analgesic efficacy of intravenous ketamine treatment to that of a placebo in patients with refractory neuropathic pain. The secondary outcomes are: 1. - To compare the additive analgesic efficacy of prior administration of magnesium sulfate to that of placebo and ketamine only, on the effectiveness of intravenous ketamine treatment, 2. - To study the evolution time of pain and analgesia after the intravenous administration of ketamine and placebo, 3. - To study the correlation of the analgesic response to administered products respectively ketamine, ketamine and magnesium sulfate, placebo.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Description of the study: Single-center clinical trial, controlled, randomized, double-blind, crossover design, against inactive placebo. Each patient will receive successively the 3 products (ketamine / placebo, ketamine / magnesium sulfate, placebo / placebo) follows a predeter randomization list, with a wash-out period between each administration. Visit 1 -Inclusion visit, signature of informed consent form, clinical examination and fill questionnaires. For women of childbearing age a pregnancy test will be performed.The pain will be measured by a numerical scale. The pain will be evaluated by scoring on a numerical scale. A booklet for monitoring analgesic concomitant medication and overall pain on a numerical scale will be given to the patient 14 days before the programmed infusion. Visit 2 : Period 1 Day 0 Clinical examination, return of booklet completed by patient and fill questionnaires. The pain will be evaluated by scoring on a numerical scale before and after the infusion. For women of childbearing age a pregnancy test will be performed. Treatment allocation period follows a predeter randomization list. At the end of the infusion, a booklet for monitoring will be given to patients for the following weeks in order to score their overall pain until the next study period. The output of the hospital patient (CPC / CETD) after each treatment will be authorized by the investigator. Wash-out period: 5 weeks. Phone call 1 (Day 1): Patients will be called by phone to collect adverse events and concomitant medications. If necessary, the patients should return to consult the CPC / CETD for a clinical examination. Patients will be called the week before their scheduled visit, if at that time their spontaneous pain is still low, according to the opinion of the investigator, the infusion visit will be shifted to allow the pain level back its basal level. Visit 3 : Period 2 : Day 36 +/- 3 days Same of period 1. Phone call 2 J 37 +/- 3 days: Same of phone call 1. Visit 4 : Period 3 : Day 72 +/- 3 days Same of period 1 Phone call 3 J 73 +/- 3 days: Same of phone call 1. Visit 5 : Day 108 +/- 3 days Clinical examination, return of booklet completed by patient and fill questionnaires. The pain will be evaluated by scoring on a numerical scale For women of childbearing age a pregnancy test will be performed. This visit is the end of the study.</detailed_description>
