	<brief_title>Ponatinib in Patients With Resistant Chronic Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) to Characterize the Efficacy and Safety of a Range of Doses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, randomized, phase 2 trial to characterize the safety and efficacy of ponatinib over a range of 3 starting doses. Eligible patients must have chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) and be resistant to at least 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Have CPCML and are resistant to at least two prior TKIs 2. Be male or female patients ≥18 years old 3. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2 4. Have adequate renal function as defined by the following criterion: Serum creatinine ≤1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) for institution 5. Have adequate hepatic function as defined by the following criteria: Total serum bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN, unless due to Gilbert's syndrome Alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤2.5 × ULN, or ≤5 × ULN if leukemic involvement of the liver is present Aspartate transaminase (AST) ≤2.5 × ULN, or ≤5 × ULN if leukemic involvement of the liver is present 1. Have used any approved TKIs or investigational agents within 2 weeks or 6 halflives of the agent, whichever is longer, prior to receiving study drug 2. Received interferon, cytarabine, or immunotherapy within 14 days, or any other cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or investigational therapy within 28 days prior to receiving the first dose of ponatinib, or have not recovered (&gt; grade 1 by NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE), version 4.0) from AEs (except alopecia), due to agents previously administered 3. Have undergone autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant &lt;60 days prior to receiving the first dose of ponatinib; have any evidence of ongoing graftversushost disease (GVHD) or GVHD requiring immunosuppressive therapy or are being considered for stem cell transplant within 612 months of enrollment (note: ponatinib is not to be used as a bridge to stem cell transplant in this trial) 4. Are taking medications with a known risk of Torsades de Pointes 5. Have clinically significant, uncontrolled, or active cardiovascular disease, specifically including, but not restricted to: Any history of myocardial infarction (MI), unstable angina, cerebrovascular accident, or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Any history of peripheral vascular infarction, including visceral infarction Any revascularization procedure, including the placement of a stent Congestive heart failure (NYHA class III or IV) within 6 months prior to enrollment, or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than lower limit of normal, per local institutional standards, within 6 months prior to enrollment History of clinically significant (as determined by the treating physician) atrial arrhythmia or any history of ventricular arrhythmia Venous thromboembolism, including deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, within 6 months prior to enrollment</criteria>
