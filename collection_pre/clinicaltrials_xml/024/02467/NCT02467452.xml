	<criteria>1. Male and female adults aged ≥ 40 years with written informed consent obtained prior to any studyrelated procedure. 2. Patients with a diagnosis of COPD at least 12 months before the screening visit (according to GOLD document updated 2014). 3. Current smokers or exsmokers who quit smoking at least 6 months prior to screening visit, with a smoking history of at least 10 pack years [packyears = (number of cigarettes per day x number of years)/20]. 4. A postbronchodilator FEV1 &lt; 50% of the predicted normal value and a postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt; 0.7 at least 1015 min after 4 puffs (4 x 100 μg) of salbutamol pMDI. If this criterion is not met at screening, the test can be repeated once before randomisation. 5. A documented history of at least one exacerbation in the 12 months preceding the screening visit. COPD exacerbation will be defined according to the following: "A sustained worsening of the patient's condition (dyspnoea, cough and/or sputum production/purulence), from the stable state and beyond normal daytoday variations, that is acute in onset and necessitates a change in regular medication in a patient with underlying COPD that includes prescriptions of systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics or need for hospitalization". Also documented visits to an emergency department due to COPD exacerbation are considered acceptable to fulfil this criterion. 6. Patients under double therapy for at least 2 months prior to screening visit with either: 1. inhaled corticosteroids/longacting β2agonist combination (fixed or free), without regular use of shortacting muscarinic antagonist (regular use means 2 puffs 4 times per day at least) or 2. inhaled corticosteroids/longacting muscarinic antagonist free combination, without regular use of shortacting β2agonist (regular use means 2 puffs 4 times per day at least) or 3. Inhaled longacting β2agonist and inhaled longacting muscarinic antagonist or 4. Patients under monotherapy with longacting muscarinic antagonist for at least 2 months prior to screening. 7. Symptomatic patients at screening with a CAT score ≥10. 8. A cooperative attitude and ability to use correctly the inhalers. 9. A cooperative attitude and ability to use correctly the daily electronic Diary (eDiary). 1. Pregnant or lactating women and all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant (i.e. women of childbearing potential) UNLESS are willing to use one or more methods of contraception as defined in the protocol 2. Patients with a current clinical diagnosis of asthma with a physicianjudged need for inhaled or oral corticosteroid therapy 3. Patients requiring use of the following medications: 1. A course of systemic steroids longer than 3 days for COPD exacerbation in the 4 weeks prior to screening 2. A course of antibiotics for COPD exacerbation longer than 7 days in the 4 weeks prior to screening 3. phosphodiesterase4 (PDE4) inhibitors in the 4 weeks prior to screening 4. Use of antibiotics for a lower respiratory tract infection (e.g pneumonia) in the 4 weeks prior to screening 4. COPD exacerbation requiring prescriptions of systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics or hospitalization during the runin period 5. Patients treated with noncardio selective βblockers in the month preceding the screening visit or during the runin period. Those patients may enter the study after nonselective βblockers withdrawal and/or cardio selective βblockers intake for at least 10 days before randomization 6. Patients treated with longacting antihistamines unless taken at stable regimen at least 2 months prior to screening and to be maintained constant during the study, or if taken as o re nata (PRN). 7. Patients requiring long term (at least 12 hours daily) oxygen therapy for chronic hypoxemia. 8. Known respiratory disorders other than COPD which may impact the efficacy of the study drug according the investigator's judgment 9. Patients who have clinically significant cardiovascular condition 10. Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF): 1. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation 2. Persistent: AF episode either lasts longer than 7 days or requires termination by cardioversion, either with drugs or by direct current cardioversion (DCC) within 6 months from screening 3. Long standing Persistent as defined by continuous atrial fibrillation diagnosed for less than 6 months with or without a rhythm control strategy 4. Permanent: for at least 6 months with a resting ventricular rate ≥ 100/min controlled with a rate control strategy (i.e., selective βblocker, calcium channel blocker, pacemaker placement, digoxin or ablation therapy) 11. An abnormal and clinically significant 12lead ECG which may impact the safety of the patient according to investigator's judgement Patients whose electrocardiogram (ECG12 lead) shows QT Interval Corrected by the Fridericia Correction Formula (QTcF) &gt;450 ms for males or QTcF &gt;470 ms for females at screening visit are not eligible (not applicable for patient with pacemaker) 12. Medical diagnosis of narrowangle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction that in the opinion of the investigator would prevent use of anticholinergic agents 13. History of hypersensitivity to anticholinergics, β2agonist, corticosteroids or any of the excipients contained in any of the formulations used in the trial which may raise contraindications or impact the efficacy of the study drug according to the investigator's judgement 14. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities indicating a significant or unstable concomitant disease which may impact the efficacy or the safety of the study drug according to investigator's judgement 15. Patients with hypokalaemia (serum potassium levels &lt;3.5 milliequivalent per liter (mEq/L) (or 3.5 mmol/L)) or uncontrolled hyperkalaemia according to investigator's judgment 16. Unstable concurrent disease: e.g. uncontrolled hyperthyroidism, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or other endocrine disease; significant hepatic impairment; significant renal impairment; uncontrolled gastrointestinal disease (e.g. active peptic ulcer); uncontrolled neurological disease; uncontrolled haematological disease; uncontrolled autoimmune disorders, or other which may impact the efficacy or the safety of the study drug according to investigator's judgment. 17. Patients with any history of malignancy likely to result in significant disability or likely to require significant medical or surgical intervention within the next six months (after V1) or with malignancy for which they are currently undergoing radiation therapy or chemotherapy 18. History of alcohol abuse and/or substance/drug abuse within 12 months prior to screening visit 19. Participation in another clinical trial where investigation drug was received less than 8 weeks prior to screening visit</criteria>
