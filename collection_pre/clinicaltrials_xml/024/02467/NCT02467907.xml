	<brief_summary>This study is to assess safety as defined by the frequency and severity of gastrointestinal (GI) perforation/fistula, GI-vaginal fistula and genitourinary (GU) fistula in participants treated with bevacizumab 15 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin, all repeated every 3 weeks, for recurrent, persistent or metastatic cervical cancer. In addition, this study will include evaluation of the overall safety profile of bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in this setting, assessment of GI perforation/fistula, GI-vaginal fistula and GU fistula events over time, and evaluation of efficacy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1 Life expectancy greater than or equal to (&gt;=3) months For women who are not postmenopausal or surgically sterile, agreement to remain abstinent or use single or combined contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate of less than (&lt;) 1 percent (%) per year during the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the last dose of study drug Distant metastatic, recurrent or persistent squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the cervix that is not amenable to curative treatment with surgery and/or radiation therapy Either measurable or nonmeasurable disease. If disease is nonmeasurable or limited to the radiation field, a biopsy or fineneedle aspiration is required to confirm malignancy Eligible for carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy in accordance with local standards of care Adequate hematological, renal and hepatic function Normal blood coagulation parameters Recovered (to Grade less than or equal to [&lt;=] 1) from the effects of prior surgery, radiation therapy or chemoradiotherapy Pregnant or lactating History of other malignancy within 5 years before screening, except for nonmelanoma skin carcinoma Ongoing disease involving the bladder or rectum at screening/baseline. In participants with pelvic disease, absence of tumor in the bladder or rectal mucosa must be demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (preferred method, or endoscopy/cystoscopy if MRI is not easily accessible) within 28 days before enrolment Evidence of abdominal free air Bilateral hydronephrosis Untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases Prior chemotherapy for recurrent, persistent or metastatic cervical cancer. Prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy for Stage IIVA disease (i.e. for nonmetastatic disease) is permitted if completed greater than (&gt;) 6 months before first study dose Prior chemoradiation within the 3 months preceding first study dose Prior radiotherapy delivered using cobalt Prior or current bevacizumab or other antiangiogenic treatment Requirement for treatment with any medicinal product that contraindicates the use of any of the study drugs, may interfere with the planned treatment, affects participant compliance or puts the participant at high risk for treatmentrelated complications Treatment with another investigational agent within 28 days or 2 investigational agent halflives before first study dose Major surgical procedure, open biopsy or significant traumatic injury within 28 days before the first dose of bevacizumab or anticipation of the need for major surgery during the course of study treatment Minor surgical procedure within 2 days before the first dose of study drug Any prior history of fistula or GI perforation Known hypersensitivity to bevacizumab or any of its excipients, Chinese hamster ovary cell products or other recombinant human or humanized antibodies to any planned chemotherapy Active GI bleeding or ulcer Uncontrolled hypertension Clinically significant active cardiovascular disease National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.0, Grade greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 2 peripheral vascular disease</criteria>
