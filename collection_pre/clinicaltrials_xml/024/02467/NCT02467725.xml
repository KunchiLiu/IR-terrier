	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine if a dynamic embryo microenvironment impacts embryo development and reproductive potential in comparison to static culture.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The proposed research design is a prospective randomized control trial. Patients with normal ovarian reserve, who would be expected to have reasonable outcomes after in vitro fertilization, will serve as the subjects. Embryos from the same patient will be randomized to either static or dynamic culture. They will then be cultured to the blastocyst stage of embryo development and biopsied for preimplantation genetic screening. The best chromosomally normal embryo from each culture group will be selected and transferred to complete a double embryo transfer in a subsequent frozen embryo transfer cycle the following month.</detailed_description>
