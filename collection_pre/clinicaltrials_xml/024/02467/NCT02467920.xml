	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Basal Insulin Glargine Combination With Exenatide Bid vs Aspart30 in T2DM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicentre, open-label, randomized and parallel trial that will compare the efficacy and safety of basal insulin glargine combination with Exenatide bid vs. switching premix human insulin to aspart30 in type 2 diabetic patients with inadequate glycaemic control on premixed human insulin and metformin. Approximately 248 patients will be enrolled in the study from China and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the 2 treatment arms: once-daily insulin glargine + twice-daily exenatide + metformin; or twice-daily aspart 30 + metformin. Study treatment will continue for 24 weeks. The primary efficacy measure is the change in HbA1c at 24 weeks. The study consists of 3 periods: a 1-week screening (period A), a 12-week run-in period (period B) and a 24-week treatment period (period C).</detailed_description>
