	<brief_summary>It is generally accepted that the fungal infection on a joint prosthesis is to be treated in two surgical time: implant removal and prosthetic reconstruction. The service took the option for over 10 years to treat bacterial infections in joint replacement by a change in time. In four recent cases the diagnosis initially suspected of bacterial infection has been restated on intraoperative bacteriological examinations fungal infection. It is therefore a potentially harmful side effect of the chosen treatment option, but 4 patients in question were all cured of their fungal infection after a postoperative antifungal therapy. The objective of this study is to report these cases for discussion on the therapeutic choices in fungal infections on joint replacement.</brief_summary>
