	<brief_title>Ovarian Reserve After Cancer: Longitudinal Effects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 7 study visits will be completed at 3 month intervals including 1 visit prior to treatment, and at least 2 visits after completion of treatment. Duration of study participation is 18-30 months, depending on length of treatment. Review and Documentation of Cancer Therapy will be abstracted from the clinical oncology chart by the oncology offices caring for the patient. Treatment will be summarized in terms of chemotherapeutic type, duration and cumulative dose; total radiation dose and location; history and type of bone marrow transplantation; and any surgery. Any attempts at fertility preservation or use of gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist treatment during cancer therapy will be captured as well.</detailed_description>
