	<brief_title>Vitamin D Plasma Level and Its Role in Headache</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several papers suggest that inflammation is able to induces both headache and low levels of vitamin D. However, to date a correlation between plasma vitamin D levels and headache has not been demonstrated. Recently we documented that low levels of Vitamin D are related to a low statin efficacy. In this study we will evaluate the plasma levels of vitamin D in patients with headache admitted to the Center of Headache of Pugliese Ciaccio Hospital. Moreover it will be also evaluated: - the correlation between efficacy and safety of drugs used in headache treatment and plasma vitamin D levels. - the role of vitamin D supplementation on both headache symptoms and drug effects. Plasma vitamin D levels in patients with headache will be evaluated respect to patients without headache.</detailed_description>
