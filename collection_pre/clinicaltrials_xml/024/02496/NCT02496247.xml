	<brief_summary>This study will test the effectiveness of a weekly village distribution of canned herring for prevention of malnutrition in children aged 2-5 years old during a food-insecure time of the year in rural villages in Guinea-Bissau. The study will use community health workers to conduct the herring distribution, making this a test that will provide valuable information on what could become a practical food aid supplementation practice. The primary study hypothesis is that distribution of canned herring as a weekly food supplement to families with young children at the beginning of the rainy season will prevent a seasonal decrease in weight-for-age Z-score (primary variable) of children with mild to moderate malnutrition at baseline.</brief_summary>
