	<brief_summary>Albiglutide, a novel analogue of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), has been developed and approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The primary objective of this study is to assess if a single dose of albiglutide can affect cholecystokinin-induced gallbladder emptying. To make this assessment, each study participant will receive a dose of albiglutide and a dose of placebo followed by cholecystokinin (CCK) infusion and ultrasound measurement of the gallbladder. The study will be comprised of two periods and 20 subjects. The screening visit will occur within 42 days of the start of Treatment Period 1. The Treatment Periods will be separated by a washout period of a minimum of 42 days. Subjects will return for a follow-up visit after 28 days following the last dose of albiglutide or placebo. The total duration of a subject's participation from Screening to Follow-up will be approximately 17.5 weeks. This study is a post marketing commitment to the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA).</brief_summary>
