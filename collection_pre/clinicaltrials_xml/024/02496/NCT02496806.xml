	<brief_summary>Brown seaweeds are a rich source of phlorotannins, a characteristic class of polyphenols which are unique to seaweeds of this type and can comprise 5 to 15 % of the dried weight. Unlike other classes of polyphenols, there is a lack of knowledge regarding phlorotannins and their bioavailability and bioactivity. The purpose of this study is to investigate the absorption and metabolism of seaweed polyphenols in humans. As part of an EC project (SWAFAX), an acute clinical intervention will be conducted to investigate the metabolism/ bioavailability of brown seaweed phlorotannins. Urine and plasma samples from 24 healthy volunteers that consumed a seaweed capsule containing polyphenols will be collected before and after the intervention. Data emanating from this project will provide strong scientific evidence for bioavailability and health promoting activity of a seaweed polyphenol extract in human volunteers.</brief_summary>
