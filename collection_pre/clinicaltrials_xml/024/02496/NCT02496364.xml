	<brief_summary>Lumbar degenerative disease surgery entails in a high blood loss, requiring often for blood transfusion. The cost and risks involved in the use of allogeneic blood have motivated research methods to reduce operative bleeding in these patients. One such method is the use of anti-fibrinolytic drugs, among which is tranexamic acid.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Topical and Intravenous Tranexamic Acid in Surgical Treatment of Lumbar Degenerative Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will enroll 144 middle-aged and aged patients undergoing Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion (PLIF) with the diagnosis of Lumbar Degenerative Disease. The primary aim is to determine if topical application of tranexamic acid is more effective than intravenous infusion at decreasing blood loss and blood transfusion perioperatively in middle-aged and aged patients presenting for PLIF surgery.</detailed_description>
