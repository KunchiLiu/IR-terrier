	<brief_title>Community-Based Peer Facilitator Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To increase uptake of, and retention within maternal and child health/prevention of maternal-to-child HIV transmission (MCH/PMTCT) services, the investigators conducted a community-based peer facilitator intervention study in Hurungwe District of Zimbabwe. Using a paired community randomized design, 16 health facility-linked communities were randomly allocated to the intervention or control condition, with a total of approximately 1,600 pregnant and lactating women, (100 women in each community), recruited into the study. In the intervention communities, 24 trained peer facilitators (3 in each community) using participatory educational approaches were encouraging women to form antenatal and post-natal groups, and to utilize and adhere to MCH/PMTCT services and recommendations. Peer facilitators, by the definition of this project, were women from the community who were peers to pregnant and lactating women; who had recently been through the process themselves and could speak to their experience. A key activity of the community-based peer facilitators was the encouragement of the formation of women into groups, and the participation of these women into antenatal care (ANC), prevention of maternal to child transmission (PMTCT), and postnatal care (PNC) programs. The group process was enable solidarity and support among the women at the vulnerable times of pregnancy and lactation.</detailed_description>
