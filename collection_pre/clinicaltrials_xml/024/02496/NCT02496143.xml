	<brief_title>A Safety and PK Study of EC-18 in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the safety, tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics of single ascending doses of EC-18 or placebo. If no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed in Cohort One, the dose of EC-18 will be increased to in Cohorts Two, Three, and Four, respectively. Dose escalation to each successive cohort of subjects will not occur until a review of the safety and tolerability data from the previous cohort is completed and the Investigator, Sponsor, and study Medical Monitor together confirm the safety and tolerability of EC-18 given at that dose level.</detailed_description>
