	<detailed_description>Freshman college students at Northwestern University will be cluster randomized to two groups based on their dorm. The intervention for one group will target smoking, physical activity, BMI and consumption of fruits and vegetables. The intervention in the second group will target driving behavior, sexual risk behaviors, sunscreen use and hydration. Baseline health and lifestyle measures will be assessed for each participant prior to intervention. Health assessments will measure height, weight, fasting glucose, total cholesterol and carbon monoxide. The lifestyle measure will ask questions about physical activity, diet, alcohol and tobacco use, safe sex practices, driving habits, and sunscreen use. These same measures will be repeated during the fall of the students' sophomore and junior years.</detailed_description>
