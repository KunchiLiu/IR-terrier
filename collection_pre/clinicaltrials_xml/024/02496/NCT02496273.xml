	<brief_title>Phase I Trial of CEA Specific AAV-DC-CTL Treatment in Stage IV Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) describes a set of highly related glycoproteins involved in cell adhesion.CEA is normally produced in gastrointestinal tissue during fetal development, but the production stops before birth. The serum levels are raised in some types of cancer,such as Gastric Cancer.The expression of CEA in these cancers and succedent unfavourable prognosis such as tumor hyperplasia, recurrence make CEA become the desirable therapeutic target. Cancer immunotherapy is the use of the immune system to treat cancer. Immunotherapies fall into three main groups: cellular, antibody and cytokine.Cellular therapies involve the removal of immune cells from the blood or from a tumor. Immune cells specific for the tumor are activated, cultured and returned to the patient where the immune cells attack the cancer. Cytotoxic T cells and dendritic cells can be used in cell-based immunotherapy. This study is for patients that have a stage Ⅳ gastric cancer with elevated serum CEA concentration. This research study uses special immune system cells called CEA-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes , a new experimental therapy. Blood will be collected from the patient and the CEA-specific CTLs will be made.The cells will be injected by IV into the patient.The investigators will follow the patient from their last infusion,monitor side effects of immunotherapy and learn more about the way the T cells are working in the patient's body.The investigators will use blood samples to see how long the T cells last and to look at the immune response to the patient's response to cancer.</detailed_description>
