	<brief_summary>The influences of specific dietary fat sources on satiety, appetite and energy utilization remains unclear; evidence is lacking on whether responses vary according to acute intake. The researchers will use a controlled setting to determine whether the source of dietary fat is related to perceived satiety, satiety hormone responses, and energy expenditure by conducting experiments to evaluate short term (acute) effects.</brief_summary>
