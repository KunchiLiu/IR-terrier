	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of necitumumab when given together with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor AZD9291 (osimertinib) in treating patients with EGFR-positive non-small cell lung cancer that is stage IV or has come back (recurrent) and who have progressed on a previous EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Monoclonal antibodies, such as necitumumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. EGFR inhibitor AZD9291 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving necitumumab with EGFR inhibitor AZD9291 may be a better treatment for EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EGFR Inhibitor AZD9291 and Necitumumab in Treating Patients With EGFR-Positive Stage IV or Recurrent Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Who Have Progressed on a Previous EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety and tolerability of AZD9291 (EGFR inhibitor AZD9291) in combination with necitumumab in patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and resistance to previous EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) therapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity in these NSCLC patients with EGFR-activating mutations and progressive disease on previous EGFR-TKI with a focus on an EGFR T790M negative expansion cohort. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of AZD9291 in combination with necitumumab. II. To explore biomarkers of response and resistance to previous EGFR-TKIs and with the combination by studying biopsied tumor tissue at baseline and at progression, as well as serial plasma deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) specimens. III. To create patient derived xenograft (PDX) models of patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC both prior to study initiation and at acquired resistance to treatment. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of necitumumab. Patients receive EGFR inhibitor AZD9291 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and necitumumab intravenously (IV) over 50 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, every 12 weeks for 1 year, and annually thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with stage IV or recurrent/metastatic histologically confirmed nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) NSCLC must harbor at least one of the following EGFR activating mutations: Exon 21 L858R, Exon 19 deletion, Exon 18 G719X, Exon 21 L861Q Progressive disease on at least one prior EGFRTKI (previous treatment with 3rd generation EGFRTKI including AZD9291 allowed for dose escalation only) Adequate archival tissue from a biopsy performed after progression of disease on previous EGFRTKI or willing to consent for a fresh tumor biopsy (mandatory for dose expansion cohort only; optional for dose escalation) For the dose expansion portion ONLY, patient must: 1) have progression of disease with erlotinib, gefitinib or afatinib as last previous systemic treatment, 2) tumors must be EGFRT790M negative confirmed by central testing prior to treatment (If EGFRT790M status is unknown patients may consent for trial for biopsy and testing for EGFR T790M will be performed as part of initial biopsy for trial; patients who test positive for EGFR T790M by central testing will be ineligible for the dose expansion), 3) be treatment naive to 3rd generation EGFRTKI (EGFR inhibitor CO1686 [CO1686] and AZD9291) and EGFR monoclonal antibodies Patients must have measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension &gt;= 10 mm (&gt;= 1 cm) by computed tomography (CT) imaging or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 42 days prior to registration; the CT from a combined positron emission tomography (PET)/CT may be used only if it is of diagnostic; laboratory parameters are not acceptable as the only evidence of disease Any number of prior therapies is allowed Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt;
