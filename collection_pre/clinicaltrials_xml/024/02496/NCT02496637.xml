	<brief_title>A Brief Appetite Awareness Intervention for Eating and Weight Regulation Among College Freshmen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All female freshmen students residing in the university dorms were recruited to participate in this study. After completing the baseline assessment, eligible participants were randomly assigned to one of the three arms. Those in the AAT condition received guided administration of AAT over the course of three weekly group sessions, with an additional booster session three weeks after completion (week 6). The standard treatment comparison group received four similarly timed group sessions of psychoeducational/nutrition information facilitated by a registered dietician. A manualized approach to administration of the intervention was created based on the AAT treatment and was strictly followed in order to standardize the implementation of the prevention groups. The no-treatment control group only participated in the assessments.</detailed_description>
