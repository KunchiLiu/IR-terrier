	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best doses of cabozantinib-s-malate and nivolumab with or without ipilimumab in treating patients with genitourinary (genital and urinary organ) tumors that have spread to other places in the body. Cabozantinib-s-malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. It is not yet known whether giving cabozantinib-s-malate and nivolumab alone or with ipilimumab works better in treating patients with genitourinary tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cabozantinib-s-malate and Nivolumab With or Without Ipilimumab in Treating Patients With Metastatic Genitourinary Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination of cabozantinib (cabozantinib-s-malate) and nivolumab (cabo-nivo) and separately the combination of cabozantinib, nivolumab and ipilimumab (cabo-nivo-ipi) in patients with genitourinary tumors. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Preliminarily evaluate the activity, as determined by objective response rate using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and the modified Immune-Related Response Criteria (irRC), derived from RECIST1.1, of cabo-nivo and cabo-nivo-ipi in patients with advanced/refractory metastatic urothelial carcinoma (checkpoint inhibition therapy naive) and with renal cell carcinoma in the second-line and beyond setting. II. Preliminarily evaluate the activity, as determined by objective response rate using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and the modified Immune-Related Response Criteria (irRC), derived from RECIST1.1, of cabo-nivo in patients with adenocarcinoma and with squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder in the first line or beyond setting. III. Preliminarily evaluate the activity, as determined by objective response rate using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and the modified Immune-Related Response Criteria (irRC), derived from RECIST1.1, of cabo-nivo in patients with urothelial carcinoma previously treated with checkpoint inhibition therapy in the second line or beyond setting. IV. To evaluate the activity as determined by progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of: cabo-nivo and cabo-nivo-ipi in patients with advanced/refractory metastatic urothelial carcinoma (checkpoint inhibition therapy naive) or with renal cell carcinoma in the second-line and beyond setting. V. To evaluate the activity as determined by progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of: cabo-nivo in patients with advanced adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder in the first-line and beyond setting. VI. To evaluate the activity as determined by progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of: cabo-nivo in patients with urothelial carcinoma previously treated with checkpoint inhibition therapy in the second line or beyond setting. VII. To obtain additional data to evaluate the safety of both combinations in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). VIII. To assess the number of malignant soft tissue and bone lesions on fludeoxyglucose F-18 (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) (scan 1) versus combined fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride (18F-NaF) and 18F-FDG PET/CT (scan 2). IX. To assess response assessment by RECIST 1.1 using CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with intravenous (IV) contrast versus assessment by combined 18F-NaF and 18F-FDG PET/CT (scan 2) using number of malignant and change (modified PET RECIST [PERCIST]) of soft tissue and bone lesions. X. To test the feasibility of automated density and volume application (ADaVA) as a means of assessing tumor response. XI. To assess PDL-1 and MET expression data and in exploratory fashion analyze their association to response or clinical benefit. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms. PART I: Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PART II: Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate PO QD on days 1-21, nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1, and ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of 4 courses with ipilimumab, patients continue receiving cabozantinib-s-malate PO QD on days 1-28 and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 42 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 16 weeks or 100 days and then every 2 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
