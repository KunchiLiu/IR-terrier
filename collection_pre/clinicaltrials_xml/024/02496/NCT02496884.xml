	<brief_summary>DS-5565 (mirogabalin) is being studied as treatment for fibromyalgia pain. Because it is metabolized through the kidneys, people who have reduced kidney function will not process the drug as well as with those with normal kidney function, so the dose must be reduced. This study will test two reduced dose levels for both moderately reduced and severely reduced kidney function. The study will test the hypothesis that the drug will be safe and well-tolerated in people who have both fibromyalgia and chronic kidney disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study of DS-5565 for Treatment of Fibromyalgia Pain in Subjects With Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a stratified, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, multi-center safety study of DS-5565 in subjects with Fibromyalgia (FM) and renal dysfunction. Eligible subjects will be randomized 2:1 to receive either DS-5565 7.5 mg once daily (QD) or placebo for the category of subjects with creatinine clearance (CrCl) 15-29 mL/min, or 2:1 to receive treatment with DS-5565 7.5 mg twice daily (BID) or placebo for the category of subjects with CrCl 30-59 mL/min. Subjects will be stratified for renal impairment by CrCl. The treatment period is 13 weeks in duration. The total study duration (individual subject) will be approximately 21 weeks. The study includes a screening period (approximately 3 weeks but no longer than 35 days, including a washout period [if necessary] and a 1-week baseline period), double-blind treatment period (13 weeks), and a 4 week follow-up period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 years Able to give written informed consent Able to complete patientreported questionnaires per the Investigator's judgment Estimated CrCl between 1559 mL/min from serum creatinine by the central laboratory using the CockcroftGault equation Fibromyalgia meeting American College of Rheumatology criteria for FM: Widespread pain index (WPI) ≥ 7 and symptom severity (SS) scale score ≥ 5 or WPI 3 to 6 and SS scale score ≥ 9, Pain in at least 11 of 18 specific tender point sites, Symptoms have been present at a similar level for at least 3 months, and The subject does not have a disorder that would otherwise explain the pain Average Daily Pain Score of ≥ 4 on the 11point numeric rating scale (NRS) over the 7 days prior to randomization (based on completion of at least 4 daily pain assessments during the 7day baseline period prior to randomization) Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must be using adequate methods of contraception to avoid pregnancy during the study and for 4 weeks after study completion. Need for ongoing use of concomitant chronic pain medications or any new nonpharmacological pain management techniques that may confound assessments of efficacy and/or safety, including neurolytic treatments (destruction of nerves by chemicals, heat, cold) or surgery, intrathecal pumps, spinal cord stimulators or psychological support within the previous year. Also excluded: topical capsaicin within 6 months; or systemic corticosteroids within 3 months of baseline period. Unable to undergo prestudy washout of prohibited concomitant medications Subjects with recent history (i.e., within 1 year prior to screening) of alcohol abuse or illicit drug use (cocaine, heroin, marijuana [including medical, prescribed], etc.) Use of any selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), unless the subject has been on a stable dose for ≥ 90 days prior to screening and is not anticipated to need any dose adjustment during the course of the study Subjects with severe or uncontrolled depression that, in the judgment of the Investigator, makes the subject inappropriate for entry into the study Significant neurological or psychiatric disorder unrelated to neuropathic pain Other severe pain (eg, sciatica, rheumatoid arthritis) that might impair the assessment of neuropathic pain CrCl ≥ 60 mL/min estimated from serum creatinine by the central laboratory using the CockcroftGault equation. Subjects who are on hemodialysis or who require hemodialysis before the followup assessment; acute renal failure; history of kidney transplant Any history of a malignancy other than basal cell carcinoma within the past 5 years Clinically significant unstable neurologic, ophthalmologic, hepatobiliary, respiratory, or hematologic illness or unstable cardiovascular disease (eg, severe hypotension, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or myocardial infarction) within 12 months prior to screening Pregnancy or breast feeding or intent to become pregnant during the study period Known hypersensitivity to α2δ ligands or other components of the study medications. Note: Prior exposure to DS5565 is allowed, as long as hypersensitivity to DS5565 was not observed. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities at the Screening Visit Subjects who are at risk of suicide, as defined by their responses to the CSSRS or in the opinion of the Investigator. Note: Subjects answering "yes" to any of the questions about active suicidal ideation/intent/behaviors that occurred within the past 12 months must be excluded (CSSRS Suicide Ideation section Questions 3, 4, or 5; CSSRS Suicidal Behavior section any of the suicide behaviors questions). Such subjects should be referred immediately to a mental health professional for appropriate evaluation. Subjects who are unlikely to comply with the protocol (eg, uncooperative attitude, inability to return for subsequent visits, and/or otherwise considered by the Investigator to be unlikely to complete the study) Subject is currently enrolled in, or it has been fewer than 30 days since ending, another investigational device or drug study or is receiving another investigational agent. Subjects who are employees or immediate family of employees of the study site, Sponsor, or contract research organization (CRO) Screening laboratory values outside the limits listed in the table below: Hematology Hemoglobin &lt; 8 g/dL Platelet count &lt; 100,000/mm3 Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1,500/mm3 Blood chemistry AST &gt; 2.0 × ULN ALT &gt; 2.0 × ULN Alkaline phosphatase &gt; 1.5 × ULN Total bilirubin &gt; 1.2 × ULN (If a subject has total bilirubin &gt;ULN: unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin fractions should be analyzed and only subject documented to have Gilbert's syndrome may be enrolled) Creatine kinase &gt; 3.0 × ULN Calculated CrCl ≥ 60 mL/min Abbreviations: ALT = alanine aminotransferase, AST = aspartate *aminotransferase, CrCl = creatinine clearance (determined by the central laboratory using the CockcroftGault equation), ULN = upper limit of normal . *CSSRS = ColumbiaSuicide Severity Rating Scale</criteria>
