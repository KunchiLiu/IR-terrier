	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study to determine the association between postoperative pain after cesarean section and several single nucleotide polymorphisms in SCN9A sodium channels gene.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact of the SCN9A Gene Polymorphism on Postoperative Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SCN9A gene encodes an alpha subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav1.7) and polymorphisms of this gene are associated with severe pain disorders. The impact of the polymorphisms in SCN9A on postoperative pain and opioid consumption after cesarean section is unclear.</detailed_description>
