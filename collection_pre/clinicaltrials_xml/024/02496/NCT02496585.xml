	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the drug nintedanib in combination with steroids, has on the lungs. Furthermore, such treatments' side effects will be studied together with quality of life. In addition, the investigators would like to determine whether they can find markers in the blood which predict worsening lung injury.</brief_summary>
