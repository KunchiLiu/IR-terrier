	<brief_summary>Long-term weight loss maintenance is seldom achieved by individuals with obesity owing to numerous biological adaptations involving appetite, satiety, and energy expenditure in the post- weight loss setting. Following a loss in body weight, peripheral and central mechanisms convey a sense that energy reserves have dwindled, activating a strong counter response to increase caloric intake. Adolescents with severe obesity are not immune to the vexing issue of weight regain. Indeed, only 2% are able to achieve and maintain clinically-meaningful weight loss with lifestyle modification therapy. Therefore, novel treatment paradigms focused on long-term weight loss maintenance are urgently needed. Pharmacotherapy has the potential to prevent weight regain by targeting specific counter-regulatory mechanisms in the post- weight loss setting. One of the most promising candidates is the glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) class, which greatly enhanced weight loss maintenance following a short-term low calorie diet among adults with obesity. The rationale for focusing on GLP-1RA treatment (BYDUREON™) to prevent weight regain is supported by the multiple central and peripheral mechanisms of action targeted by this class of drug; many of which specifically address the biological adaptations known to induce relapse. The investigators have strong preliminary data demonstrating that GLP-1RA treatment reduces BMI in adolescents with severe obesity. Moreover, the investigators and others have shown that although meal replacement therapy (structured meals of known caloric content) can elicit robust short-term weight loss among adolescents with severe obesity, weight regain is a pervasive problem. Therefore, in this clinical trial, our innovative approach will utilize GLP-1RA treatment to target weight regain following short-term meal replacement therapy in youth with severe obesity. Participants who achieve ≥5% BMI reduction during the meal replacement phase will be randomized to GLP-1RA treatment or placebo for an additional 52 weeks while simultaneously engaging in lifestyle modification therapy. Importantly, this study will also allow us to examine the extent to which GLP-1RA treatment addresses mechanisms of weight regain, investigate other pleiotropic benefits of GLP-1RA, and identify predictors of weight loss response.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhancing Weight Loss Maintenance With GLP-1RA (BYDUREON™) in Adolescents With Severe Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective Evaluate the effect of GLP-1RA treatment on the maintenance of weight loss and durability of cardiometabolic risk factor improvements among adolescents with severe obesity following a meal replacement induction period. The investigators hypothesize that adolescents with severe obesity receiving GLP-1RA treatment following a short-term meal replacement induction period will demonstrate superior maintenance of initial BMI reduction 52 weeks following randomization compared to those assigned to placebo (primary endpoint) and that a higher proportion of those assigned to GLP-1RA treatment vs. placebo will maintain ≥5% BMI reduction from baseline to the 52-week time point (secondary endpoint). Moreover, GLP-1RA treatment will result in superior maintenance of initial reductions of body fat (total, visceral, and subcutaneous), blood pressure, triglycerides/HDL ratio, inflammation, oxidative stress, postprandial glucose-insulin response, insulin resistance, β cell dysfunction, and arterial stiffness at 52 weeks. Secondary Objectives Investigate the mechanisms by which GLP-1RA treatment facilitates weight loss maintenance and identify predictors of response to treatment. The investigators hypothesize that compared to placebo, GLP-1RA treatment following a period of meal replacement will reduce appetite (and related hormones) and gastric emptying rate, and will increase satiety (and related hormones) and resting energy expenditure at 26- and 52 weeks following randomization. Moreover, based on our preliminary work, the investigator hypothesize that appetite (and appetite-related hormones) following the meal replacement period and female gender will be associated with superior weight loss maintenance with GLP-1RA treatment.</detailed_description>
