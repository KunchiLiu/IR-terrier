	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether combining of Temozolomide and cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK) transfusion can prolong survival of patients with Advanced Malignant Gliomas. The effectiveness and safety of CIK cells for the treatment of Malignant Glioma is also evaluated.</brief_summary>
