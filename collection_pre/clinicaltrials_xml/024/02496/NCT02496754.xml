	<brief_summary>Pituitary down regulation is widely used during in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures. It can suppress the spontaneous luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, and can also make follicles growth evenly. At present, standard gonadotropin releasing hormone analogue (GnRH-a) long protocol is used in around 85% patients in the investigator's center. However, patients have to inject short term GnRH-a 0.05mg or 0.1mg daily for around 3 weeks in one IVF cycle. Long term GnRH-a, which is usually used in patients with endometriosis,has been shown to increase IVF outcome by altering endometrial receptivity. Moreover, it is also very convenient because patients do not have to inject GnRH-a daily. In order to make patients feel more comfortable during IVF treatment, the investigators have used a new ovarian stimulation protocol since the beginning of 2015. The investigators give patients long term GnRH-a (3.75mg) once at menstrual cycle D2, and begin the use of Gn to stimulate follicle growth around 30 days later based on the hormone levels and follicle size. In the pilot observational study of several patients, no LH surge occurred during ovarian stimulation. The aim of this randomized controlled study is to compare the efficiency of this new protocol and standard GnRH-a long protocol in the investigator's center.</brief_summary>
