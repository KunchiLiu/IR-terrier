	<brief_title>Lenalidomide &amp; Adriamycin &amp; Dexamethasone (RAD) in Newly Diagnosed, Multiple Myeloma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase II, non randomized, non- comparative, open label trial which assess the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide, adriamycin and low dose dexamethasone combination (RAD) in 45 newly diagnosed patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma as well as to collect information regarding the effect of this regimen on angiogenesis and bone remodeling of the study population. The recruitment period is estimated for 5 months while the treatment period and the follow up period 4 months and 1 month respectively. During the treatment initiation visit the response to the combination RAD according the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria will be evaluated, biochemical markers of bone metabolism and angiogenic cytokines will be measured as well. IMWG Response evaluation will be repeated the day 1 of each treatment cycle as well as at the response evaluation visit. Finally biochemical markers of bone metabolism and angiogenic cytokines will be measured once more at the end of treatment visit.</detailed_description>

Bilirubin ≤ 2fold of upper normal limit 12. Creatinine clearance ≥60 ml/min 13. Expected survival ≥ 6 months as per PI's clinical judgment 14. Subjects able to tolerate aspirin, low molecular weight heparin or coumarinic agents as prophylactic anticoagulation 15. Female subject of childbearing potential must have 2 negative serum pregnancy tests (hCG) at Screening (once within 1014 days and once 24 h before the study drug administration) and if sexually active must be using two medically acceptable, highly effective, adequate forms of birth control (ie, failure rate &lt;1% per year when used consistently and correctly) prior to Screening and and for time period at least 28 days before the study drug administration and agree to continue using it while being in the study (Screening and Treatment Periods including dose interruptions). A female subject should continue using a highly effective method of birth control for 30 days following the end of treatment. 16. A male subject must agree to use an adequate form of contraception for the duration of the study, while taking the study drug, during dose interruptions at for at least 28 days after the last dose of study drug even if he has had a successful vasectomy and agree to have sexual relations only with women who use a highly effective birth control method. 17. Subjects must be free of any clinically significant disease (other than MM) that would interfere with study evaluations 1. Pregnancy, breastfeeding οr intention of pregnancy during the trial 2. Suspected or known hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs 3. Ongoing severe infection requiring intravenous antibiotic treatment 4. Prior malignancy, except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, insitu cervical cancer, or other cancer from which the subject has been diseasefree for at least 5 years. Concurrent prostate cancer for which the patient is receiving therapy will not be considered an exclusion if the Prostatic specific antigen (PSA) has been stable for 3 years 5. Solitary bone or solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma as the only evidence of plasma cell dyscrasia 6.

Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from signing the ICF 9. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she will participate in the study or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study 10. Subjects with any clinical condition that would affect study's outcome 11. Participation in another interventional clinical trial in the 4 weeks preceding enrollment or planning to participate in another interventional clinical trial during the planned period of this study, except of the clinical trials that implicate drugs of supportive treatment</criteria>
