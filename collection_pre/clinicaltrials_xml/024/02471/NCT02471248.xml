	<brief_summary>A novel interactive exoskeleton robotic system with embedded force and motion sensors will be developed to facilitate walking of stroke patients with hemiparesis. The robot will synchronise with the gait pattern of the stroke patient to provide assistance in ankle dorsiflexion during swing phase. It is hypothesised that the robot can facilitate stable and longer walking distance for stroke patients with drop foot problem. It can be applied on unilateral side, which is suitable for stroke patients with hemiparesis. The whole system design is lightweight, compact, comfortable, and user-friendly in hospital or at home settings.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this clinical trial, participated stroke patients will be divided into two groups: Robotic group and Sham group. Stroke patients in both groups will participate in a 20-session gait training program, which includes overground walking and stair climbing exercises. Robotic group will walk with the powered Ankle Robot, which provide ankle dorsiflexion support during swing phase of walking; Sham group will walk with the Ankle Robot with very low assistance level, which provide only tactile feedback but no ankle support in order to evaluate the placebo effect. A series of clinical assessments will be carried out to assess the functional recovery in stroke patients before and after the gait training program.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Ischemic or hemorrphagic stroke with drop foot problem. 2. Sufficient cognition to follow simple instructions and to understand the content and purpose of the study. (MiniMental State Examination &gt; 21) 3. Capable of standing and walking independently for an extended period of time. (Functional Ambulation Category &gt; 3, Berg Balance Scale &gt; 40) 1. Any medical or psychological dysfunctions that would affect their ability to comply with test study protocol, such as lower back pain, neuralgia, rotational vertigo, muscloskeletal disorders, injuries, and pregnancy. 2. Any severe contractures in hip, knee, or ankle joint that would preclude passive range of motion in the lower extremity. 3. Participation in any therapeutic treatment ("outside therapy") performed with the lower extremity during the planned study, including the baseline and the followup.</criteria>
