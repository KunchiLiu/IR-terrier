	<brief_summary>To evaluate the effects of sevoflurane on hepatic blood flow (HBF) and hepatic arterial buffer response (HABR) in infants with obstructive jaundice by Doppler ultrasound.Twenty-five infants with biliary atresia (1-3 months-of-age) scheduled for a Kasai procedure were enrolled. portal vein blood flow (PBF), hepatic arterial blood flow (HABF) and hepatic blood flow (HBF) were measured by Doppler ultrasound before induction, and after inhalation of 2 and 3% sevoflurane.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Children suffering from hepatobiliary disease also have an hepatic arterial buffer response (HABR) with reduced portal vein blood flow (PBF) and compensatory increases in hepatic arterial blood flow (HABF) which can help maintain hepatic blood flow (HBF). For infants with obstructive hepatobiliary disease, reduced HBF may affect drug metabolism and increase the risk of respiratory depression during analgesia, which can be life-threatening. To evaluate the effects of sevoflurane on HBF and HABR in infants with obstructive jaundice by Doppler ultrasound.Twenty-five infants with biliary atresia (1-3 months-of-age) scheduled for a Kasai procedure were enrolled. PBF, HABF and HBF were measured by Doppler ultrasound before induction, and after inhalation of 2 and 3% sevoflurane.</detailed_description>
