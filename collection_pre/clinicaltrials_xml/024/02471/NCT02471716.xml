	<criteria>Histologically confirmed diagnosis of inoperable PVNS/ dtTGCT or potentially resectable tumor that would result in unacceptable functional loss or morbidity as determined by a qualified surgeon or multidisciplinary tumor board (must be documented in the CRF during screening) Measurable PVNS/dtTGCT by RECIST 1.1 on MRI ECOG performance status &lt;1 Prior therapy with an antiCSF1R antibody Prior therapy with PLX3397 unless discontinued for intolerance (i.e., nonprogression on prior kinase inhibitor) CK and liver function tests (including ALT, AST, and total bilirubin), outside of the range of local laboratory normal at Screening Inadequate organ or bone marrow function History of congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction &lt;1 year prior to first study dose administration Significant abnormalities on ECG at Screening Contraindications to MRI and use of intravenous gadoliniumbased contrast agents Positive test for latent TB at Screening (Quantiferon test)</criteria>
