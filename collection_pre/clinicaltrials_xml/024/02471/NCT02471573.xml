	<brief_title>Freeze All Protocol Versus Fresh Embryo Transfer in Women Undergoing In-vitro Fertilization (IVF)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF) will be treated with GnRH antagonist protocol. Recombinant Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) will be given on day 2 or day 3 of menstrual cycle for 5 days. The starting dose is individualized for each patient based on the following criteria: Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) &lt; 0.7 ng/ml, dose 300 IU/day, AMH 0.7 -2.1 ng/ml, dose 225 IU/day, AMH &gt; 2.1 ng/ml, dose 150 IU/day. After that, investigators can titrate the dose based on their clinical judgment. Follicular development will be monitored by ultrasound scanning and measurement of estradiol, progesterone starting on day 5 of stimulation. Scanning and hormonal measurement will be repeated every 2 to 3 days, depending on the size of follicles. Antagonist is routinely used on day 5 until the day of Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Criteria for recombinant hCG (5,000IU or 10,000IU) administration is the presence of at least three leading follicles of 17 mm. Oocyte retrieval is performed 36 hours after recombinant hCG administration. Insemination will be performed by using intracytoplasmic sperm injection, 3 - 4 hours after oocyte retrieval. Only matured oocytes are inseminated. Fertilization are performed under inverted microscope at period of 16-18 hours after insemination. On day 3, embryo evaluation will be performed at fixed time point 68±1 hours after fertilization, using Istanbul consensus. After grading embryo, eligible patients will be invited to participate in the study. Written consent will be obtained from each patient for participation into the study. Patients were randomized into 2 groups fresh embryo transfer and freeze-all. Eligible subjects will be randomized in blocks of 4 via a computer generated random number list to either the freeze all group or the fresh embryo transfer (ET) group. Freeze all group All grade 1 and grade 2 embryos were cryopreserved using vitrification method. In the next cycle, endometrium will be prepared by using estradiol orally, starting from day 2-3 of menstrual cycle. When endometrium thickness reaches 8mm or more, patients start to use progesterone vaginally. Embryo transfer is performed 3 days after using progesterone. On the day of embryo transfer, embryos will be thawed. Two hours after thawing, surviving embryos will be transferred into the uterus under ultrasound guidance. Luteal-phase support is done with estradiol 8mg/day and vaginal progesterone 800mg/day until 7th week of gestation. Fresh ET group In fresh ET group, maximum 2 embryos will be transferred into the uterus under ultrasound guidance. Luteal-phase support will be continued up to 7th week of gestation either therapy was provide using estradiol and exogenous progesterone supplementation or hCG with exogenous progesterone combination. In both of groups, serum hCG was measured 2 weeks after embryo transferred, and if positive, an ultrasound scan of the uterus was performed at gestational weeks 7 and 12. METHODS STUDY ENDPOINTS Primary endpoint Ongoing pregnancy rate (OPR). Ongoing pregnancy is explained as a pregnancy with positive heart beat beyond 12 weeks of gestation. Secondary endpoints Clinical pregnancy rate. Clinical pregnancy is explained as the presence of a gestational sac seen by transvaginal sonography 7 weeks after embryo placement. Implantation rate is explained as the number of gestational sacs per number of embryos transferred. Multiple pregnancy rate. Multiple pregnancy is explained as two or more fetal heart rates by transvaginal sonography 7 weeks after embryo placement. RANDOMIZATION Randomization will be performed on day 3, using a blocks of 4 via a computer generated random number list. Patients will be allocated to either the freeze all group or the fresh ET group. STUDY PROCEDURES Patients will be treated according to local protocol. SUBJECT INFORMED CONSENT A review of patient information should be done prior to enrolment to determine preliminary eligibility according to patient inclusion and exclusion criteria. When a patient signs an informed consent she is considered to be enrolled in the study. WITHDRAWAL OF INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS Patients can leave the study at any time for any reason if they wish to do so without any consequences for their treatment. The investigator can decide to withdraw a subject from the study or urgent medical reasons. SAFETY REPORTING The investigator will inform the subjects and the reviewing accredited medical research ethics committee; if anything occurs, on the basis of which it appears that the disadvantages of participation may be significantly greater than was foreseen in the research proposal. The study will be suspended pending further review by the accredited medical research ethics committee, except insofar as suspension would jeopardize the subjects' health. The investigator will take care that all subjects are kept informed. ADVERSE AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS All observed or volunteered adverse events, regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relationship to intervention, will be recorded. Adverse events are defined as any undesirable experience occurring to a subject during a clinical trial, whether or not considered related to the intervention. All adverse events reported spontaneously by the subject or observed by the investigator or his staffs will be recorded. A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose results in death; - is life threatening (at the time of the event); - requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing inpatients' hospitalisation; - results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; - is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; - is a new event of the trial likely to affect the safety of the subjects, such as an unexpected outcome of an adverse reaction. All adverse events will be followed until they have abated, or until a stable situation has been reached. Depending on the event, follow up may require additional tests or medical procedures as indicated, and/or referral to the general physician or a medical specialist. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS RECRUITMENT AND CONSENT The investigator must explain to each subject the nature of this study, its purpose, procedures, expected duration and the potential risks and benefits involved in study participation along with any discomfort it may entail. Each subject must be informed that participation in the study is voluntary and that withdrawal of consent will not affect her right to the most appropriate medical treatment or affect the doctor relationship. This informed consent should be given by means of a standard written statement. It should be written so as to be easily understood by the subject. The subject should be given the time to read and understand the statement herself before signing her consent and dating the document. The subject should receive a copy of the written statement once signed. PRIVACY ASPECTS Participating subjects will be registered by a 5-digit number. This personal code will be on all forms retrieved from participants. BENEFITS AND RISKS ASSESSMENT, GROUP RELATEDNESS There is insufficient evidence for a rational policy in between the 2 strategies, freeze all or fresh ET. The potential benefits of freeze all are higher pregnancy rate, with a lower incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and/or ectopic pregnancy. The potential harm would be time-consuming.</detailed_description>
