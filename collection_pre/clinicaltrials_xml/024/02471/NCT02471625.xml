	<brief_title>Traumatic Brain Injury Feasibility Study (EPIC-011)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant cause of death and disability in the U.S. The severity of a TBI may range from "mild" (i.e. a brief change in mental status or consciousness) to "severe" (i.e. an extended period of unconsciousness or memory loss after the injury). However, most TBI's that occur each year are mild and are commonly called concussions. Unfortunately, TBI terminology does not adequately describe the injury or impairment, its treatment, or the resulting outcomes. Due to the complexity of the human brain, each person's physiology can result in different patterns of impairment and secondary conditions, requiring different treatment or rehabilitation. The intent of EPIC ClearView™ TBI Feasibility (EPIC-011) is to collect data to further develop the ClearView™ Response Scale to measure electrophysiology associated with TBI</detailed_description>
