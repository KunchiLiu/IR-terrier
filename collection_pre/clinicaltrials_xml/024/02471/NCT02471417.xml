	<brief_summary>Acute consumption of dietary nitrate (as beetroot juice) has been shown to improve exercise capacity in athletes, healthy adults and subjects with both peripheral vascular disease or COPD. Many patients with dilated cardiomyopathy have reduced exercise capacity, The investigators hypothesized that acute nitrate consumption might increase incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) distance in dilated cardiomyopathy subjects compared to a placebo beetroot juice.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute consumption of dietary nitrate (as beetroot juice) has been shown to improve exercise capacity in athletes, healthy adults and subjects with both peripheral vascular disease or COPD. Many patients with dilated cardiomyopathy have reduced exercise capacity, The investigators hypothesized that acute nitrate consumption might increase incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) distance in dilated cardiomyopathy subjects compared to a placebo beetroot juice. This study is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Resting blood pressure, phlebotomy and ISWT will be performed. Following completion, each subject is randomized to consume beetroot juice or placebo. 3 hours later, the same assessments are repeated by the same people. After a 7d washout, the entire protocol is repeated with the crossover beverage.</detailed_description>
