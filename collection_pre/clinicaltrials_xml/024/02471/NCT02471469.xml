	<brief_summary>The primary aim is to show whether a reduction in tumor related mRNAs and a panel of selected miRNAS can be used to personalize enzalutamide therapy. Furthermore the aim is to explore the relation between drug exposure and the decrease in the selected biomarkers and treatment response.</brief_summary>
