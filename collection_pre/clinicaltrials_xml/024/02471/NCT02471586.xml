	<brief_title>ILUMIEN III: OPTIMIZE PCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, post market, international, multi-center, randomized trial. Patients undergoing coronary angiography with possibility of PCI will be consented to participate in the study. Patients who provide informed consent and who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized 1:1:1 to undergo PCI with either OCT, IVUS, or Angiography guidance. All patients will undergo baseline and post PCI imaging with their randomized modality. In addition, the Angiography and IVUS groups will undergo a blinded post-PCI OCT run to allow comparison of OCT derived minimum stent area (MSA) in both groups. After hospital discharge, all patients will have clinical follow-up at 30 days and 1 year.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>General 1. Age ≥ 18 years. 2. Patient with an indication for PCI including: Angina (stable or unstable), Silent ischemia (a visually estimated target lesion diameter stenosis of ≥70%, a positive noninvasive stress test, or fractional flow reserve (FFR) ≤0.80 must be present), NonST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), or Recent ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (&gt;24 hours from initial presentation and stable). 3. Patients will undergo cardiac catheterization and possible or definite PCI with intent to stent using any noninvestigational metallic drugeluting stent (DES) 4. Signed written informed consent Angiographic inclusion criteria: 1. The target lesion must be located in a native coronary artery with visually estimated reference vessel diameter of ≥2.25 mm to ≤3.50 mm. 2. Lesion length &lt;40mm Note: Overlapping stents are allowed General 1. Estimated creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min using CockcroftGault equation, unless the patient is on dialysis 2. STEMI within 24 hours of initial time of presentation to the first treating hospital, whether at a transfer facility or the study hospital. 3. PCI within 24 hours preceding the study procedure. 4. PCI of a lesion within the target vessel within 12 months prior to the study procedure 5. Planned use of bare metal stent (BMS) 6. Planned use of bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) 7. Cardiogenic shock (defined as persistent hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mm/Hg for more than 30 minutes) or requiring pressors or hemodynamic support, including Intraaortic balloon pump (IABP), at time of procedure. 8. Mobitz II second degree or complete heart block 9. Malignant ventricular arrhythmias requiring treatment 10. Pulmonary edema defined as patient with shortness of breath, evidence of volume overload on physical exam, and crepitations on physical exam (&gt;1/3 of lungs) or radiographic interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema 11. Subject is intubated. 12. Known left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;30%. 13. Severe valvular disease (e.g. severe mitral regurgitation or severe aortic stenosis) 14. Cerebrovascular accident ( CVA) or transient ischemic attack within the past 6 months, or any permanent neurologic defect attributed to CVA. 15. Presence of one or more comorbidities which reduces life expectancy to less than 12 months or may interfere with protocol study processes. 16. Known allergy to protocolrequired concomitant medications including aspirin; clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor; heparin and bivalirudin; or iodinated contrast that cannot be adequately premedicated. 17. Patient is participating in any other investigational drug or device clinical trial that has not reached its primary endpoint. 18. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding (women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within one week before treatment). Angiographic 1. The presence of any nonstudy lesion in the target vessel with angiographic diameter stenosis &gt;50%, or any additional target vessel stenosis which requires PCI either during or within 12 months after the study procedure Note: Patients may have nonstudy lesions in a nontarget vessel that require PCI. These lesions must be treated prior to randomization, with the procedure being successful and uncomplicated. Alternatively nonstudy lesions in a nontarget vessel may be treated &gt;24 hours prior to or &gt;48 hours after the study procedure. Successful and uncomplicated procedure is defined as &lt;30% visually estimated residual diameter stenosis, Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Grade 3 flow, no dissection ≥ National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) type C, no perforation, no prolonged chest pain or ST segment elevation or depression (&gt;30 minutes), no periprocedural myocardial infarction (MI) as measured by creatine kinaseMB (CKMB) &gt;5x upper limits of normal (ULN) or troponin &gt;35x ULN. 2. Left main diameter stenosis ≥30% or left main PCI planned. 3. Study target lesion in a bypass graft 4. Ostial right coronary artery (RCA) study target lesion 5. Chronic total occlusion (TIMI flow 0/1) study target lesion 6. Bifurcation study lesion with a planned dual stent strategy 7. Instent restenosis study target lesion 8. Any study lesion characteristic resulting in the expected inability to deliver the IVUS or OCT catheter to the lesion pre and post PCI (e.g. moderate or severe vessel calcification or tortuosity)</criteria>
