	<criteria>NYHA(New York Heart Association) Class III IV, and symptomatic severe functional MR by 2014 ACC/AHA guideline in spite of optimal medical treatment. (For optimal medical treatments, ①ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker ②βblocker ③ aldosterone antagonists should be given for at least 3 months unless the subject has contraindication for each drug) Primary Mitral Regurgitation LV ejection fraction lower than 25% Creatinine ≥2.0 mg/dL Anomaly of Coronary Sinus Preexisting devices in coronary sinus such as Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator and Pacemaker 2:1 Atriventricular AV block or higher AV block and ventricular tachycardia Subjects with functional MR who need CABG or AVR performed Subjects who have functional MR caused by aortic valve disease Subjects who have uncontrollable hyperthyroidism Subjects who have severe TR due to primary valve leaflet disease Subjects who cannot be screened by cardiac CT Subjects who have possibility of coronary artery pinching even with Mitral Loop Cerclage system judged by cardiac CT Subjects who are unable to take antiplatelet agents Subjects who are participated in other clinical trials within 1 month of enrollment Subjects who have coagulation disorders Subjects who have thrombosis and embolism Subjects who are pregnant, or lactating, or plan pregnancy during the clinical trials Subjects who are deemed not to be eligible in this study by physician's discretion</criteria>
