	<brief_summary>Nipple areolar-complex (NAC) sparing mastectomy, extending the concept of skin-sparing mastectomy, allows to leave the nipple-areola complex intact and to provide a better cosmetic result. Large operable T2-T3 breast cancer (BC), treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, may theoretically appear suitable for this surgical option, alternative to conventional mastectomy or breast conserving surgery in case of unfavorable size of the breast, when a good response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been achieved.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NAC Sparing Mastectomy After Neo-adjuvant Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>From January 2009 to May 2013, 422 BC patients were progressively accrued to NAC-sparing mastectomy, of which 361 invasive BC patients underwent NAC-sparing mastectomy as first treatment (NAC-group), whereas 61 T2-T3 invasive BC patients underwent surgery after primary chemotherapy (NAC-PC group). 151 BC patients underwent primary chemotherapy and conventional mastectomy (PC group) from 2004 to 2009, has been evaluated as comparative group respect to NAC-PC group. Using propensity score matching, local disease-free survival (LDFS) in NAC-PC patients was first compared with that in PC patients. The NAC-PC cohort was then compared to NAC patients in terms of LDFS using two different matching criteria, one with tumor size after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and one with tumor size before neoadjuvant chemotherapy as balancing covariates.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>T2T3 N0N1 breast cancer (NACPC and PC groups). T1T3 N01 M0 breast cancer (NACgroup) In our series of NACsparing mastectomy patients, with or without treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the selection of patients for NACsparing mastectomy has been made on the basis of the following criterions: tumor nodule without adherence to the skin, no nipple retraction, retroareolar main duct free for neoplastic tissue inside at frozen section examination. Furthermore, patients were considered still eligible for NACsparing mastectomy even if the tumor lies in close proximity (&lt;1 cm) to the NAC at physical and radiological examination. (NACPC and PC groups). Exclusion criteria for the present study were all the other breast cancer patients, particularly T4 breast cancer with inflammatory or ulcerated breast cancer before chemotherapy and patients with synchronous distant metastases. Patients affected with other clinical diseases (i.e. cardiovascular diseases) conditioning the optimal therapeutic strategy were excluded. For NACsparing mastectomy, exclusion criterions were nipple retraction, Paget's disease, inflammatory changes of the breast and bloody discharge from the nipple. The study did not exclude women with prior breast augmentation, heavy smokers, obese patients.</criteria>
