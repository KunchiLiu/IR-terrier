	<criteria>1. Clinically significant, symptomatic (NYHA Functional Class II or greater) functional or secondary, tricuspid regurgitation (per applicable guidelines) requiring tricuspid valve repair or replacement as assessed by the Heart Team 2. NYHA Functional Class II or greater or signs of persistent right heart failure despite optimal medical therapy 3. Determined by the 'HEART Team' (a minimum of one Cardiologist, and one Cardiac Surgeon) to be at high surgical risk for tricuspid valve repair or replacement and the benefitrisk analysis supports utilization of the investigational device See Protocol</criteria>
