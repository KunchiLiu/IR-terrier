	<brief_summary>Most patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) will require long saphenous vein (LSV) harvesting from the leg. This has been reported to be associated with a significant morbidity (leg swelling, pain, infection, bruising, wound discharge) in up to 50% of patients. Endoscopic vein harvesting (EVH) which has been reported to be associated with a reduction in these complications was implemented within the investigators' service in 2012. Although some initial reports of concerns regarding graft patency when the LSV is harvested by EVH, NICE and European Cardiology Society (ESC/EACTS) guidelines 2014 supported the use of the EVH technology. Last year a service evaluation in the investigators' department showed significant cost benefit of EVH as compared to open vein harvest (OVH) in a matched group (50 EVH and 50 OVH patients). The purpose of this study is to evaluate this group further to assess the incidence of MACCE (Major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event) and patient's quality of life (QOL) at least 1 year after their surgery. MACCE will be assessed by contacting the patient's GP and/or Cardiologist and QOL questionnaire (SF12v2) will be sent to patients along with a patient information sheet. It is estimated that data collection would be completed within 3 months of start.</brief_summary>
