	<brief_summary>The management of functional psychogenic movement disorders (FNPMD) is challenging for neurologists and psychiatrists and only comprehensive multidisciplinary treatment programme can be worthwhile for these patients (Moene et al 2002). Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have demonstrated abnormalities in motor control at cortical level, hyperactivity of limbic system and disturbance of connectivity between these two systems leading to a lack of self-agency, (Voon et al 2010,2011).Two recent studies suggested a possible therapeutic effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in FNPMD (Dakotakis 2011, Garcin, 2013). In this protocol our objectives are twofold : 1. to compare the effect of 5 consecutive daily sessions of rTMS on FNPMD in a double-blind randomized controlled study 2. to study the effect of 3 weekly hypnosis sessions combined with rTMS in FNPMD</brief_summary>
