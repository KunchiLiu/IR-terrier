	<detailed_description>This is a Canadian randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo when used to treat subjects with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the knee, and with clinical features of inflammation, whose pain persists despite receiving maximum tolerated doses of conventional therapy. A total of 130 subjects will be entered into the study. Subjects will be randomized (1:1) at baseline to receive either adalimumab 40 mg every other week or placebo for 16 weeks. The study drug will be self-administered via subcutaneous injection. Efficacy will be assessed at week 16 while the safety of the study drug will be monitored throughout the study. At week 16 all subjects will begin to receive open label adalimumab 40 mg every other week.</detailed_description>

Has voluntarily signed and dated an approved informed consent form prior to any studyspecific procedures. 1. Has a history of an allergic reaction or significant sensitivity to constituents of adalimumab. 2.

History of uncontrolled diabetes, unstable ischemic heart disease, active congestive heart failure, New York Heart Association (NHYA) III, IV, inflammatory bowel disease, active peptic ulcer disease, recent stroke (within 12 weeks of Screening), or any other condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, would put the patient at risk by participating in the study. 11.
