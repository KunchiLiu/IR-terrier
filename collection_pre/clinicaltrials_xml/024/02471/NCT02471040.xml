	<brief_summary>This study is designed to examine the value of infusing BHB in type 1 diabetic subjects during experimentally induced hypoglycemic episode in conjunction with testing of cognitive function. This will lay the basis for subsequent trials exploring the novel use of therapeutic doses of oral ketone formulations that are currently under commercial development, which could serve as adjunct therapies to protect the brain from hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetic subjects experiencing recurrent hypoglycemia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Healthy controls as well as type 1 diabetic subjects will undergo a hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp with concomitant BHB or saline (control) infusion in random order. During each experimental condition the participants will complete a battery of validated cognitive tests that are sensitive to the cognitive impairment typically caused by hypoglycemia.</detailed_description>
