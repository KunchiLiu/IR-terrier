	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find an optimal inspiratory pressure to provide adequate tidal volume and prevent gastric insufflation in pediatric patients. The children under 5 years old are randomly assigned to muscle relaxation group and non-relaxation group. For muscle relaxation group, routine anesthesia induction is performed with muscle relaxant and mask ventilation is started by pressure-controlled mechanical ventilation. Gastric auscultation and abdominal ultrasonography are performed simultaneously during mask ventilation to detect inflow of air. Initial inspiratory airway pressure is 10 cmH2O and increased gradually by 2 cmH2O until gastric insufflation is detected by either of two methods. Tracheal intubation is done after detection of gas. For non-relaxation group, mask ventilation is performed in a same manner, without muscle relaxant. After detection of gas by any of the two methods, rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg is administered and tracheal intubation is performed.</brief_summary>

Respiratory rates are 25 per minutes in infants and 20 in children over 1 years old. Tidal volume and oxygen saturation are recorded during study period.</detailed_description>
