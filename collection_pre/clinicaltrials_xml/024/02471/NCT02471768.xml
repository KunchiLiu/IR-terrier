	<brief_summary>Abstract Objectives: Primary: To study the association between central aortic blood pressure indices and coronary artery disease in patients undergoing elective angiography. Secondary: (a) To study whether any association exists between central aortic pressure indices and the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in the same patients during a 6 month follow up period. (b) To study whether any association exists between the central aortic pressures and peripheral pressures. Methods: The investigators conducted a prospective observational study in consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography. Central and peripheral pressures were invasively recorded and coronary artery disease (CAD) classified into obstructive and non-obstructive group. CAD severity was graded using the Gensini score and subjects were divided into tertiles. Patients were followed up and the role of central aortic pressure indices in the prediction of cardiovascular events were analysed.</brief_summary>
