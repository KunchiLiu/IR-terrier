	<detailed_description>Colonic fermentation has been shown to influence oeso-gastric motility : increased gastric relaxation, increased rate of lower esophageal sphincter relaxation. Experimental increased colonic fermentation (FOS in diet) increase the occurrence of reflux events in patients with GERD. The aim of this study is to compare the low-FODMAP diet and classical GERD dietary recommendations (avoid fatty meals, head of bed elevation etc..) in patients with refractory GERD symptoms.</detailed_description>
