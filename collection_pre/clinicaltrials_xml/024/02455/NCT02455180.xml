	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics of Two Different High-dose Regimens of Intravenous Vitamin C in Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale: Critically ill patients with trauma or sepsis exhibit a high degree of vitamin C deficiency at ICU admission and vitamin C plasma concentrations decrease even more during the first three days of admission. Vitamin C is a natural anti-oxidant and crucial for endothelial and organ protection Objective: To determine the pharmacokinetics of two high dose regimens of intravenous vitamin C in critically ill patients, in particular the attained plasma concentration and the fraction retained in the body and excreted in urine. Study design: Prospective randomized controlled pharmacokinetic intervention study Study population: Adult critically ill patients admitted to the ICU of the VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, with sepsis or SIRS after major surgery or trauma with a non-neurological sequential organ failure (SOFA) score &gt;6 and an expected length of ICU stay of &gt;96 hours. Intervention (if applicable): Patients will receive either 1 or 5 gram vitamin C intravenously twice daily for two days.</detailed_description>
