	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to try and achieve similar glycemic control in general non-Intensive Care Unit (non-ICU) patients with Type 2 Diabetes with exenatide alone or in combination with basal insulin as compared to treatment with basal bolus insulin alone. The association between hyperglycemia and poor clinical outcomes in patients with diabetes is well established. Previous studies have shown that basal bolus insulin regimens improve glycemic control and reduce the rate of hospital complications compared to sliding scale regular insulin (SSRI) therapy, but has a significant risk of hypoglycemia. The investigators will compare the efficacy and safety of exenatide alone or in combination with basal insulin to control high blood glucose levels resulting in a lower risk of hypoglycemia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The association between hyperglycemia and poor clinical outcomes in patients with diabetes is well established. Data from previous trials in hospitalized patients have shown a strong association between hyperglycemia and poor clinical outcomes, such as mortality, morbidity, length of stay (LOS), infections and overall complications. Basal bolus insulin regimens improve glycemic control and reduce the rate of hospital complications compared to sliding scale regular insulin (SSRI). However, the use of basal bolus is labor intensive, requiring multiple daily insulin injections, and has a significant risk of hypoglycemia. The investigators will study if treatment with exenatide alone or in combination with basal insulin will result in similar glycemic control and a lower frequency of hypoglycemia than treatment with basal bolus in general non-Intensive Care Unit (non-ICU) patients with Type 2 Diabetes.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. A known history of Type 2 Diabetes receiving either diet alone or oral antidiabetic drugs (OAD) including insulin secretagogues, pioglitazone, DPP4 inhibitors, or metformin as monotherapy or in combination therapy, or lowdose insulin at &lt;0.5 unit/kg/day. 2. Males or females between the ages of 18 and 80 years discharged after hospital admission from general medicine and surgery services (nonIntensive Care Unit setting). 3. Subjects with an admission / randomization BG &lt; 400 mg/dL without laboratory evidence of diabetic ketoacidosis (serum bicarbonate &lt; 18 mEq/L or positive serum or urinary ketones). 4. Admission HbA1c between 7% and 10% 5. BMI range: &gt; 25 Kg/m^2 and &lt; 45 Kg/m^2 1. Age &lt; 18 or &gt; 80 years 2. Subjects with increased blood glucose (BG) concentration, but without a history of diabetes (stress hyperglycemia) 3. Subjects with a history of type 1 diabetes (suggested by BMI &lt; 25 Kg/m^2 requiring insulin therapy or with a history of diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, or ketonuria). 4. Treatment with highdose (&gt;0.5 unit/kg/day) insulin or with GLP1 RA during the past 3 months prior to admission. 5. Patients that required ICU care during the hospital admission. 6. Recurrent severe hypoglycemia or hypoglycemic unawareness. 7. Subjects with gastrointestinal obstruction, gastroparesis, history of pancreatitis or those expected to require gastrointestinal suction. 8. Patients with clinically relevant pancreatic or gallbladder disease. 9. Patients with unstable or rapidly progressing renal disease or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min) 10. Patients with clinically significant hepatic disease (cirrhosis, jaundice, endstage liver disease), 11. History of hypersensitivity to exenatide 12. Treatment with oral or injectable corticosteroid (equal to a prednisone dose &gt;5 mg/day), parenteral nutrition and immunosuppressive treatment. 13. Patients with history of heavy alcohol use (female &gt; 2 drinks per day, male &gt; 3 drinks per day) or drug abuse within 3 months prior to admission. 14. Mental condition rendering the subject unable to understand the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study. 15. Female subjects who are pregnant or breast feeding at time of enrollment into the study.</criteria>
