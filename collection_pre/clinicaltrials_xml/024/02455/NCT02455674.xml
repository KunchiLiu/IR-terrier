	<brief_summary>Weight calculation based on age could be performed according to APLS (Advanced Pediatric Life Support) guideline recommendations in children requiring emergency treatment and intervention in the field or during resuscitation with no active weight and height measurements. The aim of the study is to investigate the suitability of weight calculation using mean ages on clothing size labels (ACL) to the actual weight in real emergencies with no known actual age of the patient (AA).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Weight calculation based on age could be performed according to APLS guideline recommendations in children requiring emergency treatment and intervention in the field or during resuscitation with no active weight and height measurements. Age formulas require only knowledge of the actual age of the child and widely used all over the world with being catchy. However, situations in which one has to intervene a child without having any patient data, including information on children's ages, especially in the field or during resuscitation are not uncommon. The objective of this study is to investigate the availability of age information contained in clothing size labels of children in weight calculation according to APLS recommendations. Usability of labels can protect victims from overdose and underdose problems in cases where the actual age is unknown and the measurements cannot be done</detailed_description>
