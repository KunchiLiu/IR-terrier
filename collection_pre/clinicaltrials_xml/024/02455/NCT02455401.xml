	<brief_title>Effect of Remifentanil on Postoperative Vomiting in Pediatric Strabismus Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children undergoing strabismus surgery frequently experience postoperative vomiting (POV) that results in dehydration, aspiration pneumonia, bleeding, delayed hospital discharge, as well as decreased parental satisfaction and an unpleasant experience for the pediatric patients. Although administration of perioperative opioids increases POV incidence, remifentanil has less affect the incidence of POV than other opioids such as fentanyl. However, there are few study that evaluate the effects of remifentanil on the incidence of POV. Therefore, the investigators will conducted the study that the effects of remifentanil on the incidence of POV in children undergoing strabismus surgery during sevoflurane anesthesia. One hundred five children from 3 to 6 yr of age, ASA physical status 1 or 2 were assigned randomly selected to one of three groups: high dose remifentanil group (bolus 1.0 mcg/kg; infusion 0.1 mcg/kg/min), low remifentanil group (bolus 0.5 mcg/kg; infusion 0.1 mcg/kg/min), or no remifentanil group (no remifentanil administration). Primary endpoint, the incidence of POV for 24 hours postoperatively, will be compared between three study groups.</detailed_description>
