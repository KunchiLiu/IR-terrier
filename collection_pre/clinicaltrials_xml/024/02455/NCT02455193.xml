	<brief_summary>This study plans to learn more about how common drugs prescribed to individuals with schizophrenia contribute to weight gain, as well as how exercise and diet impact appetite and the brain's response to food. In this study, the investigators will be evaluating how patients' brains respond to food images as well as asking questions about their food preferences and intake and clinical symptoms. The investigators may also ask patients to complete an exercise or diet intervention to see how this changes brain responses or food preferences.</brief_summary>
