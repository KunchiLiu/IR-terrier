	<brief_title>Cytokines Associated With Cord Blood Cell Therapy for Neonatal Encephalopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effects and mechanisms of umbilical cord blood cell therapy for perinatal brain injury are not well understood. This is a multicenter study to measure serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and trophic factors associated with perinatal brain injury and repair in term gestation newborns with neonatal encephalopathy (hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy). This study proceeds along with the study "Autologous cord blood cell therapy for neonatal encephalopathy (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02256618)". Blood samples are obtained before the first cell infusion, and subsequently 2h, 24h, 48h, and 7 days after the first cell infusion. Blood samples are obtained in the same manner from newborns with neonatal encephalopathy who are not receiving the cell therapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Infants are eligible if they meet all the following inclusion criteria except 4. 1. ≥36 weeks gestation 2. Either a 10minute Apgar score ≤5, continued need for resuscitation for at least 10 minutes, or severe acidosis, defined as pH &lt;7.0 or base deficit ≥16 mmol/L in a sample of umbilical cord blood or any blood during the first hour after birth 3. Moderate to severe encephalopathy (Sarnat II to III) 4. A moderately or severely abnormal background amplitudeintegrated EEG (aEEG) voltage, or seizures identified by aEEG, if monitored 5. Up to 24 hours of age 6. A person with parental authority must have consented for the study. 1. Known major congenital anomalies, such as chromosomal anomalies, heart diseases 2.
