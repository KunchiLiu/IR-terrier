	<brief_summary>White matter tracts connect cortical areas to other parts of the cortex, to basal ganglia and to the brain stem and spinal cord. These tracts form the internal part of the brain and transmit the nervous impulses. Changes in brain white matter may serve as biomarkers for numerous neurological diseases. Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) is a non-invasive MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) technique providing information on white matter tracts (tractography) by studying water diffusion. Since it is based on complex mathematical models that only indirectly evaluates the underlying anatomy, tractography need to be validated before being used for research and clinical purposes. Several validation techniques were previously proposed, none of them being fully convincing in human.</brief_summary>
