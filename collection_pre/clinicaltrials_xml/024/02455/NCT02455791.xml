	<detailed_description>If you agree to take part in this study, you will have an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the tumor site. To perform this biopsy, a needle is inserted into the affected area using an ultrasound to collect cells or tissue from a tumor mass. The doctor will use the ultrasound to guide the needle into the area. Two (2) types of samples will be collected: a fine needle aspirate (FNA) that collects cells and a core biopsy that collects a small piece of tissue. If the tumor is not seen well by the ultrasound, the study doctor may use a mammogram to perform the biopsy. You will then have the same planned surgery and post-operative care that you would normally have. You will sign a separate consent for your surgery. Your medical records may be reviewed and information recorded from your routine follow-up visits in order to follow your general health and the outcome of your surgery. Length of Study Participation: Your active participation in this study will be finished when you have had your surgery and completed your post-operative care. This is an investigational study. It is investigational to compare the use of an ultrasound-guided biopsy with what is found during surgery in finding evidence of the disease. Up to 40 participants will take part on this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
