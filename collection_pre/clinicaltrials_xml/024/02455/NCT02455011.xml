	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose escalation study to evaluate safety, tolerability, PK and PD of single and repeated SC doses of REMD-477 in Type 2 diabetic subjects. The study will be conducted at multiple sites in the United States and will enroll approximately 102 subjects with Type 2 diabetes who are either treatment-naïve, controlled with diet and exercise or treated with oral antidiabetic medications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of REMD-477 in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will consist of three parts: Part A - Dose Escalation, Part B - Adaptive Dose Cohort, and Part C - REMD-477 in Combination with Metformin. Part A includes 5 cohorts that will be enrolled and dosed sequentially at escalating doses. Each cohort will consist of 12 subjects randomized in a 3:1 (active: placebo) fashion. Part B includes a single dose cohort that will enroll 12 subjects (9 on active treatment and 3 on placebo) with dose level and frequency determined by a Dose Level Review Meeting (DLRM)Committee. Part C includes 2 cohorts of T2DM patients currently treated with metformin alone, and each cohort will consist of 15 subjects (10 on active treatment and 3 on placebo).</detailed_description>
