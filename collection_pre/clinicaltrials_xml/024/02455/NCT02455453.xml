	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the uptake of a radioactive tracer 21-18F-fluoro-16α,17α-[(R)-(1'-α-furylmethylidene)dioxy]-19-norpregn-4-ene-3,20-dione (FFNP) uptake, which binds to breast cancer progesterone receptors (PgRs) on a PET/CT scan before and after administration of estradiol for one day (estrogen challenge) to determine if the change in uptake is a predictor of response to endocrine therapy (ET) in patients with hormone-sensitive estrogen receptor positive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer. Estradiol is the most potent of the naturally occurring estrogens, and can be administered to treat menopausal symptoms and also sometimes to treat metastatic breast cancer. The investigators propose to study patients with biopsy-proven newly diagnosed, locally advanced, metastatic, or recurrent breast cancer who are going to be treated with endocrine therapy (ET) (tamoxifen,aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant as standard of care therapy. Subjects will undergo a total of two FFNP-PET/CT scans; one before and a second one immediately following the one day estradiol challenge before the start of standard of care ET. The estradiol challenge will consist of administering a total of 6 mg of estradiol orally (three doses of 2 mg each) given at approximately 8 hour intervals and over a 24 hour period.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patient must be postmenopausal defined as meeting one or more of the following: Age ≥ 60 years Amenorrheic for at least 12 months Surgically sterile having undergone bilateral oophorectomy, FSH level in postmenopausal range according to institutional standards (note folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) laboratory testing must be ordered as standard of care to determine optimal treatment and should not be ordered simply to confirm eligibility to this study) Premenopausal patients who are medically induced to become postmenopausal for purposes of receiving endocrine therapy as standard of care treatment are eligible with documentation of appropriate lab testing. 2. Patient must have histological or cytological confirmed metastatic / locally advanced breast cancer. 3. Patient must have any one of the following types of breast cancer: ER+/PgR+/HER2 or ER+/PgR/HER2. ER+ is defined as Allred score of at least 4 and greater. PgR+ is defined as Allred score of at least 4 and greater. Immunohistochemistry or IHC is the primary assay methodology for HER2. HER2 refers to HER2 of 0, 1+ by IHC or negative by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) 4. Planned standard of care therapy for treatment of breast cancer with single agent endocrine therapy for a minimum of 6 months 5. Patient must have at least one measurable lesion by radiological evaluation (ultrasound, mammography, MRI, CT, PET) or physical examination. Patients with evaluable osseous metastasis that are lytic or mixed lyticsclerotic are eligible. 6. Patient must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent document. 7. Prior or chemotherapy or endocrine therapy for early stage disease is permitted if completed ≥ 12 months prior to study entry. 8. The patient must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 02. 9. The patient should have a life expectancy of &gt; 6 months. 1. Patient with other invasive malignancies, with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer or cervical carcinoma insitu, who had (or have) any evidence of the other cancer present within the last 5 years 2. Unable to tolerate up to 60 min of PET imaging per imaging session. 3. Patients with hepatic only disease are not eligible because of high hepatic uptake related to hepatobiliary elimination of FFNP. 4. Patients with nonmeasurable nonevaluable lesions such as pleural effusion are not eligible to participate. 5. Patients with vertebral lesions that, in the opinion of the principal Investigator and the treating medical oncologist, pose an imminent risk for cord compression.</criteria>
