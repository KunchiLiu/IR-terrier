	<brief_summary>Randomized, double-blind, crossover-trial, 30 subjects in each groups, either males or females, normal fasting glucose or pre-diabetes, aged &gt; 18 years old to perform oral sucrose tolerance with either one of the 5 study products 1. Sucrose 50 g 2. Sucrose 50 g + D-allulose (psicose) 2.5 g 3. Sucrose 50 g + D-allulose (psicose) 5 g 4. Sucrose 50 g + D-allulose (psicose) 7.5 g 5. Sucrose 50 g + D-allulose (psicose) 10 g Primary endpoints: 1. To investigate the dose-response effects of D- allulose (psicose) with sucrose beverage on glucose tolerance 2. To investigate the dose-response effects of D- allulose (psicose) with sucrose beverage on insulin levels</brief_summary>

Any symptom reported by the participants will be recorded as an adverse events with details of the event, its severity, start and stop dates, and relationship to study products. Gastrointestinal symptoms (heartburn, distension, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, flatulence, constipation and diarrhea) within 24 hours after OSTT will be asked and recorded as well. Withdrawal criteria 1. Those who are not able to complete 5 visits of OSTT within 8 weeks 2. Those who cannot provide 24-hour dietary record at each visit 3. Those who start any medication that might cause increasing in plasma glucose during participating in the study</detailed_description>
