	<brief_summary>FERARI is a single centre observational study comparing patients undergoing PCI either using radial compression devices or femoral closure devices at the corresponding access site. First primary outcomes consist of the occurrence of vascular complications at the arterial access site including major bleedings as defined by common classification systems Second primary outcomes consist of the occurrence of adverse cardiac events including all-cause mortality, target lesion and vessel revascularization (TLR and TVR) during 30 days and 12 months of follow-up.</brief_summary>
