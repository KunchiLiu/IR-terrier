	<brief_title>Protective Effects of Oral L-Arginine CI-AKI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is a common complication in hospitalized patients. Nitric oxide-signal transduction plays an important role in prevention of CI-AKI. L-Arginine is an amino acid involved in ammonia detoxification, and is well known as a precursor to nitric oxide, a key component of endothelial-derived relaxing factor. This is a prospective randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial among CKD stage 3-4 patients undergoing computer tomography. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to two groups: (1) arginine 3 g/day or 6 capsules per day, and (2) placebo 6 capsules per day for 3 days before contrast media injection. Serum cystatin C, serum creatinine and estimated GFR was measured at baseline and 48 hours after procedure.</detailed_description>
