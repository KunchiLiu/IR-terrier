	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to develop a screening tool to help identify family members who may need professional emotional support. The investigators are interested in enrolling family members of patients with advanced cancer care as well as family members who have lost a loved one to cancer. Some screening tools to identify family members who might need support do exist, but the investigators are hoping to develop one that is brief and easier for healthcare providers to use. The information learned in this study will help us refine the screening tool. The investigators are interviewing family members to identify which questions or items work well, which seem unclear, and to understand how a family member might approach completing the screening tool. Family member input will be essential in the development of this screening tool.</brief_summary>
