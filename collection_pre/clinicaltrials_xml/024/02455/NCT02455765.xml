	<brief_summary>The study will investigate if consumption of amino acid mixtures results a change in glycemic response of carbohydrate (white rice) and insulinemic response at different doses and timing (before consumption of carbohydrate).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glycemic Response of Co-ingesting Carbohydrate and Amino Acids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy male subjects will be served with amino acid mixtures in combinations of two doses and three time points along with white rice as control. The combinations were either low or high levels of amino acid mixtures. This was consumed together or 15 min, 30 min before consumption of white rice. Postprandial blood glucose and plasma insulin concentrations were measured at fasting and every 15 min after consumption of treatment meal until 60 min after the consumption of white rice. Subsequent blood sample were taken at 30 min interval until 210min. The glucose and insulin in the blood will be analysed.</detailed_description>
