	<brief_title>Efficacy of iLid Cleanser (Avenova) Versus Vehicle on Ocular Skin Flora</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an adaptive design, randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, multicenter, parallel group study with two treatment arms: NovaBay iLid Cleanser ("Cleanser") and Cleanser Vehicle ("Vehicle"). The study will be conducted in two Stages, each preceded by a pre-randomization phase. Randomization of Cleanser:Vehicle will be 1:1 and 2:1 in Stages 1 and 2 respectively. In the pre-randomization phase for Stages 1 and 2, subjects who meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will be evaluated by clinical examination at a single visit prior to having ocular skin specimens taken before and after treatment with open-label Cleanser. In the randomization phase for both Stages 1 and 2, subjects who meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will be randomized and evaluated at three visits: - Visit 1: Screening, Day 1 - Visit 2: Day 11 (+2) End of Treatment (EOT) - Visit 3: Day 18 (±2) Post Treatment Evaluation/Exit Subjects will have ocular skin specimens taken at Visit 1, Day 1. The specimens will be collected before and 20 minutes after the first application of the study Investigational Product performed by study personnel.</detailed_description>
