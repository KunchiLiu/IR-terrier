	<brief_summary>Many studies have worked on the efficacy and safety of Intravenous magnesium sulfate and inhaled steroids beside the standard treatment for patients with severe asthma attacks. Investigators hypothesize that, two doses if intravenous magnesium sulfate with or without inhaled budesonide, would make the stay at the Pediatric emergency center (PEC) lesser,and decrease the need of being admitted to Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) for children with severe asthma attacks,compared to single dose of magnesium sulfate with or without inhaled budesonide.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Two Doses of the Intravenous Magnesium Sulfate Versus the Standard Single Dose ,With/ Without the Nebulized Budesonide For the Management of the Severe Asthma Exacerbation in the Emergency Room; A Randomized Controlled Trial.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient with severe asthma attack, will be admitted to observation area in PEC and assessed for eligibility to the study by attending physician based on our study inclusion criteria. Eligible patient will be enrolled after obtaining written consent. Patient will receive routine treatment for severe asthma attack like,inhaled bronchodilators plus intravenous steroids,and oxygen supplements if needed. Standard blood work and chest XRay test will be obtained ,and bronchial asthma severity score will be measured initially before starting treatment then at 4,8,12,24,36,48 and thereafter. The medical team as well as parents and patient will be blinded to the medications delivered. Patient will be randomized into one of the four study groups and adverse effects of the medications in each group will be monitored and documented carefully.</detailed_description>
