	<brief_title>Study to Investigate Effects of Repeated Administration of Itraconazole on Pharmacokinetics of JNJ-42847922 in Healthy Male Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), fixed-sequence, single-center, single-dose study designed to assess the effects of steady-state itraconazole exposure on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of JNJ 42847922 in healthy male participants. The duration of study will be approximately of 6 weeks per participant. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening (that is, 21 days before study commences on Day 1); Open-label Treatment (6 days); and Follow-up (7 to 14 days after last dose of study drug or early withdrawal). All eligible participants will receive single oral doses of 5 milligram (mg) JNJ-42847922 on Day 1 and Day 6. A daily dose of 200 mg itraconazole will be administered from Day 2 to Day 6. Followed by an overnight fast of at least 8 hours participants will be administered with study treatment 30 minutes after light breakfast. Participants will not be allowed to have food until 4 hours of drug administration. Blood samples will be collected for evaluation of pharmacokinetics at pre-dose and post-dose of study treatment. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
