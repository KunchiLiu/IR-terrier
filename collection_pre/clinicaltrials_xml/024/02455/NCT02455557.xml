	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well vaccine therapy works when given together with temozolomide in treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Vaccines made from the survivin peptide or antigen may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells that express survivin. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known whether temozolomide is more effective with or without vaccine therapy in treating glioblastoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SurVaxM Vaccine Therapy and Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate 6-month progression-free survival (PFS6) in patients with survivin positive newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treated with at least 4 doses of SVN53-67/M57-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) peptide vaccine (SurVaxM) and standard of care temozolomide. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety and tolerability of SurVaxM in patients receiving standard care adjuvant temozolomide. II. To evaluate overall survival (OS) in patients with survivin positive newly diagnosed GBM treated with SurVaxM and adjuvant temozolomide. III. To describe the immune response in patients treated with SurVaxM and predictors of response. IV. To evaluate objective tumor response rate (applicable only for patients with evaluable disease at study entry, as defined per Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology [RANO] criteria) and predictors of response. OUTLINE: Patients receive the first priming dose of SVN53-67/M57-KLH peptide vaccine in emulsion with montanide ISA 51 subcutaneously (SC) and sargramostim SC within 7-28 days after completion of chemoradiation. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for a total of 4 doses in the vaccine priming phase and then every 12 weeks during the adjuvant phase in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive standard adjuvant temozolomide orally (PO) or intravenously (IV) on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses or more (at the discretion of the investigator) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may then receive maintenance SVN53-67/M57-KLH peptide vaccine in emulsion with montanide ISA 51 SC and sargramostim SC every 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks.</detailed_description>
