	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized (3 Treatment : 2 Sham Control), sham-controlled, patient and evaluator-blinded study comparing treatment with the CardiAMP cell therapy to a sham treatment. A roll-in phase with a maximum of 10 subjects will precede the randomised phase.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CardiAMP™ Heart Failure Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure is a clinical condition in which the output of blood from the heart is insufficient to meet the metabolic demands of the body. In 2015, the American Heart Association, or AHA, report on heart disease statistics estimated that there are 5.7 million Americans over the age of 20 that have heart failure. Heart failure is increasingly prevalent due to the aging population and the increase in major cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity and diabetes. The AHA also estimates that one in five adults will develop heart failure after the age of 40. During heart failure progression, the heart steadily loses its ability to respond to increased metabolic demand, and mild exercise soon exceeds the heart's ability to maintain adequate output. Towards the end stage of the disease, the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs at rest. At this stage, fluids accumulate in the extremities or in the lungs making the patient bedridden and unable to perform the activities of daily living. The long-term prognosis associated with heart failure is approximately 50% mortality at five years following the initial diagnosis. CardiAMP is a comprehensive therapeutic treatment that comprises (i) a point of care cell processing platform, and (ii) a biotherapeutic delivery system. CardiAMP is the first comprehensive therapeutic treatment utilizing a patient's own cells for the treatment of ischemic systolic heart failure, which is heart failure that develops after a heart attack. In the screening process, the physician extracts a small sample of the patient's bone marrow in an outpatient procedure performed under local anesthesia. The clinic sends the sample to a centralized diagnostic lab, which tests the sample. During the treatment, a clinician harvests and then prepares the patient's own bone marrow mononuclear cells, or autologous cells, using the CardiAMP point of care cell processing platform, which a cardiologist then delivers into the heart using the Helix biotherapeutic delivery system. BioCardia intends to submit data obtained from this clinical trial in a Pre-Market Approval Application to the United States Food and Drug Administration</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Greater than (&gt;) 21 and less than (&lt;) 90 years of age. New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II or III. A diagnosis of chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction secondary to myocardial infarction (MI). Have an ejection fraction ≥ 20% and ≤ 40%. On stable evidencebased medical and device therapy for heart failure or postinfarction left ventricular dysfunction, per the 2013 ACC/AHA Heart Failure guidelines, for at least three (3) months prior to randomization. Cell Potency Assay Score of 3, as determined by the Cell Analysis Core Lab results. Provide written informed consent. Have a baseline glomerular filtration rate &lt;50 ml/min/1.73m2. Have a hematological abnormality as evidenced by hematocrit &lt; 25%, white blood cell &lt; 2,500/ul or platelet values, &lt;100,000/ul without another explanation. Have liver dysfunction, as evidenced by enzymes (AST and LT) greater than three times the ULN. Have a coagulopathy (INR ≥ 1.3) not due to a reversible cause (i.e., Coumadin). Patients on Coumadin will be withdrawn before the procedure and confirmed to have an INR &lt;1.3. Patients who cannot be withdrawn from Coumadin will be excluded from enrollment. Be an organ transplant recipient. Have a clinical history of malignancy within 5 years (i.e., patients with prior malignancy must be disease free for 5 years), except curativelytreated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or cervical carcinoma. Be serum positive for hepatitis B/C and or HIV, unless patient is a carrier for Hepatitis B/C, but has never had an active flare. History of bronchospastic lung disease (asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), orthopedic, muscular or neurologic conditions that could limit the ability to perform 6 Minute Walk Distance Test. Have a known, serious radiological contrast allergy. Be a female who is pregnant, nursing, or of childbearing potential while not practicing effective contraceptive methods for at least 30 days prior to randomization. Not a candidate for cardiac catheterization. Cardiac or Vascular System Require coronary artery revascularization. Patients who require or undergo revascularization procedures would undergo these procedures a minimum of 3 months in advance of randomization. Have a left ventricle thrombus, as detected by the echocardiographic core laboratory. Have mitral regurgitation, defined as "severe", as measured by the echocardiographic core laboratory. Have a mechanical aortic valve or heart constrictive device. Have severe mitral or tricuspid insufficiency. Have a documented presence of aortic stenosis (aortic stenosis graded as &gt; + 2 equivalent to an orifice area of 1.5cm2 or less), as detected by the echocardiographic core laboratory. Have a documented presence of aortic insufficiency (echocardiographic assessment of aortic insufficiency graded as ≥ + 2). Acute coronary syndrome within 3 months. Have evidence of a lifethreatening arrhythmia (nonsustained ventricular tachycardia ≥ 20 consecutive beats) or sustained or short run (&gt;20 consecutive beats) ventricular tachycardia during the screening Holter Monitoring. AICD firing in the past 60 days prior to the procedure. Have peripheral artery disease involving the aorta or iliofemoral system that impacts the feasibility or safety of the study intervention. This includes stenotic or aneurysmal or embolic disease, and symptom limiting claudication. Have complete heart block or QTc interval &gt;550 ms on screening 12lead ECG. Other Have a noncardiac condition that limits lifespan to &lt; 1 year. Have a history of drug or alcohol abuse within the past 24 months. Be currently participating (or participated within the previous 30 days) in an investigational therapeutic or device trial or participated in the treatment arm of a gene or stem cell therapy trial within the previous 12 months. Unwilling or unable to comply with followup.</criteria>
