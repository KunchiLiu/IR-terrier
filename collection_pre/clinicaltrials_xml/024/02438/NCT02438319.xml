	<brief_title>Automatic vs. Manual Optic Disc Planimetry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cross-Over non-randomized Case-Series. Arm 1 (Manual segmentation): Manually marking of the boundaries of the optic disc and it's excavation on color photographs of the optic disc. Arm 2 (Automated segmentation): Automatic detection of the boundaries of the optic disc and it's excavation. Calculation of cup size, size of excavation, cup-to-disc ratio, and rim area. Comparison of all parameters of both arms and computing of agreement.</detailed_description>
