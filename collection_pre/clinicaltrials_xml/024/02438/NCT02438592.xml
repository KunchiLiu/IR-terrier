	<brief_summary>This is an observational study involving retrospective and prospective medical record review covering a total maximum of 104 weeks (24 months) per subject. An Audio Computer- Assisted Self-Interview (ACASI) at study entry will assess demographic and psychosocial variables of study subjects. Data will also be collected to assess clinic level variables. Definitions of engagement, prescription of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and viral suppression in the Continuum of Care (CoC) will utilize common definitions including those by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB). Data will be collected in a large, simple trial design manner to provide all elements for both the primary and secondary outcomes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is an observational study involving retrospective and prospective medical record review covering a total maximum of 104 weeks (24 months) per subject. Behavioral data will be collected via ACASI at study entry to assess demographic and psychosocial variables of study subjects. All other data (biomedical, ART, healthcare utilization) at subsequent study visits will be collected via medical record abstraction. Information about missed visits as well as other healthcare utilization data can be abstracted from electronic appointment systems or other electronic systems at the clinical sites. Subject data will be abstracted from medical records for up to a maximum 26 weeks prior to the baseline study visit, as well as up to a maximum 78 weeks after the baseline study visit or through January 31, 2017, whichever occurs first, for a total maximum of 104 weeks or two years per subject. Data will also be collected from each Adolescent Medicine Trials Unit to assess clinic level variables at baseline (within 30 days of protocol registration) and 48 and 96 weeks after baseline. Definitions of engagement, prescription of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and viral suppression in the Continuum of Care (CoC) will utilize common definitions including those by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB). Data will be collected in a large, simple trial design manner to provide all elements for both the primary and secondary outcomes.</detailed_description>

This HIV medical appointment must be a nonemergency, routine conditionfocused exam AND one or more of the following: CD4, VL lab draw and/or review of these lab results; Discussion around HIV ART options; Primary and/or secondary HIV prevention education and counseling; or Diagnosis and treatment of complications of HIV, and of AIDSdefining conditions. Presence of serious psychiatric symptoms (e.g., active hallucinations, thought disorder) that would impair the individual's ability to provide true informed consent or participate in the baseline ACASI*; Visibly distraught (e.g., suicidal, homicidal, exhibiting violent behavior) at the time of consent or the baseline ACASI*; or Intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol or other substances at the time of consent or the baseline ACASI* NOTE: If consent/assent is obtained prior to the enrollment date, assessment for these exclusion criteria must be performed again prior to administration of the baseline ACASI (Enrollment).

Reassessment of eligibility and enrollment may take place at a later date per the discretion of the treating clinician.</criteria>
