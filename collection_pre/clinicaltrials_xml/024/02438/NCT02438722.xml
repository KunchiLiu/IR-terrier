	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II/III trial studies how well afatinib dimaleate with cetuximab works and compares it with afatinib dimaleate alone in treating patients with newly diagnosed stage IV or recurrent (has come back), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer. Afatinib dimaleate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. It is not yet known whether afatinib dimaleate is more effective when given alone or with cetuximab in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S1403, Afatinib Dimaleate With or Without Cetuximab in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage IV or Recurrent, EGFR Mutation Positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate if there is sufficient evidence to continue to the phase III component by comparing progression-free survival (PFS) between patients randomized to afatinib (afatinib dimaleate) in combination with cetuximab versus afatinib alone in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). (Phase II) II. To determine the efficacy of the combination of afatinib and cetuximab compared to afatinib alone as measured by overall survival (OS) in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC. (Phase III) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the overall response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial responses) in the subset of patients with measurable disease treated with afatinib plus cetuximab compared to afatinib alone. II. To assess the safety of each treatment arm when used in the first-line setting. III. To compare time to treatment failure and time to treatment discontinuation between randomized to afatinib in combination with cetuximab versus afatinib alone. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To investigate the molecular mechanisms that confer benefit from afatinib and afatinib plus cetuximab by evaluating whether the presence of de novo EGFR T790M mutation or other molecular alterations in the pre-treatment tumor influence the clinical outcomes. II. To quantitatively assess whether the ratio of sensitizing EGFR (EGFRs) mutation to EGFR T790M influences outcome and is altered during treatment. III. To evaluate the frequency of known mechanisms of resistance to EGFR-directed therapies in the context of afatinib plus cetuximab and afatinib alone treatment. IV. To identify potential novel predictors of benefit to afatinib plus cetuximab. V. To identify potential new mechanisms of resistance to EGFR-directed therapies. VI. To establish patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) from a subset of patients by re-biopsy at the time of progressive disease for drug testing and genomic analysis. VII. To assess whether circulating tumor markers can be used as indicators of sensitivity and resistance to afatinib plus cetuximab and afatinib alone. VIII. To determine whether the levels of EGFR protein by immunohistochemistry predict for benefit to afatinib plus cetuximab and afatinib alone. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive afatinib dimaleate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive afatinib dimaleate as in Arm I. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IV (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] 7th Edition) or recurrent nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) Patients must have documented presence of an EGFR exon 19 deltion or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutation; T790M mutation or other molecular abnormality will be allowed as long as it accompanies one of the mutations listed above; EGFR testing must be performed using a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved test or in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)certified laboratory. Patients must have tissue available and must agree to submission of tissue and blood; one to two paraffinembedded tissue blocks or 1520 unstained slides are requested (a minimum of 12 slides is required); cytology (i.e. fineneedle aspirations, pleural effusion specimens) is acceptable if a cell block or sufficient unstained slides are available; tumor material must be reviewed by a local pathologist who must confirm that at least 100 viable tumor cells are present in the sample and sign the S1403 Pathology Review Form; patients must also be willing to submit blood samples for correlative research at baseline, during treatment and at progression Patients enrolled at sites participating in the Repeat Biopsy Study must agree to submission of tissue obtained by a repeat biopsy performed at the time of disease progression Patients must not have received any prior systemic anticancer therapy for advanced or metastatic disease including chemotherapy or EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy (including gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, or any experimental EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors [TKI] agents); prior chemotherapy for nonmetastatic disease (i.e. adjuvant therapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy) is allowed as long as &gt; 12 months has passed since completion of therapy; adjuvant EGFRdirected therapy is not allowed;
