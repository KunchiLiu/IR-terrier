	<brief_summary>The investigators propose to evaluate the potential utility of stress-related biomarkers obtained via dried blood spots (DBS) and retinal scans by collecting new data from mothers and children within the New Haven MOMS Partnership, a well-established community-partnered research setting. The proposed research could greatly advance the application of stress-related biomarkers within community-based research by increasing our understanding of how stress, trauma, and depression influence biology in childhood and adulthood, as measured using minimally-invasive approaches.</brief_summary>
