	<brief_summary>Abdominal surgery, including hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is inevitably followed by an episode of gastrointestinal hypomotility. A delayed return of gastrointestinal function, defined as postoperative ileus (POI), has a great impact on patient comfort, morbidity and recovery. POI often results in a prolonged hospital stay and contributes significantly to healthcare costs. Some prospective studies have revealed that gum chewing can improve the return of gastrointestinal function after colorectum surgery, gynaecology and obstetrics, and urinary system surgery. Moreover, some retrospective studies also revealed that simo decoction may improve the return of gastrointestinal function after hepatic resection of HCC. Therefore, the present study compared the effect of gum chewing and simo decoction after hepatic resection of HCC on POI, surgical complications, and length of hospital stay.</brief_summary>
