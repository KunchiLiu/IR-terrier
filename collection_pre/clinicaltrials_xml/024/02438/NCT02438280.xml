	<brief_summary>The AcceleDent速 device has been introduced to the specialty of orthodontics in order to reduce treatment time. The theory behind AcceleDent速 is that high frequency vibratory forces (30Hz) delivered to the teeth will stimulate the bone remodeling that is necessary for tooth movement to occur more quickly. Additionally, one claim of the AcceleDent速 product is that it may reduce pain and discomfort during orthodontic treatment. This study will be a parallel group, triple-blind randomized clinical trial comparing two groups of subjects with 12 participants in each group. Subjects will be randomized to receive one of two vibrational units, which will differ in frequency and/or amplitude of vibration. The subjects will be asked to change their aligners every week instead of every 2 weeks, which is common with Invisalign.</brief_summary>
