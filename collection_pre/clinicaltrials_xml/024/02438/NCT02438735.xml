	<brief_summary>Purpose of this study is to determine if the presence of endometriomas cause a reduction in ovarian reserve. Endometriosis and fertility problems experience are frequent. There seems to be an association between endometriosis and subfertility. This study aims to asses if the endometrioma it self causes diminished ovarian reserve after a certain time period, with determination of ovarian reserve with anti-mullerian hormone (AMH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH),luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol and antral follicle count (AFC) values.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study is planned as a prospective cohort study including women with endometrioma diagnosis with ultrasonography. Patients with endometrioma who does not have surgery indication will be evaluated with ultrasonography ( for antral follicle counts (AFC) and ovarian volume) and blood samples will be taken for anti- m√ºllerian hormone (AMH), follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH), luteinizing hormone ( LH ) and estradiol values between cycle days 3 and 5. Additional assessment will be done after 6 months after the first assessment. All the results will be statistically compared.</detailed_description>
