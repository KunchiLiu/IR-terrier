	<brief_summary>Ultrasound guidance can reduce the required local anesthetic volume for successful peripheral nerve block. The aim of the study is to determine the minimum volume of local anesthetic to achieve an ultrasound-guided median nerve block with a dextrose 5% hydrodissection approach.</brief_summary>
