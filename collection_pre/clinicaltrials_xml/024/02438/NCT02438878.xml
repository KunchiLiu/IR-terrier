	<brief_title>Supporting Baby Behavior Through Pediatric Offices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this project is to evaluate the impact on infant growth and infant-feeding practices of a low-cost series of video trainings and tools targeted to medical staff and designed to support ongoing Baby Behavior education of WIC participants. The intervention, currently used in all California WIC agencies, teaches caregivers to recognize and understand healthy infant behaviors such as the range of infant cues and common patterns for sleep and crying. This project will also evaluate the acceptance, knowledge transfer, and use of the tools by health care providers and medical staff. It is expected that trained staff will be prepared to share Baby Behavior messages with their patients and that the information will be delivered quickly and easily during well-baby visits.</detailed_description>
