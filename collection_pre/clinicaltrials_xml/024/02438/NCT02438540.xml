	<brief_summary>The investigators designed this randomized double blind (patients/ assessor) clinical trial to compare the therapeutic effects of Metformin monotherapy with Metformin and acupuncture combined therapy on weight loss and insulin sensitivity among overweight/obese type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. We compared the inflammatory markers, lipid profiles, and adipokines in overweight/obese T2DM patients receiving the combined therapy to those receiving the Metformin monotherapy, to understand whether acupuncture plus Metformin is a better approach then Metformin only on treating diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative the Effect of Metformin and Acupuncture on Weight Loss and Insulin Sensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>From 39 participants, 19 participants were sent to case group and 20 to control group according to above mentioned method of randomization by independent research assistant. In the case group enrolled participants were treated with Metformin monotherapy and received electro acupuncture (EA) and Auricular acupuncture at the selected acupoints, and participants in a control group were treated with Metformin monotherapy and received sham EA. All patients were blinded to treatment assignment during the period of study and assessor was blinded to name of the patients and results as well. IR was calculated by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) proposed by Matthews et al. HOMA-IR = (fasting insulin (mmol/L) × fasting glucose (µIU/ml))/22.5; body height was measured to an accuracy of +/-0.1cm; body weight was measured while the subjects were dressed in light clothing after an overnight fasting by standard scale to an accuracy of +/-0.1 kg; The body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing weight (kg) into height (squared m²). Blood markers including fasting blood sugar (FBS), fasting insulin (FINS), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis α (TNFα), C reactive protein (CRP), leptin, adiponectin, resistin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), HOMA index , free fatty acid (FFAs), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) , and ceramides; were calculated by measuring them after drawing 10 ml of blood from cubital vein in each patient after 8 hours overnight fasting, before treatment, and for FBS, FINS and HOMA index 30 min after treatment additionally, 3 times during the study (in the beginning, in the 5th time and at the end) from both groups, with the chosen for this research standard range. All data with standard range were managed by Epi-data software, then analyzed by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software 15.0.0 (6 Sep 2006). The investigators statistics method included T-test and repeated measures ANOVA. P-Value&lt;0.05 was statistically significant in this trial</detailed_description>
