	<brief_title>the Efficacy of Acarbose and Metformin on Blood Glucose Fluctuation When Combined With Premix Insulin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design:Prospective, parallel group, active-control, randomized, open-label. Study Organization:Single-center in China. Endocrinology and metabolism department of 6th affiliated hospital of Shanghai Jiaotong university Study Population: Type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by premix-insulin therapy,40 patients per arm(acarbose add on/ metformin add on) both acarbose and metformin are widely used with premix-insulin in clinical practice, for the better glucose control and lower hypoglycemia incident. Acarbose delay the absorption of digested carbohydrates from the small intestine and thus lower both postprandial glucose and insulin levels which sequently improve glucose fluctuation Metformin improve the insulin resistance reduce the gluconeogenesis, glucose output and thus lower the fasting glucose</detailed_description>
