	<criteria>1. Male or female patients of ≥18 years of age. 2. Patients with a documented diagnosis of recurrent head and neck squamous cell cancer (squamous cell carcinoma, including nasopharyngeal cancer, or adenoid cystic carcinoma). Patients must have at least one confirmed and evaluable tumor site.* The recurrence must have bidimensional measurements by clinical examination or CT/MRI/PET scan. A confirmed recurrence site may also be biopsyproven 3. Tumor Recurrence which is surgically unresectable 4. Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status ≥70% (or the equivalent ECOG level of 02) (see Appendix Performance Status Evaluation) and an expected survival of ≥ three months. 5. Patients must have adequate hematologic reserve with WBC≥3000/mm3, absolute neutrophils ≥1500/mm3 and platelets ≥100,000/ mm3. Patients who are on Coumadin must have a platelet count of ≥150,000/ mm3 6. Preenrollment chemistry parameters must show: bilirubin&lt;1.5X the institutional upper limit of normal (IUNL); AST or ALT&lt;2.5X IUNL and creatinine&lt;1.5X IUNL. 7. Preenrollment coagulation parameters (PT and PTT) must be ≤1.5X the IUNL. 8. Patients must agree to use a medically effective method of contraception during and for a period of three months after the treatment period. A pregnancy test will be performed on each premenopausal female of childbearing potential immediately prior to entry into the research study. 9. Patients must be able to understand and give written informed consent. Informed consent must be obtained at the time of patient screening. 10. Patients who refuse surgery. 1. Women who are pregnant or lactating. 2. Women of childbearing potential and fertile men will be informed as to the potential risk of procreation while participating in this research trial and will be advised that they must use effective contraception during and for a period of three months after the treatment period. 3. Patients with significant intercurrent medical or psychiatric conditions that would place them at increased risk or affect their ability to receive or comply with treatment or posttreatment clinical monitoring. 4. Preexisting cardiac or respiratory disorders 5. Unrelated malignancy within 3 years 6. History of hypersensitivity reactions to other EGFR inhibitors 7. Metastatic disease 8. Less than 6 months from prior Radiation Therapy (Arm 1) 9. Previous exposure to Cetuximab</criteria>
