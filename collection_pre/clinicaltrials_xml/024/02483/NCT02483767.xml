	<brief_summary>The study is a prospective randomized control clinical trial which is sponsored by the researchers. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of Gonadotropin-Releasing hormone agonist on ovarian function for premenopausal breast cancer patients during chemotherapy. The premenopausal breast cancer patients will be randomly (1:1) enrolled to receive standard chemotherapy with the GnRH agonist goserelin (goserelin group) or standard chemotherapy without goserelin (chemotherapy alone group). All patients are stratified according to age (&lt;35years vs.36-44years), hormone receptor status (HR+ or ER+ vs.HR- and ER-), chemotherapy regimen(3-4 cycles vs.6-8 cycles, and cyclophosphamide-based vs.noncyclophosphamide).The follow-up time will be at least 2years. The ovarian failure, follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol and anti-Mullerian hormone, pregnancy outcomes and disease-free and overall survival will be compared between two groups to evaluate the effectiveness of protect against ovarian failure.</brief_summary>
