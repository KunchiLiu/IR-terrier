	<brief_summary>Objective:The aim of this clinical study was to evaluate tooth color alteration (ΔE) and tooth sensitivity (TS) in patients that used two commercial brand-whitening dentifrices for four weeks. Sixty participants were selected in accordance with inclusion and exclusion criteria and randomly allocated in three groups (n=20): G1-Colgate Luminous White®, G2- Close up White Now® and G3- Sorriso® dentifrice (placebo). Then, participants received the instructions to use only the blinded supplied dentifrice and toothbrush to make the habitual oral hygiene, three times per day during four weeks. Evaluators assessed tooth color (CIEL*a*b system) and TS (VAS scale) at baseline and every week (assessment points 1, 2, 3 and 4). Two-way ANOVA and posterior Tukey and Friedman test analyzed data (α = 0.05).</brief_summary>
