	<brief_title>Safety and Feasibility Study of Rejuvenair™ for Treating Chronic Bronchitis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective, open label, single arm study with sequential accrual of subjects with known chronic bronchitis. There are two phases to this study. Phase A will enroll up to 12 subjects and will treat a single lobe to assess safety, feasibility and histology/immunology. After review of the data by the Data Safety Monitoring Board, Phase B of the study would begin. In Phase B of the study, Phase A subjects would have their remaining two lobes treated. In addition up to 24 subjects will be enrolled and will have all upper and lower lobes treated to assess safety, feasibility and immunology.</detailed_description>
