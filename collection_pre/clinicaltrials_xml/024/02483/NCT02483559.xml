	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to test the use of amber glasses at night as a method to block blue light from the eye, allowing the brain to produce a dim-light melatonin onset. The investigators hypothesize that blue-blocking will produce measurable benefits in subjectively and objectively rated sleep quality and mood as well as salivary melatonin levels during the night.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants will complete a self-report battery containing measures of sleep quality, morningness-eveningness chronotype, and mood. Participants will then wear a wrist-worn accelerometer for 14 days to objectively record activity level and sleep quality. Participants will also fill out a daily sleep log and short self-report measures assessing sleep and mood. On days 4-7 and 11-14 of the study the participants will wear either amber or placebo control lenses prior to sleep onset in a randomized crossover design (i.e., participants will be randomized to wear either amber lenses or placebo lenses for the first part of the protocol and then switch to wear the opposite lenses for the second part of the protocol). Participants will spend nights 7 and 14 of the study in a sleep laboratory in order to obtain hourly melatonin samples and wear a wrist sleep monitor to non-invasively and objectively measure sleep state and quality using peripheral arterial tone and oxygen perfusion.</detailed_description>
