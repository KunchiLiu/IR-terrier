	<brief_title>Direct Instruction Language for Learning in Autism Spectrum Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Direct Instruction - Language for Learning (DI-LL) uses face to face instruction and specific lessons to teach children language skills. This method has been used previously in children with language delays, but it has not been carefully studied in children with autism spectrum disorder. This study will compare DI-LL and ongoing treatment as usual to treatment as usual (speech therapy, language services, etc.) alone.</detailed_description>

English is spoken in the home and at least one parent is able to read, write and speak English Medication free or on stable medication (no changes in past 6 weeks and no planned changes for the next 6 months Presence of a known serious medical condition in the child (based on medical history) that would interfere with child ability to participate in the study On examination, child has less than 5 words and unable to imitate at least 5 words Children &gt; 6 years 5 months who achieve a score of 40 on the CELF4 [RATIONALE: The norms for the CELFP do not go above 6 years 11 months. Because children &gt; 6 years 11 months (at Week 24) cannot get a standard score on the CELPP, administration of the CELFP is not an option.] Presence of a current serious behavioral problem or psychiatric condition in the child that would require another treatment (e.g., psychotic disorder, major depression, moderate or greater aggression, severe disruptive behavior) based on all available information collected at screening Currently receiving Direct Instruction Language for Learning (DILL) or participation in a DILL program in the past 2 years Primary mode of communication is a speech generating device (e.g., DynaVox, Gotalk, Proloquo2go) On psychotropic medication, but regimen is not stable (Once stabilized, eligibility could be reconsidered.)</criteria>
