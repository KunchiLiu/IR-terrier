	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 2b/3, multi-center, two part study, designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of PRO 140 in conjunction with existing ART (failing regimen) for one week and Optimized Background Therapy (OBT) for 24 weeks respectively. Study population includes treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients with CCR5-tropic virus who demonstrates evidence of HIV-1 replication despite ongoing antiretroviral therapy with documented genotypic or phenotypic resistance to ART drugs within three drug classes (or within two or more drug classes with limited treatment options).The options may be limited as a result of drug antiviral class cross-resistance or documented treatment intolerance.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Males and females, age ≥ 18 years 2. Exclusive CCR5tropic virus at Screening Visit 3. Have a history of at least 3 months on current antiretroviral regimen 4. Treatmentexperienced HIVinfected patients with documented genotypic or phenotypic resistance to at least one ART drug within three drug classes OR Treatmentexperienced HIVinfected patients with documented genotypic or phenotypic resistance to at least one ART drug within two drug classes and have limited treatment options. The options may be limited as a result of drug antiretroviral class crossresistance or documented treatment intolerance. 5. Be willing to remain on treatment without any changes or additions to the OBT regimen, except for toxicity management or upon meeting criteria for treatment failure. 6. Plasma HIV1 RNA ≥ 400 copies/mL at Screening Visit and documented detectable viral load (HIV1 RNA &gt;50 copies/ml) within the last 3 months prior to Screening Visit. 7. Laboratory values at Screening of: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 750/mm3 Hemoglobin (Hb) ≥ 10.5 gm/dL (male) or ≥ 9.5 gm/dL (female) Platelets ≥ 75,000 /mm3 Serum alanine transaminase (SGPT/ALT) &lt; 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Serum aspartate transaminase (SGOT/AST) &lt; 5 x ULN Bilirubin (total) &lt; 2.5 x ULN unless Gilbert's disease is present or subject is receiving atazanavir in the absence of other evidence of significant liver disease Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN 8. Clinically normal resting 12lead ECG at Screening Visit or, if abnormal, considered not clinically significant by the Principal Investigator 9. Both male and female patients and their partners of childbearing potential must agree to use 2 medically accepted methods of contraception (e.g., barrier contraceptives [male condom, female condom, or diaphragm with a spermicidal gel], hormonal contraceptives [implants, injectables, combination oral contraceptives, transdermal patches, or contraceptive rings], and intrauterine devices) during the course of the study (excluding women who are not of childbearing potential and men who have been sterilized). Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening visit and negative urine pregnancy test prior to receiving the first dose of study drug. 10. Willing and able to participate in all aspects of the study, including use of SC medication, completion of subjective evaluations, attendance at scheduled clinic visits, and compliance with all protocol requirements as evidenced by providing written informed consent. Note: Subjects diagnosed with either substance dependence or substance abuse or any history of a concomitant condition (e.g., medical, psychologic, or psychiatric) may be enrolled if in the opinion of site investigator these circumstances would not interfere with the subject's successful completion of the study requirements. 1. Documented CXCR4tropic virus or Dual/Mixed tropic (R5X4) virus 2. Patients with no viable treatment options (≤ 1 fully active approved drug) 3. Any active infection or malignancy requiring acute therapy (with the exception of local cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma) Note: Subjects infected by the hepatitis B virus or early stage hepatitis C virus will be eligible for the study. 4. Laboratory test values of ≥ grade 3 DAIDS laboratory abnormality with the exception of the absolute CD4+ count criterion of &lt; 200/mm3 5. Females who are pregnant, lactating, or breastfeeding, or who plan to become pregnant during the study 6. Unexplained fever or clinically significant illness within 1 week prior to the first study dose 7. Any vaccination within 2 weeks prior to the first study dose. 8. Subjects weighing &lt; 35kg 9. History of anaphylaxis 10. History of Bleeding Disorder or patients on anticoagulant therapy 11. Prior use of maraviroc or any other CCR5 coreceptor antagonist 12. Participation in an experimental drug trial(s) within 30 days of the Screening Visit or during the study 13. Any known allergy or antibodies to the study drug or excipients 14. Treatment with any of the following: Radiation or cytotoxic chemotherapy with 30 days prior to the Screening Visit or during the study Immunosuppressants within 60 days prior to the Screening Visit or during the study Immunomodulating agents (e.g., interleukins, interferons), hydroxyurea, or foscarnet within 60 days prior to the Screening Visit or during the study Oral or parenteral corticosteroids within 30 days prior to the Screening Visit or during the study. Subjects on chronic steroid therapy &gt; 5 mg/day will be excluded with the following exception: Subjects on inhaled, nasal, or topical steroids will not be excluded. 15. Any other clinical condition that, in the Investigator's judgment, would potentially compromise study compliance or the ability to evaluate safety/efficacy</criteria>
