	<brief_summary>This is a phase 1 study (the first stage in testing a new treatment to see how safe and tolerable the treatment is) which will include patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that has either returned or has a more than a 70% chance of coming back and cannot have a bone marrow transplant. This study will see whether modifying a patient's AML cells to produce IL-12 and giving it back to the patient is safe and useful in patients with AML that cannot have bone marrow transplants.</brief_summary>
