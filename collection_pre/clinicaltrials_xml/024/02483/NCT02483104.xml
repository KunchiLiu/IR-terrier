Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to the study entry. Post menopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of nonchildbearing potential. A history of another invasive cancer within the past 3 years, except nonmelanoma skin cancer or in situ malignancies that are considered cured by the investigator (e.g., cervical cancer in situ, in situ carcinoma of the bladder, or breast carcinoma in situ). Participants who received prior radiotherapy to any portion of the abdominal cavity or pelvis. Participants who received prior chemotherapy for any abdominal or pelvic tumor. Any investigational agents less than 4 weeks prior to study enrollment. Any anticancer Chinese medicine/herbal remedies within 14 days prior to study enrollment. Known history of allergic reaction to Cremophorpaclitaxel, carboplatin, Azo Colourant Tartrazine (also known as FD&amp;C Yellow 5 or E102), Azo Colourant Orange YellowS (also known as FD&amp;C Yellow 6 or E110) or known contraindications to any study supplied drug. Patients with history or evidence upon physical examination of central nervous system disease, including primary brain tumor, any brain metastases, or history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA, stroke), transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 6 months of the first date of treatment on this study. Prior therapy with a Poly(ADPribose)Polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. Subject has a clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s), including but not limited to: Uncontrolled seizure disorder, or focal or generalized seizure within the last 12 months; Active infection that requires parenteral antibiotics; Known active hepatitis B or hepatitis C with abnormal liver function test or organ dysfunction; Symptomatic congestive heart failure; unstable angina pectoris; serious ventricular cardiac arrhythmia (i.e., ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication (this does not include asymptomatic atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular rate); or myocardial infarction within the last 6 months; Uncontrolled hypertension (sustained systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg or diastolic pressure &gt; 100 mmHg despite optimal medical management); Bowel obstruction or gastric outlet obstruction; Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements; Any medical condition which in the opinion of the Investigator places the subject at an unacceptably high risk for toxicities.
