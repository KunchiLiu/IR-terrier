	<brief_summary>AVERT is a randomized controlled trial comparing video-oculography (VOG)-guided care to standard care to assess accuracy of diagnoses and initial management decisions for emergency department (ED) patients with a chief symptom of vertigo or dizziness suspected to be of vestibular cause. The trial will test the hypothesis that VOG-guided rapid triage (VRT) will accurately, safely, and efficiently differentiate peripheral from central vestibular disorders in ED patients presenting acute vertigo or dizziness, and that doing so has the potential to improve post-treatment clinical outcomes for these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute Video-oculography for Vertigo in Emergency Rooms for Rapid Triage (AVERT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AVERT is a multicenter, Phase II clinical trial comparing a novel diagnostic strategy (VRT) to standard ED diagnostic care at three performance sites. The Specific Aims are to assess diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic workup costs, and estimate the short-term impact of correct diagnosis in anticipation of a larger, definitive Phase III trial. Adult ED patients with a chief symptom of vertigo, dizziness, or unsteadiness, new in the previous 7 days, will undergo on-site vestibular function tests by trained research personnel using a portable, quantitative VOG recording device. Research personnel will also record a focused symptom history and bedside hearing tests. Eligible patients with at least one pathologic vestibular eye movement finding will be randomized to VRT or standard ED care. The VRT arm relies on an automated algorithm to interpret VOG results, thereby determining a patient-specific clinical care pathway. For safety, all VRT-arm study subjects will undergo stroke protocol MRI before release. All subjects in both arms will undergo confirmatory testing at one week, including vestibular specialist exam and 3-Tesla research MRI combining stroke and internal auditory canal protocols. All patients in both arms will also undergo 30-day phone follow-up and medical record review to confirm diagnoses. Clinical findings, ED diagnoses, diagnostic resource utilization, treatments applied, and clinical events during follow-up will be recorded. A multidisciplinary, masked, expert panel will adjudicate final diagnoses.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A chief presenting symptom of "vertigo," "dizziness," or "unsteadiness" as defined by consensus expert definitions in the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders Vestibular symptoms are new in the previous 7 days At least one pathologic vestibular eye movement abnormality on prerandomization VOG testing: 1. vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) loss on one or both sides as assessed by head impulse testing in the horizontal canal plane 2. nystagmus (spontaneous, gazeevoked, or positional) during fixation, gaze, and positional tests, or 3. vertical ocular misalignment (skew deviation) during alternate cover testing Level 1 trauma or critical illness Unsafe to participate (as deemed by ED physicians or specific preenrollment risk assessment questions) including but not limited to: 1. clinicallyperceived risk to patient of participating in study (ED staff concern) 2. clinicallyperceived risk to research staff (e.g., violence, blood/body fluid/respiratory precautions) 3. unstable cardiac status (given a single reported case of bradycardia with impulse testing) 4. acute craniocervical trauma or other condition (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) that might lead to instability of the cervical spine that would be a contraindication to neck rotation during VOG testing Unable to participate fully with VOG exam, MRI, or study followup including, but not limited to: 1. altered mental status (e.g., delirium, dementia) that would preclude active study participation (this includes patients with abnormal mental state due to alcohol intoxication or illicit substance, which are known, easilyrecognized causes of dizziness or vertigo presentations to the ED) 2. contraindications to imaging (e.g., pacemaker, metallic foreign body); contraindications to contrast administration (e.g., renal failure, pregnancy all patients must have serum creatinine measured and glomerular filtration rates calculated; all women of childbearing age must undergo a urine pregnancy test prior to MRI to confirm no pregnancy) Possible confounders for results interpretation of VOG tests (excluded from randomization but not testing) including, but not limited to: 1. known prior unilateral vestibulopathy (e.g., vestibular neuritis; labyrinthitis) or vestibular surgery (e.g., prior labyrinthectomy, vestibular neurectomy, canal plugging, superior canal resurfacing) or vestibular ablative therapies such as intratympanic gentamicin) 2. history of treatment for a chronic neurootologic disorder (e.g., Meniere's disease, vestibular migraine, treatmentrefractory benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, otosclerosis, acoustic neuroma [vestibular schwannoma], superior canal dehiscence) 3. known prior eye movement disorder (congenital nystagmus, childhood or acquired strabismus, prior eye muscle surgery to correct misalignment) Obvious central nervous system or general medical cause (as judged by treating ED physician) including, but not limited to: 1. new dysarthria (slurred speech) or hemiparesis (unilateral face, arm, or leg weakness) 2. acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolus, pneumonia, renal failure, drug intoxication, etc. Patient already enrolled in the AVERT Trial</criteria>
