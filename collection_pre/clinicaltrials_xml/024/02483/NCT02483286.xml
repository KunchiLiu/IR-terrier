	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES To determine the effects of 3 exercise interventions on sarcopenic indices among community-dwelling older adults with high osteoporotic fracture risks. MATERIAL AND METHOD The current study enrolled subjects who screened high risk of fall, osteoporosis/fracture by standardized questionnaires or FRAX. Subjects at the National Taiwan University Hospital Bei-Hu Branch (NTUHBB) were randomized into integrated care group (ICG, target n=50) and muscle training group (MTG, target n=50). Subjects from Lingko Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (LCGMH) were all assigned into X-box group (XBG, target n=30). All participants received a CD-ROM and a one education on osteoporosis, sarcopenia, frailty, fall prevention, nutrition, and coping strategy and another hour of professional led exercise program. ICG subjects received once weekly group exercise while MTG subjects received twice weekly machine-based resistence training on major muscle groups. XBG subjects rececived twice weekly exercise with X-box based programs. Major outcomes were muscle mass (measured by bio-impedance analysis), grip strength, walking speed, and lower leg extension power at baseline and after 12-weeks of intervention.</brief_summary>
