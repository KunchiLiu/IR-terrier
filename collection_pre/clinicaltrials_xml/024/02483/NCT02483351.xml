	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of conducting a large trial examining the effect on clinical outcome of a liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion strategy compared to a restrictive strategy (usual care) in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Age ≥18 years old at time of presentation 2. First ever episode aneurysmal SAH 3. Confirmed aneurysmal SAH diagnosis: as confirmed by treating Neurosurgeon or Neurointerventionalist and supported by blood in subarachnoid space (demonstrated on cranial imaging or cerebrospinal fluid positive for xanthochromia) that is the result of a ruptured saccular aneurysm (confirmed by cranial imaging cranial topography or magnetic resonance imaging angiography or catheter angiogram) 4. Incident hemoglobin ≤100g/L within 14 days following SAH (defined by first day of hospital presentation) 1. Physician and or family decision to withdraw/withhold critical care at time of enrolment 2. Active bleeding with hemodynamic instability at time of enrolment 3. Patients with contraindication or known objection to blood transfusions 4. SAH due to causes other than saccular aneurysm rupture including mycotic, traumatic and dissecting aneurysms, and aneurysms associated with arteriovenous malformations.</criteria>
