	<brief_title>Nephrologist Follow-up Versus Usual Care After an Acute Kidney Injury Hospitalization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Survivors of acute kidney injury (AKI) are at increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and death, but have inconsistent follow-up care. Our team has developed and tested a model to deliver structured follow-up kidney care (the AKI Follow-up Clinic) that is feasible and sustainable, with standardized assessments based upon clinical practice guidelines that are transferable to any setting. This study will randomize patients with Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) stage 2-3 AKI to the AKI Follow-up Clinic or usual care (control group). The usual care group will have a letter outlining their AKI diagnosis mailed to their family physician; the usual care group may still be referred to a nephrologist by their healthcare provider if desired, but these participants will not have access to the AKI Follow-up Clinic pathways. The primary outcome is development of a major adverse kidney event (MAKE), a composite of death, chronic dialysis, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline. Outcomes will be ascertained after one year of follow-up, which is when AKI Follow-up Clinic patients are transitioned back to their family doctor or general nephrologist based upon pre-specified graduation criteria. Participants will also be followed using local hospital electronic resources and the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) administrative databases in order to assess the long-term impact of early nephrologist follow-up on AKI outcomes.</detailed_description>
