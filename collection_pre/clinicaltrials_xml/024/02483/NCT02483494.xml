	<brief_summary>Aim. To develop and examine the effectiveness of an APN-led telehealth rehabilitative programme as a transitional nursing therapeutic on readmission rates and health related outcomes amongst patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) post discharge. Design. Randomized controlled trial with repeated measures. Methodology. A consecutive sampling of 172 patients with AMI will be recruited from a tertiary hospital in Singapore. Participants will be randomised into two groups. The experimental group (ALTRA) will receive APN-led telehealth rehabilitative programme upon discharge in addition to standard care. The control group will receive only standard follow-up care.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Advanced Practice Nurse-Led Telehealth on Readmissions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ischaemic heart disease is the third leading cause both for death and illness for hospitalisation in Singapore. Epidemiological data shows that the incidence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) stands around 7000 plus in Singapore. In United States, nearly 20% of patients with AMI are readmitted within 30 days of discharge causing the healthcare system a huge financial burden. These readmissions have been shown to be associated with lower patient satisfaction and less inefficient healthcare. Cardiac rehabilitation has been proven to be an effective strategy in improving quality of life and reducing readmission. However, this structured programme which comprise of clinical review, education and exercise, has poor uptake rate for varied reasons. It is important that newer strategies are being explored and developed to cater to the changing needs of the patient population. One of which is to utilize telemedicine with combination of Advanced Practice Nurse delivering the care remotely. This is a substudy of IMMACULATE STUDY (NCT02468349) where more details can be found.</detailed_description>
