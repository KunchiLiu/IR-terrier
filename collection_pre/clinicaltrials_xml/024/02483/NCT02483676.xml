	<brief_summary>Deficits in ankle control after stroke can lead to foot drop, resulting in inefficient, aberrant gait and an elevated falls risk. Using a novel ankle robot and newly invented adaptive control system, this study tests whether robotic assisted treadmill training will improve gait and balance functions in chronic stroke survivors with foot drop impairment. It is hypothesized that, compared to treadmill training alone, integrating adaptive ankle robotics with treadmill training will reduce drop foot during independent overground walking, resulting in greater mobility, improved postural control and reduced fall risk.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ankle Robot to Reduce Foot-drop in Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This proposal investigates a novel ankle robot (anklebot) adaptive control approach integrated with treadmill training to reduce foot drop and improve mobility function in chronic hemiparetic stroke survivors. Currently, stroke survivors with foot drop are trained to live with a cane or other assistive device, and often ankle foot orthotics (AFOs) for safety. Neither mediates task-practice or neuromotor recovery. The investigators have developed an adaptive anklebot controller that detects gait cycle sub-events for precise timing of graded robotics assist to enable deficit severity adjusted ankle motor learning in the context of walking. The investigator's pilot findings show that 6 weeks treadmill training with anklebot (TMR) timed to assist swing phase dorsiflexion only, is more effective than treadmill alone (TM) to improve free-walking swing dorsiflexion at foot strike, floor-walking speed, and the benefits are retained at 6 weeks post-training. Notably, swing-phase TMR training improved paretic leg push-off, and reduced center-of-pressure sway on standing balance, indicating potential benefits to other elements of gait and balance, beyond those robotically targeted toward foot drop. This randomized study investigates the hypothesis that 6 weeks TMR is more effective to durably improve gait biomechanics, static and dynamic balance, and mobility function in chronic stroke survivors with dorsiflexion deficits, compared to TM alone. Aims are to determine the compare effectiveness of 6 weeks TMR vs. TM alone on: 1. Independent gait function indexed by gait velocity, swing-phase DF, terminal stance push off. 2. Balance function indexed by measures of postural sway (CoP), asymmetric loading in quiet standing, peak paretic A-P forces in non-paretic gait initiation, and standardized scales for balance and fall risk. 3. Long-term mobility outcomes, assessed by repeated measures of all key gait and balance outcomes at 6 weeks and 3 months after formal training cessation.</detailed_description>
