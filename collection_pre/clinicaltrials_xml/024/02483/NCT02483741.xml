	<brief_title>The Use of Manuka Honey to Improve Healing After Third Molars Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sufficient evidence exists recommending the use of honey in the management of acute wounds and burns. Studies revealed that the healing effect of honey could be classified by its antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of its components. Manuka honey has been shown to inhibit a wide range of microorganisms, including multiresistant strains. This unique honey is derived from flowers of manuka tree (Leptospermum scoparium) in New Zealand. Dihydroxyacetone and methylglyoxal are unique and naturally occurring constituents of manuka honey that correlate with its antibacterial activity. Since surgical extraction of impacted molars is one of the most common operations in the oral cavity and the postoperative symptoms disturbing the patient may reduce the quality of health service, this study aims to assess the healing potential of Manuka honey in reducing these symptoms by comparing the outcome of extraction of impacted lower molars with and without topical application of Manuka honey into the extraction socket.</detailed_description>
