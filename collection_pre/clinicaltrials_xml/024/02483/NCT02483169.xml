	<brief_summary>Through this study, the investigators are to prove that Cilostazol effectively prevent progression of intima-medial thickness in ischemic stroke patients with high risk of cerebral hemorrhage, along with no significant increase in the risk of occurrence of hemorrhagic side effects. The primary hypothesis of this study is; Cilostazol alone or with probucol will reduce the progression of intima-medial thickness compared to aspirin in the ischemic stroke patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic old cerebral hemorrhage.</brief_summary>
