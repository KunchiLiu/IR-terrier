	<brief_summary>People with dementia have complex medical, social, and psychological needs and can be exacerbated by physical illness and the complex relationships between health care systems, patients and their families or caregivers. They are a vulnerable and fragile population that differs significantly from the population without dementia. Therefore, the investigators propose the following objectives: 1. To describe the evolution of dementia patients admitted during the study period in two hospitals in the Basque Health Service-Osakidetza and complications associated with such admissions. 2. To compare with a control group (matched by type of pathology, age and sex and adjusting for other clinical variables (severity of dementia ...) the patient's condition before and after admission, in terms of quality of life, dependency, instrumental activities of daily living and severity of dementia. 3. To compare the length of stay, complications, mortality rate, the degree of dependency and quality of life of patients with dementia compared to those without dementia, matched by groups of pathologies, gender and age.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>For the patients with dementia cohort, the inclusion criteria were: (a) Being patient aged over 75 years; (b) having been diagnosed with dementia according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental DisordersIV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) by any of the psychiatrists; (c) having received inpatient treatment by the time of the study in the hospital//with an unplanned medical admission to any medical speciality in the GaldakaoUsansolo Hospital (d) agreeing to participate voluntarily and providing written informed consent. Patients with dementia were included if a caregiver agreed to participate voluntarily. Caregiver is defined as any person who cares for a needy person in his or her direct environment on a regular basis and more or less as a matter of course. The caregiver is related (family, friendâ€¦) to the person receiving care and is not a professional caregiver (Shoenmakers et al., 2010). For the cognitive intact patients cohort, the inclusion criteria were patients without dementia admitted in the hospital by the time of the study, matched with patients with dementia, after controlling for age, gender and types of pathologies. Patients with dementia (or caregivers) were excluded if they did not provide inform consent. The exclusion criteria for patients without dementia were disorders interfering with psychometric assessment, or not given written informed consent.</criteria>
