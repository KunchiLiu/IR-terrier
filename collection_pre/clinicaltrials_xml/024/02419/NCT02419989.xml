	<brief_summary>No nontuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM) treatment protocol has been validated in the setting of cystic fibrosis (CF). This trial tests the feasibility of a standardized treatment algorithm for confirmed disease by either M. avium complex or the M. abscessus complex that is also based on forthcoming guidelines from the CF Foundation (CFF) and the European CF Society (ECFS). The primary endpoint is 12 months of negative NTM cultures following completion of therapy. The investigators' near-term goal is to validate both protocols by extending the trial to 5 additional CF Centers. The long-term goal is to make the validated protocols available to the entire CFF Care Center Network.</brief_summary>
