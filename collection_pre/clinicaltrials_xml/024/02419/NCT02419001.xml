	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Effect of SYN-004 on the PK of IV Ceftriaxone in Adults With a Functioning Ileostomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1b/2a, randomized, multi-center, open-label study. Twenty otherwise healthy subjects between the ages of 18 and 80 years, inclusive, with functioning ileostomies were planned to be enrolled. In the first treatment period (Period 1) all subjects received an IV infusion of 1 g ceftriaxone. Subjects had a 3 - 7 day washout period between Period 1 and Period 2. In the second treatment period (Period 2) all subjects received an IV infusion of 1 g ceftriaxone and 2 oral doses of either 75 or 150 mg of SYN-004, according to the randomization schedule, which were administered 30 minutes before and 5.5 hours after the start of the ceftriaxone infusion.</detailed_description>
