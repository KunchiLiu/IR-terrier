	<brief_summary>Objectives: Primary Objective: To establish the safety and tolerability of Selinexor when given in combination with standard chemotherapy regimens. Secondary Objectives: To determine disease control and progression free survival of Selinexor administered with standard chemotherapy treatments. Exploratory Objectives: To determine the correlation of translational biomarkers To compare serial assessment of mutation status in biopsies obtained at baseline and progression after clinical response to combination therapy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase IB of Selinexor in Combination With Standard Chemotherapy in Patients With Advanced Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label, single center Phase IB combination therapy study in metastatic or locally advanced cancers. The addition of Selinexor to multiple standard chemotherapy regimens will be tested in parallel. Two types of patients may be enrolled in this study: (1) advanced staged cancer patients either unresponsive or relapsed following prior standard therapy or for whom there is no known effective therapy; OR (2) advanced stage cancer patients for whom the standard chemotherapy treatment to which Selinexor is added is considered an appropriate and acceptable therapy. Patients who meet these criteria may in some cases have received no prior chemotherapy. Study Groups: If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, their doctor will decide which part of the study they will be in based on the type of tumor they have. The study doctor will discuss this with participant. - If participant is in Group A, they will receive selinexor and carboplatin. - If participant is in Group B, they will receive selinexor and paclitaxel. - If participant is in Group C, they will receive selinexor and eribulin. - If participant is in Group D, they will receive selinexor, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide. - If participant is in Group E, they will receive selinexor, carboplatin, and paclitaxel. - If participant is in Group F, they will receive selinexor, carboplatin, and pemetrexed. - If participant is in Group G, they will receive selinexor and topotecan. - If participant is in Group H, they will receive selinexor in combination with FOLFIRI. - If participant is in Group I, they will receive selinexor in combination with irinotecan. - If participant is in Group J, they will receive selinexor in combination with XELOX. - If participant is in Group K, they will receive selinexor in combination with olaparib. - If participant is in Group L, they will receive selinexor in combination with pembrolizumab. Up to 470 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

Subjects must have failed, be intolerant to, or be ineligible for any potentially curative approved treatment, irrespective of line of therapy. 3. Patients must have either measurable disease (RECIST 1.1) or evaluable disease (nonmeasurable lesions) outside irradiated field on CT/MRI. 4. Age &gt;/= 18 years. 5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 01. 6. The patient must be recovered from a prior major surgery. The major surgery must be performed at least 4 weeks prior to consent date. 7. Adequate hematologic function defined as: platelets &gt;/=125 x 10^9/L (For Arm L Pembrolizumab, platelets &gt;/= 100 x 10^9/L), hemoglobin &gt;/= 10 g/dL (For Arm L Pembrolizumab, hemaglobin &gt;/= 9 g/dL), ANC &gt;/= 1.5 x 10^9/L, WBC &gt;/= 3 x 10^9/L, Albumin &gt;/= 3 g/dL. Transfusions and growth factors are allowed. 8. Adequate liver function defined as: Alanine transaminase (ALT) &lt;/= 2 x upper normal limit (ULN) (In the expansion cohort, patients with known liver involvement may have ALT &lt;/= 5 x ULN), Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt;/=2 x ULN (In the expansion cohort, patients with known liver involvement may have AST &lt;/= 5 x ULN), Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 4 x ULN, Total Bilirubin &lt;/=2 x ULN (In the expansion cohort, patients with Gilbert's syndrome [hereditary indirect hyperbilirubinemia] who must have a total bilirubin of &lt;/= 3 x ULN). 9. Renal function defined as a calculated or measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &gt;/=30 mL/min. For Arm F Carboplatin and Pemetrexed, GFR &gt;/=45 mL/min. 10. The patient has recovered to Grade &lt;/= 1 by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.03 (NCICTCAE v4.03) from the effects of recent surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or other targeted therapies, with the exception of alopecia. The exceptions for such effects are allowed lab values of &lt;/= Grade 2 specified elsewhere in these inclusion criteria. 11. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. 12.
