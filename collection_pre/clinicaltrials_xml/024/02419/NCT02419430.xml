	<brief_summary>The investigators aim to evaluate the Mindfulness Based Resilience Training (MBRT) intervention for Mayo Clinic employees in order to provide evidence for improved ability to cope with stress and decreased work-related burnout and stress-related symptoms as a result of MBRT training. In addition, the investigators aim to compare the effects of MBRT + smartphone sleep feedback, a smartphone resilience intervention + smartphone sleep feedback, or waitlist control +smartphone sleep feedback in a randomized clinical trial in a sample of 75 Mayo Clinic employees.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators aim to compare the effects of MBRT + smartphone sleep feedback, a smartphone resilience intervention + smartphone sleep feedback, or waitlist control +smartphone sleep feedback in a randomized clinical trial in a sample of 75 Mayo Clinic employees. Specific self-report outcomes include: well-being, stress, anxiety, depression, fatigue, resilience, self-compassion, and burn-out, assessed at pre-, post- and 3-month followup. Objective outcomes, derived from smartphone-driven self-monitoring, include sleep quality and emotional experiencing, assessed throughout the six-week intervention period. The investigators will explore whether changes in objectively measured sleep quality and emotional experiencing will mediate treatment effects on self-report outcomes. The investigators will also explore whether treatment effects are more robust in self-selected versus randomized groups by drawing on the investigators' existing data.</detailed_description>
