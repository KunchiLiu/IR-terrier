	<brief_summary>Microbiota from fecal samples from IBS-D patients, in combination with vitamin D supplementation added to our 3-D immunocompetent intestinal models will establish a high fidelity disease model to achieve our long-term goal to understand the relationship between gut microbiome, vitamin D levels, host gene expression and IBS-D symptoms that could ultimately be used as a testing platform for treatment and prevention.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The pathophysiology of IBS is not well understood. Preliminary studies support IBS-D patients with varied microbiome fingerprints, vitamin D levels, and blood serotonin levels compared to non-IBS patients. The investigators have novel 3-D immunocompetent intestinal models to establish a new model of high fidelity disease to examine the relationship of IBS-D patients gut microbiome, with supplemental vitamin D levels, and the relationship of blood serotonin and vitamin D levels. IBS-D patients and healthy controls will be asked to provide a fecal sample, a biopsy sample of colonic tissue obtained during a clinically appropriate flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, and a blood sample. There will be 1-2 office visits. One visit will last 30 minutes, the second visit no longer than 3 hours. This study is funded by a combined MAYO-Arizona State University seed grant. The samples will be analyzed at ASU. Our long-term goal is to understand the relationship between gut microbiome, vitamin D levels, host gene expression, serotonin levels, and IBS-D symptoms that could ultimately be used as a testing platform for treatment and prevention of this highly prevalent disorder.</detailed_description>
