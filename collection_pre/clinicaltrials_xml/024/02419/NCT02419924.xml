	<brief_title>Proof of Concept: "Bottom's Up" Seat to Treat Constipation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Efficacy and safety of a unique pelvic floor support device that fits into the Radiology defecography commode will be tested. Patients with refractory constipation due to known pelvic floor laxity and/or excessive perineal descent will be examined without, then with the device in place. Patients will complete questionnaires pertaining to device safety and efficacy before and after using the device. Radiographic images to document efficacy of support plus adequate emptying will be acquired during the study resulting in very low dose radiation exposure.</detailed_description>
