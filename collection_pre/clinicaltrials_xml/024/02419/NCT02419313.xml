	<brief_summary>The scientific aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin-Merz Pharmaceuticals) in the tremor of Parkinson‟s disease. Our hypothesis is that injection of Xeomin into the muscles of arm, forearm and hand decreases the tremor amplitude and frequency leading to improvement of the patient‟s function.</brief_summary>
