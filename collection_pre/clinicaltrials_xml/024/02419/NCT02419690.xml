	<brief_summary>This study aims to use a text messaging intervention to prevent unintended teen pregnancy and transmission of sexually transmitted disease. The study will be informed by a formative qualitative phase (February 2014 - January 2015) which will include individual qualitative interviews and focus group with teens to elucidate and explore the barriers to effective contraceptive use and sexually transmitted disease (STD) prevention and to obtain feedback on the developed intervention. The second efficacy phase will randomize subjects to the texting intervention or to usual care.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adolescents, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, are disproportionally affected by both unintended pregnancies and STDs. While youth only represent a quarter of the sexually active population in the US, they account for almost half of all new STDs and the rate of unintended pregnancies among sexually active teens is almost double the rate of all sexually active women. Teen mothers experience higher rates of negative social outcomes including school dropout and children of teens are more likely to have low birth weight, lower academic achievement and more likely to perpetuate the cycle of teen pregnancy themselves. Both unintended pregnancies and STDs are much higher among racial/ethnic minority populations. Contraceptive methods considered most effective for pregnancy prevention do not protect against STDs and HIV transmission. Dual protection methods include being on an effective and consistent form of contraception, preferably a long-acting reversible contraceptive and having an effective STD prevention method in place, preferably consistent condom use. Non-penetrative sexual practices can be substituted. There are many barriers to providing these services in the context of primary care visits. A recent study of pediatricians found that 61% of pediatricians reported discussing contraception, use of condoms and/or STDs with patients at preventive care visits. Most providers (76%), however, believed they did not have sufficient time to provide such counseling in the visit. The problems are even more acute in resource-limited safety net settings. Therefore, a two-tiered approach may prove to be useful, where providers initially address reproductive health issues in the visit but where additional support outside the visit provides additional, information, support, motivation and connection to services. An innovative intervention using texting technology may prove to be a cost effective method of providing support between visits.</detailed_description>
