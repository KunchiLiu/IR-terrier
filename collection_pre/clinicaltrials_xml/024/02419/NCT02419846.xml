	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies an informed decision making intervention of screening for prostate cancer in predominantly African American participants. It also evaluates participants' knowledge about prostate cancer screening and to improve understanding. Using decision aids such as culturally sensitive written material, verbal information, and videos to educate patients about screening may increase patient participation and knowledge. This may increase confidence in participants' decisions. Raising awareness about prostate cancer in the communities may increase the participants' willingness to be screened for prostate cancer once they have learned about it.</brief_summary>
