	<brief_title>Assessment of Adductor Canal Blockade in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The adductor canal blockade is a reliable technique for analgesia after knee surgery. It is a safe technique, avoiding muscle weakness, and by this way limiting the risk of fall. Injection of local anaesthetics in the adductor canal does not block the sole saphenous nerve. Demonstration of a proximal spreading, around the branches of the femoral nerve have been made. The aim of this study is to assess a possible spreading from the adductor to the the popliteal fossa, where sciatic nerve and its branches are located. Pinprick test all around the knee and the leg, combined with motor assessment of the muscle of the leg and the ankle will be realised. This assessment was compared with femoral nerve blockade, classically used for analgesia after this kind of surgery (anterior cruciate ligament repair)</detailed_description>
