	<brief_title>Evaluation of Fractional CO2 Laser Treatment Efficacy and Comparison to Vaginal Estrogen Therapy in Postmenopausal Women With Vulvovaginal Atrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) symptoms are strongly associated with declining ovarian function and estrogen levels in postmenopausal women, having a considerable impact on women's life quality. Topical hormonal therapy and hormonal replacement are widely used to alleviate VVA symptoms. In this context, minimal invasive fractional CO2 laser emerges as an alternative non-hormonal therapy, especially in patients that present contraindications to hormonal therapy. Objective: Compare fractional CO2 laser treatment, local estrogen therapy and the combination of both treatments for VVA and determine the efficacy and possible adverse effects CO2 laser treatment. Materials and Methods: Forty-five postmenopausal women will be randomized in three double-blinded groups of treatment consisting of CO2 laser and placebo of estrogen vaginal cream, placebo of CO2 laser and estrogen vaginal cream and CO2 laser and estrogen vaginal cream. Assessment of baseline characteristics and follow-up will be obtained through self-completion questionnaires (Female Sex Function Index, International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF), Vulvovaginal Symptom Questionnaire and The Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL)). Frost Index and Vaginal Health Index (VHI) are part of objective clinical and histologic analyses. Colposcopy, vaginal cytology and middle third lateral vaginal wall biopsy will also be performed at baseline and at week 17.</detailed_description>
