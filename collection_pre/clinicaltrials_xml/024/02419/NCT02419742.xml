	<criteria>Histologically confirmed early invasive HER2 positive, node positive or high risk node negative breast cancer with no evidence of residual, locally recurrent or metastatic disease and defined as clinical stage I to IIIA that is eligible for adjuvant treatment with Trastuzumab. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2. HER2 overexpression/amplification defined as either IHC3+, or IHC2+ and Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) positive as determined in a central laboratory. At time of starting Trastuzumab therapy, Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measured by echocardiography. Screening left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) =/&gt; 55%. Adequate bone marrow, renal, and hepatic function. Agreement to use an adequate, nonhormonal means of contraception by women of childbearing potential. Any contraindication to Trastuzumab. Previous adjuvant breast cancer treatment with an approved or investigational antiHER2 agent. History of other malignancy, except for curatively treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix or basal cell carcinoma and patients with other curatively treated malignancies who have been diseasefree for at least 5 years. Past history of ductal carcinoma in situ and/or lobular carcinoma that has been treated with any systemic therapy or with radiation therapy to the ipsilateral breast where the invasive cancer subsequently develops. Locally advanced (stage IIIB and IIIC) and Metastatic disease (stage IV). Clinically relevant cardiovascular disorder or disease. Uncontrolled hypertension, or history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy. History of severe allergic or immunological reactions, e.g. difficult to control asthma. Pregnant or lactating women.</criteria>
