	<detailed_description>The investigators will study a noninvasive no risk process by which we can quickly screen and assess for fasting and non-fasting states in individuals scheduled for routine endoscopy. In non-fasting individuals, the risk of a sedation related complication such as aspiration increases and often the procedure must be aborted and repeated on another day following more prolonged fasting and medication administration. This adds to increased cost and delay to patient care.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Adult (18+) patient undergoing scheduled elective outpatient upper endoscopy 2. Willing and able to consent to research protocol 3. Fasting as required per routine instruction for upper endoscopy 4. Able to breath for approximately 10 minutes pre and post procedure into the Aeonose device with a noseplug on 5. Able to consume standard refreshments post procedure during recovery per routine endoscopic area policy 1. Nonfasting per protocol, or known to have had food or drink outside of routine protocol 2. &lt; 18 years of age 3. Unable or unwilling to consent to research protocol 4. Inability to tolerate Aeonose breathing (such as those with claustrophobia, anxiety, nasal trauma, etc.) 5. Unable to consume refreshment post procedurally 6. Unable to repeat Aeonose measurement postprocedurally due to tolerance or medical indication (such as instructed to remain fasting)</criteria>
