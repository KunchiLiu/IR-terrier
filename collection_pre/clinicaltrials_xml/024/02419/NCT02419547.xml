	<brief_summary>This research study is being done to see whether general anesthesia (GA) affects our ability to start ventricular tachycardia (VT) during an VT ablation procedure. Data collected during this research study will help electrophysiologists and anesthesiologists to make the best decisions about the best anesthetic conditions to use to perform VT ablations. This research study is a "pilot" study. Pilot studies are done on a small group of subjects to learn if a larger study would be useful.</brief_summary>
