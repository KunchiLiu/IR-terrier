	<brief_summary>This clincial trial is evaluating if the co-administration of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin, in addition to metformin, results in better glycemic control, as measured by HbA1c, over a treatment period of 52 weeks, compared to the addition of glimepiride to metformin in subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus who have inadequate glycemic control on Metformin Alone. We will compare the change from baseline in HbA1c achieved with saxagliptin, in co-administration with dapagliflozin, added to current background therapy with metformin compared to glimepiride added to current background therapy with metformin ≥1500 mg at Week 52.</brief_summary>
