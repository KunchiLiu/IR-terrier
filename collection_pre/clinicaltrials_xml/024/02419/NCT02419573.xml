	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the trial is to determine if 72-hour survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is improved with initial endotracheal intubation (ETI) over initial laryngeal tube (LT) airway management strategies. The null hypothesis is that 72-hour survival is similar between primary Laryngeal Tube (LT) SGA and primary ETI airway management strategies. Evaluated secondary outcomes will include return of spontaneous circulation, survival to hospital discharge, neurologically intact survival at hospital discharge, airway management performance, and clinical adverse events.</detailed_description>
