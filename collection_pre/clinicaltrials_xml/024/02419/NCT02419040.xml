	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of removal of the calcification in calcific tendinitis of the shoulder (supraspinatus and/or infraspinatus tendon) by aspiration with a needle and syringe (barbotage) and a corticosteroid injection is more effective than corticosteroid or sham injection alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Calcific Tendinitis of the Rotator Cuff</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Barbotage is a sonographically guided percutaneous needle aspiration and lavage of the calcium deposit in calcific tendinitis of the shoulder. Persisting pain in cacific tendinitis is considered to be a consequence of increased tendon volume or changed tendon texture in the area of the calcification which leads to secondary impingement and inflammation. Consequently, removal of the deposit should be a causal treatment measure. Scientific evidence for the efficacy of the barbotage procedure in patients with persistent symptoms from calcific tendinitis is still limited. The cyclic often self-limiting course of the disease, and an anticipated placebo effect, questions about the method's efficacy can only be answered by high-quality randomized studies. In this trial the investigators want to randomize a cohort of patients to (1) Ultrasound guided needling, lavage and subacromial steroid injection, (2) Ultrasound guided subacromial steroid injection or (3) Ultrasound guided lidocain injection (sham). The investigators want to follow the patients over two years with repeated testing with a set of validated outcome measures together with radiologic re-examinations. The investigators want to find out whether the active treatments (1, 2) are more effective than the sham treatment and whether there are differences in outcome between the two active treatments. To increase the generalizability of the investigators' results, the investigators want to perform the study as a multi-centre study.</detailed_description>
