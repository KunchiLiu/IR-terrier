	<brief_summary>The investigators want to understand how oral processing (chewing) of nuts affects particle size and the presence of lipid (fat) on the cut surfaces. The main objective of the study is to: Measure the size of nut particles that have been chewed sufficiently to be swallowed. The secondary objective of this study is to: Measure any changes in lipid content due to chewing and compare it to a prediction from a theoretical model. The investigators have developed a theoretical model for determining the release of nutrients from plant foods, specifically lipid (fat) from almonds. The model has been used to calculate the amount of lipid released from chewed almonds. The model shows that only about 10% of the lipid is immediately released. The investigators require information on the particle size distribution (number of particles of each size) for other chewed nuts to calculate the amount of lipid released for other nuts. This will allow us to check the validity of our model for other foods.</brief_summary>
