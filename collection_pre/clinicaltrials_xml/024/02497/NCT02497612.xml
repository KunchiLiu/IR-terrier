	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To determine whether a single dose combination of OZ439 (Artefenomel)/FQ (Ferroquine) is an efficacious treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in adults and children. Secondary Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of OZ439 (Artefenomel)/FQ (Ferroquine): - To determine the incidence of recrudescence and re-infection. - To determine the time to relief of fever and parasite clearance. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of OZ439 (Artefenomel)/FQ (Ferroquine). To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of OZ439 (Artefenomel)/FQ (Ferroquine). To explore in vitro drug resistance of P. falciparum infecting patients &gt;14 years old in Vietnamese sites.</brief_summary>
