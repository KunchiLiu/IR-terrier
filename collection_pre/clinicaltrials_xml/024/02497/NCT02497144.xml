	<brief_summary>Decreased exercise capacity and quality of life, increased dyspnea and fatigue perception and hypoxemia during exercise is seen in patients with interstitial lung disease. Impaired ventilatory response, increased lung compliance, ventilation-perfusion mismatching and inadequate peripheral circulation causes decreased exercise capacity. Another important factor that induce decreased exercise capacity is peripheral muscle weakness. In literature, there is no study investigated effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation on functional exercise capacity, respiratory and peripheral muscle strength, pulmonary functions, physical activity level, dyspnea and fatigue perception in patients with interstitial lung disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation in Patients With Interstitial Lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In literature, there was increased quantity of study investigated effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation in chronic lung disease patients. It was used as a pulmonary rehabilitation component especially in patients with decreased exercise capacity and peripheral muscle strength, intensely increased dyspnea inhibits exercise. It was demonstrated that neuromuscular electrical stimulation improved functional exercise capacity, peripheral muscle strength and quality of life.</detailed_description>
