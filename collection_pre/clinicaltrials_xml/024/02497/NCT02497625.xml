	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Therapeutic Alliance and Minimal Intervention for Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low back pain remains a global public health problem. The classification of patients in low back pain subgroups aims to optimize the health system and provide the quantity and the type of proper technique for each patient. Several factors may influence physical therapy. The therapeutic alliance may be defined as harmony or social connection between the therapist and the patient and may influence the treatment effect. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the addition of the therapeutic alliance to a minimum intervention for the treatment of chronic non-specific low back pain with low risk of psychosocial factors.</detailed_description>
