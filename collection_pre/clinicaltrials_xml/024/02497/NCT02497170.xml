	<brief_summary>Translational study based on the American Association of Diabetes Educators 7 behaviors to manage Type 2 diabetes</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Implementation of A Patient Centered Self-Management Program for Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Primary Investigator will meet with patients that attend routine visits for Diabetes 2 in the primary care office on a monthly basis to set behavior goals. Behavior goals will be set by patient's choice of 4 out of 7 of the AADE7 recommendations. The goals are health eating, being active, monitoring,taking medications, problem solving, healthy coping, and reducing risk. Once the goal is chosen, the PI and patient will make a plan to address the goals on a monthly basis for four months. There will be pre and post questionnaires that will evaluate diabetes knowledge and self-efficacy. There will also be a pre and post measure of the patient's Hemoglobin A1c which is a measurement that helps determine the extent of glycemic control over a three-month period. The goal of the study is to determine if translation of the AADE7 behavioral goals into the primary care setting will make a difference in diabetes knowledge, self efficacy, and Hemoglobin A1c.</detailed_description>
