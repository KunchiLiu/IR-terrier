	<brief_summary>The use of a written, pre-procedure checklist and positioning the patient with the head of the bed elevated have been proposed as interventions capable of preventing complications during non-elective intubation and are used intermittently in routine care -- however neither have been examined in a prospective trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Checklists and Upright Positioning in Endotracheal Intubation of Critically Ill Patients (Check-UP) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endotracheal intubation is common in the care of critically ill patients. Procedural complications including hypoxia and hypotension are frequent in urgent and emergent intubation and associated with an increased risk of death. The use of a written, pre-procedure checklist and positioning the patient with the head of the bed elevated have been proposed as interventions capable of preventing complications during non-elective intubation and are used intermittently in routine care -- however neither have been examined in a prospective trial. The investigators propose a randomized trial comparing use of a written checklist versus no written checklist and ramped versus sniffing position for endotracheal intubation of critically ill adults.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Airway management events will be included in which: 1. Patient is admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) 2. Planned procedure is endotracheal intubation 3. Planned operator is a Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (PCCM) fellow 4. Administration of sedation and/or neuromuscular blockade is planned 5. Age â‰¥ 18 years old Airway management events will be excluded in which: 1. Operator feels specific patient positioning during intubation is required 2. Urgency of intubation precludes safe performance of study procedures 3. Operator feels an alternative preprocedure checklist or no checklist is required</criteria>
