	<brief_summary>This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Brentuximab Vedotin (BV) as a single agent in relapsed/refractory CD30+ PTCL patients. BV will be administered as a single IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Measures of anti-cancer activity will be assessed using the revised response criteria for malignant lymphoma (Cheson et al. 2007). Computed tomography (CT) scans (chest, neck, abdomen, and pelvis) and PET scan will be performed at baseline and Cycles 3, 8, 12, and 16. Patients will have an End of Treatment (EOT) assessment 30 ± 7 days after receiving their final dose of study drug. Patients with at least stable disease will enter short follow up phase till month 24 with radiology assessment every 6 months and visit every 12 weeks. After month 24 and for all patients with progressive disease, long-term follow-up assessments (including survival, disease status and next therapy information) will be performed every 12 weeks until either patient death or study closure, whichever occurs first.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Signed written informed consent. Males and females ≥18 and ≤75 years at the time of enrolment. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of PTCL (PTCLnot otherwise specified [PTCLNOS], angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma [AILT] and transformed mycosis fungoides) according to World Health Organization (2008) classification. Histologically confirmed CD30+ PTCL. Availability of histological material for central review and pathobiological studies. Failed at least one prior systemic antilymphoma therapy. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of ≤ 1 at study entry. At least one site of disease measurable in two dimensions by computed tomography. Both nodal and extranodal disease will be considered (lymphnodes must have long axis of 1.5 cm regardless of short axis or long axis 1.1 to 1.5 cm and short axis &gt;1.0 cm). Hematology values within the following limits: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/mm3 independent of growth factor support. Platelets ≥75,000/mm3 or ≥50,000/mm3 if bone marrow involvement is independent of transfusion support. Hemoglobin level ≥8 g/dL. Biochemical values within the following limits: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN). Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN (unless bilirubin rise is due to Gilbert's syndrome or of nonhepatic origin). Serum creatinine ≤ 2 x ULN. Serum albumin ≥ 3 g/dL. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days of receiving study medication. WOCBP must agree to use effective contraception, defined as oral contraceptives, double barrier method or practice true abstinence from sexual intercourse during the study and for 6 months after the last dose of study drug. Male subjects and their female partners of childbearing potential must be willing to use an appropriate method of contraception or practice true abstinence from sexual intercourse during the study and for 6 months after the last dose of study drug. Diagnosis of CTCL, ALCL, mycosis fungoides or Sezary Syndrome. CD30 expression &lt; 10 % as measured by IHC Patients that have not completed any prior treatment chemotherapy and/or other investigational agents within at least 5 halflives of last dose of that prior treatment. Patients underwent major surgery without complete recovery Known hypersensitivity to recombinant proteins, murine proteins, or to any excipient contained in the drug formulation of brentuximab vedotin. Any serious active disease or comorbid medical condition (according to investigator's decision). Prior history of malignancies other than lymphoma (except for a history of a complete resection for basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast) unless the subject has been free of the disease for ≥ 3 years. Patients with peripheral neuropathy of grade 34. Signs or symptoms of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).</criteria>
