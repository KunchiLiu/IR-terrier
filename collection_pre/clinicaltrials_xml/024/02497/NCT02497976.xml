	<brief_title>Pilot Study Evaluating the Efficacy of Certolizumab Pegol for Interstitial Cystitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a chronic disabling bladder syndrome characterized by urinary frequency, nocturia, urinary urgency, and pain or discomfort with bladder filling. There is no cure for IC and the treatment options are suboptimal. Patients with IC report significant negative effects on their physical and mental quality of life. The etiology of IC is unknown. Certain aspects of IC suggest that autoimmunity may play a role in initiating or sustaining the chronic inflammatory response. Bladder biopsies of patients with IC demonstrate an increase number of mast cells. Mast cell activation with the release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) may mediate this bladder inflammation. Cimzia (certolizumab pegol) is a medication that blocks the effect of TNF. Cimzia (certolizumab pegol) is FDA approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and Crohn's disease. These diseases are similar to IC. In this study, the hypothesis being tested is that Cimzia (certolizumab pegol) will show efficacy in improving the symptoms of patients with IC.</detailed_description>
