	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if there is any difference in the way the body handles 3 types of evacetrapib tablets with different particle sizes. Information about any side effects will also be collected. This study will consist of 3 study periods. Participants will be dosed 3 times during the entire study. Each study period will consist of an inpatient stay for 3 days - the day before dosing (Day -1), dosing day (Day 1) and the day after dosing (Day 2). Then participants will be asked to return to the clinical research unit (CRU) daily for outpatient appointments up to Day 8. The overall length of this study is about 7 weeks from first dose to end of study. Screening will take place within 28 days prior to the first dose of evacetrapib and follow-up will take place 21 days after the last dose of evacetrapib.</brief_summary>
