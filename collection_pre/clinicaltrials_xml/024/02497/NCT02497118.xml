	<brief_summary>This study mainly to observe the anti angiogenic drugs Endostatin (Endostar) combined with vinorelbine and Cisplatin (NP) as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with non small cell lung cancer clinical efficiency and safety. Through anti angiogenesis therapy combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy improve the treatment of neoadjuvant therapy in tumor response rate and the rate of resection, At the same time, the study before and after the anti angiogenesis therapy in patients with peripheral blood circulation endothelial cells(CECs), levels of Endothelial progenitor cells（EPC）, micro vascular density（MVD） and vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) expression level, to understanding the correlation between the clinical efficacy of anti angiogenesis therapy combined with chemotherapy and the change of all these markers. In order to find the reference basis for the prediction of the effect of curative effect. The changes of blood volume, blood flow and vascular permeability of the lung cancer before and after treatment with CT perfusion imaging are studied.</brief_summary>
