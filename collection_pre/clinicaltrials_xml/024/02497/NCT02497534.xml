	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to characterize measures of cardiac performance and neuromuscular physiology in FA patients using novel techniques, including echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), metabolic exercise testing, and neurophysiological outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers in Friedreich's Ataxia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation in the frataxin gene (FXN). Although rare, FA is the most common form of hereditary ataxia, affecting 1 in every 50,000 people in the United States. Currently, palliative therapies are the only treatment for FA patients. However, current gene therapy efforts in other neuromuscular diseases have positioned the investigator's research program to extend these discoveries and techniques to FA. As new therapies become available for clinical application, it is crucial to identify non-invasive outcomes measures of cardiac and neuromuscular performance with adequate sensitivity to detect the impact of treatments.</detailed_description>
