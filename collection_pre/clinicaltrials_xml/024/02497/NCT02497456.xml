	<brief_title>The Effectiveness of a Counselling Intervention on the Uptake of HIV Care Services Among HIV Infected Patients in Uganda</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data on linkage to pre-antiretroviral therapy (pre-ART) care after HIV diagnosis through home-based HIV counselling and testing (HBHCT) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are scarce. The few existing data suggest that only 13% to 54% of HIV-infected persons identified through HBHCT enter pre-ART care. No studies have rigorously evaluated interventions aimed at improving linkage to pre-ART care following HBHCT in SSA. This study will evaluate the effect of follow-up counselling after HIV diagnosis through HBHCT on linkage to pre-ART care in Masaka, south-western Uganda. The study is a cluster randomised trial of the effectiveness of referral to pre-ART care and follow-up counselling (intervention) compared to referral to pre-ART care only (control), for individuals diagnosed with HIV through HBHCT. The intervention will be administered at months 1 and 2, and linkage to care assessed at month 6 post-HBHCT. Data will be collected on socio-demographic characteristics, sexual risk profile, HIV testing history, HIV status disclosure, linkage to care, CD4 count testing and results, cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, and ART initiation. At least 224 HIV-infected participants will be enrolled from 28 clusters (14/study arm). Approximately 84 HIV-uninfected individuals will also be recruited into the study to reduce the possibility of revealing the sero-status of the HIV-infected participants.</detailed_description>
