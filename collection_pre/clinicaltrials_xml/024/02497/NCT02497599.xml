	<brief_summary>Intraoperative tumor localization and resection can be enhanced using intraoperative fluorescence imaging and radiodetection. Girentuximab specifically recognizes carbonic anhydrase IX expressed on &gt; 95% of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Therefore Indium-111-DOTA-girentuximab-IRDye800CW is a perfect dual-labeled antibody for dual-modality image-guided surgery in RCC. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and safety of intraoperative dual-modality imaging with Indium-111-DOTA-girentuximab-IRDye800CW in renal cell carcinoma patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraoperative Dual-modality Imaging in Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In oncologic surgery complete tumor resection is important for treatment outcome and patient survival. Intraoperative tumor localization and resection can be enhanced using intraoperative imaging techniques (e.g. targeted radioguided or fluorescence guided surgery). A powerful synergy can be achieved by combining radiotracers (e.g. Indium-111) and optical tracers (e.g. IRDye 800CW) conjugated to an antibody against a tumor-associated antigen. Girentuximab specifically recognizes carbonic anhydrase IX expressed on &gt; 95% of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Therefore Indium-111-DOTA-girentuximab-IRDye800CW is a perfect dual-labeled antibody for dual-modality image-guided surgery in RCC. The concept has been shown in preclinical studies with mice and the investigators will translate this to the clinic. Eligible patients with renal cell carcinoma scheduled for (partial) nephrectomy will receive dual-labeled girentuximab 7 days before surgery. At day 4 or 5 a SPECT/CT of the abdomen will be obtained. Surgery at day 7 will be extended with the use of a near-infrared fluorescence camera and a gamma probe. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and safety of intraoperative dual-modality imaging with Indium-111-DOTA-girentuximab-IRDye800CW in renal cell carcinoma.</detailed_description>
