	<brief_summary>This study will provide information regarding the metabolic pathway of GBT440, the need for evaluation of potential drug-drug interactions, and the need for studies in special populations. The administration of radiolabeled drug is necessary to fully characterize the rates and routes of elimination of GBT440, providing further quantitative information on the disposition of GBT440. The results from this study will permit a comprehensive comparison between animal and human routes of elimination and metabolic profiles of GBT440.</brief_summary>
