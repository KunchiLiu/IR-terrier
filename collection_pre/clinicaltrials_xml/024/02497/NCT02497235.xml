	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the brain cholesterol 24S-hydroxylase (CH24H) enzyme occupancy of TAK-935 after single oral dose in healthy participants using the positron emission tomography (PET) ligand [18F]MNI-792 and PET imaging and to determine the relationship of occupancy to TAK-935 exposure.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-935. TAK-935 is being tested to examine the degree and duration of brain CH24H enzyme occupancy/target engagement as a function of TAK-935 plasma concentration in order to guide dosing and schedule for future clinical trials with TAK-935.This study will utilize the PET ligand [18F]MNI-792 to evaluate the brain CH24H occupancy of TAK-935 after single dose oral administration in healthy adult participants. The study will evaluate up to 16 participants. The first 2 participants will take TAK-935 600 mg oral solution and undergo PET imaging using tracer [18F]MNI-792 up to 5 microgram (up to 370 MBq), injection, intravenously prior to each PET scan at Baseline, 45 minutes and 10 hours post-TAK-935 dose. TAK-935 dose and timing of post-dose scans for subsequent participants will be based on the data from the previous participants. This single-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 55 days. Participants will make 4 visits to the clinic, including 2 confinement periods to the clinic for PET imaging. Participants will be contacted by phone on Day 22 for follow-up safety assessments.</detailed_description>

Contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on the standard MRI radiography screening questionnaire. 3. Had exposure to any radiation greater than (&gt;) 15 millisievert (mSv)/year (example, occupational or radiation therapy) within the previous year prior to Baseline imaging. 4. Has a known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation of TAK935 or related compounds, or to [18F]MNI792 or to any of its components. 5. Clinically significant abnormal findings on brain MRI scan or findings on brain MRI that may interfere with the interpretation of the PET imaging. 6. Use of any overthecounter, herbal, or prescription medications or supplements within 30 days prior to baseline imaging.</criteria>
