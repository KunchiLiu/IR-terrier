	<brief_title>Azacytidine Prior to in Vivo T-cell Depleted Allo Stem Cell Transplant for Patients With Myeloid Malignancies in CR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label two-step phase II study is designed to determine the safety and efficacy of epigenetic priming with 5-Azacytidine immediately prior to reduced intensity conditioning for an in vivo T-cell depleted hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for high risk myeloid malignancies in complete remission (CR). Subjects will be given a five day course of subcutaneous 5-azacytidine, followed by a reduced intensity conditioning regimen of fludarabine and melphalan prior to an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a related or unrelated HLA matched donor. The effect of 5-azacytidine on global gene methylation will be assessed. Evaluations for safety, in particular for graft failure, transplant related mortality and acute graft versus host disease will be made on a weekly basis. Efficacy, as defined by disease free survival, will be evaluated with a bone marrow biopsy at the standard time points, which are one-, three-, six-, and twelve-months after transplant and upon clinical suspicion within regular follow-up visits - weekly for the first 3 months, then biweekly for 3 months, then monthly until one-year post-SCT. Thereafter, unless otherwise dictated by the clinical scenario, the follow up visits will be every 3 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed AML or MDS as specified below: 1. Acute myeloid leukemia with poor risk cytogenetics (1) in complete hematologic remission. These include: del (5q)/5, del (7q)/7, abn 3q, 9q, 11q, 20q, 21q, 17p, t(6;9), t(9;22) and complex karyotypes (â‰¥ 3 unrelated abnormalities); or 2. Acute myeloid leukemia with Flt3 mutation in complete hematologic remission; or 3. Acute myeloid leukemia, all types, excluding M3 (Promyelocytic leukemia) in second or higher hematologic remission; or 4. Myelodysplastic syndromes (intermediate2, high risk and CMML with bone marrow blasts &lt;5%); or Secondary acute myeloid leukemia on the basis of prior MDS in hematologic remission Life expectancy not severely limited by concomitant disease ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 Adequate organ function as defined below: Serum Bilirubin:&lt;2.0 mg/dL ALT (SGPT): &lt;3X upper limit of normal Creatinine Clearance:&gt;50 mL/min (eGFR as estimated by the modified MDRD equation) Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Evidence of chronic active hepatitis or cirrhosis HIV infection Uncontrolled illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Pregnant and lactating women are excluded from the study because the risks to an unborn fetus or potential risks in nursing infants are unknown. There are no prior therapies or concomitant medications that would render the patients ineligible</criteria>
