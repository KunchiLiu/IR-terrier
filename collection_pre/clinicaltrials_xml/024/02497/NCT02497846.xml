	<brief_title>TEOSYAL® PureSense Redensity [I] Injection Using MicronJet® Needle in the Treatment of Crow's Feet Wrinkles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TEOSYAL® PureSense Redensity [I] is a viscoelastic gel of non-cross-linked hyaluronic acid that is sterile, non pyrogenic, colourless and of non-animal origin and contains 0.3% by mass of lidocaine hydrochloride, for its anaesthetic properties. Each box contains two syringes pre-filled with Teosyal® PureSense Redensity I. The volume of each syringe is shown on the cardboard box as well as on each syringe. Teosyal® PureSense Redensity I is indicated for the prevention of wrinkles and rehydration of the neck, neckline, face and in particular the crow's feet wrinkles. The MicronJet® needle is a 3 micro-needle (0.6 mm of length) device that is mounted on a standard syringe in the same manner as a conventional needle. The MicronJet® needle is used to inject liquid substances, allowing for controlled intradermal delivery in any procedure which requires administration of substances to the dermal compartment. For the first time, the TEOSYAL® PureSense Redensity [I] will be injected using the medical device MicronJet® in the superficial wrinkles.</detailed_description>
