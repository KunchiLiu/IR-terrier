	<brief_title>Effect of Smoking on Postprandial Gastric Emptying, Glucose Tolerance and Secretion of Gut and Pancreatic Hormones</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidemiological studies show that active smoking increases the risk of type 2 diabetes in a dose-dependent fashion. Smokers seem to be characterized by central obesity, increased inflammatory markers and oxidative stress, which may lead to insulin resistance and irregularities in glucose metabolism. The current study is a meal test study, in which the aim is to examine a number of variables during a liquid mixed meal test (including gastric emptying, glucose tolerance, gut and pancreatic hormone responses, gall bladder emptying, appetite and food intake) performed in healthy non-smoking subjects and in healthy smokers with or without concomitant cigarette smoking. The investigators hypothesize that smoking-induced increases in circulating nicotine levels and simultaneous activation of nicotinic receptors in the gastrointestinal tract and in the autonomic nervous system would have detrimental effect on postprandial glucose metabolism and, thus, constitute an important link between smoking and the risk of type 2 diabetes. The current study will help to clarify this hypothesis and improve our general understanding of the association between smoking and gut hormone secretion, gastric emptying and glucose metabolism.</detailed_description>
