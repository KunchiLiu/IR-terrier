	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Therapy Via Telemedicine Following Cochlear Implants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children with congenital sensorineural deafness can acquire relatively normal language if they undergo cochlear implantation surgery followed by aural rehabilitation therapy in the first three to four years of life. High quality therapy, however, may not be available in many areas. This study will assess the effectiveness of post-implant Auditory-Verbal Therapy (AVT) delivered by means of telemedicine technology. This will be accomplished primarily by evaluating subjects' language abilities using the 5th Edition of the Preschool Language Scales.</detailed_description>
