	<brief_summary>Introduction: immersion cold water is a recuperative strategy commonly used, however, are not yet fully understood the real effects of this technique on specific conditions. Objective: To analyze and to compare the effects of the immersion cold water during the intense post-exercise recovery, using different times and temperatures on biological, clinical and metabolic variables. Method: 105 male subjects were divided into five groups: one control group (CG) and four recoveries (G1: 5' at 9±1 degrees Celsius; G2: 5' at 14±1 degrees Celsius; G3: 15' at 9±1 degrees Celsius; G4: 15' at 14±1 degrees Celsius). The volunteers were submitted an exhaustion protocol that consisted of a program of jumps and the Wingate test. Immediately after the exhaustion protocol, volunteers were directed to a tank with water and ice, which were immersed up to the height of the anterior superior iliac spine to the recovery procedure, during which blood samples were collected for later analysis lactate and creatine kinase (CK). Variables were collected prior to the exercise, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after the end of it. Furthermore, the perception of pain and recovery of the lower limbs were also collected at specific moments by means respectively of the Likert scale of perceived effort and visual analogue scale pain. Appropriate statistical analysis was used to compare the groups and the moments, considering the 5% level of significance.</brief_summary>
