	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerability and safety of JNJ-54767414 (daratumumab) in Combination With Bortezomib and Dexamethasone (D-Vd) in Japanese participants with relapsed (the return of a medical problem) or refractory (not responding to treatment) multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of JNJ-54767414 (Daratumumab) in Combination With Bortezomib and Dexamethasone (D-Vd) in Japanese Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all participants and study personnel will know the identity of the study treatments) and multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites) study in Japanese participants. The study will include a Screening Phase (21 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1); open-label treatment phase (from Cycle 1 Day 1 until study treatment discontinuation, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other reasons), and a Follow-up Phase. Bortezomib and Dexamethasone will be administered along with JNJ-54767414 for first 8 treatment cycles. Follow-up Phase begins immediately following the End-of-Treatment Visit, and will continue until 8 weeks after last study treatment, death, loss to follow-up, consent withdrawal for study participation, or study end, whichever occurs first. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants proven to have symptomatic (having symptoms) multiple myeloma (MM) according the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) diagnostic criteria Participant must have documented MM as defined by following criteria: Monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow 10 percent (%), or presence of a biopsyproven plasmacytoma at some point in their disease history, disease measurements: a) Serum Mprotein greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 1 gram per deciliter (g/dL) (&gt;=10 gram per liter [g/L]) b) Serum immunoglobulin A [IgA] Mprotein &gt;= 0.5 g/dL); c) Urine Mprotein &gt;=200 milligram per 24 hour (mg/24 h); d) Serum immunoglobulin free light chain &gt;=10 mg/dL and abnormal serum immunoglobulin kappa lambda free light chain ratio Participant must have received at least 1 prior line of therapy for MM Participant must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1 Participant must have achieved a response (partial response [PR] or better based on investigator's determination of response by the IMWG criteria) to at least 1 prior regimen Participant has received daratumumab or other anticluster of differentiation 38 (antiCD38) therapies previously Is refractory to bortezomib or another PI, like ixazomib and carfilzomib (had progression of disease while receiving bortezomib therapy or within 60 days of ending bortezomib therapy or another PI therapy, like ixazomib and carfilzomib Is intolerant to bortezomib (ie, discontinued due to any adverse event while on bortezomib treatment) Has received antimyeloma treatment within 2 weeks or 5 pharmacokinetic halflives of the treatment, whichever is longer, before the date of daratumumab first administration. The only exception is emergency use of a short course of corticosteroids (equivalent of dexamethasone 40 milligram per day [mg/day] for a maximum of 4 days) before treatment. A list of antimyeloma treatments with the corresponding pharmacokinetic halflives is provided in the Site Investigational Product Procedures Manual (IPPM) Has a history of malignancy (other than multiple myeloma) within 3 years before the date of daratumumab first administration Has any concurrent medical condition or disease (eg, active systemic infection, pulmonary impairment) that is likely to interfere with study procedures</criteria>
