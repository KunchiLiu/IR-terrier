	<brief_title>A Long-term, Safety and Efficacy Study of Intranasal Esketamine in Treatment-resistant Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (the researchers and participants know the treatment the participant is receiving), multicenter (more than 1 study site), long-term safety and efficacy study of intranasal esketamine plus an oral antidepressant in participants with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Participants will enter the study either directly (direct-entry participants) or after completing the Double-Blind Induction Phase of ESKETINTRD3005 (transferred-entry participants). The study consists of 4 phases: Screening Phase (4 weeks), Open-Label Induction Phase (4 weeks), Open-Label Optimization/Maintenance phase (48 weeks), and Follow up Phase (4 weeks). Transferred entry non-responders in the ESKETINTRD3005 may enter study at the Open-Label Induction Phase and responders in the ESKETINTRD3005 may enter Optimization/Maintenance phase. In the Open-Label Induction Phase, participants will self-administer flexibly-dosed intranasal esketamine (participants who are less than (&lt;) 65 years old self-administer 56 mg or 84 mg dose, participants who are greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 65 years old self-administer 28 mg, 56 mg or 84 mg dose) twice weekly for 4 weeks. The starting dose for all participants &gt;= 65 years old will be 28 mg. In addition, each direct-entry participants will be assigned to receive 1 of 4 selected oral antidepressant medications (escitalopram or sertraline or duloxetine or venlafaxine extended release [XR]), initiated on Day 1 of the open-label induction phase and continued through the duration of the study. Transferred-entry participants will continue their same antidepressant from ESKETINTRD3005 through the duration of this study. Participants who are responders at the end of the Open-Label Induction phase and transferred-entry responder participants (from study ESKETINTRD3005) will enter the Optimization/Maintenance Phase where intranasal esketamine treatment sessions will be reduced from that in the induction phase (twice weekly) to weekly for the first 4 weeks of this phase, and then individualized to either once weekly or once every other week based on the severity of depressive symptoms. Participants' safety and depressive symptoms will be assessed and monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
