	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators would like to describe FDG-PET/CT responses in patients who are receiving CART-19 immunotherapy for Follicular Lymphoma (FL), Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), and Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) as part of UPCC #13413. Subjects will undergo two FDG-PET/CTs. One performed within 6 weeks of CART-19 infusion and a repeat scan at about 1 month after infusion.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects enrolled on the study UPCC 13413 Pilot Study Of Redirected Autologous T Cells Engineered To Contain AntiCd19 Attached To Tcr And 41bb Signaling Domains In Patients With Chemotherapy Resistant Or Refractory Cd19+ Lymphoma CART19 autologous Tcell trial with relapsed or refractory DLBCL and FL. As this is a pilot study, we plan to enroll 4 subjects from the two disease types of interest. Subjects â‰¥ 18 years of age Subjects able to provide informed consent and agree to comply with study procedures Subjects who are pregnant or lactating. Subjects will be coenrolled in this study and UPCC 13413 and therefore must comply with the UPCC 13413 Pilot Study Of Redirected Autologous T Cells Engineered To Contain AntiCd19 Attached To Tcr And 41bb Signaling Domains In Patients With Chemotherapy Resistant Or Refractory Cd19+ Lymphoma requirements pertaining to pregnancy, lactation, conception and contraception use throughout their participation in both studies.</criteria>
