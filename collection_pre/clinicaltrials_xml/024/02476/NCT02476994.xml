	<brief_summary>This will be a descriptive study designed to evaluate the propensity for hospitalized pediatric patients treated adequately with Clinolipid or standard of care for up to 90 days to develop Essential Fatty Acid Deficiency (EFAD). Additionally, this study design will evaluate the safety and efficacy of using Clinolipid in a pediatric population.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Soybean oil, phospholipid emulsion</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Patients and/or their legal representative must be able to understand the study and voluntarily sign the ICF 2. Patients age &lt;18 years 3. Patients who are able to adhere to protocol requirements 4. Patients who are expected to require PN for at least 7 days 5. Premature infants (&lt;36 weeks of gestation) require at least 80% PN to meet nutrition requirements at study entry; full term infants and children require at least 70% PN to meet nutrition requirements at study entry 1. Patients who are not expected to survive hospitalization or with a severe illness with foreseeable intercurrent events that could jeopardize the patient's participation in the study 2. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to lipid emulsion, egg or soybean proteins, or any of the active substances, excipients, or components of the container 3. Patients with a diagnosis of shock, renal failure requiring dialysis, or severe metabolic acidosis (eg, pH &lt;7.10, serum bicarbonate level â‰¤15 mEq/L , and/or an Anion Gap &gt;16 mEq/L) 4. Patients with hemodynamic instability as judged by the Investigator 5. Patients with uncorrected metabolic disorders (eg, diabetes) or liver disease including cholestasis 6. Patients with severe hyperlipidemia or severe disorders of lipid metabolism characterized by hypertriglyceridemia (triglyceride &gt;400 mg/dL) 7. Patients who are unable to tolerate the necessary laboratory monitoring 8. Patients who have a new and active infection (as assessed by the investigator) at time of initiation of study treatment 9. Patients who are enrolled in another clinical trial involving an investigational agent 10. Patients who were treated with IV lipids within 48 hours of randomization into the study</criteria>
