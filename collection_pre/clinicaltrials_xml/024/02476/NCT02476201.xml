	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to assess prospectively at 6 months the percentage of responder patients implanted with a Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT-D) device and a Quartet Left Ventricular (LV) quadripolar lead and with the MultiPoint Pacing (MPP) feature activated.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint of the study is to measure prospectively at 6 months the percentage of responder* patients implanted with a Quartet LV quadripolar lead and with the MultiPoint Pacing feature activated compared with No Pacing at baseline. *A positive CRT response is defined as an improvement of more than 15 % in Left Ventricular End Systolic Volume (LVESV) at 6 months post-implant, measured by Echocardiography.</detailed_description>
