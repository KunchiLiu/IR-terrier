	<brief_title>Depersonalization Disorder: Therapeutic Effect of Neuronavigated Repetitive Transcranial Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depersonalization disorder is characterised by a profound disruption of self-awareness. Depersonalization symptoms may occasionally arise (30 to 70% of the population) or may become chronic in depersonalization disorder. Its prevalence is around 2.4% in the general population. This disorder is particularly resistant to pharmacological treatments. This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, and the investigators are testing the therapeutic efficacy of neuronavigated repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) of right angular gyrus in patients with depersonalization disorder.</detailed_description>
