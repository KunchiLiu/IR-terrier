	<brief_summary>This non-interventional study will prospectively collect detailed, high-quality documentation of bleeds, HRQoL, and safety in patients with hemophilia A with or without FVIII inhibitors treated according to local routine clinical practice (receiving FVIII replacement or bypassing agents as either episodic or prophylactic treatment). Actual patients will be enrolled from routine clinical practice in this observational study.</brief_summary>
