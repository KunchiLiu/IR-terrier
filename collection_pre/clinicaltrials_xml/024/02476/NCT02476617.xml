	<brief_summary>A study to evaluate immune restoration following removal of viral antigen in non-cirrhotic HCV GT1a treatment-naïve and pegylated-interferon (pegIFN)/RBV treatment-experienced adults receiving treatment with ombitasvir/ABT-450/ritonavir and dasabuvir coadministered with RBV for 12 weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ombitasvir/ABT-450/Ritonavir (Ombitasvir/ABT-450/r) With Dasabuvir and Ribavirin (RBV) in Treatment Naive and Treatment Experienced Genotype 1a Hepatitis C Virus Infected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A study to evaluate the role of ombitasvir/ABT-450/ritonavir and dasabuvir coadministered with RBV treatment leading to sustained virologic response 12 weeks post-dosing (SVR12) on the changes from baseline in IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression in peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs) in HCV GT1a-infected adult subjects.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Screening laboratory result indicating HCV GT1a infection. 2. Chronic HCV infection. 3. Subjects must be noncirrhotic. 4. Subjects must be treatmentnaïve or have documentation that they were adherent to prior pegIFN/RBV combination therapy and meet the criteria of prior pegIFN/RBV treatment failure. 5. Subjects must meet specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele requirements. 1. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. 2. Positive test result for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or antihuman immunodeficiency virus antibody (HIV Ab) positive immunoassay. 3. Clinically significant abnormalities or comorbidities, other than HCV infection, that make the subject unsuitable for this study or treatment. 4. Current enrollment in another interventional clinical study, previous enrollment in this study, prior or current use of any investigational or commercially available antiHCV agents other than pegIFN or RBV (including previous exposure to ABT450, ombitasvir, or dasabuvir), or receipt of any investigational product within 6 weeks prior to study drug administration. 5. History or solid organ transplant. 6. Screening laboratory analysis that shows abnormal results.</criteria>
