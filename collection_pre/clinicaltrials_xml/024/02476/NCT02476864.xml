	<brief_summary>A study conducted in healthy adults to investigate if a new macitentan tablet leads to the same fate of macitentan in the body (time of onset, time of presence, amount in the blood) as the marketed macitentan tablet.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of the Pharmacokinetic Properties of Two Tablet Formulations of Macitentan in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to establish biocomparison of 2 types of tablets containing macitentan: a pediatric dispersible tablet and the adult film-coated tablet. A single oral dose of each tablet will be given to healthy subjects on 2 different periods separated by a washout phase of 10 to 14 days. Biocomparison will be based on the comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters of macitentan with the two types of tablets using specific statistical methods. The pharmacokinetic parameters will be considered equivalent if specific criteria defined in the study protocol are met.</detailed_description>
