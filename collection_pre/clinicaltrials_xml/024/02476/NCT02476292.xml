	<brief_title>Impact of Vasculitis on Employment and Income</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All individuals with vasculitis participating in the VCRC contact patient registry, living in the USA or Canada, and with a follow-up period of ≥1 year since the diagnosis of vasculitis will be invited by email to complete an online questionnaire. They will be asked several questions about their disease, their employment and work status before diagnosis and over the course of their disease, their work capacity and the financial impact on their lives. The survey data will be stored by the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network's Data Management and Coordinating Center (DMCC) at the University of South Florida. The data will be de-identified. Names or other personal health information will not be collected. If a participant is enrolled in the Vasculitis Patient-Powered Research Network (V-PPRN) University of South Florida (USF) Institutional Review Board Pro00018514, the participant can choose to provide their email address. Upon conclusion of the study period, the data will be sent to the VCRC Principal Investigator and the Protocol 5536 Co-Principal Investigators. All data collected will be sent to the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) to be stored indefinitely per the Rare Disease Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) Data Sharing Policy.</detailed_description>
