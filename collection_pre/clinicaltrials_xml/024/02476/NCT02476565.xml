	<brief_summary>The investigators plan to conduct a randomized trial comparing the efficacy of intubating the tracheal using an Aintree intubation catheter through either the LMA-S or I-gel supraglottic devices</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Endotracheal Intubation Over the Aintree Via the I-gel and Laryngeal Mask Airway Supreme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With the proposal, the investigators are comparing two different types of supraglottic devices. One is the LMA Supreme (laryngeal mask airway) and the other is the I-gel. The study is designed to use the supraglottic airway device as an adjunct to tracheal intubation, not as the definitive airway. The investigators will be utilizing the Aintree intubation catheter over the fiberoptic bronchoscope in an effort to secure the airway. This technique has been well described in the literature and has been proven effective and safe.</detailed_description>
