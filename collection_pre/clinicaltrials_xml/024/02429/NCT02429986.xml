	<brief_summary>Adaptive Servo-Ventilation (ASV) treatment is routinely prescribed in France. In order to be reimbursed according to the French Social Security rules, the patient treated with an ASV needs to be examined each year. In this observational transversal single-visit study, the investigators aim to describe the clinical characteristics of patients treated with ASV and the associated device settings.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adaptive Servo-Ventilation in "Real Life" Conditions : the OTRLASV Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate in "real life conditions" the use of Adaptative Servo-Ventilation (ASV) treatment. ASV treatment is routinely prescribed in France in patients with various sleep disorders breathing (Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) and Central Sleep Apnea Syndrome (CSAS), CHF and central and obstructive sleep apnea (COSA), Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) and complex sleep apnea syndrome (compSAS), idiopathic or drug induced periodic breathing. In order to be reimbursed according to the French Social Security rules, the patient treated with an ASV needs to be examined each year. In this observational transversal single-visit study, the aim is to describe the clinical characteristics of patients treated with ASV and the associated device settings. The aim is to evaluate the safety and efficacy issues in real life conditions of the ASV prescription.Depending of the data, data are obtained after analysis of the six latest months data of the ASV device, after questioning the patient, after analysis of the polygraphy/oximetry (if prescribed by the doctor for the renewal consultation of the ASV care and reimbursement by the French Social Security). All the data are obtained during the annual consultation required by the French Social Security.</detailed_description>
