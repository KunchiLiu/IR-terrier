	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare which strategy is superior in patients with persistent/permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing ablation, direct current cardioversion (DCC) prior to empirical pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) ; or pulmonary vein isolation (PVI)ablation in atrial fibrillation then Direct current cardioversion (DCC) if the patient remains in atrial fibrillation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Timing of Direct Current Cardioversion (DCC) in Patients Undergoing Ablation of Persistent/Permanent Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ablation of persistent/permanent Atrial Fibrillation (AF) remains a challenge. There are several strategies to improve the outcomes of persistent/permanent AF ablation. At the Cleveland Clinic one of the commonly used strategies is Direct Current Cardioversion (DCC). Depending on physician preference, patients may be ablated in atrial fibrillation then Direct current cardioverted; or Direct current cardioverted and ablated in sinus rhythm. Neither approach has been shown to be superior. As both approaches are currently being performed based on physician preference, the investigators propose to study and compare both approaches in a randomized fashion for evidence based practice. The purpose of this study is to compare which standard of care strategy is superior in patients with persistent/permanent Atrial Fibrillation undergoing ablation, direct current cardioversion prior to empirical pulmonary vein isolation; or ablation in atrial fibrillation then direct current cardioversion if the patient remains in atrial fibrillation</detailed_description>
