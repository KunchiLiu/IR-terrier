	<brief_summary>The focus of this study is on identifying how Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Adolescents (IPT-A) with depression works to change sleep and related biological markers found in saliva, namely cortisol and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the biological mechanisms of recovery from depression in order to assist in selecting and guiding personalized psychotherapeutic interventions with the highest likelihood of success for individual adolescents with depression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy of a Depression Intervention for Adolescents With Depression and Sleep Disturbances</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of this project is to examine whether adolescent depression and the associated symptoms of sleep disturbance are best treated using an empirically supported psychotherapy that is augmented with a sleep improvement module. Twenty adolescents (ages 12-17) who meet criteria for major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, depressive disorder not otherwise specified, or adjustment disorder with depressed mood and also report elevated levels of sleep disturbance will receive Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depressed Adolescents (IPT-A) with an adjunctive sleep module that is integrated throughout the treatment. Identifying the best approach to treating both the adolescent's depression and the commonly associated symptom of sleep disturbance will have significant implications for the long-term outcomes of depressed adolescents. Moreover, identifying unique symptom and biological profiles at the outset of treatment may enable doctors to predict treatment outcome.</detailed_description>
