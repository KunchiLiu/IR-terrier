	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study are to investigate the efficacy and safety of rAd-p53 gene combined with radio- and chemo-therapy vs. radio- and chemo- therapy only in treatment of unresectable, locally advanced head and neck cancer. This is a phase 2, open labeled, and active-controlled study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>P53 Gene Combined With Radio- and Chemo-therapy in Treatment of Unresectable Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate benefits of rAd-p53) gene therapy combined with radio- and chemo-therapy in treatment of unresectable, locally advanced head and neck cancer, total of 60 patients with above condition will be randomly assigned to two groups: the experiment group (EG) and the control group (CG). The EG received multi-point injections of rAd-p53 into tumor on day 1, 8 and 15 at a dose of 2 Ã— 10^12 viral particles (VP) in a 21-days cycle. Both EG and CG were given radiotherapy at a total dose of 60 Gy and chemotherapy (Cisplatin 100 mg/m2 IV on days 1 plus paclitaxel 30 mg/m2 IV on day 1, 8 and 15). The patients will be treated until disease progression, withdrawal from study, or untolerated adverse events. study endpoints are efficacy (Progression-free survival, overall survival) and safety variables.</detailed_description>
