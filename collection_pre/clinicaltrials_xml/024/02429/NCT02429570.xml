	<brief_summary>Cancer that has spread to the brain, or brain metastasis, is difficult to treat. Meclofenamate is a drug which has been shown to reduce brain metastasis growth in the laboratory. This medicine has been used in the past to treat pain. But, in this study, it will be used to prevent new brain metastasis. This is the first time that meclofenamate will be used in patients with brain metastasis. This is a pilot study which means that the purpose of this study is to determine if a larger clinical trial of meclofenamate is possible in patients with brain metastasis. This study also aims to find out what effects, good and/or bad meclofenamate has on the patient and the cancer that has spread to the brain. The investigators also want to learn more about potential effects that this drug may have in the digestive system.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age 1880 KPS ≥ 60 At least one recurrent or progressive brain metastasis (es) from any solid primary tumor that is visible on MRI as assessed by the patient's treating physician. Recurrence may occur after any treatment: recurrence after wholebrain radiation, stereotactic radiosurgery, surgical resection, systemic chemotherapy are all acceptable. There is no limit on the number of brain metastases. Surgical resection or SRS to other recurrent lesions in the same patient are acceptable, provided one recurrent lesion remains untreated. Systemic disease must be wellcontrolled or NED in the opinion of the patient's primary oncologist. Inability to get brain MRI +/ contrast Progressive systemic disease Known leptomeningeal metastases Primary Brain tumor Active Intracranial Hemorrhage Surgery less than two weeks before enrollment GI hemorrhage (active or in recent 6 months) Concurrent antiplatelet therapy Concurrent anticoagulation therapy Active bleeding diathesis Platelet count ≤ 70,000/mm3 International normalized ratio (INR) &gt; 1.6 and a Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) &gt; 40 seconds Serum Creatinine &gt;2 mg/dL OR CrCL &lt;30ml/min AST or ALT &gt; 200 U/L Hemoglobin &lt;8 g/dL Allergy to meclofenamate or other NSAID Inability to tolerate PO dosing Steroid dose increased in the most recent two weeks.
