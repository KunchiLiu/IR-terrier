	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the effects of chronic HCV infection and corresponding innate immune activation on the immune response to HBV vaccination. We will recruit chronic HCV patients and healthy control patients for HBV vaccination. We will use RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq), a relatively new technology for simultaneously measuring the expression of all genes, to determine patients' innate immune status, and learn how this innate immune signature is related to HBV vaccine response. We will then explore the mechanisms by which chronic HCV infection affects different immune cells and functions that are known to be important for an effective HBV vaccine response. These studies will enhance our understanding of the immune effects of chronic viral infection, establish factors that determine effective vaccine responses, and help guide vaccination strategies for HCV patients and other individuals with chronic inflammatory disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Persistent Innate Immune Activation on Vaccine Efficacy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vaccines have been responsible for preventing millions of deaths and extending the average human lifespan. Effective vaccines stimulate the cells of the immune system to activate genes and associated functions that bring about protective immunity. If we can better understand the factors that influence vaccine success versus failure, we may be able to improve current vaccines and/or develop new vaccines against prevalent infectious diseases. Certain groups of people do not respond well to particular vaccines. For example, vaccines can be less effective in immunocompromised patients, elderly individuals, and people with chronic inflammatory diseases. Often it is these groups of people that have the greatest need for protection against infectious disease. People chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) are at increased risk of serious liver disease. As a result, they should receive the hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine, which can protect them from infection by HBV, another virus that targets the liver. However, people chronically infected with HCV do not respond to the HBV vaccine as effectively as healthy people without HCV. Chronic HCV infection is not thought to cause general problems with the immune system, and the reasons for this poor vaccine response are poorly understood. Previous work has shown that chronic HCV infection leads to production of chemical ("innate immune") signals that can affect function of the immune system, but it is currently unknown how this might impact vaccination.</detailed_description>
