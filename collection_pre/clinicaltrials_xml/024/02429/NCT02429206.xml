	<brief_summary>In the general population, xerosis is often caused by external factors such as seasonal changes. In that case, the best way to relieve dry skin is to use a standard moisturizer. However, for those suffering of mobility problems due to age or paralysis (e.g., spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, etc), xerosis is often severe and chronic because of the multiple causes (endogenous rather than exogenous ones) underlying such mobility impairment-related skin problems. This study is a double-blind, randomized study with positive control (active comparator) to assess the safety and efficacy of SQIN with CanSATs (Co-Activation of Natural Synergistically Acting Target-receptorS) technology on dry skin in patients suffering of paralysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of SQINâ„¢ on Xerosis in Adults With Mobility Problems and Paralysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Xerosis is a medical term for dry skin. When it results in skin that is scaly and itchy, the condition is called pruritus. This occurs when natural moisture is drawn out of the skin. The skin needs moisture to protect itself. The best way to relieve dry skin normally, for those suffering of seasonal dry skin problems, is to use standard moisturizers. However, for those suffering of mobility problems due to age or paralysis (spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, amputation, cerebral palsy, or other comparable disorders), xerosis becomes severe and chronic because of the multiple causes (endogenous metabolic problems and dysfunctions rather than exogenous ones). SQIN with CanSATs technology is designed to act upon multiple mechanisms for enhanced protecting, moisturizing, and repairing effects. Based upon preliminary evidence, SQIN with CanSATs technology can thus elicit significantly superior effects compared with standard, commercially available moisturizers.</detailed_description>
