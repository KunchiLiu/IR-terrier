	<brief_summary>Tourniquets are still widely used in total knee arthroplasty, but are associated with several adverse effects. Most of previous studies did not randomize the participants so the baseline difference of the patients might have influenced the outcome. Therefore, investigators conducted a randomized controlled trial, in which all the patients received staged bilateral TKA with two different durations of tourniquet use. Investigators aimed to quantify the effect of tourniquet use on reducing blood loss and to evaluate the impact of tourniquet use on functional and clinical outcome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Tourniquet Use in Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fifty participants who underwent staged bilateral TKA were recruited in this study. On one side, the tourniquet was inflated immediately before incision and deflated after the hardening of the cement. On the other side the tourniquet was inflated immediately before cement application and deflated after its hardening. Blood loss, operating time, transfusion rate, postoperative pain, limb swelling, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) incidence and clinical outcomes were monitored for comparison.</detailed_description>
