	<criteria>Age &gt; or = 18 years Degenerative disc disease DDD with up to Grade 1 spondylolisthesis or retrolisthesis at the involved level. DDD is defined as discogenic back pain with degeneration of the disc confirmed by history and radiographic studies. ODI 40 out of 100 Back pain 4 out of 10 Mono segmental or two level lumbosacral disease Skeletally mature patients Six months failed conservative treatment. Gave written consent to take part in the study by signing the Ethics Committee's approved Patient Informed Consent Form.

Prior surgical procedure at the index level(s) using the desired operative approach. Severe degenerative lesions at more than two level of the lumbosacral spine. Morbid obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 40). Active local infection in or near the operative region. Active systemic infection and/or disease. Severe osteoporosis or insufficient bone density, which in the medical opinion of the physician precludes surgery or contraindicates instrumentation. Known or suspected sensitivity to the implant materials. Endocrine or metabolic disorders known to affect osteogenesis (e.g.Paget's disease, renal osteodystrophy, hypothyroidism) Systemic disease that requires the chronic administration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory or steroidal drugs. Significant mental disorder or condition that could compromise the patient's ability to remember and comply with preoperative and postoperative instructions (e.g. current treatment for a psychiatric/psychosocial disorder, senile dementia, Alzheimer's disease, traumatic head injury) Neuromuscular disorder that would engender unacceptable risk of instability, implant fixation failure, or complications in postoperative care. Pregnant. Unwilling to follow postoperative instructions, in particular with respect to athletic or occupational activities. Current vertebral metastatic tumors. Symptomatic cardiac disease.
