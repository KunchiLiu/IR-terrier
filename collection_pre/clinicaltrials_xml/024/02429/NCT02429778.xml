	<brief_summary>The PI developed a self-directed program to treat late-life anxiety called Breathing, Relaxation, and Education for Anxiety Treatment in the Home Environment (BREATHE). This program consists of weekly video lessons that participants watch on digital video disc (DVD) along with weekly telephone check-ins. In BREATHE participants will learn two behavioral interventions: diaphragmatic breathing and progressive muscle relaxation (PMR). The purpose of the study is to examine whether the self-directed BREATHE program is superior to a wait list control in reducing anxiety in older adults with anxiety disorders. For those assigned to wait list control, they will be offered opportunity to participate in BREATHE treatment after 8 weeks of wait list.</brief_summary>
