	<brief_summary>In the transarterial technique for axillary brachial plexus block, the axillary artery is intentionally punctured to indicate placement of the needle within the neurovascular sheath; local anesthetic is then injected deep and superficial to the axillary artery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Periarterial Injection Versus Multiple Periveural Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To lessen the risk for hematoma and intravascular injection, several modifications, such as the multi-injection perineural technique, have become popular. These techniques require a high degree of technical skill and multiple needle passes, and also carry potential for injury. In this study, the investigators will compare an ultrasound-guided equivalent of the transarterial technique (periarterial injections) to a commonly used multi-injection perineural technique.</detailed_description>
