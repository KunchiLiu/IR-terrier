	<brief_title>Working Memory Training for Children With Dyslexia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dyslexia is a specific learning difficulty which mainly affects the development of literacy and language related skills. It is characterized by difficulties with phonological processing, rapid naming, working memory, processing speed and the automatic development of skills that may not match up to an individual's other cognitive abilities. Phonological processing deficit is well established as one of the main causes of dyslexia. Working memory (WM) is today considered to be a cognitive system that strongly relates to a person's ability to think and learn. Over the last decade an increasing body of evidence indicates that WM deficits may cause particular problems for individuals with dyslexia. This is consistent with many of the every day problems reported by dyslexics and those around them. WM deficits are frequent in children with reading deficits. A major question is whether the WM impairment is secondary to phonological core deficit affecting the phonological loop only, or caused by an additional deficit involving central executive. Exploratory findings from fMRI studies indicates that impaired WM processes in dyslexia have a unique neuronal signature which may be associated with central executive processes. However there are conflicting findings and further studies are needed. The children in the study, all diagnosed with dyslexia, will be divided into two subgroups (16/16 children). They are randomly allocated to either the adaptive training group or the treatment as usual control group after the baseline assessment. Both groups will meet for baseline testing and re-testing 4 weeks after completed training. Those that serve as non-trained controls will be offered to participate in training after completion of the study. The intervention in this study aim to increase WM of children with dyslexia. We hypothesise that intensive computerized working memory training will improve reading fluency, speed and comprehension for children with dyslexia.</detailed_description>
