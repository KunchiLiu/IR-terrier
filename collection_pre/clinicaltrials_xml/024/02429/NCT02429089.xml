	<brief_title>Study of LEE011plus Cetuximab in Patients With a Cancer of the Head and Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the mammalian cell cycle, entry into S phase is achieved by cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6), which activate a family of E2F transcription factors by phosphorylating and deactivating the retinoblastoma protein (pRb). LEE011 is an orally, highly selective small molecule inhibitor of CDK4/6 that potently induces G1 arrest with sub-micromolar IC50's in a variety of pRb-positive cancer cells. A recent study showed that an inhibitor of the CDK4-CCND1 complex showed promising results in SCCHN pre-clinical models. There is a strong rationale to investigate CDK inhibitors in this disease. In phase Ib/II study as a single agent, the major toxicities observed were Grade 3 and 4 fatigue (53.8%), nausea (50.8%), neutropenia (47.7%), anemia (37.1%), leukopenia (46.2%), thrombocytopenia (34.1%), diarrhea (32.6%), vomiting (34.8%), lymphocytes count decreased (30.3%), anorexia (21.2%), hyperglycemia (21.2%), constipation (19.7%), hypoalbuminemia (18.9%), dyspnea (18.2%) and cough (16.7%).</detailed_description>

Highly effective contraception methods include: Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening).

Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill before taking study treatment. Note: Oral contraceptives are allowed but should be used in conjunction with a barrier method of contraception due to unknown effect of drugdrug interaction. Women are considered postmenopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.] 22. Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking the drug and for 30 days after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid. 23. Patient has a history of noncompliance to medical regimen or inability to grant consent.</criteria>
