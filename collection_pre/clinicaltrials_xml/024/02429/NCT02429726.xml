	<detailed_description>Objective of this study is to investigate of efficacy and safety of recombinant adenoviral human p53 Gene (rAd-p53) in treatment of malignant pleural effusion, compared to cisplatin. Study design: phase 2, double blinded, randomized, active controlled.Ninety patients with malignant pleural effusion, who meet the study inclusion criteria and none of exclusion criteria, will be randomized into 3 treatment groups: rAd-p53, cisplatin, and rAd-p53 combined with cisplatin. The study endpoints are objective response rate, Karnofsky score, effusion-free survival, and safety.</detailed_description>
