	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to demonstrate improved A1c in study subjects with type 1 and type 2 diabetes using the OneTouch Verio® Flex BGM and the OneTouch Reveal® Mobile APP system over a period of 24 weeks, compared to subjects using the OneTouch Verio® Flex BGM.</detailed_description>

Willing to send and receive SMS messages using a sponsor smartphone at 2 weekly intervals throughout the study (note: this inclusion applies to all subjects regardless of whether they are subsequently randomized to control or intervention) Is located in an area that can send and receive SMS messages and has access to a phone signal to use the 3G network as required On a stable dose of antihyperglycemic agents (AHA), including oral hypoglycemics (OAs), noninsulin injectables (e.g. GLP1) or insulin therapy ≥ 2 months prior to screening; (Note: the definition of stable includes subjects who routinely selfadjust insulin based on 'in the moment' SMBG values. Stable does not include actual diabetes therapy changes (e.g. new oral medications, initiating insulin or changing insulin regimen, insulin to carb ratio changes or basal to bolus insulin progression) Antihyperglycemic agents (AHA)(OAs or GLP1s) must be consistent with UK labeling for the subject's insulin type; Willingness to not use a CGM device during the study period; Willingness to notify the study staff if they become pregnant during the study; Willingness to practice an appropriate form of birth control during the study if of child bearing potential; Able to communicate (speak, read and write) in English, and able to understand and sign the required study documents; Have signed an informed consent (or regional equivalent) document indicating they understand the purpose and procedures of the study; Is unlikely to be compliant with the currently prescribed diabetes regimen, in the opinion of the study staff; Currently pregnant or planning pregnancy within the duration of the study or breast feeding; Has unstable (rapidly progressing) retinopathy that in the opinion of the study staff may require surgical treatment (including laser photocoagulation) during the study Is currently on or received treatment during the past 3 months with Systemic corticosteroids or antipsychotic drugs or prescription cannabinoid Is currently psychiatrically unstable in the opinion of the study staff Has known clinically significant and/or unstable medical conditions, in the opinion of the study staff, including: Cardiovascular disease, Hematological disease, Hepatic disease, Gastrointestinal disease, Endocrine/metabolic disorders and Neurologic disease Malignant neoplasm requiring treatment in the past 5 years, other than basal cell/squamous cell carcinoma of the skin History of major surgery within 6 months Has had any condition that in the opinion of the study staff that would complicate or compromise the study, or the well being of the Subject Subject is an employee of the investigator or clinical site;</criteria>
