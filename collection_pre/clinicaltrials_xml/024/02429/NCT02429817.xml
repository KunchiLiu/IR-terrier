	<brief_summary>Vibrating-mesh nebulizers ensure currently the best deposition output and are recommended in routine use in intensive care unit. However, jet nebulizers remain the most frequently used nebulizers. On a bench study, aerosol delivery through a high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) was increased using a vibrating-mesh nebulizer as compared to a jet nebulizer. Lung distribution of nebulized particles delivered through a HFNC has never been investigated in vivo. The aim of this study was to compare aerosol lung distribution with both nebulizers through a HFNC by SPECT-CT.</brief_summary>
