	<brief_summary>Anti N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis is an autoimmune encephalitis，found in recent years，producing the specific IgG antibody induced by the NMDA receptors.It is the most common curable disease among the non infectious-autoimmune encephalitis,usually has been misdiagnosed as other causes of encephalitis.Our previous study found that there are differences between the Chinese and the foreign in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis such as the sex ratio, the rate of combined tumor and clinical manifestations.As a new found disease,the incidence rate has been underestimated.Therefore,to establish the Registry Research Database for Chinese group of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is imminent.This study will combine Beijing area's hospitals and foreign experts,depending on multicenter, prospective and registry method,to understand the incidence in Beijing area,to summarize and analyze the clinical data of patients.So,there will make a solid foundation for the subsequent Beijing area detection platform and other research.</brief_summary>
