	<brief_summary>The study included 300 patients who are post-kidney transplantation (&gt; 3 months and &lt;10 years). An analysis of body composition using bioelectrical impedance, calculated BMI and serum creatinine was determined. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated using the formula CKD-EPI, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and Cockroft-Gault.</brief_summary>
