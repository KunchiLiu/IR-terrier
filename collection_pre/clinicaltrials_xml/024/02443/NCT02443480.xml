	<brief_summary>The investigators created the St. Paul's Endoscopy Comfort Score (SPECS) which includes the frequency of verbal cues, body positioning and anxiety levels with descriptions for each of the variables. Our objective is to compare the SPECS, NAPCOMs, NPAT and GS amongst different observers and to determine any correlation with patient satisfaction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development and Validation of the Saint Paul's Endoscopy Comfort Scale (SPECS) for Colonoscopy and Upper Endoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colonoscopy is used for the diagnosis and treatment of colonic lesions as well as screening and follow up of patients at risk of developing colorectal cancer. With the increasing demand for colonoscopies, the number of procedures performed in recent years has increased dramatically (Bjorkman &amp; Popp Jr., 2006). Given that performance of a high quality colonoscopy is dependent on the expertise and technical skills of the endoscopist, quantitative and reliable methods for measurement of the quality of colonoscopy are needed. Although other colonoscopy quality indicators, such as adenoma detection rate, have been studied comprehensively (Rex, et al., 2006), patient comfort as a measure of endoscopic quality performance has not been thoroughly assessed.</detailed_description>
