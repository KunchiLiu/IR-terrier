	<brief_summary>It was found that people who have an excessive growth in one or more parts of their body and normal growth in other parts, may have a change in genes responsible for controlling cell growth. This genetic discovery identified a possible treatment for this overgrowth, called Sirolimus. This is a pilot study, which help the investigators prepare a larger international study, which will aim to determine whether a treatment based Sirolimus is able to stop the excessive growth of one or more parties of their body in people who carry a genetic change in the PIK3CA gene (phosphatidylinosilol-3-kinase encoded by the gene PIK3CA).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The duration of participation is 15 months: - Visit screening: blood test, pre-clinical evaluation, urine collection and chest X-ray. - First 6 months: participants will have their overgrowth monitored. This step includes 2 visits taking place at the University Hospital of Dijon: complete clinical evaluation, MRI of the body part by the overgrowth and Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). - Next 6 months: participants will take Sirolimus. This step includes 2 visits (4 and 13 weeks after the start of treatment at local hospital): blood test, urine collection and clinical evaluation. and 1 end of study visit after 6 months of treatment taking place at the University Hospital of Dijon: blood test, complete clinical evaluation, urine collection, MRI and DXA. Participants will have several blood and urine tests between visits (1 and 2 weeks after the start of treatment at a local laboratory).</detailed_description>
