	<brief_summary>Up to 90% of the radiotherapy patients will develop a certain degree of skin reaction at the treated area, also known as radiodermatitis (RD). Currently, there is a wide variety of strategies to manage RD, including creams, gels, ointments, wound dressings. However, up to now, there is still no comprehensive, evidence-based consensus for the treatment of RD. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a promising, non-invasive technique for treating RD. In a recent pilot study conducted in our research group, LLLT prevented the aggravation of RD and provided symptomatic relief in patients undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer after breast-sparing surgery. This pilot study was the first prospective study investigating the potential of LLLT for RD. In the current study, we want to investigate the efficacy of LLLT as a tool for the prevention of radiodermatitis in breast cancer patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of noninvasive (stage 0) or invasive (stage 1, 2 and 3A) breast adenocarcinoma Treatment with primary breastsparing surgery (lumpectomy) and/or neoadjuvant (preoperative) or adjuvant (postoperative) chemotherapy or hormonal therapy Scheduled for postoperative radiotherapy with standard technique (isocentric) and fractionation regime (i.e. 25 daily fractions of 2 Gray to the whole breast followed by a boost of 8 fractions of 2 Gray to the tumor bed, 5/week) Signed informed consent Previous irradiation to the same breast Metastatic disease Concurrent chemotherapy Required use of bolus material to deliver radiotherapy (i.e. material placed on the to beirradiated zone to modulate the delivered dose in order the ensure an optimal distribution of the radiation dose; mostly used for treatment of superficial tumors)</criteria>
