	<brief_summary>The objectives of this trial are primarily to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BI 655066/ABBV-066 (risankizumab) as compared to placebo over a 24-week treatment period in severe asthma patients. The primary endpoint is time to first asthma worsening during the planned 24 week treatment period for active vs. placebo treated patients on top of standard of care therapy. Upon demonstration of a meaningful clinical response, another important objective is the identification of biomarkers that can be used to target patients who will likely respond to treatment with BI 655066/ABBV-066 (risankizumab).</brief_summary>
