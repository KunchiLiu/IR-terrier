	<brief_title>CARPALL: Immunotherapy With CD19 CAR T-cells for CD19+ Haematological Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-centre, non-randomised, open label Phase I clinical trial of an Advanced Therapy Investigational Medicinal Product named CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells (CD19 CAR T-cells) in children and young adults (age &lt;24 years) with high risk, relapsed CD19+ haematological malignancies (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and Burkitt's lymphoma). Following informed consent and registration to the trial, patients will undergo an unstimulated leukapheresis for the generation of the CD19 CAR T-cells. Patients will receive the CD19CAR T-cells following lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The study will evaluate the safety, efficacy and duration of response of the CD19 CAR T-cells in children with high risk relapsed CD19+ malignancies.</detailed_description>
