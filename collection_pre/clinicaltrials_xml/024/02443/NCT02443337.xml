Able to swallow the study drugs whole. Adequate organ function. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test performed ≤ 7 days prior to start of treatment. Women of childbearing potential or men with partners of childbearing potential must use effective birth control measures during treatment and during the 3 months following completion of study treatment. Participants who have received &gt; 1 prior line of chemotherapy in the advanced or metastatic setting. (Immunotherapy will not be considered a line of chemotherapy.)

History of brain metastases unless irradiated ≥ 2 weeks prior to first study treatment and stable without requirement of corticosteroids. Have serious preexisting medical conditions. Have insulindependent diabetes mellitus. Participants with a type 2 diabetes mellitus are eligible if adequate control of blood glucose level is obtained by oral antidiabetics. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Clinically significant electrolyte imbalance ≥ Grade 2. Currently receiving treatment with therapeutic doses of warfarin sodium. Low molecular weight heparin and oral Xa inhibitors are allowed. Have initiated treatment with bisphosphonates or approved receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand (RANKL) targeted agents (e.g. denosumab) ≤ 28 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1. Concurrent serious infection requiring parenteral antibiotic therapy. Have a second primary malignancy that in the judgment of the investigator and Medical Monitor may affect the interpretation of results. Have an active, known fungal, bacterial, and/or known viral infection. History of arterial or venous embolism within 3 months prior to study enrollment.
