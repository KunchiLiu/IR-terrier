	<brief_title>Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Brain Morphology and Cognition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a common and serious medical problem. Most cases occur when patients forget or stop insulin injections. Some patients require frequent admissions to the hospital with DKA after stopping insulin. Many patients do not know why they stop insulin therapy. The investigators will test if patients with one or more episodes of DKA have poor memory and brain changes that may lead to poor management. In this study, the investigators will perform memory testing and brain images in subjects with initial DKA episode and subjects with more than 3 episodes of DKA. The results will be compared to subjects with diabetes and no history of DKA and healthy (non-diabetic) subjects. Each subject with DKA will have an MRI and cognitive testing done shortly after hospital discharge, 1 month, and 3 months after hospital discharge. Diabetic subjects without DKA and healthy controls will only come in for a single baseline visit and have a MRI and cognitive testing done.</detailed_description>
