	<brief_summary>This is a long-term follow-up to an earlier study, LA38-0411. Its purpose is to gather more information about the safety and efficacy of deferiprone in patients with sickle cell disease or other anemias who suffer from iron overload caused by regular blood transfusions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-term Safety and Efficacy of Ferriprox® in Iron Overloaded Patients With Sickle Cell Disease or Other Anemias</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Deferiprone (brand name Ferriprox®) is an iron chelator that is approved in the United States and over 60 other countries for the treatment of iron overload in patients with thalassemia, when other treatments are inadequate. This study has been designed to evaluate the long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of deferiprone to treat iron overload in patients who have sickle cell disease or other anemias. Only patients who have completed an earlier study, LA38-0411, are eligible to enroll in this one.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Completed study LA380411 2. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test result at Visit 1. In addition, if applicable, they must: Use an effective method of contraception according to local requirements, during the study and within 30 days following their last dose of study medication, OR Have had a tubal ligation (supporting evidence required), OR Have had a hysterectomy (supporting evidence required), OR Participate in a nonheterosexual lifestyle, OR Have a male sexual partner who has been sterilized (supporting evidence required) 3. Fertile heterosexual males and/or their partners must agree to use an effective method of contraception during the study and for 30 days following the last dose of study medication 4. All patients and/or their authorized legal representatives must provide signed and dated written informed consent prior to the first study intervention, and assent will be obtained from patients who are considered to be minors. Patients must be able to adhere to study restrictions, appointments, and evaluation schedules. 1. Plan to participate in another clinical trial at any time from the day of enrollment until 30 days posttreatment in the current study 2. For only those patients who were treated with deferoxamine in study LA380411 (Group 2): Presence of any medical condition (including clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, such as ALT ≥ 5 x ULN or creatinine ≥ 2 x ULN), psychological condition, or psychiatric condition which in the opinion of the investigator would cause participation in the study to be unwise. 3. Pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant during the study period. 4. Treatment failure after 1 year on deferiprone which in the investigator's judgment indicates the need for the patient to be started on a different iron chelator</criteria>
