	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of the combination of the study drug known as ramucirumab plus pembrolizumab in participants with locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium, or biliary tract cancer (BTC).</brief_summary>

Has received ≥3 lines of prior systemic therapy for gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma and BTC or ≥4 lines for NSCLC or urothelial cancer. Has active autoimmune disease. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Known active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection. Has received any previous systemic therapy targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or VEGF receptor, or programmed death (PD) 1 or PDligand 1/2 signaling pathways. Have received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to enrollment. Seasonal flu vaccines that do not contain live virus are permitted. Have had a serious or nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture within 28 days prior to enrollment. Have an elective or a planned major surgery during the course of the trial or has undergone major surgery within 28 days prior to enrollment.</criteria>
