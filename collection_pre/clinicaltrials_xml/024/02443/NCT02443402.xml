	<brief_title>Sitagliptin in Non-Diabetic Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 80% of patients develop high glucose after cardiac surgery. High glucose is linked to an increased risk of hospital complications. High glucose increases the risk of wound infection, kidney failure and death. Patients with high glucose are treated with insulin given through an arm vein or by frequent insulin injections under the skin. This study will determine if sitagliptin can prevent the development of high glucose after heart surgery. Sitagliptin is a diabetes pill approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat patients with diabetes.</detailed_description>
