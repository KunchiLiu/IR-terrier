	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Profile of Insulin Lispro Using Needle-Free Jet Injection Technology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, crossover study. Eighteen healthy volunteers will be recruited. Lispro (0.2 units/kg) will be administered by jet injector or by conventional pen and a seven-hour euglycemic clamp test will be performed. PK-PD profiles of lispro will be calculated.</detailed_description>
