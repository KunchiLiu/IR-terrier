	<brief_summary>Background: Propofol effects dose-dependent myocardial depression, but there is little clinical data available regarding the direct impact of propofol induction on myocardial function. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of propofol-based anesthesia induction on cardiac function in low-risk patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Propofol Induction's Effect on Cardiac Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study population After approval by the institutional ethics committee and written informed consent, we prospectively enrolled adult patients who were scheduled for elective non-cardiac surgery. During the preoperative anesthesia visit, we selected patients with low-risk as indicated by the revised cardiac risk index of 0 and normal LV function (ejection fraction ≥ 60% and septal e' ≥ 8 cm/s). We excluded patients with an arrhythmia, poor lateral axis in supine position, regional wall motion abnormality, or other structural heart diseases. Patients with any of the following conditions were also excluded: unfavorable airway or facemask fit, intractable coughing, hiccups, or hypotension (mean BP &lt; 60 mmHg) requiring IV positive inotropes or vasoconstrictors during the study period. Anesthesia induction Upon each patient's arrival at the holding area, we placed an 18-gauge IV line in the right forearm vein and administered 10 mL/kg/hour of lactated Ringer's solution, 0.2 mg of glycopyrrolate, and 0.03 mg/kg of midazolam, as a premedication. Once in the operation room, we started to monitor electrocardiography, non-invasive BP, HR, pulse oximeter oxygen saturation, and the bispectral index (BIS). Anaesthesia induction was started in the following manner. Patients took a spontaneous respiration with inspired oxygen (8 L/min) through a transparent facemask and a circulation system with a reservoir bag. Bolus propofol (2.0 mg/kg) was administered intravenously for 10 seconds, after which assisted ventilation followed. After 5 minutes, complete induction was confirmed via a lack of train-of-four response and followed by tracheal intubation for maintenance anesthesia. Intraoperative transthoracic echocardiography: Imaging After positioning the patient supine on the operation table, serial transthoracic echocardiography was performed with a portable GE Vivid Q platform (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI), before (T0) and 1, 3, and 5 minutes after the propofol bolus injection (T1, T2 and T3, respectively) along with hemodynamic recordings at the same time (BP, HR, and BIS). Two-dimensional imaging of parasternal and apical views and pulsed wave (PW) Doppler imaging of mitral inflow &amp; LV outflow were performed. DTI was recorded at both septal and lateral mitral annulus from the apical 4-chamber view to determine longitudinal endocardial velocities with a sweep of 66.7 mm/s. Each set of images required less than 30 seconds.</detailed_description>
