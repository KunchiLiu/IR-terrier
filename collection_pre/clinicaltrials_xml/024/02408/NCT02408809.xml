	<brief_summary>The investigators of this study aim to evaluate the impact of a new orthopaedic related smoking cessation discussion on smoking behavior. Considering the high prevalence of patients who smoke and receive orthopaedic management, we are interested in determining whether an orthopaedic smoking cessation discussion impacts smoking abstinence self-efficacy over time compared to a general smoking cessation discussion.</brief_summary>
