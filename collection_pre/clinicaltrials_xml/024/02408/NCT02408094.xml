	<brief_title>Screening Protein Markers in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis and Hot-dampness and Blood Stasis Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RA is one of the main disabling diseases in nowadays, which is an autoimmune disease with complex networks mechanism involving multiple signaling pathways and existing cross path. The investigators consider that the "heat-dampness and blood stasis" syndrome is the main syndrome and major pathogenesis for active RA, which on the base of the theory of traditional Chinese medicine and a large quantity of clinical practice, and also examined by mechanism experiments. But the material basis of this syndrome is remained unclear, lack of high specific objective basis to ensure the syndrome differentiation consistency accurately in clinical practice. Proteomic techniques study cells or the body by all the protein expression and function, thus has the potential efficient for decoding syndrome biological basis. Proteomic techniques are the most effective way to reveal the essence of TCM syndrome. The investigators will use proteomic technology to explore the protein markers and to applicate those protein markers in syndrome diagnosis of hot-dampness and blood stasis syndrome in patients with RA. With strong clinical applicability, this will reveal the scientific connotation of this syndrome, preliminarily guide the syndrome differentiation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects are made or confirmed diagnosis according to the American College of Rheumatology criterion and "heatdampness and blood stasis" syndrome according to Traditional Chinese Medicine. 1. Subjects have other serious diseases, such as liver and kidney disease, cerebralcardio vascular diseases. 2. Subjects, who belong to "nonheatdampness and blood stasis" syndrome, have double syndrome of heat or dampness.</criteria>
