	<brief_summary>Practice guidelines recommend early physical therapy in intensive care unit. Feasibility, safety and efficacy are confirmed by growing evidence based data. However, the scientific literature emphasizes the heterogeneity of targeted populations, lack of precisions concerning eligibility criteria, program modalities, timing initiation, progressions and stopping criteria. However, all these results remain to be precised and confirmed. So, the investigators hypothesize that an early exercise program in intensive care unit formalized from a decisional algorithm is well tolerated in clinical practice.</brief_summary>
