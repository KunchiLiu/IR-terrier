	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine how body weight changes the drug level of an emergency contraceptive pill containing a hormone called levonorgestrel (LNG). This emergency contraceptive is available to women without a prescription, but has recently been found to not work as well to prevent pregnancies in women of higher body weight. The overall goal of this research is to improve the effectiveness of contraception for women, no matter their weight.</brief_summary>
