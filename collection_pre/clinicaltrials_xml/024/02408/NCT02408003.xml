	<brief_summary>The investigators want to compare the effects of two drugs, levosimendan and milrinone, on cardiac muscle, both in terms of contractility and relaxation. Half of the participants will be randomized to each drug.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing the Effects on Cardiac Function of Levosimendan Versus Milrinone.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aortic stenosis is associated with myocardial hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. In patients undergoing open aortic valve replacement surgery due to stenosis, the investigators want to compare the effect on myocardial relaxation between two commonly used drugs, levosimendan and milrinone, using catheter-based measurements in combination with echocardiographic evaluation. Standard anaesthesia and surgical care for these patients is performed. After surgery is completed and the participant is transferred to the intensive care unit, the studies are performed during general anaesthesia and the participants still connected to a respirator with controlled ventilation. Echocardiographic data will be collected simultaneously with hemodynamic parameters - first at two control measurements, then after each of two different doses of the drug. Preload, afterload and heart rate will be kept stable during the experiment. The echocardiographic data is later analyzed offline for strain and strain rate.</detailed_description>
