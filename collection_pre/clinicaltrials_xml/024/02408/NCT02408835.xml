	<brief_summary>This study investigates the use of a negative pressure wound therapy device (PICO™, Smith &amp; Nephew Healthcare, UK) on clean, closed surgical wounds, in patients who are undergoing inguinal lymphadenectomy for metastatic carcinoma of cutaneous origin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Negative Pressure Wound Therapy in Groin Dissection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients may develop inguinal lymph node metastases from a variety of cutaneous neoplasms. A number of factors conspire to cause a high rate of wound breakdown and other complications in this patient group. Reported rates of wound healing complications vary in the literature, but tend to affect &gt; 40% of patients. A new negative pressure wound therapy device is recommended for use in clean, closed surgical wounds (PICO™ system, Smith &amp; Nephew Healthcare, UK). Patients will be randomised to receive either PICO™ system for up to seven days, or conventional dressings, and then assessed for wound healing and other outcome measures.</detailed_description>
