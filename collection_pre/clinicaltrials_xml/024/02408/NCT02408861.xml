	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of nivolumab when given with ipilimumab in treating patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated solid tumors have spread to other places in the body or cannot be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Ipilimumab is an antibody that acts against a molecule called cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4). CTLA-4 controls a part of your immune system by shutting it down. Nivolumab is a type of antibody that is specific for human programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), a protein that is responsible for destruction of immune cells. Giving ipilimumab with nivolumab may work better in treating patients with HIV associated solid tumors.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To demonstrate safety and feasibility of ipilimumab and nivolumab at the standard doses of drug in solid tumor participants with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection given the possibility of increased toxicity based on immune activation, co-morbidity, or interference with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) therapy. (Dose De-escalation and Dose Expansion Cohorts) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab, on immune function (HIV viral load in plasma using conventional assay, CD4+ and CD8+ cells). (Dose De-escalation Cohort) II. To preliminarily assess objective response rates associated with treatment for commonly represented tumors (Kaposi sarcoma, anal cancer, and lung cancer). (Dose Expansion Cohort) III. To evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab, on immune function (HIV viral load in plasma using conventional HIV assay, CD4+, and CS8+ cells). (Dose Expansion Cohort) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Understand the immune response to agent in the context of antiretroviral therapy (ART), of altered immune function, and repertoire due to prior HIV infection. II. To evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab, on intratumor immune cells by immunohistochemistry (IHC) such as PD1, programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PDL-1), and others. III. To evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab on circulating cytokine markers by multiplex assay, such as: interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-8, interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP10), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 13 (CXCL13), interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL2R)-alpha, sCD27, soluble TNF receptor (sTNFR)1, and sTNFR2. IV. To understand the response of human tumor viruses (human papillomavirus [HPV], Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus [KSHV]) to agent. V. To evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab on herpesvirus loads (Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus [KSHV], cytomegalovirus [CMV]) in plasma. VI. To evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab on latent herpesvirus (EBV, KSHV, CMV) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). VII. To evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab on herpesvirus specific CD8 and CD4 T cells in PBMC. VIII. In cases of Kaposi sarcoma, to evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab on viral transcription in tumor biopsies. IX. In cases of anal cancer, to evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab on HPV types in anal swabs, when feasible. X. Understand the response of HIV to agent. XI. To evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab on latent HIV loads in PBMC using outgrowth assay. XII. To evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab on HIV reactive T cells. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of nivolumab. Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Patients in dose level 2 also receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1 of every third course of nivolumab, and patients in dose level -2 also receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1 of every sixth course of nivolumab. Courses repeat every 14 days for up to 46 courses of nivolumab (with ipilimumab if receiving dose level 2 or -2) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 16 weeks or 112 days (based on 5 half lives).</detailed_description>

participants are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger (precipitating event) Participants who have had evidence of Clostridium (C.) difficile infection, active or acute diverticulitis, intraabdominal abscess, intraabdominal abscess, gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction and abdominal carcinomatosis, which are known risk factors for bowel perforation, should be evaluated for the potential need for additional treatment before coming on study</criteria>
