	<brief_title>MIRs03: Paravertebral Block With Ropivacaine Before Breast Cancer Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Before anesthesia, the second or third intercostal space is located. After an aspiration, 0.35 mL/kg of solution (ropivacaine 7.5 mg/mL or saline, maximum 30 mL) are injected into the paravertebral space. After 30 minutes, spread of PVB is evaluated by cold test on skin. Then, general anesthesia is induced. Evaluation of the frequency of chronic pain at 3, 6 and 12 months by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaire and Neuropathic Pain Diagnostic (DN4) and Anxiety and depression evaluation by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression questionnaire (HAD) will be done.</detailed_description>
