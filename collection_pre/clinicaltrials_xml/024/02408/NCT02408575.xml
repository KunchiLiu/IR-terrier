	<brief_summary>Pilot study on safety, tolerability and clinical performance/randomized double-blind active-controlled pilot-study. Patients are being recruited from patients of the Tinnitus Center of Regensburg and groupwise randomized. Control groups are being treated with hearing aids without notch-filter. Patients and raters are blinded, only the coworker, who is programming the hearing aids, is informed about the group assigned. A Hearing aid with notched amplification filters frequencies in a specific manner, depending on the individual tinnitus frequency. Through this special filtering the neuronal functional changes of the auditory cortex are supposed to be affected therapeutically.</brief_summary>
