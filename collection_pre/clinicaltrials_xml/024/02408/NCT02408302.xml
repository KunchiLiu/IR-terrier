	<brief_summary>Currently Midazolam sedation is the standard of care for minor invasive procedures in pediatric patients; its use is restricted to two routes of administration for this purpose oral and intranasal. A third route of administration (buccal) is tested and approved for seizure management. In the investigators' study the researchers investigate the buccal route of administration versus oral or intranasal administration for sedation. The investigators' hypothesis is that buccal route of administration is more convenient than intranasal and better absorbed than oral.</brief_summary>
