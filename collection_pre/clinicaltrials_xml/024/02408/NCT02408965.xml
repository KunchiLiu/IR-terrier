	<brief_summary>Excessive bleeding after dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E) requiring interventions is common, occurring in approximately 30% of cases at one large abortion-providing clinic. Uterotonic prophylaxis at the time of D&amp;E, particularly with methylergonovine maleate (MM), is a common practice among D&amp;E providers despite nearly no evidence for its efficacy. Finding ways to decrease excessive bleeding after D&amp;E has the potential both to improve patient safety and to reduce costs of provider-initiated interventions. The investigators propose a randomized, controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of MM prophylaxis versus placebo in decreasing excessive bleeding measured by a composite outcome among women undergoing D&amp;E at 20 to 24 weeks.</brief_summary>
