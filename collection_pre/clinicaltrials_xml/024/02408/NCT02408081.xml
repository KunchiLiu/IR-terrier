	<brief_title>Family Focused Nursing for Elderly Medical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psychosocial issues such as lack of social support and symptoms of depression, are risk factors associated to readmission for elderly medical patients. Families with elderly members in general want to be involved in the caring and want to maintain a close relation to their elderly family member. However, disease in a single family can have a negative effect on all members and may result in dysfunction of the family. International guidelines recommend that the patient's relatives are involved in patient education as well as the treatment. Family interventions might contribute to decline depression and readmissions, besides enhanced quality of life and family function among elderly medical patients and their next of kin.</detailed_description>
