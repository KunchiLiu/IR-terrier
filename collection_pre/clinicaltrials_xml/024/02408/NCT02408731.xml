	<brief_summary>Shock is a condition of reduced tissue perfusion, resulting in the inadequate delivery of oxygen and nutrients that are necessary for cellular function. The current resuscitative agents can extend patient's life to a limited extent. Centhaquin (PMZ-2010) in very low doses reduced blood lactate levels, improved blood pressure, cardiac output, survival and proved to be a highly effective resuscitative agent. The investigators are conducting a phase I clinical study in humans to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of centhaquin citrate in normal healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Determine the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of PMZ-2010 (Centhaquin) in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Shock is a condition of reduced tissue perfusion, resulting in the inadequate delivery of oxygen and nutrients that are necessary for cellular function. Common causes of shock are hypovolemia (excessive blood or fluid loss), sepsis, cardiac failure, dengue and neuroendocrine dysfunction. The current resuscitative measures include administration of crystalloid solutions (e.g., 0.9% saline, Ringer's lactate, or hypertonic saline) or colloid solutions (e.g., hydroxyethyl starch, albumin, or dextrans). These agents can extend patient's life to a limited extent. Centhaquin (PMZ-2010) in very low doses reduced blood lactate levels, improved blood pressure, cardiac output, survival and proved to be a highly effective resuscitative agent. The investigators are conducting a phase I clinical study in humans to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of centhaquin citrate in normal healthy volunteers. Successful completion of phase I studies will lead to efficacy studies in patients with hypovolemic shock.</detailed_description>
