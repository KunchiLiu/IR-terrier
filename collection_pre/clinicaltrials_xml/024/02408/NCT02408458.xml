	<brief_title>Miromatrix Biological Mesh for Ventral Hernia Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Miromatrix Medical Inc. has developed a new biologic mesh, called MIROMESH®. MIROMESH received FDA 510(k) clearance with an indication for reinforcement of soft tissue on March 31, 2014 under K134033. Miromatrix Biologic Mesh is a non cross-linked, acellular surgical mesh that is derived from the highly vascularized porcine liver. This study will serve to provide clinicians with high-quality clinical data in order to provide them with a higher degree of confidence when selecting MIROMESH for ventral hernia repair.</detailed_description>
