	<brief_summary>Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is an immune-mediated disorder of peripheral nerves. Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) are a first line therapy for CIDP. The investigators used a transcriptomic approach to compare the gene expression profiles in the peripheral blood of patients having a CIDP or autoimmune diseases, before and after IVIg treatment, in order to identify their mechanism of action in this condition, to lead to a better understanding of CIDP pathophysiology, and potentially determine factors associated with the response to the treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transcriptome Analysis of the Peripheral Blood in CIDP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We study the change of the: - gene profile on transcriptome analysis of peripheral blood - T cell repertory - igG dosage - immunological profile Before IVIG (T1 time) and and 3 weeks after IVIg treatment (T2 time). On a population of patients having: CIDP, autoimmune muscular disease, Clarkson syndrome, or autoimmune diseases. We also search for polymorphism of FCgammareceptor, TKPC et CASP3 genes in CIDP patients</detailed_description>
