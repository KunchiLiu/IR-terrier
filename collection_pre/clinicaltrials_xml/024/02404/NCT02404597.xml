	<brief_title>Cardiac Output Monitoring in Burn Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Appropriate fluid resuscitation in the first 24 hours after a burn injury directly influences patient outcome and morbidity. Currently, there is some controversy surrounding the over and under-resuscitation and endpoints of resuscitation using older fluid resuscitation formulas in patients with burn injury. The NICOM has been used in the resuscitation of patients with sepsis. The NICOM will be used in patients with burn injury to determine the patient's fluid responsiveness and the need for additional fluid boluses versus medications to increase the patient's blood pressure.</detailed_description>
