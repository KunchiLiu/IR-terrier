	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic distal D2 gastrectomy (LDG) compared with open surgery (ODG) for resectable gastric cancer, to determine whether LDG can be a test arm for a future Phase III trial to evaluate the non-inferiority of overall survival compared with ODG in patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison of Laparoscopic With Open Distal Gastrectomy in Advanced Gastric Cancer After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is an open-label, controlled, randomized Phase II clinical trial. The protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Cancer Hospital. The primary endpoint is the 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate. The secondary endpoints are the overall survival, surgical morbidity and mortality.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the stomach. Clinical cT2N+M0,or cT34a/N+M0 disease, confirmed by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and abdominal computed tomography (CT) and laparoscopy. The T and N stages are determined by the method of Habermann et al. The gastric tumors are located in the middle to lower third of the stomach, are macroscopically resectable by distal gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection, and R0 or R1 resection can be achieved. No bulky lymph node metastasis is detected by abdominal CT. No pleural effusion, no ascites exceeding the pelvis and no metastasis to the peritoneum, liver or other distant organs are confirmed by abdominal pelvic CT. No clinically apparent distant metastasis. Karnofsky performance status ≥70%. Sufficient oral intake. No previous treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy for any tumors. No previous surgery for the present disease. Sufficient organ function, as evaluated by laboratory tests 7 days or more after the date when the anticancer drugs were given. When patients are recovering from myelosuppression,the revised criteria are shown in parentheses. White blood cell count≥3000/mm3 (2000/mm3) Platelet count≥10.0*104/mm3 (5.0*104/mm3) Aspartate aminotransferase≤100 IU/l Alanine aminotransferase≤100 IU/l Total bilirubin≤2.0 mg/dl Serum creatinine≤1.5 mg/dl No need for emergency surgery due to bleeding or perforation of the primary tumor. No mechanical obstruction. Written informed consent. Past history of upper abdominal surgery. Past history of surgery for the gastrointestinal tract. Body mass index exceeding 30 kg/m2.</criteria>
