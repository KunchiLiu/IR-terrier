	<brief_title>Curarisation and Intubation Conditions During Videolaryngoscopy With Glidescope Titanium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this prospective, randomized study, the investigators assess the intubation conditions during videolaryngoscopy with Glidescope Titanium whether patients receive (curare (Atracurium)group) or no (control group) within elective surgery patients with no difficult intubation prediction. The IDS score assessed by an anesthesiologist from the video-recording is the primary outcome. All general anesthesias are standardized using Target Control Infusion of propofol and sufentanil. The investigators also compare IDS scores as assessed by intubators, time for tracheal intubation, and laryngeal morbidity in both groups.</detailed_description>
