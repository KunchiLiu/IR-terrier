	<brief_summary>Using a pulse oximeter, we have developed an algorithm that estimates intracranial pressure (ICP) based on patients who have had traumatic brain injuries. Patients with hydrocephalus are typically treated with a shunt in order to reduce ICP. At times the shunt can malfunction. We believe that our algorithm will help identify when a hydrocephalus patient's shunt has malfunctioned.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A malfunctioning ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt will typically cause a rise in intracranial pressure, which can be difficult to identify without costly imaging. Novel, state-of-the art machine learning techniques can be leveraged to develop an algorithm that noninvasively estimates intracranial pressure. The resulting algorithm will accurately determine the presence or absence of ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction in patients with hydrocephalus.</detailed_description>
