	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To describe the safety and tolerability, including laboratory abnormalities following a single dose of sarilumab or tocilizumab administered subcutaneously (SC) as monotherapy in Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Secondary Objectives: To describe the laboratory abnormalities (absolute neutrophil count [ANC], platelet counts, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, and liver function tests [LFTs]) following a single dose of sarilumab or tocilizumab administered SC as monotherapy in Japanese patients with RA. To describe the pharmacokinetics (PK) of sarilumab and tocilizumab.</brief_summary>
