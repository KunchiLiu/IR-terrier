	<brief_summary>Total cystectomy (surgical removal of the bladder) is performed in a number of settings, including invasive bladder cancer and radiation cystitis. This requires a urinary diversion to be performed. The most common type of urinary diversion in this setting is an ileal conduit, where a section of small intestine is fashioned into a conduit that drains urine through a stoma into a pouch appliance, which is adhered at the level of the abdominal wall skin. There are multiple risk factors associated with the development of parastomal hernia after ileal conduit formation, including obesity, stoma site and size of the abdominal wall stoma opening. Up to 30% of patients with parastomal hernia will undergo surgical correction, mainly due to discomfort, urine leakage, skin excoriation, difficulty in maintaining a watertight ostomy appliance, increased frequency of ostomy pouch changes, or rarely due to bowel strangulation. Parastomal hernia repair is a challenging procedure which is not without significant risks. Furthermore, the outcomes of parastomal hernia repair surgery are highly variable. Prevention of parastomal hernia resulting from ileal conduit formation will help to decrease the incidence of hernia related complications, including pain, bowel complications, and urinary leakage due to poor stoma appliance. It will also decrease the significant cost associated with frequent stoma pouch changes. Prevention of parastomal hernia is expected to improve the quality of life of patients undergoing ileal conduit, and will reduce the need for secondary operations.</brief_summary>
