	<brief_title>Flunisolide HFA in Children With Small Airway Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized, parallel, open label study. The primary aim is to compare the average change in spirometric values (Forced expiratory volume 1 (FEV1) and Forced Expiratory Flow 25-75% (FEF 25-75%) and Impulse Oscillometry System (IOS) values (Resistance at 5 Hz (R5), Resistance at 20 Hz (R20), Area of reactance (AX), Resonant frequency (Fres)) from baseline to week 6 from participants randomized flunisolide hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) 1 inhalation BID and to flunisolide HFA 2 inhalations BID. The change in scores from baseline to six week follow up will initially be compared using paired t-tests and Chi-squared tests for trend. Repeated measurements will be analyzed using generalized linear mixed-effects regression modeling (GLMM) techniques. For continuous outcomes (e.g. FEV1, FEF 25-75%, Fres, reactance at 5 Hz (X5), AX, R5-R20). The identity link function and normal distribution will be used. For count data (e.g., use of Beta-agonists, episodes of coughing, episodes of wheezing, etc.) the log link function and the Poisson distribution will be used. If we dichotomize outcomes (e.g., a Beta-agonist was used, coughing occurred, etc.) the logit link function and Bernoulli distribution will be used.</detailed_description>
