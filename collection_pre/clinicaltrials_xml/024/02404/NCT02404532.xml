	<brief_title>Substudy 'B' of the Accuracy of Ingestible Event Marker (IEM) Detection by the Medical Information Device #1 (MIND1)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The OSMITTER study protocol is designed as a master protocol governing multiple substudies for the rapid assessment of candidate subcomponents for the MIND1 System. This substudy is being conducted to determine the accuracy of IEM detection by the MIND1 System by completing a series of Patch applications and IEM ingestions in the clinic. Following placement of the Patch by clinic staff, subjects will ingest one placebo-embedded IEM tablet approximately every other hour, for a total of 4 ingestions. Placebo-embedded IEM tablets are being tested to measure the accuracy of IEM detection by the MIND1 system. Approximately 30 healthy volunteer subjects will be enrolled in the substudy. The duration of this substudy from Visit 1 (Day 1) to safety follow-up will be approximately 1 week, of which approximately 1 day will be allotted for active subject participation, plus a 1-week safety follow-up period.</detailed_description>
