	<brief_title>A Safety and Immune Response Study of 2 Experimental HIV Vaccines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) is doing a study to test a new HIV vaccine combination. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. The investigators are doing this study to answer several questions: - Are the study vaccines safe to give to people? - Are people able to take the study vaccines without becoming too uncomfortable? - How do people's immune systems respond to the study vaccines? (Your immune system protects you from disease.) The study uses 2 different vaccines: ALVAC-HIV (vCP2438) and bivalent gp120/MF59. These are experimental HIV vaccines -- the investigators do not know whether the vaccines will be safe to use in people, or whether they will work to prevent HIV infection. These vaccines are used only in research studies. The ALVAC vaccine is made out of canarypox virus, which infects birds but cannot grow in human cells. This virus has small bits of man-made DNA inserted into it. DNA is a natural substance found in all living things, including people and some viruses. The canarypox virus helps get the DNA into the body's cells. The DNA then tells those cells to make small amounts of proteins that look like some of the ones found in HIV. A study in South Africa, HVTN 097, is giving a similar ALVAC vaccine to about 80 participants. So far, no one has had serious health problems. The Protein vaccine has man-made pieces of a protein found on the outside of HIV. These protein pieces are mixed with an adjuvant called MF59. An adjuvant is something added to the vaccine to help the immune system respond better. MF59 has been included with other vaccines that have been given to over 50,000 people in clinical trials without causing any serious health problems. This combination of study vaccines has not been given to people before. However, similar ALVAC and protein vaccines have been given to more than 10,000 people in clinical trials without causing any serious health problems. Also, over 300 people have received a similar combination of ALVAC and protein vaccines with the MF59 adjuvant in clinical trials without having any serious health problems. About 252 people will take part in this study at multiple sites. The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) is paying for the study. The study requires about 14 clinic visits in 18 months.</detailed_description>

Volunteers who were born female: negative serum or urine beta human chorionic gonadotropin (βHCG) pregnancy test performed prior to vaccination on the day of initial vaccination. Persons who are NOT of reproductive potential due to having undergone total hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy (verified by medical records), are not required to undergo pregnancy testing. Reproductive status: A volunteer who was born female must: Agree to consistently use effective contraception for sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy from at least 21 days prior to enrollment through the last required protocol clinic visit. Effective contraception for participants in South Africa is defined as using 2 methods, including the following: Condoms (male or female), or Diaphragm or cervical cap, PLUS 1 of the following methods: Intrauterine device (IUD), Hormonal contraception (in accordance with Republic of South Africa: National Contraception Clinical Guidelines), Successful vasectomy in the male partner (considered successful if a volunteer reports that a male partner has [1] documentation of azoospermia by microscopy, or [2] a vasectomy more than 2 years ago with no resultant pregnancy despite sexual activity postvasectomy); or Any other contraceptive method approved by the HVTN 100 PSRT Or not be of reproductive potential, such as having reached menopause (no menses for 1 year) or having undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation; Or be sexually abstinent.

For volunteers who have received control/placebo in an HIV vaccine trial, the HVTN 100 PSRT will determine eligibility on a casebycase basis. NonHIV experimental vaccine(s) received within the last 5 years in a prior vaccine trial. Exceptions may be made for vaccines that have subsequently undergone licensure by the South Africa Medicines Control Council (MCC). For volunteers who have received control/placebo in an experimental vaccine trial, the HVTN 100 PSRT will determine eligibility on a casebycase basis. For volunteers who have received an experimental vaccine(s) greater than 5 years ago, eligibility for enrollment will be determined by the HVTN 100 PSRT on a casebycase basis. Live attenuated vaccines other than influenza vaccine received within 30 days before first vaccination or scheduled within 14 days after injection (eg, measles, mumps, and rubella [MMR]; oral polio vaccine [OPV]; varicella; yellow fever) Influenza vaccine or any vaccines that are not live attenuated vaccines and were received within 14 days prior to first vaccination (eg, tetanus, pneumococcal, Hepatitis A or B) Allergy treatment with antigen injections within 30 days before first vaccination or that are scheduled within 14 days after first vaccination Immunosuppressive medications received within 168 days before first vaccination.

Any medical, psychiatric, occupational, or other condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, would interfere with, or serve as a contraindication to, protocol adherence, assessment of safety or reactogenicity, or a volunteer's ability to give informed consent Psychiatric condition that precludes compliance with the protocol.
