	<brief_title>Conservative Treatment of Esotropia in Children up to 3 Years Old</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This investigation includes children with esotropia associated with hyperopia, hypermetropic astigmatism, myopia, myopic astigmatism and minor ametropias. All children are prescribed full optical correction of refractive errors with special attention to astigmatism up to 0.5 Dpt to achieve maximal clear image on the retina of both eyes.If necessary, direct occlusion or penalization were administered to the children. The investigators suggest that this approach will give good results in the treatment of esotropia.</detailed_description>
