	<brief_summary>The Vanderbilt Atrial Fibrillation Ablation registry (VAFAR) is a prospective clinical and genetic biorepository that systematically enrolls patients undergoing atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. The registry was started in 2011 and has greater than 1000 AF ablation records with stored blood and DNA samples. The goals of VAFAR are to: 1) identify clinical, genetic, and serological predictors of response to AF ablation in order to improve patient selection, and 2) to provide a resource for translational research investigating the electrophysiologic mechanisms of AF pathogenesis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study population consists of patients at least 18 years of age who are scheduled for AF ablation at Vanderbilt University. Data recorded at enrollment includes a detailed past medical history and measurements from pre-ablation imaging (cardiac MRI or CT). At the time of ablation, a blood sample is collected for storage of plasma/serum and extraction of DNA, and details of the ablation procedure are recorded. Post-ablation monitoring for arrhythmia recurrence is performed according to a standard clinical follow-up schedule at 3, 6, and 12-months. ECG's are performed at each follow-up visit along with placement of an ambulatory ECG-monitor. At 6-months post-ablation, cardiac imaging with a repeat cardiac MRI or CT is performed.</detailed_description>
