	<brief_summary>C1-C2 is the most mobile segment of the spine and its dysfunction is frequently associated to cervical pain and headache. However, serious neurovascular adverse effects have been documented through direct treatment of C1-C2 segment. Although indirect treatment via adjacent segments and avoidance of end range of rotation and extension have been recommended for a safer and effective cervical treatment, there is no scientific evidence of the effectiveness of the indirect treatment approach in the cervical neutral position for C1-C2 hypomobility. Due to that, the investigators designed a randomized controlled trial to compare the short-term effects in the Flexion Rotation Test (FRT) of a translatoric mobilization of C0-C1, a translatoric mobilization of C7-T1 and a control group in subjects with C1-C2 hypomobility.The primary hypothesis is that C0-C1 dorsal glide mobilization applied in the neutral cervical position can recover the C1-C2 rotational range of movement in subjects with upper cervical hypomobility.</brief_summary>
