	<brief_summary>Poor oral motor development in preterm neonates is common. Feeding problems lead to longer hospital stay and higher hospital cost. Different interventions have shown their efficacy to accelerate transition and move faster to full oral feeding autonomy. Our study aimed to evaluate the impact of a 2-year education nurse program on feeding pattern and hospital stay of preterm neonates. This is an interrupted time series study placed in Intensive Care and Neonatal unit of an university hospital located in Lyon, France. All preterm neonates are included in the study, from April 2013 to January 2016.</brief_summary>
