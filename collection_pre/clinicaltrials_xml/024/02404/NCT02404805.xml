Additionally, the investigator believes simeprevir and dolutegravir are safe when administered alone and in combination.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Drug Interaction Potential Between Dolutegravir and Simeprevir in HIV/HCV Seronegative Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To investigate the potential for drug interactions between simeprevir and dolutegravir, participants will receive each drug alone and the drugs in combination for 7 days. The pharmacokinetics of simeprevir and dolutegravir when given in combination vs. alone will be compared.</detailed_description>
