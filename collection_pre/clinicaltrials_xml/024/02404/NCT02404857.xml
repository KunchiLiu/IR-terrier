	<brief_title>BCI Post-stroke Neurorehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Brain computer interfaces (BCI) encompasses the usage of the brain signals to compensate for lost physical function. The current protocol evaluates the therapeutic potential of a EEG based driven BCI that is connected to a non-invasive pneumatic glove for rehabilitation of hand flexion/extension post-stroke. The system non-invasive, portable and low-cost. The utility and usability of the system will be investigated at two levels. First by means of questionnaires for patients and therapist and second by means of in depth analysis of the EEG signals during intended, imagined and passive driven hand movements in relation to no movement at all and the capacity of the BCI to distinguish between these conditions.</detailed_description>
