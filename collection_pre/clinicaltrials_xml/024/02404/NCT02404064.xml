	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Appendectomy for Uncomplicated Appendicitis: Does Antimicrobial Prophylaxis Really Matter?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic appendectomies are performed by one of the 6 institutional attending surgeons. US and/or abdominal CT scans are obtained as clinically necessary to make the diagnosis of appendicitis. All of the appendectomies are initiated laparoscopically. Postoperative orders are controlled via a standard electronic order set for all operations. Patients found to have acute uncomplicated appendicitis at appendectomy will be randomized to either single dose of perioperative antibiotics /On the second post-operative day the patient who has no fever and tolerating a regular diet, will be discharged home without oral antibiotics. On the post-operative, day seven after surgery all patients will be examined in the outpatient clinic on the presence of surgical site infection. then will be followed for a 30 days after surgery .</detailed_description>
