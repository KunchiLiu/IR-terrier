	<brief_title>PRV-based Detection of CAD in Comparison to Standard Methods</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will validate a pulse wave based algorithm for the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) with parameters from standard methods. Subjects will be patients admitted to coronary angiography due to suspected CAD. Pulse wave signals will be analyzed according to novelly established algorithm regarding the presence of CAD and/or myocardial ischemia. These results be compared to the diagnoses made by coronary angiography (primary endpoint): presence of minimum one coronary artery stenose &gt;=50%. For secondary analyses, results will be compared to parameters form echocardiography and cardiogoniometry.</detailed_description>
