	<brief_summary>This trial objective is to assess whether doubling the daily intake of vitamin D improves serum vitamin D levels and serves as primary prevention of respiratory infections and asthma in premature infants. This is a prospective randomized (1:1) double-blinded trial. The study population will be randomized into two groups (1:1): - Intervention Group - 800 IU of Vitamin D once daily - Control Group - 400 IU of Vitamin D once daily Patients will be followed up for one year after randomization for serum Vitamin D levels and respiratory morbidity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Vitamin D Administration to Premature Infants on Vitamin D Status and Respiratory Morbidity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rational of this trial is that a daily supplementation of a double dose of Vitamin D (800 IU instead of 400 IU) to late premature infants during the first year of life will result in elevated Vitamin D serum levels and in an improvement in respiratory morbidity. This randomized trial of vitamin D supplementation is planned to determine the optimal dose of daily vitamin D supplementation required to achieve sufficient vitamin D levels in preterm infants and to assess whether doubling the daily intake of vitamin D may serve as primary prevention of respiratory infections and asthma in premature infants.</detailed_description>
