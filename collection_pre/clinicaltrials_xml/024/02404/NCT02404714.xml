	<brief_summary>This is an observational comparative study to compare the standard-of-care methods for sweat testing used to support diagnosing cystic fibrosis (CF) against a new method of sweat testing called the CF Quantum Sweat Test System. The results of the new device in this study are for comparison ONLY and will NOT be used to diagnose, treat or mitigate the subject's condition.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multi-Center Study of the CF QuantumÂ® Sweat Test System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a new sweat test method in both normal individuals and individuals with CF or cystic fibrosis related metabolic syndrome (CRMS). Subject participation is for one day and duration of study for each subject is one day. No follow-up will be required. Number of subjects; 300 split evenly between subjects with previously diagnosed CF or CRMS (cystic fibrosis related metabolic syndrome) and subjects referred to the sweat test lab for clinical reasons. Number of sites = 6, U of WI-Madison, U of WI-Milwaukee, U of MI-Ann Arbor, Dayton Children's Hospital (OH), U of MN, and Children's of Alabama. Primary endpoints: - Clinical and analytical sensitivity of the new test method - Clinical and analytical sensitivity of the standard-of-care methods Statistics Sensitivity and specificity will be calculated and reported along with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Bias assessment will be conducted according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for method comparison and bias estimation. Pearson's correlation analysis will be conducted to test for adequate range of the replicate values for the new test method.</detailed_description>

Patient is receiving oxygen by open delivery. 2. Infants less than 48 hours of age. 3. Diffuse inflammation or rash on the collection site. 4. Patients who have had a reaction to a prior iontophoretic sweat test procedure. 5. Arm is too small for both the new and conventional sweat test.</criteria>
