	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to determine the percentage of patients with a plasma concentration of sunitinib remaining at equilibrium ([Suni]REq) greater than 100 ng / ml (effective concentration according to the current literature).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Pharmacokinetic Variability of Sunitinib in Patients With Metastatic Renal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of this study are: - To describe the distribution of constitutional genetic determinants related to sunitinib pharmacokinetics, and to study their correlation with - the [Suni]REq, - the advent of toxicity, - the tumor response. - To describe the variation in the [Suni]REq and the plasma concentration of the active entity remaining at equilibrium ([ActEnt]REq) at: - the interindividual level, - overtime, between chemotherapy cycles. - To describe the variation in the ratio of the plasma concentration of the metabolite remaining at equilibrium ([Metab]REq) to the [Suni]REq at: - the interindividual level, - overtime, between chemotherapy cycles. - To explore potential correlations between the [Suni]REq and - toxicity, - tumor response. - To explore potential correlations between the [ActEnt]REq and - toxicity, - tumor response. - To explore potential correlations between the ratio [Metab]REq / [Suni]REq and - toxicity, - tumor response.</detailed_description>
