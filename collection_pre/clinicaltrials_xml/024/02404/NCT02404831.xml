	<detailed_description>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a term used to describe a number of lung conditions characterised by irreversible damage to the airways causing airflow obstruction. Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) is a broad programme that helps improve the health and well-being of people with breathing difficulties, most commonly COPD. Participation in PR leads to improvements in exercise tolerance and functional ability, as well as a reducing breathlessness in everyday activities. It is traditionally an outpatient programme based in a hospital or community setting run by a multidisciplinary team, and usually lead by physiotherapy and nursing staff. Typically it includes a physical exercise programme, and advice and education on managing a chronic lung condition. The purpose of this pilot study is to compare a six week web-based pulmonary rehabilitation programme with traditional hospital-based pulmonary rehabilitation classes for people affected by COPD.</detailed_description>
