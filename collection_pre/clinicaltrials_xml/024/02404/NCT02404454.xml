	<brief_summary>The septate uterus is the most common structural uterine anomaly. It results from failure of the partition between the two fused Müllerian ducts to resorb;it is associated with the highest incidence of reproductive failure and with first- and second-trimester pregnancy loss and infertility. Hysteroscopic division of the uterine septum is performed using microscissors, electrosurgery, or laser. Several studies shown significant improvement in pregnancy outcome after hysteroscopic metroplasty. Purpose of this study is to verify the effectiveness of 5 ml, instead of 10 ml, of autocross-linked hyaluronic acid gel in the prevention of the formation of intrauterine adhesions, through second look office hysteroscopy after three months.</brief_summary>
