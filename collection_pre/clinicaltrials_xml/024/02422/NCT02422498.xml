	<criteria>Histologicallyconfirmed invasive triple negative breast cancer (ER &lt;1%, PR &lt;1%, her2neu 01+ by IHC or FISHnegative) or as determined by MD discretion Radiation to the recurrent or metastatic site is clinically indicated and would be considered standard care for palliation or for locoregional control Age ≥18 years Tumor to be irradiated is measurable by RECIST 1.1 or PRC Willingness to undergo tumor biopsy prior to initiation of treatment Life expectancy greater than 6 months ECOG performance status 02 Any prior chemotherapy is allowed including prior treatment with platinumcontaining chemotherapy Prior treatment with FDAapproved or investigational biologics or novel molecularly target therapies, including oral or IV formulations, are permitted. Patients must be off prior targeted therapy for at least 14 days prior to study biopsy. Use of an effective means of contraception in women of childbearing potential Ability to comprehend and sign informed consent Adequate organ and marrow function within 14 days prior to study entry, defined as: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC)&gt;1000/mm3 Hemoglobin &gt;9 gm/dl Platelets &gt;100,000/mm3 Serum creatinine &lt;1.5 mg/dl OR creatinine clearance of ≥ 50 cc/min SGOT/SGPT&lt;2.5X institutional ULN (&lt;5X ULN if known liver metastases) Unmeasurable target tumor site by RECIST 1.1 or PRC (ex: lesions &lt;2 cm on CT or MR scan, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, lymphangitis, nonFDGavid skin lesions) Brain metastases requiring focal or whole brain radiation will be excluded, as these lesions cannot be biopsied and can have life expectancies &lt;6 months. Inability to obtain a biopsy of the tumor as deemed by the study Interventional Radiologist Prior chemotherapy completed &lt;7 days prior to planned study entry Prior RT is allowed and must have been completed more than 7 days before planned study entry. Note: For reirradiation cases, standard departmental guidelines should be followed so as to not exceed normal tissue Life expectancy less than 6 months Intercurrent illness or other major medical condition or comorbid condition that might affect study participation (uncontrolled renal, pulmonary or hepatic dysfunction or infection) Renal dysfunction for which cisplatin dose would be considered unsafe. Women on study must be neither pregnant nor nursing nor expected to become pregnant during therapy. For premenopausal women, negative pregnancy test within 14 days of RT is required. Concurrent active malignancy other than nonmelanomatous skin cancer or carcinoma insitu of the cervix, unless treatment for the previous cancer was completed &gt;2 years prior to study entry and patient has remained diseasefree.</criteria>
