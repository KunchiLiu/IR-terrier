	<brief_summary>Management of leptomeningeal disease (LMD) in patients with metastatic breast cancer is an area of unmet clinical need. High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is known to have activity against breast cancer and in contrast to other systemic chemotherapeutics, it penetrates the blood brain barrier, targets areas of poor cerebrospinal fluid flow, may penetrate bulky leptomeningeal disease, and provide treatment to systemic disease burden. While two retrospective studies have suggested activity of HD-MTX in LMD in patients with breast cancer, no prospective data are available to inform its inclusion in treatment regimens. Thus, while HD-MTX is included in the NCCN Guidelines for LMD and while it is used to varying degrees in cancer centers across the nation, this is more representative of the lack of available therapies for LMD as opposed to strong evidence-based data. This phase II, prospective study will evaluate systemic, intravenous HD-MTX in breast cancer patients with leptomeningeal metastasis with or without brain parenchymal metastasis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation Of High-Dose Systemic Methotrexate In Patients With Breast Cancer And Leptomeningeal Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: Management of LMD in patients with metastatic breast cancer is an area of unmet clinical need. Increased survival in the era of hormonal and HER2 directed therapies has further heightened the need for more effective therapies against the late complications of metastatic disease. Prognosis is dismal with median survivals ranging from 6-8 weeks in untreated patients and with little improvement having been demonstrated over the past 20 years. Recently, there has been renewed interest in systemic chemotherapeutic options in these patients. Incorporation of systemic therapies into standard treatment algorithms has been limited as many agents have not been shown to adequately penetrate the blood brain barrier. High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX), however, is unique in that it does penetrate the blood brain barrier. In fact, evidence suggests that it may target areas of poor cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow, penetrate bulk disease, and provide treatment to systemic disease burden. Methotrexate is a drug known to have activity against breast cancer and has been used in combination with cyclophosphamide and 5-fluorouracil as part of a standard adjuvant treatment regimen. Currently, HD-MTX is included in the NCCN Guidelines for LMD and is used intermittently at Johns Hopkins and cancer centers across the nation for LMD in breast cancer. These recommendations, however, are more representative of the lack of available therapies for LMD as opposed to strong evidence-based data. Only two retrospective studies have suggested that HD-MTX may be an effective option for treating central nervous system (CNS) metastasis, both with substantial methodological limitations. STUDY OBJECTIVE This phase II, prospective study will evaluate systemic, intravenous high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) in breast cancer patients with leptomeningeal metastasis (LMD). The primary objective is to determine if treatment with systemic intravenous HD-MTX will result in an overall survival (OS) exceeding 12 weeks among patients with triple negative, HER2-positive, and hormone refractory metastatic breast cancer patients with LMD with and without parenchymal brain involvement.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults (male and female) age &gt;18 Eastern Cooperative Group (ECOG) Performance Scale 01 (see Appendix I) Histologically or cytologically confirmed invasive breast cancer of the following subtype: TRIPLE NEGATIVE (ERnegative, PRnegative, and HER2negative disease). Triplenegative patients will be defined per ASCOCAP Guidelines (American Society of Clinical OncologyCollege of American Pathologists). HER2POSITIVE: HER2positive patients will be defined per ASCOCAP Guidelines. HORMONE REFRACTORY: Patients with ER/PRpositive disease according to ASCOCAP guidelines above may be considered if they have disease progression after two lines of hormonal therapy (administered in the adjuvant or metastatic setting), or are deemed clinically hormoneresistant taking into consideration the rate of progression of disease or a short interval of time on first line hormonal therapy before progression. Clinically hormoneresistant patients MUST also be discussed with the Study Chair, Study coChair or designee in advance for approval. NOTE: ASCOCAP guidelines state that ER and PR assays be considered positive if there are at least 1% positive tumor nuclei in the sample on testing in the presence of expected reactivity of internal (normal epithelial elements) and external controls. HER2positive is defined as HER2 IHC 3+, ISH ≥ 2.0, or average HER2 copy number ≥ 6.0 signals. NOTE: A patient who has a change in receptor status (e.g. PR negative to positive) may be stratified as triple negative or hormone positive, contrary to the most recent receptor testing, for the purposes of the study, based upon the clinical course at the discretion of the Study Chair, Study coChair, or designee in advance for approval. Cytologic or unequivocal radiographic confirmation of leptomeningeal metastasis by dural puncture and/or neuroimaging with or without known brain metastasis Adequate organ function as follows: Estimated creatinine clearance &gt;70 cc/min (calculated by CockcroftGault formula) White blood cell counts &gt;3000 cells/mcL Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1500 cells/mcL Platelet count &gt;100,000 cells/mcL Hematocrit &gt;30% Serum bilirubin &lt;1.5 x the ULN Alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase &lt;2.5x the ULN Alkaline phosphatase &lt;2.5x the ULN or &lt;5x the ULN if secondary to liver metastasis Able to provide confirmed consent Prior allergy or adverse reaction to methotrexate New York Heart Association Heart Failure Class &gt;3 (see Appendix II) Active diabetes insipidus Active mucositis Chemotherapy or stereotactic radiotherapy within the last 2 weeks Whole brain radiotherapy within the last 6 months Prior treatment with any methotrexate containing systemic regimen within 1 year (excluding intrathecal methotrexate) Concurrent or planned systemic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, new hormonal or antiHER2 directed therapy directed at management of breast cancer (existing antiHER2 therapy can be continued as recently recommended in the National Consensus Guidelines Uncontrolled or progressive systemic disease or other concurrent condition which in the Investigator's opinion makes HDMTX an undesirable treatment option for the patient or would jeopardize compliance Contraindication to MRI Use of salicylates, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or sulfonamide medications within one week of start of methotrexate Pregnant women or women who are breastfeeding. Patients with significant visceral fluid collections including ascites, pericardial effusions, pleural effusions or others may experience delayed clearance of methotrexate because of third space accumulation which could result in methotrexate toxicity and inability tolerate the proposed study treatment. While these are not absolute exclusions the Study Chair or coChairs should be contacted to discuss possible enrollment. Patients with significant ascites defined as European Association for the Study of the Liver &gt; grade 2, or with asymptomatic pleural effusions with an estimated size &gt;200 mL, or with symptomatic pleural effusion of any size will be excluded.</criteria>
