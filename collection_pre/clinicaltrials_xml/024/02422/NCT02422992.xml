	<brief_summary>This is a case/control epidemiology study to identify what are the iron-metabolism abnormalities in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, and risk factors relevant to PD predisposition.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Haptoglobin and Iron in Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 342 participants, 100 PD patients and 242 age- and gender matched controls, were included in the study. All study participants were seen for one study visit in the morning at one of two Bastyr University Clinics in the Seattle area. Study participants were fasting at the time of the visit. During the study visit, participants donated a blood sample for the blood tests and complete an epidemiology questionnaire. A subset of 51 of the study participant who were seen for the visit at Bastyr University, underwent brain scan and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), at the University of Washington Department of Radiology. The MRI part of the study aims at estimating brain iron levels.</detailed_description>
