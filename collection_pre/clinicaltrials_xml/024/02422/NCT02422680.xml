	<brief_summary>The study aim to capture key quality indicators and patient satisfaction for at least 500 patients referred for a colonoscopy at Aalborg University Hospital. The patient population is mix of screening and non-screening colonoscopies seen at our out-patient clinic. Each Colonoscopy is registered using a specially designed registration form and a more detailed form relating to the colonoscopy itself. The data collected includes: Endoscopy experience and education, Medicine use, Colonoscopy duration, Caecum Intubations rate and documentation, Polyp detection rate, Polyps removed, Cancer detection rate and Nurse assisted Gloucester Comfort score. Each patient were given a questionaire with 6 questions answering satisfaction, pain, discomfort etc on a 10 cm analog scale.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Colonoscopy Quality Assurance With Focus on Key Quality Indicators and Patient Satisfaction at Aalborg University Hospital</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The above study is a part of the complete Colonoscopy program which has begun April 2015. The full program are as follows: Colonoscopy in North Jutland Surgical Departments A quality assurance research project with focus on key quality indicators, patient satisfaction and colonoscopy training. Introduction Population screening for colorectal cancer was introduced in Denmark in 2014 leading to a substantially increased demand on the endoscopy units, which are typically based in the surgical departments. Colonoscopy can be effective in detecting cancers at an early stage or even preventing cancer by removal of premalignant polyps. A prerequisite for this effect is a high quality endoscopy service with a very low incidence of complications and missed cancers. Another important aspect is compliance within the target population. This is also largely dependent on the quality of colonoscopy including minimal discomfort and the perception of endoscopy staff as competent, knowledgeable, friendly and courteous. In reality little is known about the quality of colonoscopy in Denmark or in our region of North Jutland. There is no systematic collection of quality data on the national or regional level, endoscopy unit level or individual surgeon level. Data from the population screening programme will cover a few of the potential points, but a much more detailed data acquisition is necessary in order to ascertain if our service is up to international standards. This is not only of theoretical interest, as the endoscopy service quality or lack thereof will determine if the screening programme is effective or whether it is actually detrimental to the population. Prior to the implementation of population screening in the United Kingdom a colonoscopy quality survey was carried out. The results were appalling, with low completion rates and too many complications, and this led to a nationwide quality improvement programme, which includes systematic data monitoring and a very comprehensive training effort. All NHS endoscopy providers are invited to participate and there is regular feedback on quality data both at the endoscopy service level and at the individual colonoscopist's level. This has led to a marked improvement in the overall quality. In our region the investigators have an intuitive belief that our general endoscopy quality is good, although some endoscopists would be preferable to others in case any of us where referred for a colonoscopy. The investigators also perceive some endoscopists as better teachers than others, but in reality there are no evidence for any of these assumptions. Traditionally little attention has been paid to colonoscopy training in our country as opposed to teach-ing other types of surgical skills. Colonoscopy is a potentially unpleasant procedure usually carried out under minimal sedation, and it carries the risk of rare but serious complications and even death. There is ample evidence that part of the learning curve can be moved away from the patient by training on virtual reality simulators, but this is not mandatory in surgical education in Denmark. In this region there are two endoscopy simulators and courses are provided free of charge. Some of the training, how-ever, must necessarily be undertaken in the clinical setting. The literature suggests that competency is not achieved until the trainee has performed more than 200 procedures. In the Danish surgical curriculum, there is no demand for a specified number of procedures with or without supervision, but the colonoscopy competency must be vouched for by the supervisor or programme director at the end of specialty training. Teaching colonoscopy is difficult and time consuming. Most experienced colonoscopists are unable to give detailed guidance without actually taking over the procedure from the trainee as their perform-ance of colonoscopy has become largely "automated" or "unconsciously competent" over the years. It follows that a necessary foundation for effective and high quality training is a faculty of trainers (experienced colonoscopists) who have themselves received training as trainers, are aware of the quality of their own performance, and agree on the criteria for a high quality colonoscopy. In this educational and quality assurance research project the investigators wish to focus on quality data and quality training and wherever possible take the patients' perspective into account by inquiry into patient satisfaction aspects. Method 1. Quality of colonoscopy Quality data acquisition - The investigators wish to implement a nurse assessed patient comfort score - The investigators wish to explore patient satisfaction with the colonoscopy service through questionnaires and if possible link the results to other quality parameters - The investigators wish to gather retrospective epidemiological data regarding missed cancers and serious complications as a basis for future comparison. This will be a cooperation with the clinical epidemiology service - The investigators wish to implement an IT system that enables automated capture of selected quality parameters directly from the colonoscopy notes. This will facilitate regular feedback on unit and individual level if this should be decided on at a later date. It will also provide a reliable basis for research Quality parameters for colonoscopy that can be registered on site include completeness (percentage of examinations where the coecum is reached), adenoma detection rate, use of sedatives and analgesics, time per colonoscopy and a patient comfort score. In a previous but not yet published study, one of the investigators have validated a patient questionnaire with more detailed information about the colonoscopy experience, which may also be used. Serious complications such as bleeding and perforation must also be noted, but are fortunately very rare. Ultimately a close to zero rate of missed cancers (cancers that occur from 6 to 36 months after colonoscopy) is an important quality indicator, but this information can only be obtained by searching national register data. 2. Quality of teaching and learning • Determining base line technical quality of colonoscopy. In order to establish a baseline to inform further educational activities the investigators wish to assess all surgeons and nurse colonoscopists on their technical performance (Miller's level 3 and 4 - shows how and does) and basic knowledge (Miller's level 1). The technical performance will be assessed in two ways. One, by performing 3 cases on the endoscopy simulator utilizing both the inbuilt feedback data and direct observation (with the aid of the DOPS assessment tool developed by The Joint Advisory Group of GI Endoscopy, Royal College of Physicians of Great Britain). Two, by performing two live colonoscopies being assessed by two faculty using the DOPS assessment tool. The basic knowledge will be tested by a MCQ originally developed for nurse colonoscopists. On the basis of these assessments benchmarks for novice, intermediate, proficient and expert will be decided. If possible the investigators also wish to use a novel assessment tool based on an automatic registration of time and movements on the scope-guide system and compare this with the DOPS and simulator data. It may also be possible to correlate the technical data with the patients' feedback. • Train the trainers As described in the introduction a local faculty of colonoscopy educators who have themselves received training as trainers, are aware of the quality of their own performance, and agree on the criteria for a high quality colonoscopy is a prerequisite for a successful training programme. Some of the trainers who have been key movers behind the highly successful British quality improvement process have agreed to teach our faculty. They already have some knowledge of colonoscopy training (or lack of same) in the Scandinavian countries through teaching courses in Oslo and in the Mid Jutland Region of Denmark. The course will consist of three separate days each preceded by an evening theoretical session. Day one will deal with basic technical aspects of colonoscopy. Day two will deal with polypectomy and day three with teaching aspects i.e. how to teach trainees and peers. There will be three teachers on each day for 6 participants, who will be experienced colonoscopists from the three surgical departments in our region. The course will consist mainly on hands on teaching and training, but there will also be a video-linked teaching session led by one of the teachers. The participants will be asked to register their own quality data before and after the course. The participants will function as colonoscopy supervisors for the intervention training programme • Training programme Other studies have demonstrated a marked improvement in the acquisition of surgical skills by a module based programme, where theoretical aspects and simulated skills training is delivered shortly prior to an intensive training period over for example 6 to 8 weeks where the trainees is scheduled to perform a high number of supervised similar procedures i.e. herniotomies or laparoscopic cholecystectomies. (CG Carlsen, PhD dissertation: Fast-track training improves surgical skills compared to traditional training, 2013). Intuitively this will also be effective in colonoscopy training. The investigators wish to deliver a module based colonoscopy training programme to surgical trainees (PGY1, 2 and 3 - Danish equivalents: introduktionsstilling, hoveduddannelse 1, 2). The programme will consist of a theoretical session, a two day simulator course aimed at basic scope handling and a number of days' clinical training. 3 days' supervised training (supervisor present in the colonoscopy room) - approximately twenty colonoscopies. And 6 days' with the possibility of supervision at short notice - approximately 50 colonoscopies. The supervisors have participated in the train the trainers programme. All trainees will give information about prior experience with colonoscopy. The investigators will determine learning curves by DOPS assessment after 20 and 50 colonoscopies and ranking in the previously agreed benchmarking framework. The investigators will be interested in noting if learning curves differ according to the trainees starting point. I.e. if a high initial score will indicate that the training programme is unnecessary. 3. The patients' perspective The investigators wish to explore the patients' perception of colonoscopy further through the nurse assessed comfort score and by questionnaires dealing with aspects of communication, safety, comfort, and ultimately the patients' willingness to return for a repeat colonoscopy if this were deemed necessary. The investigators would like to see if some of these parameters correlate to the observed technical quality. 4. Epidemiological data The investigators wish to collaborate with the clinical epidemiology service in providing retrospective data about missed cancers (colorectal cancers diagnosed from 6 to 36 months after colonoscopy) and serious adverse events, readmissions and death.</detailed_description>
