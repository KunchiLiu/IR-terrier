	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential inhibitory effects of ceritinib on the CYP3A4- and CYP2C9-mediated metabolism of the probe drugs midazolam and warfarin, respectively, when administered simultaneously as a cocktail. The results obtained from this drug interaction study will provide guidance that will enable an update to the ceritinib labeling and will help guide recommendations for administration of co-medications in future clinical trials.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of stage IIIB (and is not a candidate for definitive multimodality therapy) or stage IV NSCLC demonstrated ALKpositive or an advanced tumor, other than NSCLC, that carries an ALK genetic alteration (mutation, translocation or amplification) and/or ALK overexpression that has progressed despite standard therapy, or for which no effective standard therapy exists. The test to confirm ALKpositivity may be performed in archival tumor (obtained at or since the time of diagnosis), or in a newly obtained tumor sample taken prior to the first day of study drug. Results confirming ALKpositive status must be available before initiating treatment with ceritinib. Patients who have received prior chemotherapy, other ALK inhibitors, biologic therapy, or other investigational agents, must have recovered from all toxicities related to prior anticancer therapies to grade ≤ 1 (CTCAE v 4.03) prior to starting study drug. Patients with grade ≤ 2 peripheral neuropathy or any grade of alopecia, nail changes or skin changes are allowed to enter the study. Patients who have been treated with chemotherapy, with biological therapy or other investigational agent must have discontinued the treatment at least 2 weeks (14 days) prior to starting the study drug on Study Day Patient has the ability to understand and provide signed informed consent. Patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the excipients of ceritinib (microcrystalline cellulose, mannitol, crospovidone, colloidal silicon dioxide and magnesium stearate), midazolam and warfarin as described in the local product information. History of carcinomatous meningitis. Presence or history of a malignant disease other than an ALKpositive advanced tumor that has been diagnosed and/or required therapy within the past 3 years. Exceptions to this exclusion include the following: completely resected basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers, and completely resected carcinoma in situ of any type. Clinically significant, uncontrolled heart disease and/or recent cardiac event (within 6 months Uncontrolled hypertension defined by a Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) ≥ 160 mmHg and/or Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) ≥ 100 mmHg, with or without antihypertensive medication. Patient has history of interstitial lung disease or interstitial pneumonitis, including clinically significant radiation pneumonitis (i.e., affecting activities of daily living or requiring therapeutic intervention). Other Protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion may apply.</criteria>
