	<brief_summary>Current Helicobacter Pylori infection preferred treatment involves; proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-based triple or qudrable regimens. Omeprazole, Amoxicillin, and Clarithromycin is one of a global standard care for confirmed H.pylori infection . Metronidazole (MTZ) is used instead of Amoxicillin or Clarithromycin in cases of allergy or resistance . However, a recent study based on the Maastricht III guidelines, indicated that treatment with a PPI-based triple regimen as first-line therapy will fail in ~30% of patients on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis, and will fail in ~ 50 % of patients who treated with PPI-based triple regimen with Metronidazole. This treatment resistance is also an issue warranting the investigation of other agents. Helicobacter pylori infection has become increasingly resistant to traditional first-line treatment regimens because of emerging antibiotic resistance coupled with poor patient compliance with completing the treatment course that decrease H. pylori eradication rates. So there is a considerable interest in evaluating new antibiotic combinations and regimens .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Nitazoxanide (NTZ) Based New Therapeutic Regimens for Helicobacter Pylori</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) is a small, Gram-negative spirochete inhabiting the mucous layer overlying the gastric epithelial cells in humans. It is the most common prevalent chronic human bacterial infection and the most common cause of gastritis worldwide;. Furthermore, according to the World Health Organization, HP is classified as a type 1 carcinogen and is the primary cause of peptic ulcer disease, gastric carcinoma, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas . Current Helicobacter Pylori infection preferred treatment involves; proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-based triple or qudrable regimens.Omeprazole,Amoxicillin &amp;Clarithromycin is one of a global standard care for confirmed H.pylori infection .Metronidazole (MTZ) is used instead of Amoxicillin or Clarithromycin in cases of allergy or resistance . However, a study by Rokkas , et al., 2008 based on the Maastricht III guidelines, indicated that treatment with a PPI-based triple regimen as first-line therapy will fail in ~30% of patients on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis,and will fail in ~ 50 % of patients who treated with PPI-based triple regimen with Metronidazole.This treatment resistance is also an issue warranting the investigation of other agents . Helicobacter pylori infection has become increasingly resistant to traditional first-line treatment regimens because of emerging antibiotic resistance coupled with poor patient compliance with completing the treatment course that decrease H. pylori eradication rates .So there is a considerable interest in evaluating new antibiotic combinations and regimens. Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is an antibiotic with microbiological characteristics similar to those of Metronidazole which was sittled as a therapy for intestinal protozoa and helminthic infection,and was studied as an additional therapy with Peg Interferon and Ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) . In the last few years Nitazoxanide was evaluated as a single agent therapy for H. Pylori infection showing controversed results.. However (NTZ) based regimens were recently studied showing interesting results without the apparent problem of resistance as Metronidazole with nearby cost.Moreover ;Levofloxacin,PPI,NTZ&amp;Doxycycline (LOAD) regimen with very good results in H.pylori infection ~90% cure rate..But uptil now there are no actual similar reported trials in Egypt.</detailed_description>
