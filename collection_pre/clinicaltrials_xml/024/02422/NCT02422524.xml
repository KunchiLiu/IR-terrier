	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1, single dose, open-label, sequential group study comparing the pharmacokinetics and safety of PA-824 in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment to matched, non-hepatically impaired subjects. Primary objective: To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of PA-824 in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment (as assessed by Child-Pugh score), relative to matched non-hepatically impaired subjects. Secondary objective: To evaluate the safety of a single oral dose of PA-824 in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment (as assessed by Child-Pugh score), relative to matched non-hepatically impaired subjects.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1, single dose, open-label, sequential group study comparing the pharmacokinetics and safety of PA-824 in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment to matched, non-hepatically impaired subjects. This study will enroll approximately 6 subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A), approximately 6 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B), approximately 6 subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), and approximately 18 matched non-hepatically impaired subjects. Non-hepatically impaired subjects in the control group will be matched to subjects with hepatic impairment based on age (+/- 10 years) and body weight (+/- 20%). Study Duration is approximately 15 months. Primary objective: To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of PA-824 in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment (as assessed by Child-Pugh score), relative to matched non-hepatically impaired subjects. Secondary objective: To evaluate the safety of a single oral dose of PA-824 in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment (as assessed by Child-Pugh score), relative to matched non-hepatically impaired subjects.</detailed_description>
