	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether the dual transcranial direct current stimulation(tDCS) improves the swallowing function of stroke patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of tDCS for Swallowing Difficulties in Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>120 patients were recruited and randomized to receive either real or sham-tDCS. Real experimental groups were divided into three types; Anode-Anode dual stimulation group, Anode-Cathode dual stimulation group, Single stimulation group. 20-minutes session of the stimulation were applied 5 times a weeks for 2 weeks at pharyngeal motor cortex of affected or non-affected site. The patients were evaluated at baseline, immediately and 2 weeks after tDCS.</detailed_description>
