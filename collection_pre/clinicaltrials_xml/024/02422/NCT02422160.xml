	<brief_summary>The investigators have developed an image analysis method that can predict the likelihood that a patient with age related macular degeneration (AMD) will progress within 1 year, based on computerized analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images that are routinely acquired in clinical practice on each patient visit to the ophthalmologist. The investigators' goal is to evaluate whether this method will improve the ability to detect AMD earlier and improve visual outcomes in AMD patients by assigning patient risk categories and having patients come back for follow up based on those categories.</brief_summary>
