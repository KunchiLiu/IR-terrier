	<brief_summary>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently one of the standard diagnostic imaging methods used to diagnose tumor stage before treatment in Radiology Oncology Department. It is also used to check responses to radiation after treatment. However, MRI isn't traditionally used in planning for radiation treatment or in checking treated tumor and tissue changes during radiation treatment. The goal is to find out the possible benefits of MRI imaging techniques in these settings of radiation treatment. Participating in this study would NOT change the current treatment plans, this will allow the investigators to use the MRI methods in research and future patient care.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imaging Acquisition and Analysis Methods for Optimization of MRI Radiation Oncology Simulation and Response Assessment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this protocol is to demonstrate proof of concept and feasibility of new MRI hardware, pulse sequences and data analysis software to plan radiotherapy treatment and to assess tumor response to radiotherapy (only FDA approved hardware are allowed in this study). Efforts to develop, modify and evaluate new or existing MR imaging techniques must be a continuous practice with the goal of enhancing the use of MRI during radiation therapy. The investigators therefore anticipate an ongoing need for such a protocol and believe the ability to perform such studies is critical to the translation of new imaging technologies from concept to routine clinical use. Under this protocol, modifications to the following items may be tested: pulse sequence programs, radiofrequency coils, reconstruction and processing software, other MR system hardware and analysis software. A brief description of each of these items is described below. The potential risks associated with modifying each of these items, and the measures that will be taken to minimize these risks are described in subsequent sections. Given that performing MRI examinations during radiation therapy is not the current standard of care, no changes to radiation treatment plans, radiotherapy delivery or treatment recommendations or guidelines will be done based on the findings for any participants entered on this protocol.</detailed_description>
