	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to characterize a new test to assess the rate and time it takes to form a blood clot in people who either do or do not take aspirin.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It is estimated that approximately 25% of people are resistant to aspirin, or do not respond to its effect. These individuals have a four fold higher risk of a heart attack or stroke compared to those who respond to aspirin. Current tests for determining those who are aspirin resistant are not reliable. This study is assessing the effectiveness of a new assay in determining the rate and time it takes for people who are or are not on aspirin in forming a blood clot.</detailed_description>
