	<brief_summary>This pilot trial seeks to obtain preliminary data on the effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (4g/d) on endothelial function measured via endopat2000 after 12 weeks of intervention among adults with elevated triglycerides and type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Eicosapentaenoic Acid on Endothelial Function in Diabetic Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty adults aged 30-75 y will be randomized to either 4 g/d of eicosapentaenoic acid or no drug for 12 weeks. Endothelial function will be measured at baseline and after 12 weeks. in a secondary aims, we will evaluate effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on plasma levels of c-reactive protein, oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and endothelin-1.</detailed_description>
