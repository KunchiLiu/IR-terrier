	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine if virologically suppressed, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected adults on an antiretroviral regimen (including 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs] plus a third agent) remain suppressed upon switching to a two-drug regimen with dolutegravir (DTG) + rilpivirine (RPV). The study will primarily assess the non-inferiority antiviral activity of switching to DTG + RPV once daily compared to continuation of current antiretroviral regimen (CAR) up to Week 48 with a switch visit for eligible subjects in the CAR group to initiate DTG + RPV therapy at Week 52. CAR will include 2 NRTIs plus 1 HIV-1 integrase inhibitor (INI), or 1 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), or 1 protease inhibitor (PI). The study will include a 148-week open-label treatment phase, comprising of an Early Switch Phase (Day 1 to Week 52) and a Late Switch Phase (Week 52 to Week 148). The participants fulfilling the study eligibility criteria will participate in the Early Switch Phase where they will either switch from their CAR to DTG + RPV, or continue taking their CAR, until Week 52. At the end of Early Switch Phase, eligible participants will proceed to the Late Switch Phase where all participants in both DTG + RPV and CAR treatment groups will receive DTG + RPV therapy until Week 148. After Week 148, subjects may be eligible to continue to receive DTG +RPV in the Continuation Phase. The study is planned to be conducted in approximately 476 participants.</brief_summary>

Must be on uninterrupted current regimen (either the initial or second combination antiretroviral therapy [cART] regimen) for at least 6 months prior to screening; Any prior switch, defined as a change of a single drug or multiple drugs simultaneously, must have occurred due to tolerability and/or safety concerns or access to medications, or convenience/simplification. Acceptable stable cART regimens prior to screening include 2 NRTIs plus INI (either the initial or second cART regimen), or an NNRTI (either the initial or second cART regimen), or a Boosted PI (or atazanavir unboosted) ( either the initial or second PIbased cART regimen).

Any contraception method must be used consistently, in accordance with the approved product label during treatment with study drug and for at least 2 weeks after discontinuation of study drug. All participants participating in the study should be counseled on safer sexual practices including the use and benefit/risk of effective barrier methods (e.g., male condom) and on the risk of HIV transmission to an uninfected partner. Participants who are willing and able to understand requirements of study participation and provide signed and dated written informed consent prior to screening. For participants enrolled in France: participants will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if either affiliated to or a beneficiary of a social security category. Exclusionary Criteria prior to screening or Day 1 Within 6 months prior to Screening and after confirmed suppression to &lt;50 c/mL on current ART regimen, any plasma HIV1 RNA measurement &gt;=50 c/mL .
