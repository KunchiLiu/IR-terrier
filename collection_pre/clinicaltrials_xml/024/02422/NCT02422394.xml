	<brief_summary>Inherited thrombocytopenias are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by a reduced number of blood platelets and a consequent bleeding tendency that ranges from mild to life-threatening. Thrombocytopenia is caused by genetic mutations and therefore is present throughout patients' life and can be transmitted to the progeny. Some patients with severely reduced platelet count present spontaneous bleedings, which represent a major clinical problem: in fact, bleeding diathesis exposes these subjects to the risk of severe hemorrhages, affects their quality of life and often requires hospitalization and/or transfusions. Conversely, other patients with inherited thrombocytopenias have absent or mild spontaneous bleeding tendency. However, even these patients are at risk of major bleedings on the occasion of surgery or other invasive procedures. Therefore, the potential for hemorrhages on the occasion of invasive procedures represent a clinical problem for all patients affected by inherited thrombocytopenias. Eltrombopag is a drug, available in tablets, which stimulates the production of platelets by the bone marrow. A previous study demonstrated that a short course of eltrombopag was effective in increasing platelet count in most patients with the MYH9-related disease (MYH9-RD), one form of inherited thrombocytopenia. Eltrombopag was given for 3 to 6 weeks to 12 patients with MYH9-RD and platelet counts lower than 50 x10e9/L. Eleven patients responded to the drug and 8 of them obtained platelet counts higher than 100 x109/L or three times the baseline value. Remission of spontaneous bleeding was achieved by 8 of 10 patients and treatment was well tolerated in all the cases. Based on these findings, short-term eltrombopag courses have been successfully used for preparing for major surgery two patients with MYH9-RD and less than 20 x10e9 platelets/L. The present study has two main objectives. - To verify if eltrombopag is effective in transiently increasing platelet count over 100 x 109/L and abolish bleeding tendency in patients with different forms of inherited thrombocytopenia. To this end, eltrombopag will be given for 3-6 weeks to patients with different forms of inherited thrombocytopenia. Eltrombopag will be administered at the dosage of 50 mg/day for 3 weeks. After 3 weeks of treatment, the patients who will obtain a platelet count higher than 100 x10e9/L will stop therapy. The patients who will achieve a platelet count lower than 100 x10e9/L will be treated with eltrombopag at a higher dosage (75 mg/day) for 3 additional weeks. This treatment schedule is called "Phase 1" of the study. If the study will achieve this goal, short-term eltrombopag could be potentially used in the future to prepare these patients for surgery or other invasive procedures - To verify if eltrombopag can be used to stably reduce spontaneous bleeding tendency for long periods of time in patients with clinically significant spontaneous bleedings. To this end, patients with clinically significant spontaneous bleedings and who had their bleeding tendency reduced during the Phase 1 of the study without severe side effects, will be admitted to the "Phase 2" of the study. During the Phase 2, patients will be treated with eltrombopag for 16 weeks. In order to determine the lowest dose of eltrombopag that is able to reduce or abolish their bleeding tendency, patients will start treatment with eltrombopag 25 mg/day for 4 weeks. Then, every 4 weeks, patients will be re-evaluated and the dosage of eltrombopag will be adjusted according to the bleeding tendency of the 7 days before evaluation. The dosages of eltrombopag that can be used in the Phase 2 range from 12.5 to 75 mg/day. Other objectives of the study are: - to evaluate safety and tolerability of Eltrombopag in patients with inherited thrombocytopenias. - to identify the dosages of Eltrombopag required to obtain the objectives of Phases 1 and 2. - to study the effect of treatment on some laboratory parameters related to platelet production and function. All patients will be undergo a follow-up visit 30 days after completion of treatment. Patients will be treated as outpatients. The evaluation of patients at enrollment includes: medical history; physical examination; peripheral blood examinations to count blood cells, to examine blood cells by microscope, to measure some parameters related to liver/kidney function and platelet production; standard urine analysis; ophthalmic assessment. Studies for dose adjustment includes the same examinations performed at enrollment with the exception of ophthalmic assessment. Evaluation of patients at the end of the Phases 1 or 2 and 30 days after the end of treatment includes the same examinations performed at enrollment: moreover, in patients who will obtain a platelet count higher than 100 x10e9/L, the in vitro platelet function will be studied.</brief_summary>
