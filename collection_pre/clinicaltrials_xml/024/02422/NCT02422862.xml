	<brief_summary>Frequently, headache is associated with disorders of the cervical spine, specially on the upper cervical spine. Therefore, restoration of the upper cervical mobility is considered fundamental for the treatment of headache. Manual therapy interventions seek to restore upper cervical mobility through a wide range of therapeutic procedures, including mobilization or manipulation techniques. Previous systematic reviews reported preliminary evidence for the application of upper cervical manual therapy techniques for the management of headache. The objective of this study is to study the effects of upper cervical translatoric spinal mobilization (UC-TSM) on headache intensity, cervical mobility and pressure pain threshold in subjects with headache. For this purpose, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial. Volunteers with headache will participate in the study and will be randomly divided into control or treatment group. Treatment group will receive UC-TSM and the control group will receive no treatment. Headache intensity, cervical mobility, temporomandibular mobility and pressure pain thresholds (PPT) will be measured before and immediately after each treatment session (3 treatment sessions in one week period) and after one month follow-up. At this moment, global perceived effect will be assessed.</brief_summary>
