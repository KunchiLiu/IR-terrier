	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare immune phenotype, function, and specificity of B lymphocytes from different developmental stages in autoimmune patients to B cells from infectious disease patients and healthy controls.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Autoantibody and Immunologic Cell Marker Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is essential to analyze the distribution of autoreactive B cells within bone marrow in order to study immature B cell developmental subsets, which are not present in the peripheral blood. Lymphocyte subsets from bone marrow will be characterized as described above for peripheral blood.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Signed written informed consent by the subject or, if the subject is unable to provide informed consent, the subject's legal representative may provide consent. Subjects can be of either gender Subjects with autoimmune diseases, and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) patients will fulfill the American College of Rheumatology Classification criteria for SLE to be determined by their treating physician but may have incomplete criteria (&lt;4 items). SLE patients are not restricted by treatment or by disease activity as determined by Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) or Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM) score 1. Subjects with acute exacerbations of their disease, including hospitalized patients 2. Firstdegree relatives of subjects with active disease Subjects who have received or will receive a vaccination may be enrolled for bone marrow aspirates before and/or after vaccination. Vaccination will have been done by the subject's healthcare provider or through another outside source. Subjects may have a screening blood draw performed in cases where a certain subset of cells or antibody titer is desired. This may be followed by additional blood draws and/or bone marrow aspiration after the ideal candidates have been identified. Subjects who have been diagnosed with HIV or another infectious disease Healthy controls must be free of acute or chronic disease at the time of bone marrow donation Poor venous access Subjects who have had side effects to local anesthetics such as Lidocaine and who are on blood thinners such as warfarin Normal controls must be free of acute or chronic diseases or medications that may affect the assay (as determined by the investigator). Insufficient access to the iliac crest and bone is hindered. This generally correlates to a BMI (Body Mass Index) of greater than 25.0.</criteria>
