	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether taking daily, dietary supplements of cocoa extract (containing cocoa flavanols and theobromine from the cocoa bean) and/or a standard multivitamin reduces the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (including heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and cardiovascular mortality) and cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>COcoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The COcoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study (COSMOS) is a randomized clinical trial of cocoa extract supplement (containing a total of 600 mg/d flavanols, including 80 mg. (-)-epicatechins), and a standard multivitamin supplement to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer among women aged 65 years and older and men aged 60 years and older. Women will be recruited among active Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Extension Study participants, and men will be recruited among non-randomized respondents to the VITamin D and OmegA-3 Trial (VITAL). Women who responded but were not randomized into VITAL will also be included as well as other women and men who express interest in research being conducted at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Several small randomized trials have demonstrated benefits for cocoa flavanols on intermediate outcomes, including blood pressure, lipids, insulin sensitivity, and flow-mediated vasodilation. For multivitamins, a prior large-scale randomized trial in middle-aged and older men showed a significant reduction in cancer, but comparable trial data in women are lacking. For both interventions, a large-scale clinical trial such as COSMOS could have major clinical and public health implications. Eligible participants will be assigned by chance (like a coin toss) to one of four groups: (1) daily cocoa extract and multivitamin; (2) daily cocoa extract and multivitamin placebo; (3) daily cocoa extract placebo and multivitamin; or (4) daily cocoa extract placebo and multivitamin placebo. Participants have an equal chance of being assigned to any of these four groups and a 3 out of 4 chance of getting at least one active agent. Participants in all groups will take three pills each day: two capsules that contain either cocoa extract or cocoa extract placebo, and one tablet that contains either multivitamin or multivitamin placebo. Participants receive their study pills in convenient calendar packs via U.S. mail. Participants also will be asked to complete short mailed questionnaires each year. The questionnaires ask about health; lifestyle habits, such as diet, physical activity, and smoking; use of medications and dietary supplements; family history of illness and new medical diagnoses. Occasionally, participants may receive a phone call from study staff to collect information or clarify responses on the questionnaires. At baseline, approximately 6,000 COSMOS participants will provide optional blood and urine samples to determine whether the study agents significantly change biomarkers and other risk factors related to cardiovascular disease and cancer. Selected participants will either have specimens collected through mailed specimen collection kits that are returned by the participant, or have blood, urine, blood pressure, and anthropometric measurements collected by technicians from Examination Management Services, Inc. (EMSI), a national clinical services provider. A subgroup of those who provide baseline specimens and measurements will be asked to provide follow-up samples and measurements. At baseline and year 2 of the trial, approximately 500 participants living within driving distance of Boston, Massachusetts will provide additional measurements from in-clinic study visits at the Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) of Brigham and Women's Hospital. These visits will include cognitive function assessments, anthropometrics, physical function assessments, blood pressure and other measurements. At baseline and after each year of follow-up, approximately 4,000 COSMOS participants will complete web-based assessments of cognitive function. Over the course of the trial, participants will complete up to 4 assessments, each of which takes approximately 25 minutes to complete.</detailed_description>
