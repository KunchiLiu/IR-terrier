	<brief_summary>Assessment of the improvement of the safety of the swallowing function under 3 natural ingredients known to be agonist of sensory receptors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Natural Ingredient to Improve the Swallowing Response of Patients With Oropharyngeal Dysphagia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial will be double-blind, randomized, monocentric, and interventional with a hybrid design. The subjects will be randomized to one of the three parallel active ingredient groups. Products will be compared versus control (Thicken Up Clear - nectar viscosity), which adds a part of cross over within the design. The total sample size is 84 enrolled subjects. Patients will be males and females aged 55+ with mild proven dysphagia.</detailed_description>
