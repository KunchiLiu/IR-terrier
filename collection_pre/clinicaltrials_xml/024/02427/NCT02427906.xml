	<brief_title>Effect of Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt on Gut Microbiota in Cirrhotic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cirrhosis is associated with qualitative and quantitative changes in the gut microbiota that can potentiate disease progression and complications such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and infections. Dysbiosis or altered gut microbiota, due to decreased autochthonous or commensal taxa, has been found in stool and colonic mucosa in cirrhotic patients, which is in turn linked with disease severity and systemic inflammation. TIPS can decompress the hypertensive portal vein,so that the intestinal congestion can be decrease too. Hence we summarize that TIPS may have effect on gut microbiota and associated inflammatory factors in cirrhotic patients.</detailed_description>
