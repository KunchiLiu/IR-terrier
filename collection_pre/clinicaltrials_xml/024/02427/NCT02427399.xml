	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to determine whether outreach to HIV-negative women who are overdue for a Pap smear at a New England urban community health center can increase cervical cancer screening rates among these women. It additionally seeks to determine which form of outreach - via letter, email, phone, or a mixture of those modalities- is most effective.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Conducting Outreach to Improve Cervical Cancer Screening Rates Among Underscreened Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To the investigators' knowledge, this study will be the first to assess the efficacy of email in cervical cancer screening outreach in a randomized controlled trial. It will also be one of the few randomized controlled trials to directly compare different outreach media directly, as opposed to different variations within a single medium (e.g. two different types of letters). Lastly, given the unique patient demographic makeup at Fenway, including a significant number of lesbian and bisexual women and transmen, secondary subanalyses have the potential to significantly add to the investigators' knowledge of what media work best in conducting cervical cancer screening outreach with sexual and gender minorities, who are disproportionately underscreened compared to heterosexual cis-gendered women.</detailed_description>
