	<brief_title>A Study of Ibrutinib Plus Rituximab With Hyper-CVAD Consolidation in Newly Diagnosed Young Patients With Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: This study will have 2 Parts. If you are found to be eligible for this study, you will begin Part 1 of the study. At any time you may be given other drugs to help prevent or decrease side effects, such as nausea and vomiting. You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks. Part 1: Part 1 will last up to 12 cycles. Each cycle is 28 days. Every day you will take 4 ibrutinib capsules with about 1 cup (8 ounces) of water. You must take all 4 capsules at about the same time every day, at least 30 minutes before or at least 2 hours after eating a meal. Do not open the capsules or dissolve them. If you miss a dose, you can take it up to 6 hours after the time you would have taken it. If it is later than 6 hours, you should skip the dose and start taking the capsules at the same time as usual the next day. You will need to fill out diary cards with information about when you take ibrutinib. You should bring the diary cards with you to appointments. On Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1, you will receive rituximab by vein. The first dose should take about 6-8 hours. After that, each dose should take about 4 hours. You will then receive rituximab by vein over 4 hours on Day 1 of Cycles 3-12. You will not receive the drug in Cycle 2. For some patients, you may receive the rituximab dose over 2 days. Your doctor will tell you if this is best for you. You will be checked every 2 cycles to learn how you may be responding. Based on your response, you may start Part 2 of the study. Part 2: During part 2, depending on your response in Part 1, you will receive 2 alternating combinations of drugs (the first combination in the first cycle, then the second combination in the second cycle, and so on) for 2-8 cycles. Each cycle will be 28 days. First combination: You will receive the following drugs during the odd-numbered cycles (Cycles 1, 3, 5, and 7) of Part 2: - Rituximab by vein over 6 hours on Day 1 - Dexamethasone either by mouth or by vein on Days 1-4 - Cyclophosphamide by vein (over 3 hours each time) 2 times each day on Days 2-4 - Mesna by vein non-stop on Days 2-4 - Doxorubicin by vein over 15-30 minutes on Day 5 - Vincristine by vein over 15-30 minutes on Day 5 To help prevent infections, you will also receive Filgrastim (G-CSF) injections just under your skin, starting at 24-36 hours after the end of the doxorubicin infusion. You will continue to receive these injections every day until your white blood cell counts recover. Second combination: You will receive the following drugs during the even-numbered cycles (Cycles 2, 4, 6, and 8) of Part 2: - Rituximab by vein over 6 hours on Day 1 - Methotrexate by vein over 24 hours on Day 2 - Cytarabine by vein (over 2 hours each time) 2 times each day on Days 3-4 When you receive methotrexate, you will also be given leucovorin by mouth to help prevent side effects. Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn 24 and 48 hours after the end of the methotrexate infusion so that the study doctor can learn when it is best to stop giving you leucovorin. You will again receive G-CSF after doxorubicin until your white blood cell counts recover. Study Visits in Part 1: On Day 1 of every cycle: - You will have a physical and neurological exam. - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of the disease. - If you can become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1½ tablespoons) or urine pregnancy test. - If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow biopsy and/or aspiration to check the status of the disease. - If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a gastrointestinal endoscopy. - If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease. On Days 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1, you will have a physical exam. On Day 1 of every odd-numbered cycle (Cycles 3, 5, 7, and so on), if the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a CT scan to check the status of the disease. If your CT scan shows that the disease has gotten better, you will have a PET/CT scan at the end of Part 1. If the doctor thinks it is needed based on the results of your screening bone marrow biopsy and/or colonoscopy, these tests will be repeated at the end of Part 1. Study Visits in Part 2: On Day 1 of every cycle: - You will have a physical and neurological exam. - You will have an EKG. - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of the disease. - If you can become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1½ tablespoons) or urine pregnancy test. Up to 3 times a week from Days 8-28 of all Cycles, you will have a blood (about 2 tablespoons each time) drawn for routine tests. At the end of Cycles 2, 4, 6, and 8, and then every 3-6 cycles after that, you will have a CT scan and chest x-ray to check the status of the disease. Length of Treatment: You may continue taking the study drugs in Part 1 for up to 12 cycles. You may continue taking the study drugs in Part 2 for up to 8 cycles. You will no longer be able to take the drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. End-of-Treatment Visit: After you finish taking the study drugs: - You will have a physical and neurological exam. - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of the disease. - If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a PET/CT scan and/or bone marrow biopsy/aspiration to check the status of the disease. - If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a gastrointestinal endoscopy. - If you can become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1½ tablespoons) or urine pregnancy test. Long Term Follow-Up: After your end-of-treatment visit and if the disease has not gotten worse, you will return for a clinic visit every 4 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 2 years, and then every year after that to see how you are doing. At these visits: - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of the disease. - You will have a PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease. This is an investigational study. Ibrutinib is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of patients with MCL. Rituximab is FDA approved for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and certain types of leukemia. Using these 2 drugs in combination with each other is investigational. All of the drugs in Part 2 are standard of care for the treatment of lymphoma. Up to 100 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
