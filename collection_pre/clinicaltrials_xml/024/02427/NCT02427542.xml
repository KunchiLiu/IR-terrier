	<brief_summary>This is a feasibility trial designed to test the feasibility and acceptability of a brief form (six sessions) of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) for Depersonalisation/Derealisation (DP/DR) in those individuals who also have a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder. Participants will be randomised to receive either six sessions of CBT targeting DP/DR symptoms or to a treatment as usual control condition.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Trial of CBT for Depersonalisation in Psychosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depersonalisation/derealisation (DP/DR) are distressing symptoms of having a sense of detachment and unreality about oneself (DP) or the external world (DR). Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) has been found to be beneficial in treating patients with chronic DP/DR. CBT for DP/DR includes educating patients about these experiences so they have a better understanding and less fear; teaching ways of coping to help them manage the symptoms better; helping reduce the impact on their day to day functioning; and working together to find less distressing ways of interpreting these experiences. Recent research has highlighted that DP/DR symptoms are common in people diagnosed with psychotic disorders, and when present are linked with more severe psychotic symptoms. However, there has been no previous study to ascertain if CBT to target DP/DR in psychosis would be effective. This study therefore aims to establish the feasibility of a brief CBT intervention for DP/DR in people diagnosed with a psychotic disorder. It is hoped that the CBT will reduce the distress associated with DP/DR experiences, with a possibility of reducing psychotic phenomena in addition. The investigators will seek to recruit adults aged 18-70 with a current psychotic symptoms as well as meeting threshold for DP/DR disorder. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive six sessions of CBT or to a treatment as usual control. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and follow-up interview at 10 weeks.</detailed_description>
