	<brief_summary>This is a prospective randomized controlled study comparing the efficacy of cryolipolysis versus a combination of cryolipolysis and surgical subcision for the treatment of cellulite. The treatment sites are both outer thighs. One outer thigh will be randomized to receive one treatment of cryolipolysis, while the contralateral thigh will be assigned to receive the combination cryolipolysis plus surgical subcision. A live rating by a blinded dermatologist will evaluate the treatment and control areas using a cellulite severity scale at week 0 (before treatment) and at the 3-month follow up visit.</brief_summary>
