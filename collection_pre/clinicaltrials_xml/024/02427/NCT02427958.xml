	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of Leuprorelin in Central Precocious Puberty in Chinese Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called leuprorelin. It is administered as a 1 month subcutaneous depot. Leuprorelin is being tested to treat children who have CPP. This study will look at the development of internal and external genital organs and appearance of secondary sexual characteristics in pre-pubertal children who take leuprorelin. The study will enroll approximately 300 patients. Participants with body weight &gt;=20 kg will receive the recommended dose of leuprorelin 3.75 mg subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks for 96 weeks. Participants with body weight &lt;20 kg will receive recommended dose of 1.88 mg subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks for 96 weeks. This trial will be conducted in China. The overall time to participate in this study is 104 weeks. Participants will make 11 visits to the clinic, and will be followed-up by the physician on a long-term basis until stable puberty is reached.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. In the opinion of the investigator, the subject and/or parent(s) or legal guardian are capable of understanding and complying with protocol requirements. 2. The subject or the subject's parent(s) or legally acceptable representative signs and dates a written, informed consent form and any required privacy authorization prior to the initiation of any study procedures. 3. Has onset of appearance of secondary sexual characteristic earlier than age 8.0 years in girls or earlier than 9.0 years in boys and the symptom is persistent, and has confirmed diagnosis of CPP. 4. Has basal luteinizing hormone (LH) level greater than (&gt;) 5.0 international units per liter (IU/L) or peak LH &gt;3.3 IU/L with LH/folliclestimulating factor (FSH) &gt;0.6 in stimulation test. 5. Has evidence of gonadal development evaluated by ultrasonography: ovarian volume &gt;=1 milliliter (mL) with multiple follicles &gt;=4 millimeter (mm) in any ovary or uterine enlargement in females or testicular volume &gt;=4 mL in males. 6. Has advanced bone age (BA) &gt;=1 year and BA is less than or equal to (&lt;=) 11.5 years in females or &lt;=12.5 years in males OR predicted adult height &lt;150 centimeter (cm) in females or &lt;160 cm in males OR standard deviation score (SDS) &lt;2 standard deviations (SD) OR rapid growth defined as growth of BA /growth of chronologic age &gt;1. BA is determined by Greulich and Pyle standards or TannerWhitehouse 3 (TW3) standards at screening. 7. Has anticipated treatment duration of at least 2 year in investigator's judgment. 8. A male subject who is nonsterilized and sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential agrees to use adequate contraception from signing of informed consent throughout the duration of the study and for 90 days after last dose. 9. A female subject of childbearing potential who is sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner agrees to use routinely adequate contraception from signing of informed consent throughout the duration of the study. 10. The female subject who, at the discretion of the investigator, is deemed to be of child bearing potential must provide negative urine pregnancy text at Day 1 or Day 1 prior to drug administration. 1. Has received any investigational compound within 30 days prior to Screening. 2. Has received gonadotropinreleasing hormone analog (GnRHa) treatment in a previous clinical study or as a therapeutic agent. 3. Is an immediate family member, study site employee, or is in a dependent relationship with a study site employee who is involved in the conduct of this study (example [eg], spouse, parent, child, sibling) or may consent under duress. 4. Has any findings in his/her medical history, physical examination, or safety clinical laboratory tests giving reasonable suspicion of underlying disease that might interfere with the conduct of the trial. 5. Has any concomitant medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may expose a subject to an unacceptable level of safety risk or that affects subject compliance. 6. Has any screening abnormal laboratory value that suggests a clinically significant underlying disease or condition that may prevent the subject from entering the study; or the subject has: creatinine &gt;=1.5 milligram per deciliter (mg/dL), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), or total bilirubin &gt;2.0 mg/dL, with AST/ALT elevated above the limits of normal values. 7. Has a history or clinical manifestations of significant adrenal or thyroid diseases or intracranial tumor OR has a history of malignant disease. 8. Has a history of hypersensitivity or allergies to leuprorelin, or related compounds including any excipients of the compound. 9. Has a diagnosis of peripheral precocious puberty. 10. Has a history of drug abuse (defined as any illicit drug use) or a history of alcohol abuse within 1 year prior to the Screening Visit. 11. Subject or parent(s), at the discretion of the investigator, is unlikely to comply with the protocol or is unsuitable for any of other reason. 12. If female, the subject is of childbearing potential (eg, not sterilized). 13. If female, the subject is pregnant or lactating or intending to become pregnant before, during, or within 1 month after participating in this study; or intending to donate ova during such time period. 14. If male, the subject intends to donate sperm during the course of this study or for 90 days thereafter. 15. Has participated in another clinical study and/or has received any investigational compound within 30 days prior to Screening.</criteria>
