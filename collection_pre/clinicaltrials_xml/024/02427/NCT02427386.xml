	<brief_summary>Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that causes pelvic pain difficult to treat. In view of this, many patients seek assistance in complementary and alternative medicine, including homeopathic treatment. The absence of evidence in the literature raises controversy about the effectiveness of homeopathic treatment in endometriosis. The aim of this randomized trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of dynamized estrogen compared to placebo in the treatment of chronic pelvic pain of endometriosis.</brief_summary>
