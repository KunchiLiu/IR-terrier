	<brief_summary>This phase Ib/II trial studies the best dose and safety of Bcl-2 inhibitor GDC-0199 in combination with obinutuzumab and ibrutinib and to see how well they work in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia that has returned (relapsed), does not respond to treatment (refractory), or is previously untreated. Bcl-2 inhibitor GDC-0199 and ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as obinutuzumab, may block cancer growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Giving Bcl-2 inhibitor GDC-0199 together with obinutuzumab and ibrutinib may be a better treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bcl-2 Inhibitor GDC-0199 in Combination With Obinutuzumab and Ibrutinib in Treating Patients With Relapsed, Refractory, or Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To identify the dose of venetoclax (Bcl-2 inhibitor GDC-0199) that can be safely administered in combination with obinutuzumab and ibrutinib for the treatment of relapsed/refractory or previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). II. To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab and ibrutinib in patients with relapsed/refractory or previously untreated CLL. III. To determine the minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative complete response (CR) rate after 12 cycles of treatment with venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab and ibrutinib in patients with relapsed/refractory or previously untreated CLL. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) and complete response rate (CR) of venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab and ibrutinib in patients with relapsed/refractory or previously untreated patients with CLL. II. To estimate progression free survival (PFS) after treatment with venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab and ibrutinib in patients with relapsed/refractory or previously untreated patients with CLL. III. To conduct pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies of venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab and ibrutinib in patients with relapsed/refractory or previously untreated patients with CLL. IV. To examine pre-treatment and serial biomarkers associated with response and mechanisms of resistance to venetoclax, obinutuzumab and ibrutinib when given in combination for relapsed/refractory or previously untreated patients with CLL. OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of Bcl-2 inhibitor GDC-0199 followed by a phase II study. Patients receive obinutuzumab intravenously (IV) on day 1 (days 1, 2, 8, and 15 for course 1 only) every 28 days for up to 8 courses. Beginning in course 2, patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Beginning in course 3, patients receive Bcl-2 inhibitor GDC-0199 PO QD on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 14 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 and 8 weeks, every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
