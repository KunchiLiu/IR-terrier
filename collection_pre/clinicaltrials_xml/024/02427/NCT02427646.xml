	<brief_summary>The present study attempts to fill a critical knowledge gap of BoNT A in tremor management by studying the efficacy of IncobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin®) injection for hand tremor in essential tremor and idiopathic Parkinson disease using data regarding composition of tremor obtained through sophisticated, yet clinically accessible multi-sensor based kinematic information.</brief_summary>
