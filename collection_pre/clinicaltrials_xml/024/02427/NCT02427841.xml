	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and gemcitabine hydrochloride followed by radiation therapy before surgery work in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that can be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation and Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Followed by Radiation Therapy Before Surgery in Treating Patients With Pancreatic Cancer That Can Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the R0 (complete resection) resection rate for subjects with borderline resectable or lymph node positive pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with a multimodality neoadjuvant therapy of preoperative gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) and ABRAXANE (paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation) followed by 5-fluorouracil (fluorouracil) based image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) chemoradiotherapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine 1-year relapse-free survival rate with the investigational protocol. II. To determine 1-year and 2-year overall survival rates. III. To assess response rate by imaging (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1) and pathologic analysis. IV. To assess the toxicity and safety according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0) criteria. V. To assess molecular predictors of response and survival (serum cancer antigen (CA) 19-9 and secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) expression). OUTLINE: PRE-OPERATIVE (NEOADJUVANT) CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 3-6 weeks after completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo IG-IMRT 5 days a week for 28 fractions and receive fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-7 for 6 weeks. SURGICAL RESECTION: Patients undergo surgery 4-10 weeks after the last dose of chemoradiation. POST-OPERATIVE (ADUJUVANT) CHEMOTHERAPY: Beginning within 8-12 weeks after surgery, patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30 minutes and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 additional courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 3 years and then every 24 weeks for 2 years.</detailed_description>
