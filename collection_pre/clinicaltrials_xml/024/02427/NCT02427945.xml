	<brief_summary>The investigators are seeking to overcome the dual challenges of under-nutrition and diarrhea using an existing safe water supply platform to deliver nutrition information to targeted groups in Western Kenya. Using a randomized evaluation, investigators will determine the impact on nutrition status and practices of delivering nutrition information. The evaluation results will enable Evidence Action to make strategic decisions regarding the potential scale-up of the combined program across Kenya.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Leveraging an Existing Large-scale Safe Water Program to Deliver Nutrition Messages at a Low Marginal Cost</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evidence Action's Dispensers for Safe Water program currently provides access to safe water for two million people. The program would be able to leverage the existence of this service delivery platform to provide promoters with training on proper nutrition and methods for delivering these messages to target groups. The intervention is a home visiting program that will provide nutrition advice on complementary feeding to households with children aged 6-24 months. Two types of home visits will be evaluated, a 'traditional visit mode' in which the child's mother receives the visit; and a 'couples visit mode' in which the promoter attempts to involve both the father and mother. Households in the control group will also receive home visits by promoters but the content of the visit will be restricted to safe water. The same information on safe water will also be provided to households in the treatment group. Hence, the evaluation will measure the additional effect of providing nutrition information on top of information on safe water. Promoters will provide advice on nutrition and food hygiene to target households, according to criteria established by Evidence Action. Following the Guiding Principles for Complementary Feeding of the Breastfed Child (PAHO/WHO 2003), the intervention will include information on the maintenance of breastfeeding, safe/hygienic preparation and storage of complementary foods, amount of complementary food needed, food consistency, meal frequency and energy density, nutrient content of complementary foods, and feeding after illness. The home visits will be modelled on the MaiMwana Infant Feeding intervention (http://www.maimwana.malawi.net/MaiMwana/Home.html) that has been taking place in Mchinji (Malawi) since 2005. Households within the treatment group will be provided by a poster to hang in their dwellings with some basic information on nutrition. A random subset of households will be given a small poster in black and white, and the other subset of households will be give a larger color poster.</detailed_description>
