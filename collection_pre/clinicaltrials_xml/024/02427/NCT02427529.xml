	<brief_title>Muscle-Sparing Effect Of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) During a Very Low Calorie Diet (VLCD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Four-week clinical trials were conducted on 59 females between the ages of 20 and 55, over an 18 month period. Exclusion criteria included thyroid conditions or prior significant medical history. Patients were randomized to receive daily subcutaneous injections of either hCG (200-300IU) or saline (placebo). All were placed on a VLCD resembling a protein-sparing modified fast. The caloric intake was between 500 and 600 calories, with 50% protein and 50% complex carbohydrates consisting mostly of fruits and vegetables. Measured parameters: weight, body composition via bio-impedance, blood pressure, and blood labs. A subset also underwent weekly electrocardiograms (EKG).</detailed_description>
