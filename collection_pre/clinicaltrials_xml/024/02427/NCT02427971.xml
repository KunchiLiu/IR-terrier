	<brief_summary>The Aysis® Cs2 ventilator offers an automated control of end-tidal inhalation anesthetic concentration, the EtControl® mode. A low Fresh Gas Flow (FGF) (0.5L/min) is kept during the maintenance of the anesthesia, decreasing the expensive consumption of halogenated agents. The Perseus® A 500 offers a VaporView® mode that gives the evolution of inspired (Fi) and end-tidal (Fe) fractions of halogenated agents for 20 minutes based on the delivered fraction (Fd). FGF remains adjusted manually by the practitioner. This mode also makes it possible to maintain a low FGF (0.5 L/min), provided the halogen Fd is set to maintain a steady Fe curve. The goal of this work was to compare the maniability of the intraoperative administered concentrations and the consumption of Desflurane between these 2 modalities of administration.</brief_summary>
