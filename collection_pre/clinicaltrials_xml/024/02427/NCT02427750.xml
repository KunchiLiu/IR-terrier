	<brief_summary>The present study is designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of trivalent, surface antigen, inactivated influenza vaccine in 2 age cohorts: 18 to ≤60 years and ≥61 years. For the immunogenicity endpoint the antibody response to each influenza vaccine antigen will be evaluated by means of Single Radial Hemolysis (SRH) or Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) at approximately 21 days post vaccination. The vaccine composition will be based on the WHO recommended influenza strains for the 2015 Southern Hemisphere vaccine, and the data from this study are intended to support the use of this vaccine in future influenza seasons if the recommended vaccine composition remains the same.</brief_summary>

Has known or suspected drug or alcohol abuse within the past 2 years; 12. Has the following within the past 6 months: had any laboratoryconfirmed seasonal or pandemic influenza disease, received any seasonal or pandemic influenza vaccine, 13.
