	<brief_title>Clinical Risk Score Predicting the Cardiac Rupture in Patients With ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STEMI patients chewed 300 mg aspirin and 600 mg clopidogrel in the emergency department, followed by oral 100 mg aspirin and 75mg clopidogrel daily for at least 12 months. STEMI patients received low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), β-blockers, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) according to the STEMI guideline, unless there were contraindications to these drugs. Peripheral blood samples were collected from patients within 2 hours of admission for blood routines and blood biochemistry examinations. White blood cell counts and level of hemoglobin were assessed with automated cell counters via standard techniques. The investigators followed up patients in validation group for three month to observe the cardiac rupture events and other adverse cardiac events .</detailed_description>
