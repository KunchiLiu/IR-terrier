	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well mTOR complex 1 and 2 (TORC1/2) Inhibitor INK128 works in treating patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia that has returned after a period of improvement (relapsed) or has not responded to previous treatment (refractory). TORC1/2 Inhibitor INK128 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TORC1/2 Inhibitor INK128 in Treating Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the complete hematologic response (CR)/complete response with complete response incomplete (CRi) rate when MLN0128 (TORC1/2 Inhibitor INK128) is administered to adult patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the overall response rate (CR, CRi/partial response (PR)/morphologic leukemia free state [MLFS]). II. Determine the CR/CRi duration when MLN0128 is administered to adult patients with relapsed/refractory ALL. III. Determine the frequency of proceeding to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for patients with relapsed/refractory ALL who achieve a response on MLN0128. IV. Determine the overall survival for relapsed/refractory ALL patients on MLN0128. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Examine the pharmacokinetics of MLN0128 in ALL patients. II. Assess whether phosphorylation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) substrate 4EBP1 decreases in leukemic blasts harvested from the bone marrow on day 8 compared to baseline. III. Assess in an exploratory fashion whether MLN0128 enhances expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bim and Puma in marrow ALL cells. IV. Assess in an exploratory fashion whether myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) levels decrease in blast cells during MLN0128 treatment. V. Assess in an exploratory fashion whether a) the phospho-protein pattern at baseline or b) MLN0128-associated changes in the phospho-protein pattern differs between ALL samples that respond to therapy and those that do not. OUTLINE: Patients receive MLN0128 orally (PO) daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses after response in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 month.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>World Health Organization (WHO)defined acute lymphoblastic leukemia and either: Relapsed after achieving remission Patients age 59 and younger may have had up to two prior induction regimens (where the cyclophosphamide/vincristine/daunorubicin/dexamethasone and highdose methotrexate/cytarabine cycles of hypercyclophosphamide/dexamethasone/doxorubicin/vincristine [CVAD] are counted as one regimen) or Patients age 60 and older may have had up to one prior induction regimen Refractory to front line therapy Ineligible for intensive chemotherapy induction Note: patients with T lineage and B lineage ALL are eligible for this trial; likewise, patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) (as long as they are not candidate for other therapies for Ph+) and Ph ALL are eligible At least 4 weeks away from any previous antineoplastic or investigational agent; patients may receive hydroxyurea or glucocorticoids for suppression of leukocytosis, but these must be stopped at least 24 hours prior to initiation of therapy Bone marrow blasts of at least 10% Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 Life expectancy of &lt; 2 months Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =&lt; 2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal Relapse after SCT is allowed but no active graftversushost disease (GVHD) as per treating physician; also must not exceed the number of prior induction regimens listed above; SCT does not count as line of therapy Negative serum pregnancy; women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of MLN0128 administration Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Prior therapy with mTOR inhibitors except for rapalog treatment as part of graftversushost (GVH) prophylaxis or treatment Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy =&lt; 4 weeks prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier; treatment with glucocorticoids, hydroxyurea, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors is allowed up to 24 hour prior to initiation of therapy Patients with white blood cell (WBC) &gt; 30,000 are not eligible to start therapy; however, it is permissible to use glucocorticoids and/or hydroxyurea to diminish peripheral WBC to less than 30,000 provided these agents are stopped at least 24 hours prior to the first dose of MLN0128 Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents Patients with known other active cancers; skin cancers (basal or squamous) are exempted History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to MLN0128 Because of the low potential for interaction with agents that induce or inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes, there are no prohibitions of specific medications on the basis of anticipated drugdrug interactions Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV)positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with MLN0128; in addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrowsuppressive therapy, as lymphocyte numbers and function will be further suppressed by MLN0128; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated</criteria>
