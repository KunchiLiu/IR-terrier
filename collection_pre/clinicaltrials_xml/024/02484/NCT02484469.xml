	<brief_summary>Team-based learning (TBL) is a learner-centered, instructor-directed strategy for small group active learning in large group educational settings. When TBL is conducted correctly, the students' performances are equivalent or improved in comparison to either lecture-based formats or more traditional small group learning models.1 Nevertheless, few studies have been published regarding the insertion of innovative audiovisual tools in the TBL context. The Virtual Human Project is described as powerful sequences of three dimension (3D) computer graphics video of the human body that aids learning by facilitating an understanding in relation to a specific subject. The Virtual Human is composed by video sequences combining anatomy, physiology, and morphology in the context of various diseases. There are video sequences available for many disciplines, including dermatology and with capacity to produce anatomical structures by 3D printer. Despite the incredible potential applications of the Virtual Human, few studies have assessed its impact on medical education. The investigators did not find any study evaluating TBL with the insertion of iconographic educational material that assessed whether this intervention could change the learning progress of students. This is the aim of the present study, by comparing students tests scores after a TBL session with the VIrtual Human videos about leprosy or a standard TBL session, and to evaluate the student's satisfaction with the Virtual Human videos.</brief_summary>
