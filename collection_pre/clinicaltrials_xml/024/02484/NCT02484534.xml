	<brief_summary>Cirrhotic patients are patients with high morbidity and mortality, it is very important for determining the prognosis of these patients. The importance increases when these patients waiting for a liver transplant. The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) is a reliable measure of mortality risk in patients with end-stage liver disease. It is used as a disease severity index to help prioritize allocation of organs for transplant. MELD uses the patient values for serum bilirubin, serum creatinine, and the international normalized ratio for prothrombin time (INR) to predict survival. Blood tests that we use today in daily practice to evaluate the coagulation system (PT, PTT) do not check actually the functioning of the system, but examine the level of clotting factors and therefore only verify that the side of Anticoagulant of the equation and not the side of the procoagulant . To examine the coagulation system function tests have been developed, One of them is the thrombin generation. The purpose of the trial is to determine whether thrombin generation test can be a prognostic indicator in patients cirrhosis.</brief_summary>
