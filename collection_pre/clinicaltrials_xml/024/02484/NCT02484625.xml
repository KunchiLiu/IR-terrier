	<brief_summary>Dairy products have a potential to be healthy snack foods for children and are provided in a variety of food matrices. For instance, milk represents a fluid product, yogurt can be classified as a semi-solid food, and finally cheese is the example of the solid food. This experiment is aimed to examine the effect of dairy products with different food matrices on satiety and food intake in children. Dairy products will be compared with other non-dairy snacks popular among children including cookies and potato chips.</brief_summary>
