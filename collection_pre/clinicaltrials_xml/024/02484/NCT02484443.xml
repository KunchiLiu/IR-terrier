	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well dinutuximab works when given with sargramostim in treating patients with osteosarcoma that has come back after treatment (recurrent). Monoclonal antibodies, such as dinutuximab, may find tumor cells and help kill them. Sargramostim may help the body increase the amount of white blood cells it produces, which help the body fight off infections. Giving dinutuximab with sargramostim may work better and kill more cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dinutuximab in Combination With Sargramostim in Treating Patients With Recurrent Osteosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the disease control rate in patients with completely resected recurrent osteosarcoma treated with ch14.18 (dinutuximab) in combination with sargramostim (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]) as compared to historical Children's Oncology Group (COG) experience. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) in patients with recurrent osteosarcoma in the proposed administration schedule. II. To determine the occurrence of unacceptable toxicity (UT) in patients with recurrent osteosarcoma treated with ch14.18 (dinutuximab) in combination with sargramostim. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the relationship between probability of disease control and tumor GD2 expression. II. To assess killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) and Fcgamma receptor (FcgammaR) genotypes, natural killer cell p30 (NKp30) isoforms and its circulating ligand, B7-H6, and their relationships to the probability of disease control. III. To attempt banking of tumor samples for future research studies from patients enrolled on study who undergo biopsy or resection of suspected metastatic disease recurrence while on protocol therapy or during the evaluation period. IV. To determine a descriptive profile of human anti-chimeric antibody (HACA) during immunotherapy. V. To bank serial plasma samples for future studies of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) detection as a marker of disease progression and response. OUTLINE: Patients receive sargramostim subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-14 and dinutuximab intravenously (IV) over 20 hours on days 4 and 5 (dinutuximab infusion may be extended for an additional 2 days for anticipated toxicities). Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 5 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 8 and 12 months.</detailed_description>
