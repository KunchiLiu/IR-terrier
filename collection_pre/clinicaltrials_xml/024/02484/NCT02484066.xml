	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and safety of transbronchial biopsy (TBB) and bronchial brushing by using virtual bronchoscopic navigation (VBN) combined with endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and a Guide Sheath (GS) for the diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs) without radiographic fluoroscopy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and safety of transbronchial biopsy (TBB) and bronchial brushing by using virtual bronchoscopic navigation (VBN) combined with endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and a Guide Sheath (GS) as a guide for diagnosing peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs) without radiographic fluoroscopy.The study is designed as a two-center prospective randomized controlled trial.The participating centers are Department of endoscope , Shanghai chest Hospital affiliated to Shanghai JiaoTong University, China. Department of endoscope, respiratory endoscopy division, National Cancer Center, Japan.Patients are divided into two groups, VBN-EBUS-GS-X-ray group and VBN-EBUS-GS group.Each subject will be randomized to each group.The study is expected to enroll 400 patients at 2 centers (China:200, Japan: 200).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Individuals eligible for inclusion are patients that the CT scan appearance of the PPLs showed the longest diameter was more than 1 cm and non GGO lesions. 1. The distance from the lesion to the pleura is less than 1cm 2. Absence of bronchus leading to or adjacent to the lesion from CT scan 3. Refusal of participation 4. Severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction and other indications that can't receive bronchoscopy</criteria>
