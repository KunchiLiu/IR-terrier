	<brief_summary>Background: - MEDI4736 is a drug that may help people s immune systems respond to and kill cancer cells. Olaparib is a drug that may inhibit repairing DNA damage of cancer cells. Cediranib is a drug that may stop the blood vessel growth of cancer cells. This study has two components. In the phase 1 component of the study, researchers want to investigate how well participants tolerate the combination of these drugs in treating advanced solid tumors, and in the phase 2 part of this study, researchers want to study if the combination treatments are effective in ovarian cancer. Objectives: - Phase 1 part of the study: To determine the safety of the combination of MEDI4736 with the drugs olaparib or cediranib. - Phase 2 part of the study: To determine how effective this combination is in treating ovarian cancer. Eligibility: - Phase 1 part of the study: Adults age 18 or older with advanced or recurrent solid tumors that have no standard treatment. - Phase 2 part of the study: Adults age 18 or older with advanced or recurrent ovarian cancer that has no standard treatment. Design: - Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine tests. They will have CT or MRI scans. For these, they will lie in a machine that takes pictures of their bodies. - Phase 2 part of the study requests the participants to have tumor samples removed. - Participants will get MEDI4636 through an IV. A small plastic tube will be inserted into a vein. The drug will be given every 2 weeks for 12 months. - Participants will take olaparib or cediranib by mouth every day. - Every 28 days will be 1 cycle. For cycle 1, participants will have 2 study visits. All other cycles, they will have 1 visit. At these visits, they will repeat the screening procedures. - Patients will keep a drug and diarrhea diary. - Patients on cediranib will monitor their blood pressure and keep a blood pressure diary. - Participants who can become pregnant, or have a partner who can become pregnant, must practice an effective form of birth control. - After 12 cycles, participants will have 1-3 months of follow-up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study of the Anti-Programmed Death Ligand-1 Antibody MEDI4736 in Combination With Olaparib and/or Cediranib for Advanced Solid Tumors and Advanced or Recurrent Ovarian, Triple Negative Breast, Lung, Prostate and Colorectal Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: - Disruption of the immune checkpoint PD-1/PD-L1 pathway yielded clinical activity in subsets of advanced solid tumors, such as melanoma and lung cancer. - Olaparib (O), a PARP inhibitor (PARPi), has demonstrated single agent activity in recurrent ovarian cancer (OvCa), and subsets of prostate, triple negative breast or lung cancers. - Our recent randomized phase 2 study showed that O and cediranib (C), a VEGFR1-3 inhibitor was clinically superior to O alone in platinum-sensitive recurrent OvCa. - We hypothesize that increased DNA damage by PARP inhibition and/or reduced angiogenesis by VEGFR inhibition will complement the anti-tumor activity of an immune checkpoint inhibitor, MEDI4736, in recurrent OvCa and other solid tumors. Objectives: - Phase I: To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and the safety of doublet therapies of MEDI4736/olaparib (MEDI+O) and MEDI4736/cediranib (MEDI+C) and triplet therapy (MEDI+O+C) in patients with advanced solid tumors. - Phase II MEDI+O: To determine clinical efficacy as measured by overall response rate (ORR) in patients with recurrent OvCa, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), OR as measured by progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) - Phase II MEDI+C: To determine clinical efficacy as measured by ORR for patients with recurrent OvCa OR by PFS for patients with recurrent NSCLC and colorectal cancer (CRC). Eligibility: - Phase I: Advanced or recurrent solid tumors with evaluable disease. - Phase II MEDI+O: Advanced or recurrent OvCa (Cohort 1), NSCLC (Cohort 2), SCLC (Cohort 3), mCRPC (Cohort 4) and TNBC (Cohort 5) - Phase II MEDI+C: Advanced or recurrent OvCa (Cohort 1), NSCLC (Cohort 2), and CRC (Cohort 3) - Patients must be off prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy or biologic therapy for at least 3 weeks. mCPRC patients (MEDI+O, Cohort 4) may be on hormonal therapy with GnRH agonists/antagonists. - Adults with ECOG performance status 0-2, and adequate organ and marrow function. Design: - Phase I: MEDI+O, MEDI+C and MEDI+O+C will dose escalate simultaneously. MEDI4736 will be administered once every 2 weeks or once every 4 weeks until disease progression. O tablets and C will be given orally on a continuous or intermittent dosing schedule. The DLT period will be one cycle, 28 days. Patients on the 2-week schedule greater than one year will be changed to the 4-week schedule until progression. - MEDI+O: MEDI4736 (3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks, or a fixed dose of 1500 mg every 4 weeks) and O tablets (150 mg or 200 mg or 300 mg BID) - MEDI+C: MEDI4736 (3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks, or a fixed dose of 1500 mg every 4 weeks) and C (15 mg or 20 mg or 30 mg daily or 5 days/week) - MEDI+O+C: MEDI4736 (a fixed dose of 1500mg every 4 weeks) with O tablets (200 mg or 300 mg BID) and C (15 mg or 20 mg 5 days/week) - Phase II MEDI+O: Patients in the Cohorts 1-5 will be treated with MEDI+O at RP2D (O 300mg tablets bid daily and MEDI4736 at 1500mg IV every 4 weeks). - Phase II MEDI+C: Patients in the Cohorts 1-3 will be treated with MEDI+C at RP2D. (C 20mg once a day [5 days on/2 days off] and MEDI4736 at 1500 mg every 4 weeks). - Phase II Correlative studies: Research samples including whole blood, CTCs, cell free DNA and plasma will be obtained at pretreatment, prior to cycle 1 day 15, prior to cycle 3 day 1 and at progression. Mandatory baseline core biopsy and two optional biopsies will be obtained. - Patients will be evaluated for toxicity every 4 weeks by CTCAEv4.0, and for response every two cycles (8 weeks) by RECIST 1.1. Patients with mCRPC (MEDI+O Cohort 4) will be evaluated for response initially at 8 weeks then every 12 weeks using RECIST v1.1 criteria as per the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2).</detailed_description>
