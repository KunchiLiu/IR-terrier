	<brief_title>Evaluation of Intestinal Permeability, Expression of Genes of Epithelial Integrity in the Duodenal Wall, Serum Inflammatory Cytokines, and Lipopolysaccharide in Cirrhotic Patients Before and After Treatment With Non-selective Beta Blocker (Propranolol)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is evidence that the non-selective beta-blocker (NSBB) propranolol reduces intestinal permeability and decreases bacterial translocation in cirrhotic patients, independent of hemodynamic effects on portal pressure. The mechanism by which this decrease in intestinal permeability and bacterial translocation occurs has not been established. Among the proposed mechanisms are: modification of splanchnic hemodynamics, increased gastrointestinal motility, and immunological properties of nonselective beta blockade. It is not known, however, if beta-blocker treatment decreases intestinal permeability by altering the expression of genes encoding intercellular junction proteins. This study seeks to investigate this question to improve understanding of the mechanism by which beta-blockers work in primary and secondary prophylaxis of variceal hemorrhage.</detailed_description>
