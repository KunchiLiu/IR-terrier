	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with and without augmentation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Mesenchymal stem cells promote tissue regeneration by differentiating into adult cell lines and by supplying growth factors to their implanted environment. They have been shown to be effective in improving both overall healing and tendon integrity in rotator cuff repair. This study will follow 100 patients in the United States and track their clinical outcomes for at least one year post-operatively.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rotator cuff repair is one of the most commonly performed arthroscopic procedures in the United States, but re-tear remains a common long-term complication. This can lead to pain, decreased shoulder function, and the need for corrective surgery. Mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to improve healing rates in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, primarily due to their retained ability to differentiate into several different adult cell lines, such as tenocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts. MSCs further enhance the healing process by releasing growth factors into the local environment to promote tissue regeneration. While MSC augmentation of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair has led to higher rates of healing and improved tendon integrity, there remains a paucity of data surrounding clinical improvement after the procedure. Outcomes such as post-operative strength, range of motion, and shoulder function have yet to be compared with standard rotator cuff repair. The incidence of post-operative persistent structural defects in the tendon after MSC augmentation must also be further elucidated.</detailed_description>
