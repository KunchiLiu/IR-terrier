	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, and safety of rVIIa-FP (CSL689). The study will enroll a total of 54 male subjects, 12 to 65 years of age, with hemophilia types A or B who have developed inhibitors to FVIII or FIX. The study consists of 3 sequential parts (Parts 1, 2, 3): The purpose of Part 1 (PK part) is to evaluate the PK of a single treatment of CSL689 (low dose or high dose) and compare with the PK of a single treatment of Eptacog alfa (low dose or high dose). In Part 1, CSL689 and Eptacog alfa will be given by the doctor at the study center. The purpose of Part 2 (Dose-evaluation part) is to identify which of the 2 tested dose levels of CSL689 shows the best efficacy and safety in stopping acute bleeding events (this dose will be called the "population best dose"). The purpose of the final Part 3 (Repeated-dose part) is to confirm the efficacy and safety of the "population best dose" identified in Part 2. In Parts 2 and 3, subjects will self-administer a specified number of CSL689 infusions at home on-demand (ie, when a bleeding event occurs), will keep an electronic diary, and will visit the center at monthly intervals. This study is expected to last for up to 16 months for the subjects participating in all 3 parts, and up to 9 months for the subjects participating in Part 3 only.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male subjects with hemophilia A or B and inhibitors. Age ≥ 12 and ≤ 65 years. High responding inhibitor with documented historical inhibitor titer &gt; 5 Bethesda Units/mL. Congenital or acquired coagulation disorders other than hemophilia A or B. Ongoing immune tolerance induction therapy or planned during study.
