	<brief_summary>Fifty healthy, young participants (10 male, 40 female) completed two 3-hour study sessions that were at least five days apart. The first session was a baseline. The sleep intervention took place on the night prior to Session 2, where the amount of time in bed was manipulated to be 60-130% of the individual's habitual sleep time. Within both sessions, subjective (Stanford Sleepiness Scale, SSS) and objective (Psychomotor Vigilance Test, PVT) alertness were measured. During the middle of each session, a 40-minute ad libitum meal opportunity allowed participants to eat from eight different food items. Food healthfulness, caloric density, distribution and number of calories were measured and compared to alertness levels.</brief_summary>
