	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that an anesthetic protocol maintaining deep neuromuscular block throughout the entire surgical procedure followed by sugammadex reversal, would suppress EMG activity and result in improved anesthetic stability by reducing the variability of the Bispectral Index of the EEG, and be beneficial by reducing the total doses of the anesthetic drugs propofol and remifentanil required to maintain an adequate level of anesthesia (BIS between 40 and 60).</brief_summary>
