	<brief_summary>This pilot phase II trial studies how well CPI-613 (6,8-bis[benzylthio]octanoic acid), cytarabine, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride work in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia or granulocytic sarcoma (a malignant, green-colored tumor of myeloid cells [a type of immature white blood cell]) that has returned (relapsed) or that does not respond to treatment (refractory). 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid is thought to kill cancer cells by turning off their mitochondria. Mitochondria are used by cancer cells to produce energy and are the building blocks needed to make more cancer cells. By shutting off these mitochondria, 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid deprives the cancer cells of energy and other supplies that they need to survive and grow in the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine and mitoxantrone hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid together with cytarabine and mitoxantrone hydrochloride may kill more cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CIP-613, Cytarabine, and Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Granulocytic Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the feasibility of CPI-613 when administered with high dose cytarabine, and mitoxantrone (mitoxantrone hydrochloride) in all three phases of salvage therapy (induction, consolidation and maintenance). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To observe the response rate (complete remission [CR], and CR with incomplete recovery [CRi]) of CPI-613 in combination with high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone. II. To observe the overall survival of patients treated with CPI-613 in combination with high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone in induction, consolidation and maintenance. III. To monitor toxicities experienced by patients treated with CPI-613 in combination with high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone in induction, consolidation and maintenance. OUTLINE: SALVAGE INDUCTION COURSE 1: Patients receive 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1-5, cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours starting on day 3 for 5 doses, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes after the first, third, and fifth doses of cytarabine. SALVAGE INDUCTION COURSE 2 (OPTIONAL, AT DISCRETION OF TREATING PHYSICIAN): Patients receive 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride as in course 1 or an abbreviated second course at the discretion of the treating physician. In the abbreviated course, patients receive 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid IV over 2 hours on days 1-3, cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours starting on day 2 for 3 doses, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes after the first and third cytarabine doses. SALVAGE CONSOLIDATION: Patients achieving response receive up to 2 courses of the abbreviated course of 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid, high dose cytarabine, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride. Patients achieving response may undergo stem cell transplant at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients may proceed to maintenance after 1, 2 or no courses of consolidation at the discretion of the treating physician. MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients achieving response receive 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid IV over 2 hours on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.</detailed_description>
