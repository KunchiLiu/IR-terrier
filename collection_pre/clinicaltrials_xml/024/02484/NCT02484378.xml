	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of ten intravenous infusions of 3 mg/kg CER 001 vs. placebo, given at weekly intervals for ten weeks, on atherosclerotic plaque volume as measured by coronary IVUS, when administered to subjects presenting with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) with significant plaque volume.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CER-001 Atherosclerosis Regression ACS Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be required to have at least one epicardial coronary artery suitable for IVUS imaging. A suitable target artery for IVUS imaging will be determined at baseline as having stenosis of up to 50% and meeting all angiographic inclusion criteria. Subjects having met all eligibility criteria will be randomized to receive an intravenous infusion of CER 001 (3 mg/kg) or placebo within 14 days of event presentation. Randomized subjects will then return at 7 day intervals for nine additional infusions. A follow up IVUS will be conducted at 14 days after the last infusion. The total study duration from randomization to follow up IVUS for a completed study can range from approximately 9 to 12 weeks.</detailed_description>
