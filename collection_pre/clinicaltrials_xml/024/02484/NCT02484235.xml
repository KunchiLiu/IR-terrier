	<brief_summary>Obesity is a global health problem since it is associated with many cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, osteoarticular problems and some cancers. That is why it is a priority of the national health policies. Exercise is a mainstay in the treatment, but still the most effective method is sought. The resistance exercise and high intensity intervals (HIIT) have been shown to positively affect the outcome of the disease, increasing the oxidative capacity of the trained subjects. Therefore it is important to look if both together produce greater benefits or otherwise nullify its effects, such as suggested by recent publications in relation to the cellular response to different stimuli such exercise in skeletal muscle. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions exercise high intensity intervals, overload and combining them in the oxidative capacity of obese subjects.</brief_summary>
