	<brief_summary>Currently, there is little recent data on regional variations in treatment methods, neonatal units that provide retinopathy (ROP) treatment, facilities for treatment available at each unit including anaesthetic support for such preterm babies, facilities to transfer babies to units that offer treatment etc. While some parts of the UK have established neonatal networks and agreements among units for ROP treatment, in other parts, such arrangements are illdefined. The number of babies needing ROP treatment may be higher since the introduction of revised guidelines in 2008 as earlier treatment has been shown to be beneficial. Collecting epidemiological data through the British Ophthalmic Surveillance Unit (BOSU) on the incidence of treatable ROP, the treatment methods used and facilities for treatment will provide the foundation for effective planning of resources and manpower to deal with the additional demand.</brief_summary>
