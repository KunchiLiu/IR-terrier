	<brief_title>A Gene Therapy Study for Hemophilia B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemophilia B, or Christmas disease, is a genetic bleeding disorder resulting in the lack of ability to produce blood-clotting factor IX (FIX). Individuals with hemophilia B suffer repeated bleeding events, which can cause chronic joint disease and sometimes leads to death due to the inability for blood to clot efficiently. This chronic joint disease can have significant physical, psychosocial, and quality-of-life effects, including financial burden. The current treatment is intravenous infusion of FIX protein products, either prophylactically or in response to bleeding. The approach being tested in this study uses a novel recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV), which in nature causes no disease, to deliver the human factor IX (hFIX) gene to the liver cells where FIX is normally made. Recent data of a gene therapy study showed preliminary encouraging results with the approach of using an AAV vector carrying the factor IX gene. This study will seek to determine the safety and kinetics of a single IV infusion of SPK-9001 (a novel AAV vector carrying a high specific activity factor IX variant).</detailed_description>
