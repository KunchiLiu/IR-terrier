	<brief_summary>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neuromuscular disease that results in rapid decline in normal muscle function and tone leading to difficulties with mobility, eating, drinking, breathing, sleeping, and communicating. The disease is progressive and no cure currently exists. Most people diagnosed with ALS succumb within 3 to 5 years. The only approved treatment to slow the progression of ALS is called RilutekÂ® (riluzole) which has only a modest effect and has been shown to increase survival by a few months. Muscular dysfunction present in people with ALS is caused by nerve breakdown and a dysfunction in the communication between the muscles and the nerves. The area where these communications occur is called the neuromuscular junction. Some recent studies have focused on using different medications to enhance communication at the neuromuscular junction with the goal of improving muscle function as a result. This approach is unproven but may help to slow the progression of the disease. Pimozide is a medication that has been demonstrated to enhance communication at the neuromuscular junction in fish and mice. This study will look at whether Pimozide may help to slow the progression of ALS and how much medication needs to be taken to have an effect.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Registry-Based Clinical Trial of Pimozide in Patients With Neuromuscular Junction Transmission Dysfunction Due to ALS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial has two components: an acute therapy component consisting of a Phase II placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized-controlled pilot study of pimozide for the treatment of ALS; and a second component featuring a longitudinal follow-up study on ALS progression and outcomes. This clinical trial is registry-based including subject recruitment facilitated by the Canadian Neuromuscular Disease Registry (CNDR; National Principal Investigator: L. Korngut), and longitudinal follow-up data collection will occur during the second component of this clinical trial through the CNDR. The acute therapy study duration for each subject is around 11 weeks. The follow up study duration through the CNDR is up to 5 years. Number of study participants:25 Randomization: Subjects will be block randomized with a block size of five subjects. Within each block one subject will be randomly assigned to placebo with the remaining four subjects randomized to the treatment groups. Study physicians will be blinded to patient randomization status. Randomization will occur with a 4:1 ratio of study drug (20 subjects) to placebo (5 subjects). After administration of maximum dose for 45-50 days, subjects will taper the allocated treatment or placebo. Randomization will occur via permuted block randomization and study personnel will be blinded to the randomization at all times allowing full concealment.</detailed_description>
