	<brief_title>Dyphenhidramine Effect on Prevention of Sevoflurane Induced Post Anesthesia Agitation in Pediatric</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an experimental clinical trial in double-blinded randomized controlled design on 50 children aged 10 months to 21 months who underwent general anesthesia with sevoflurane for labioplasty surgery. Fifteen minutes before inhalation anesthetics were discontinued, the subjects were randomly given a placebo or a single dose of diphenhydramine 0, 5 mg / kg intravenously. Subjects were extubated and observed in the recovered space conscious for any agitation or emergence delirium and feasability to return to the ward. Agitation or emergence delirium was assessed by the Pediatric Emergence Agitation and Delirium Score (PAEDS) whereas feasability to return to the ward scored with the Steward score. When PAEDS&gt; 10 patients were assessed to be agitated or having emergence delirium and administeres rescue tranquilizer ketamine 0.1 mg / kg. Total rescue tranquilizers and clinically significant adverse effects of drugs also recorded.</detailed_description>
