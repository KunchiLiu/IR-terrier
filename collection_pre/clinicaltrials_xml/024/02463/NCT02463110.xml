	<brief_summary>Primary purpose: To evaluate the evolution in time of the antiaggregant platelet effect of sertraline (SSRI) compared to placebo in depressive patients with ACS (Acute Coronary Syndrome) and treated as recommended by a double antiplatelet therapy, aspirin and clopidogrel. Hypothesis: The benefits of SSRIs observed in depressive patients with ACS are related to an antiplatelet effect.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute Myocardial Necrosis and Depression: Antiplatelet Effect of Reuptake Inhibition of Serotonin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rational: 40% of patients hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) present depressive symptoms. The increase in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality at 6 months (hazard ratio = 3.5) could partly be explained by an alteration of the platelet parameters in patients with depression. Sertraline is a potent inhibitor of the selective serotonin reuptake (SSRI). At the platelet level, it decreases the secretion induced by collagen and causes the inhibition of serotonin reuptake and platelet activation, wider than the simple anti-serotonergic effect. Its efficacy on depression of patients with ACS has been demonstrated (-20% of ischemic events at 24 weeks vs placebo), partly independent of the correction of depressive symptoms, and with a wide safety action. Antiplatelet, anti-inflammatory and endothelial function effects of sertraline are demonstrated in healthy volunteers, in stable patients and in patients with heart failure, but have never been explored in ACS . Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial comparing SSRI and placebo in depressive patients with ACS. A control (non depressive) ACS group will also do the clinical and laboratory follow-up at the same time (without drug administration), to constitute a reference for platelet parameters and to allow a comparison with the depressive ACS group treated with placebo. Randomization and initiation of the treatment at the end of the hospitalization for ACS (possibly after reperfusion and stabilization of cardiac medication)</detailed_description>
