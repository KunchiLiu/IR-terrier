	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if splenomegaly on point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is an accurate and user-friendly surrogate to the heterophile antibody test and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) serologies to diagnose acute mononucleosis infection in patients presenting with sore throat to the Emergency Department (ED).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use of Point-of-Care Ultrasound in the Diagnosis of Acute Infectious Mononucleosis in the Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators seek to determine whether the presence of splenomegaly on POCUS can accurately diagnose acute infectious mononucleosis in symptomatic ED patients, and determine the feasibility of performing point-of-care ultrasound for splenomegaly by emergency physicians in the emergency department setting.</detailed_description>
