	<brief_summary>Participants will be initially assessed for their suitability for inclusion in the study and will undergo a physical screening of the affected shoulder and cervical spine by an experienced physiotherapist. After, participants will be attended 72 hours after data recording of the baseline measures (range of motion with a goniometer, pressure pain threshold with a algometer, and peak force with a dynamometer) for four sessions per week with 24 hours of interval between sessions. At each experimental week session, each participant will receive one of the two treatment conditions (MWM or sham) and then will repeats the assessment. In the following week, there will be a crossover condition of each individual and 24 hours after the last treatment session, the examiner will do the last assessment.</brief_summary>
