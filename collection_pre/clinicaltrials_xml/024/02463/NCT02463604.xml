	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the efficacy of remote ischemic preconditioning on preventing contrast medium-induced nephropathy in a population of high risk patients undergoing coronary angiography. Half of participants will receive a preconditioning procedure while the other half will receive a sham procedure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Renal PRotection Against Contrast mEdium-induced nephroPathy in High Risk Patients undErgoing Coronary Angiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Contrast medium-induced nephropathy has a big impact on clinical outcomes in patients suffering from renal insufficiency who undergo percutaneous coronary interventions. Remote ischemic preconditioning is proved to protect myocardium in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary angiography. We will evaluate the effect of remote preconditioning on renal protection.</detailed_description>
