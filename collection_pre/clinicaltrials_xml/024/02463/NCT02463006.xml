	<brief_summary>Till date, no study has been reported in the literature where porous bioactive glass was used for the management of periodontal osseous defects. In this context, the present study is designed to assess the efficacy of the porous variant of bioactive glass and compare with that of nonporous variant using cone beam computed tomography.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Porous and Non-porous Bone Grafts in Intra-bony Periodontal Defects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: 1. To evaluate clinically the periodontal healing with Porous variant of Bioactive Glass placed in the intra bony defects at an interval of 6 months. 2. To evaluate clinically the periodontal healing with Non Porous variant of Bioactive Glass placed in the intra bony defects at an interval of 6 months. 3. To evaluate the radiographic changes in the intra bony defect grafted with Porous variant of Bioactive Glass at baseline and an interval of 6 months. 4. To evaluate the radiographic changes in the intra bony defect grafted with Non Porous variant of Bioactive Glass at baseline and an interval of 6 months. 5. To compare clinically soft tissue healing for sites grafted with Porous variant of Bioactive Glass and sites grafted with Non Porous variant of Bioactive Glass in the treatment of periodontal intra bony defects at an interval of 6 months. 6. To compare the radiographic changes for sites grafted with Porous variant and sites grafted with Non Porous of Bioactive Glass in the treatment of periodontal intra bony defects at an interval of 6 months.</detailed_description>
