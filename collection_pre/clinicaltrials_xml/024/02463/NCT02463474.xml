	<brief_title>Mobile Health (mHealth) Black Women With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Though Black women have a lower breast cancer rate than White women, Black women have the poorest outcomes of all races and ethnicities. Low cancer knowledge and mistrust of the healthcare system have been shown to lead to poorer outcomes following breast cancer diagnosis. Participants are asked to be in this research study if they are a woman age 21 years or older who identifies as Black/ African American and has been diagnosed with breast cancer within the past 6 months. First, participants will come to a pre-intervention study appointment and will be asked to complete several questionnaires. The questionnaires will ask about breast cancer knowledge, quality of life, and their relationship with their doctor. Participants will then opt-in to the study by sending a text message to the study. For the next ten ten weeks, participants will receive a text message with a link to one video clip per week. Each video is 15-20 minutes long and contains information about breast cancer. Participants will also receive one supportive text message per week for ten weeks. At the end of the ten weeks, participants will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment. Participants will again be asked questions about breast cancer knowledge, quality of life, and their relationship with their doctor. Participants will also be asked what was helpful and not helpful about the videos.</detailed_description>
