	<brief_title>Early Feasibility Study of Zone-MPC and HMS With DiAs in the Outpatient Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a feasibility study of an artificial pancreas (AP) system with our previously validated Zone-MPC and Health Monitoring System (HMS) algorithms (ClinicalTraisl.gov: NCT01929798) integrated into the Diabetes Assistant (DiAs) system. The system will be evaluated on 2-3 subjects per site (n=6-9 subjects) for 2 weeks at 3 different sites (William Sansum Diabetes Center, University of Virginia, and Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). Basal rates will be adjusted in a run-to-run manner by study physicians prior to the closed-loop phase for a maximum of 3 weeks. Subjects will then complete 2 weeks at home use of the Zone-MPC/HMS system using the DIAs platform for a closed-loop feasibility trial. The purpose of this pilot study is to establish that safe day-and-night use of the Zone-MPC/HMS system integrated into the DiAs is achievable in the home environment, to analyze and learn to improve upon the run-to- run optimization process, and to collect efficacy data to inform a future larger study.</detailed_description>
