	<brief_title>Autologous Muscle Derived Cells for Underactive Bladder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subject that meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be consented and enrolled in this study. Initial screening includes blood and urine testing, questionnaires, physical examination, specialized bladder function testing and review of medical history. At the next visit a small sample of each subject's own thigh muscle is obtained by needle biopsy. This cell biopsy is sent to a specialized lab for growth and processing. Approximately ten weeks later the frozen cells will be sent back to the treatment site for thawing, diluting and injection under lighted instrumentation into the subject's bladder wall. The subject will be followed for 6 months and at that time may be eligible for a second injection of cells. The study doctor will determine if the second injection may be beneficial to the subject. All subjects will be followed for up to 24 months. The long term follow-up assessments at 12, 18 and 24 months will include questionnaires, urine and blood testing, specialized bladder function testing and visualizing the inside of the bladder with a lighted instrument (at the 12 month assessment only).</detailed_description>
