	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the gene expression and activity of SIRT1, and forkhead box O3 pathway by means of investigating target genes MnSOD and catalase in multiple sclerosis and healthy subjects. Also, we investigate the effect of melatonin on interaction between SIRT1 activity and target genes MnSOD and catalase in multiple sclerosis and healthy subject .Additionally, we evaluate effect the probable effect of melatonin treatment on gene expression and activity of above-mentioned genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy subjects-treated with H2O2.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>patients with relapsingremitting multiple sclerosis. The diagnosis of MS was based on the McDonald criteria . All patients were newly diagnosed cases with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score â‰¤ 6 and had never received immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive drugs. The exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) treated with antioxidant supplements, antiinflammatory drugs, and vitamins in the previous 6 months; 2) had a history of acute or chronic infection, malignancy, diabetes (type I and II), and any clinically significant systemic disease; 3) was currently pregnant or lactating; 4) was currently smoking; 5) used contraceptive medication during the previous 6 months.</criteria>
