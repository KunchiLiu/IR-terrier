	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and antiviral activity of an antibody (called VRC01) in HIV-infected adults whose HIV is well-controlled with HIV medicines. The study will examine whether VRC01 controls or delays the return of HIV viremia when the participants' HIV medicines are briefly stopped during the study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Antiviral Activity of a Human Monoclonal Antibody (VRC01) in HIV-Infected Adults Undergoing a Brief Treatment Interruption</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and antiviral activity of a human monoclonal antibody, VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB (known as VRC01), in HIV-infected adults whose HIV is well-controlled with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The study will examine whether VRC01 delays or prevents the return of HIV viremia in participants who are undergoing a brief analytical treatment interruption (ATI). The study will enroll HIV-infected participants 18 years and older who are on ART. (ART will not be provided by the study). At a pre-entry study visit, participants will undergo blood collection, a leukapheresis procedure, and a rectal biopsy. The study will last about 34 weeks and proceed in three stages: Step 1 (approximately 9 weeks), Step 2 (approximately 12 weeks), and Step 3 (approximately 13 weeks). During Step 1, participants will receive three doses of VRC01 via intravenous (IV) infusion. The first dose of VRC01 will be given on day 0. Seven days after receiving this first dose of VRC01, participants will discontinue ART. Participants will receive the second and third doses of VRC01 at days 21 and 42, respectively. For 7 days after each VRC01 IV infusion, participants will monitor and record their temperature and any symptoms. In addition to the 3 injection study visits, participants will attend weekly visits from day 7 through approximately day 63 (week 9). Participants will enter Step 2 of the study and resume ART when they have a confirmed return of HIV-1 viremia or a confirmed CD4+ T-cell count of less than 350 cells/μL. Step 2 study visits will occur on the day ART is resumed (Step 2, week 1) and every four weeks thereafter (approximately at Step 2, weeks 4, 8, and 12) until a participant's HIV viral load decreases to less than 50 copies/mL. Throughout the study, visits will include clinical assessments and blood collection. Some blood will be stored for future testing. Some study visits will include the collection of oral, rectal, and (for women) cervical secretion samples. On day 63, participants will undergo another leukapheresis procedure and a rectal biopsy. Participants who have completed Step 2 may optionally enter Step 3 for additional testing. Entry into Step 3 will occur at least 3 months after the participant has completed Step 2. Step 3 participants will have additional study visits for a leukapheresis procedure, a rectal biopsy, and clinical follow up.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Step 1 HIV1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV1 antigen, plasma HIV1 RNA viral load (VL). More information on this criterion can be found in the protocol. Ability and willingness of participant or legal representative to provide informed consent Men and women greater than or equal to 18 years old Clinically stable on their first or second ART regimen that includes a boosted protease inhibitor or an integrase inhibitor. The current regimen should be stable for 8 weeks at the time of entry. Changes while the patient HIV viral load is undetectable does not count toward the number of ART regimens used, (for example an individual switching from a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)based regimen to an integrase inhibitor based regimen while the HIV viral load is undetectable will still be in their first regimen). HIV1 RNA that is less than 50 copies/mL using a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved assay performed by any laboratory that has a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification or its equivalent within 45 days prior to study entry HIV1 RNA less than 50 copies/mL using a FDAapproved assay for at least 24 weeks prior to study entry performed by any laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent. More information on this criterion can be found in the protocol. Screening CD4+ Tcell count greater than or equal to 450 cells/μL within 45 days prior to study entry Nadir CD4+ Tcell count greater than 200 cells/μL Willingness to have blood samples collected, stored indefinitely, and used for studyrelated research purposes The following laboratory values obtained within 45 days prior to enrollment: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1000 cells/mm^3 Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 12.0 g/dL for men and greater than or equal to 11.0 g/dL for women Platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm^3 Creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min estimated by the CockcroftGault equation. More information on this criterion can be found in the protocol. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than or equal to 2.0 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) At least eight participants will have availability of plasma or serum specimen before the initiation of ART either in the Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) repository of the University of Pennsylvania, University of Alabama, or in the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) central repository For females of reproductive potential (i.e., women who have not been postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months; who have had menses within the preceding 24 months; or women who have not undergone surgical sterilization, specifically hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy), negative urine pregnancy test (with a sensitivity of 15 to 25 mIU/mL) within 48 hours prior to screening and entry. More information on this criterion can be found in the protocol. Contraceptive methods will be required for female participants of reproductive potential. Female participants of reproductive potential and their male partners MUST appropriately use at least two contraceptives, with one method being highly effective and the other method being either highly effective or less effective.

Contraceptive methods will be required for female partners of reproductive potential of male study participants on study drug. Female partners of reproductive potential of male study participants and/or their male partners MUST appropriately use at least two contraceptives, with one method being highly effective and the other method being either highly effective or less effective.
