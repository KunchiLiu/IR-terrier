	<brief_summary>Descriptive study of the residual anti-pneumococcal immunity in patients with Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) who have previously gone through pneumococcal immunization.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Residual Anti-pneumococcal Immunity After Pneumococcal Immunization in ANCA-associated Vasculitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine, through serotype-specific enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and opsonophagocytosis (OPA) titres whether AAV patients who have gone through pneumococcal vaccination are protected against invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD).</detailed_description>
