	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies the effect of radium-223 when added to sipuleucel-T for treating castrate-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to the bone. Sipuleucel-T is an autologous cellular immunotherapy designed to stimulate an immune response against prostate cancer. It has been suggested that the immune response may be strengthened by radiation therapy. Therefore this study is testing whether radium-223 added to sipuleucel-T increases the immune response and anti-tumor effect against prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ph 2 Study of Sipuleucel-T W/ or W/O Radium-223 in Men With Asymptomatic or Minimally Symptomatic Bone-MCRPC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized study designed to assess the antigen-specific immune response of sipuleucel-T with or without radium-223. Eligible subjects will be registered and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive sipuleucel-T and radium-223 or sipuleucel-T alone. Subjects in both arms (sipuleucel-T and radium) will undergo a standard 1.5 to 2.0 blood volume leukapheresis, followed approximately 3 days later by an IV infusion of sipuleucel-T. This process will occur a total of 3 times at approximately 2-week intervals. Subjects in Arm 1 will receive a total of 6 infusions of radium-223 at IV dose of 50 kBq/kg at 4-week interval. All participants are allowed to receive the best supportive care which includes secondary hormonal manipulation as required. No chemotherapy, external-beam radiation, or other radionuclides are allowed while on active treatment but are permitted after completion of active treatment. Glucocorticoid-containing treatments should be minimized to less than the equivalent dose of prednisone 10mg daily if feasible for the 3 months following sipuleucel-T therapy. All patients continue medical or surgical castration during treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Written informed consent provided prior to initiation of study procedures 2. Age ≥ 18 years 3. Histologically documented adenocarcinoma prostate cancer confirmed by a pathology report from prostate biopsy or a radical prostatectomy specimen. If prostatic tumor is of mixed histology, &gt; 50% of the tumor must be adenocarcinoma 4. Bone metastases as manifested by one or more lesions on a bone scan performed within 2 months of screening 5. Castrateresistant prostate cancer, in the setting of castrate levels of testosterone (≤ 50 ng/dL), defined as current or historical evidence of disease progression concomitant with surgical castration or androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), as demonstrated by two consecutive rises in PSA OR new lesions on bone scan: PSA progression will be defined as 2 rising PSA values compared to a reference value, measured at least 7 days apart and the second value is ≥ 2 ng/mL [1]. It must be documented within 2 months of screening. Appearance of one or more new areas of abnormal uptake on bone scan when compared to imaging studies acquired during castration therapy or against the precastration studies if there was no response. Increased uptake of preexisting lesions on bone scan does not constitute progression. It must be documented within 4 months of screening 6. Serum PSA ≥ 2.0 ng/mL 7. Screening ECOG perf status ≤ 1 8. Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic disease (no narcotic analgesic; other analgesics use is allowed) 9. Prior abiraterone and enzalutamide are permitted, but not required 10. Concurrent osteoclastinhibitory therapies (zoledronic acid, denosumab) are permitted if patients have been on a stable dose for at least 1 month 11. Adequate screening hematologic, renal, and liver function as evidenced by laboratory test results within the following ranges ≤ 28 days prior to registration: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x109/L Platelet count ≥ 100 x109/L Hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL Total bilirubin level ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Albumin &gt; 25 g/L 1. The presence of known lung or liver metastases greater than 1.0 cm in the long axis diameter 2. The presence of lymphadenopathy greater than 3 cm in the shortaxis diameter 3. The presence of known brain metastases 4. Spinal cord compression, imminent long bone fracture, or any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to require radiation therapy and/or steroids for pain control during the active phase 5. Previous treatment with chemotherapy for mCRPC (adjuvant chemotherapy is permitted), or chemotherapy for any reason within 2 years prior to registration 6. Intention to receive chemotherapy within 6 months after enrollment in protocol therapy 7. History of radiation therapy, either via external beam or brachytherapy within 28 days prior to registration 8. Systemic radiotherapy with strontium89, samarium153, rhenium186 or rhenium188 for the treatment of bony metastases within previous 24 weeks 9. Prior history of other cancers (except nonmelanoma skin cancers or lowgrade lowstage urothelial cancers) 10. Use of prednisone or equivalent systemic corticosteroid within 2 weeks of treatment. Use of inhaled, intranasal, intraarticular, and topical steroids is allowed. Oral or IV steroids to prevent or treat IV contrast reactions are allowed 11. Use of opioid analgesics for cancerrelated pain 12. Use of experimental drug within 4 weeks of treatment 13. Uncontrolled medical conditions including diabetes, heart failure, COPD, ulcerative colitis, or Crohn's disease 14. Uncontrolled fecal incontinence 15. Any medical intervention, any other condition, or any other circumstance which, in the opinion of the investigator, could compromise adherence with study requirements or otherwise compromise the study's objectives</criteria>
