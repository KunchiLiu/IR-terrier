	<brief_summary>Sleep apnoea affects more than 20% of people over 65 years and is largely underdiagnosed. It does multiply tenfold the occurrence of vascular events, particularly stroke. While Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is currently the Gold standard treatment to prevent cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events, with a major clinical benefit, long term adherence to CPAP is a significant problem and search for alternative treatment is essential. The investigators hypothesize that long-term exercise training would allow to reduce significantly sleep apnoea syndrome severity. Thus, in this study, the investigators will compare evolution of Apnoea Hypopnea Index (AHI) in an exercise trained group performed through in a national based non-profit organization (Fédération Française d'éducation Physique et de Gymnastique Volontaire (FFEPGV)) using a medical established program (NeuroGyV) during nine months against a control group receiving only standard dietetic and physical activity counseling.</brief_summary>
