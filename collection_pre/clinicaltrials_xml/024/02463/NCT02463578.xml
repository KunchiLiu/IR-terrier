	<brief_summary>Exploratory study of anti-pneumococcal immune response in patients with Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) immunized according to new vaccine recommendations (i.e. with a combined vaccine schedule (13-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine -PCV13- followed by a 23-valent non-conjugate pneumococcal vaccine -PPV23- 8 weeks later).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunogenicity of a Combined Anti-pneumococcal Vaccine Schedule in Patients With ANCA-associated Vasculitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine whether this vaccination schedule induces sufficient protective immunity (serotype-specific enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and opsonophagocytosis (OPA) response rates) in AAV-patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy.</detailed_description>
