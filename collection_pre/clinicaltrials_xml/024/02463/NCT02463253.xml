	<brief_summary>This is a single-center, prospective, non-randomized, observational study to evaluate specific proteogenomic biomarker panels for acute rejection (AR) and chronic allograft nephropathy/interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (CAN/IFTA) in blood, urine and kidney tissue (biopsy) in kidney transplant recipients. Proteogenomic profiles will be routinely monitored over one year after enrollment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this phase of the study is to allow the clinical site to gain familiarity with patient recruitment, sample and data collection, and interpretation of the proteogenomic biomarker report provided, through retrospective analysis. This phase of the study will provide a platform for the transplant physicians to gain confidence with the format, logistics, and potential use of the biomarker tests on blood and tissue.</detailed_description>
