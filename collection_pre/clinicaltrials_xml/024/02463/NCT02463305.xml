	<brief_summary>This study plans to learn more about the effects that creatine monohydrate has on disease activity in ulcerative colitis. Creatine is a substance that is naturally produced by the body and is found in foods, such as meat and fish. Creatine helps to provide energy to some body tissues, such as the colon. In the colon, this energy allows cells to form a tight barrier between molecules in digested food and bacteria and the body's infection-fighting cells within the colon underneath this barrier. If the barrier becomes "leaky" molecules may pass through and lead to inflammation. This "leakiness" may contribute to the colon inflammation seen in ulcerative colitis.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female patients aged 1870 years old with mild to moderatelyactive UC that extends at least 15 cm proximal to the anal verge (i.e. not proctitis) as defined by a Mayo Score of 310, with an endoscopic subscore ≥ 1. Allowed concomitant medications will include mesalamine compounds if used for at least 8 weeks and at a stable dose for at least 4 weeks, as well as thiopurines (azathioprine, 6mercaptopurine) if used at a stable dose for at least 3 months. Abnormal baseline laboratory tests: Albumin &lt; 3.0 g/dL ALT, AST, total bilirubin, or alkaline phosphatase &gt; 1.5 x ULN Potassium &lt; 3.0 mmol/L or &gt; 5.5 mmol/L Creatinine or cystatin C &gt; ULN WBC ≤ 3000 Platelets ≤ 105 Hemoglobin ≤ 10g/dL Positive stool test for Clostridium difficile, ova and parasites, or routine stool culture Pregnancy (as confirmed by urine pregnancy test at study outset), stated desire to become pregnant during the study period, or refusal/inability to use effective methods of contraception during the study period. Concomitant major comorbidities (renal, hepatic, cardiac, pulmonary or malignancy) to include any medical conditions requiring therapeutic anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy. Diagnosis of severe UC (Mayo Score &gt; 10) Evidence or history of toxic megacolon Patients who received antiTNF agents within 3 months of screening, or who used oral or rectal corticosteroids within 4 weeks of screening will be excluded. Use of overthecounter herbal or dietary supplements (excluding vitamin and minerals) two weeks prior to or during the study period. Use of known nephrotoxic medications (including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cyclosporin A, tacrolimus, aminoglycoside antibiotics, diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers) 2 weeks prior to or during the study period Prior surgical bowel resections (excluding appendectomy) Local or systemic complications or other pathological states requiring therapy with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents.</criteria>
