	<criteria>1. History of symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation defined as: Selfterminating AF with episodes lasting no more than seven consecutive days before spontaneous conversion back to sinus rhythm Documentation of one or more events with PAF tracings by ECG, event recordings, pacemaker strips or monitor rhythm strips within the past year AF symptoms defined as the manifestation of any of the following: Palpitations Fatigue Exertional dyspnea Effort intolerance 2. Age between 18 and 70 Willingness, ability and commitment to participate in baseline and followup evaluations for the full length of the study 1. Structural heart disease of clinical significance including: Previous cardiac surgery (excluding CABG) Symptoms of congestive heart failure including, but not limited to, NYHA Class III or IV CHF and/or documented ejection fraction &lt; 40% measured by acceptable cardiac testing Left atrial diameter of &gt; 45mm as measured in the parasternal long axis on transthoracic echocardiogram LA volume&gt;40 ml/m2 Stable/unstable angina or ongoing myocardial ischemia Myocardial infarction (MI) within three months of enrollment Aortic or mitral valve disease &gt; Grade II Congenital heart disease (not including ASD or PFO without a right to left shunt) where the underlying abnormality increases the risk of an ablative procedure Prior ASD or PFO closure with a device using a percutaneous approach Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (LV wall thickness &gt; 1.5 cm) Pulmonary hypertension (mean or systolic PA pressure &gt;50mm Hg on Doppler echo 2. Prior ablation for arrhythmias other than AF within the past three months 3. Prior left sided AF ablation 4. Enrollment in any other ongoing arrhythmia study protocol Any ventricular tachyarrhythmias currently being treated where the arrhythmia or the management may interfere with this study</criteria>
