	<brief_summary>Estimation of energy requirements is essential for adequate nutritional support in ICU. Indirect calorimetry being the golden standard of resting energy expenditure estimation is not available in most intensive care units. Different predictive equations have been developed, but not evaluated in cardiac population and have low accuracy in compare to the indirect calorimetry. The aim of present study is to develop cardio-specific equation for resting energy expenditure estimation.</brief_summary>
