	<brief_summary>This study involves sampling bone marrow transplant patients, hospital workers and the patient room for microbes using swabs and other techniques. We send these samples to the laboratory, where they will use state-of-the art technology to identify and relate the microbes to each other. This study also involves putting copper, nickel, or titanium into some hospital rooms, and seeing whether these metals influences the growth of microbes. Some equipment in the hospital room, such as faucets and soap dispensers will be replaced by sensor-based (e.g. touchless) controls.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention of Healthcare Associated Infections in Bone Marrow Transplant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bacteria and other microbes are everywhere, the majority of which are harmless. They live on our bodies, on everyday objects, in food, and in our environment. They are passed around through the many interactions with other people and our surroundings. Some are even beneficial, helping us digest our food or protecting us from infections caused by harmful microbes. In rare instances, some of the harmful microbes can cause infections. When a microbe causes an infection while we are in healthcare facilities, they are called "Healthcare-associated infections", or "HAIs". Examples that you may have heard of include Clostridium difficile, and MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Vancouver General Hospital already has some of the lowest HAI rates in the country. We have dedicated hospital workers that do a great job at preventing HAIs, but we are always looking for ways to be even better.</detailed_description>
