	<brief_summary>The investigators aim to evaluate the feasibility of a larger clinical trial assessing an exercise program during the "teachable moment" in patients with prostate cancer and measuring its effect on tumor apoptosis signaling, lipogenesis and steroidogenesis. Participants will be randomized between a 4-12 week exercise program or to standard of care only. Participants will be assessed at screening, baseline (day 0), throughout the trial intervention (days 1-84), post-intervention visit (prior to radical prostatectomy) and final study visit 6-months post-radical prostatectomy. At each assessment, physical, biological samples and psychosocial assessments will take place.</brief_summary>
