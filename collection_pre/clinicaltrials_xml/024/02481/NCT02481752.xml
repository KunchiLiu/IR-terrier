	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to investigate the effect of a brief computer task (Approach Avoidance Task) on smoking cessation. The investigators will use a novel training protocol that works to target automatic thoughts and tendencies that occur outside of conscious control. Previous research suggests that these automatic tendencies may have a direct effect on certain health behaviors- like continuing to smoke despite having previous quit attempts. The investigators hypothesize that individuals in the AAT training condition will evidence a greater decrease in reaction times to avoid smoking-related stimuli &amp; approach positive stimuli relative to those in the control condition. The investigators also expect that individuals in the AAT condition will exhibit superior outcomes on several quit-related variables as evidenced by an increase in motivation to quit smoking, an increase in number of days abstinent following a self-guided quit attempt, an increase in self-efficacy, and a decrease in urge to smoke compared to those in the SHAM training condition.</brief_summary>
