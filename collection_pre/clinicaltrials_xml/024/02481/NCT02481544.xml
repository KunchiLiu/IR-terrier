	<brief_summary>Psychosocial factors, including positive affect, finding meaning in the event, and managing emotional distress, influence prognosis following a heart attack or myocardial infarction (MI). Gratitude, typically defined as a feeling or attitude in acknowledgment of a benefit that one has received or will receive, is associated with higher levels of well-being, and people who are more grateful experience less stress, are less depressed, have higher levels of control over their environment, and more positive ways of coping. The present project will examine the potential benefits of a gratitude intervention (i.e., 8 weeks of gratitude journaling) to increase positive health behaviors, psychological health, and physical functioning in post-MI patients as compared to journaling about memorable events as well as care as usual alone. The investigators will study psychological and physical functioning at baseline, following 8 weeks of gratitude journaling or care as usual, and at 4-month follow-up.</brief_summary>
