	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that critical care trained registered nurses and physicians can perform measurements of cognitive impairment in critically ill pediatric patients in a reliable and valid manner. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will incorporate an instrument (psCAM-ICU) to assess both components of consciousness, arousal and content, in critically ill pediatric patients at least 6 months to children 5 years of age, both on and off mechanical ventilation, and compare these assessments to those of the reference standard.</brief_summary>
