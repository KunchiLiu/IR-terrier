	<brief_title>Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells Transplantation to Patients With Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal cord injury(SCI) is a common severe traumatic central nervous system damage. And now the treatment of SCI is still a worldwide problem in clinic. How to improve the curative effect of SCI and restore the limb nerve function as far as possible are becoming the key problems in the clinical treatment of SCI. The current treatments for spinal cord injury mainly include surgical treatment, medical therapy, physical therapy, preventing the complications after injury, but these treatments can only make some clinical improvement in patients, most patients will also face severe nerve dysfunction. Animal experiments and clinical researches in recent years have reported using umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) transplantation to treat spinal cord injury, this provides a new approach of SCI treatment, but its efficacy remains controversial, and lacking of high credible prospective cohort clinical trial evidence to support. In this study, completely or incompletely cervical, thoracic spinal cord injury participants were recruited to join in a prospective, cohort clinical trials. Intervention is subarachnoid injection of human allogeneic UC-MSCs and the main evaluation index is American spinal injury association (ASIA) score, secondary evaluation indicator is electromyogram and electroneurophysiologic test. A monocenter prospective cohort study will be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of UC-MSCs, for the treatment of completely or incompletely spinal cord injury. The primary outcome is American spinal injury association (ASIA) score at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 and 24 months post-treatment. Secondary outcomes of the study include the number of participants with adverse events at 1 month post-treatment, electromyogram and electroneurophysiologic test at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 and 24 months post-treatment. On the basis of the results of this trial investigators will, for the first time, have scientific evidence as to the relative safety and efficacy of UC-MSCs transplantation for the treatment of spinal cord injury.</detailed_description>
