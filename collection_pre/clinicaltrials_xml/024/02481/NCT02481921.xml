	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this proposal is to improve the quality of care and outcomes for patients discharged with heart failure using an innovative multidisciplinary group intervention approach. Heart failure is a complex chronic illness where comprehensive patient-centered care is difficult and resource intensive. One potential solution is to use shared medical appointments (SMA), where a multi-disciplinary team of providers with expertise in nutrition, nursing, behavior and medication management join to manage heart failure. The investigators will enroll patients from Providence, Cleveland and Phoenix VA Hospitals who were within 12 weeks of discharge from a heart failure hospitalization and randomized them to receive SMA intervention or usual care. Results from this project are expected to add an innovative intervention that could improve outcomes important for both the patient and the VA: health status, hospitalizations, and mortality.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Group Medical Visits in Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal of this research project is to improve the health status and decrease hospitalization and death for patients discharged with heart failure (HF) via education to patients, disease monitoring and medication titration through shared medical appointments (SMAs). Studies have found patient self-care behaviors in HF (e.g. medication/dietary non-compliance) and health system factors (e.g. care discoordination, limited access, lack of education to patients and caregivers) played an important role in patient's health status and hospitalization risk to the extent that 50% of the readmissions were judged to be possibly/probably preventable. To address patient and system factors based on the Chronic Care Model, redesign of care delivery, via SMA's, can be a good solution to provide patient self-management support while also performing disease monitoring and medication management in an environment of peer support. The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial to enroll patients within 12 weeks of discharge from a HF hospitalization and randomized them to receive either SMA intervention every other one-two weeks for 4 sessions versus usual care for HF. The investigators will determine, at 180 days from randomization, whether HF patients who participate in HF-SMA, as compared to patients who receive usual care: 1. Experience better cardiac health status measured by Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (primary outcome), and overall health status (EQ5D, secondary outcome); 2. Have fewer hospitalization or death and 3. Experience improvement in intermediate outcomes: a) increase in HF Self-Care behavior, and b) decrease in plasma BNP levels. For patients who underwent HF-SMA, the investigators will also determine perceived benefits, areas in need of improvement, potential obstacles of implementation, and fidelity of the intervention across sites, by conducting (a) face-to-face interviews with patients and (b) telephone interviews with stakeholders (physicians of the patients and administrators). The sites will be Providence VA, Cleveland VA and Phoenix VA hospitals to enroll a total of 375 patients. The study duration will be 180 days for all patients from the time of randomization. The investigators will use stratified (enrollment in other programs for HF care, &lt;2 hospitalizations last 6 months, left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40%), block randomization with block sizes of 4 in each site to ensure balance of the stratified variables. The team will consist of a nutritionist, nurse, health psychologist, a clinical pharmacist and/or nurse practitioner, without the presence of a physician (cardiologist will be available on call). The session will contain an assessment of patient needs, theme-based disease self-management education, patient-initiated disease management discussion, and break-out sessions of individualized medication case management. The study findings will be used in health care management and system redesign to provide better quality and patient centered care for Veterans with HF. The long-term goal is to use a multi-disciplinary team approach in a group setting to manage HF support regular physician visits, in a peer support environment, all of which, are necessary to provide patient-centered care and improve outcomes.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All subjects &gt;18 years old, within 12 weeks of discharge from a hospitalization with a principal diagnosis of heart failure able to participate in a group setting and able to sign informed consent, will be eligible for enrollment Unable to attend the group sessions due to either psychiatric instability (acutely suicidal, psychotic) or organic brain injury (e.g., severe dementia, encephalopathy) that precludes selfreporting on health status Discharged to hospice or longterm nursing home facilities (as opposed to shortterm rehab), or patients with a code status of comfortmeasuresonly since the setting and goals of disease management will be very different compared to the general HF patients after discharge, who are the target of the investigators' intervention. Recipients of heart transplant or ventricular assist devices, patients receiving intravenous inotropic infusions for heart support, women who are pregnant, and patients with endstage liver disease or renal disease on dialysis since these conditions would preclude them from standard HF care. All women of childbearing age will have a pregnancy test before study enrollment.</criteria>
