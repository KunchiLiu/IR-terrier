	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the use of NAC in the treatment of anosmia (a loss of the sense of smell). This drug is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for oral or pulmonary (lung) inhaled use for other medical conditions. However, there is research evidence that the medication may promote nerve recovery (help nerves work better after they are damaged). Since anosmia involves nerve problems, we believe the nasal spray may help treat anosmia. The medication has been in use for many years for other conditions, without safety problems.</brief_summary>
