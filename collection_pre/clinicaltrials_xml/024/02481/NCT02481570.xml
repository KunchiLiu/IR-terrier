	<brief_summary>The standard anesthetic care plan for people having adolescent idiopathic scoliosis surgery will be accompanied by a pharmacokinetic simulation of the administered drugs to suggest opportunities to adjust drug doses to achieve tolerable pain control after surgery, avoid respiratory depression and allow patients to respond quickly either during intraoperative testing or at the conclusion of surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As part of this study, anesthesiologists will be given additional data on the expected drug effects based on a computer simulation. The data will be provided as a suggestion and will be used together with all the other information normally used to keep the study subjects safely asleep during surgery. In addition, data will be collected from the medical history and on postoperative pain control and medication side effects for the first 24 hours. Specifically, study subjects will be asked to rate their pain on a 10-point scale after they wake up from surgery and once they arrive in the pediatric intensive care unit. Measures of the time from the end of surgery until the study subjects are awake and out of the operating room will also be collected.</detailed_description>
