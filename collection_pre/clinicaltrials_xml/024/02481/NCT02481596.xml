	<brief_summary>This study evaluates family-focused mobile phone-delivered intervention, called FAMS (Family-focused Add-on for Motivating Self-care), in supporting adults with type 2 diabetes in their self-management relative to an individual-focused mobile phone-delivered intervention and relative to a control group. The goal of this study is to ascertain if family-focused content delivered to the patient can improve the patients' family support for diabetes self-care, self-efficacy, and adherence to diet and exercise recommendations (compared to an individual mobile phone-delivered intervention and compared to no intervention). This study also seeks to assess participants' readiness to invite family members to receive intervention content via text messages.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Family-Focused Mobile Health Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Family members perform diabetes-specific behaviors that are harmful and/or helpful to the adult managing type 2 diabetes. Family behaviors are strongly associated with patients' adherence to diet and exercise: supportive family behaviors with more adherence and harmful family behaviors with less adherence. This six-month intervention seeks to increase supportive and reduce harmful family behaviors, and to improve diabetes-related self-efficacy, and adherence to diet and exercise recommendations among adult patients with content that can be delivered via basic mobile phones (i.e., phone calls and text messages). FAMS components include: - Six 20-30 minute coaching sessions by phone focusing on helpful/unhelpful/desired family behaviors relevant to the patients' self-identified daily diet or exercise goal (occurs after enrollment and monthly for six months) - Text messages to the patient to support him/her in meeting the identified daily goal (4 per week) - The option to invite an adult support person to receive text messages (3 per week) encouraging the support person to discuss the patient's self-care goal to provide opportunities for the patient to practice skills discussed during phone coaching This is a supplemental intervention, nested within a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT; see NCT02409329) which evaluates REACH, a text messaging intervention to improve participants' adherence to self-care and glycemic control. We will evaluate these interventions with a three arm trial. Participants will be randomized to intervention or control; participants assigned to intervention will be again randomized to receive REACH only or REACH+FAMS. Participants assigned to REACH+FAMS will receive the above described components for the first six months of the trial, and then REACH only until the end of the trail. Analyses will compare change in outcomes at months 3 and 6, respectively, with the control group and with the REACH only intervention (NCT02409329).</detailed_description>
