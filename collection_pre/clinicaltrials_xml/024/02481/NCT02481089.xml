	<brief_summary>Warburg effect is an important feature of tumors,and genetic variation is one of the main factors of individual differences to radiotherapy treatment response for nasopharyngeal carcinoma(NPC). Through the previous work investigators found that the p53 codon72 (Pro/Arg) was related to the prognosis of NPC; Using the method of proteomics, investigators discovered glycolysis related gene such as PGK1, ALDOA，was associated with radiosensitivity.Thus,with all the previous work,investigators hypothesize that the key gene polymorphisms in glycolytic pathway, such as p53 , influence the glycolytic pathway,which leads to differences in radiosensitivity of NPC. This projects will include 600 cases of patients with NPC to detect common glycolytic key genes polymorphisms. Besides,investigators correlate these factors with their radiosensitivity and prognosis.Then, prediction model will be established, and validation of the prediction model will be done. Using enzyme-labeling instrument ，comet assay and clonogenic assay，cytological experiments will further investigate the influence of key gene polymorphisms on the glycolysis efficiency and mechanism of radiation sensitivity.Thus,investigators could provide theoretical basis of individualized treatment for NPC.</brief_summary>
