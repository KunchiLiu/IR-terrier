	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to perform a quantitative perfusion study of the undermined abdominal skin in deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flap breast reconstruction patients in order to obtain more knowledge on perfusion dynamics. Laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI) was used to evaluate this. Microcirculatory changes were monitored in the abdominal skin of 20 consecutive patients. Measurements were taken and recorded within four standardized zones covering the skin between the xiphoid process and the upper incisional boundary of the flap (zone 1-4; cranial to caudal).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background: No studies have assessed the perfusion of the undermined abdominal skin in breast reconstruction with deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flap. A greater understanding of the procedure's impact on the perfusion of the abdominal skin can be valuable in predicting areas susceptible to necrosis. Methods: Microcirculatory changes were monitored in the abdominal skin of 20 consecutive patients undergoing breast reconstruction with a deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flap. Quantitative mapping was performed with laser Doppler perfusion imaging at seven set intervals. Measurements were taken and recorded within four standardized zones covering the skin between the xiphoid process and the upper incisional boundary of the flap (zone 1-4; cranial to caudal).</detailed_description>
