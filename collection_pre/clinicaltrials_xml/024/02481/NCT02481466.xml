	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a dietary portfolio of cholesterol-lowering foods (viscous fibres, soy protein, plant sterols and nuts) further enhanced by increased levels of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and low glycemic index foods; together with a structured exercise program reduce the progression of carotid and coronary atheromatous lesions, Low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and blood pressure, while reducing the number of individuals requiring statins.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Combined Portfolio Diet and Exercise Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Presently in Canada, 29% of deaths are due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), costing $20.9 billion annually. The investigators have, therefore, brought together an unique network of investigators at different stages in their careers with a range of disciplines (nutrition, cardiology, diabetes, exercise physiology, imaging, physics, clinical trials, statistics, laboratory medicine, primary care, genetics, psychology, knowledge translation (KT), epidemiology), and with international recognition, experience and connections, to undertake a Canada-wide, multi-centre study which will test the ability of an effective cholesterol-lowering diet (dietary portfolio) and an exercise program, developed at Laval University, over 3 years to reduce the progression of plaque build-up in the carotid artery as assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in individuals with hypercholesterolemia and or type 2 diabetes. The dietary portfolio which has been proven in many of our studies to be an effective cholesterol-lowering diet will be enhanced to include features from other dietary strategies which the investigators have tested or developed; such as high monounsaturated fat (from Mediterranean diet) (CMAJ 2010) and low glycemic index foods (JAMA 2008). The investigators plan to recruit194 (approximately 200) men and postmenopausal women, who have measurable thickening (as assessed by ultrasound) due to plaque build up in the carotid arteries, in a 1.5 year period for this 3 year study. Ultrasound selection will be of individuals with intima-media thickness (IMT) &gt;1mm as relevant arterial thickening to ensure a relatively low risk for the majority of the group, yet with some measurable arterial thickening. Those selected will be randomly assigned to receive advice on either a dietary Portfolio Plus diet and increased physical activity (test) or the DASH-like diet with routine physical activity (control). The results of the study will have a major influence on dietary and exercise guidelines for coronary heart disease (CH risk reduction and provide evidence for the larger international trial that will focus on hard endpoints, myocardial infarction (MI) and CHD events). It is hoped that this cohort of participants will continue on and form part of the planned 9 year hard end point (MACE) study if funded.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A) Eligible participants will be men over 21 years postmenopausal women Having a BMI 2540 kg/m2 whose body weight has remained constant (within ±2kg) over the last 3 months preceding the onset of the study and who have measurable arterial thickening (&gt;1.0mm) at screening as assessed by ultrasound. They will include those who: 1. have type 2 diabetes with one of the following: raised LDLcholesterol (in accordance with the 2012 Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines) raised BP (≥145/95mmHg), or active smoking 2. nondiabetic subjects post MI or post percutaneous coronary intervention (angioplasty) on statin therapy; 3. are hypercholesterolemic and are treated with statins or have been prescribed statins but are not taking it because they are either unable(intolerant) or unwilling to take statin drugs. B) Individuals with the following conditions will be excluded: cardiovascular disease that precludes exercise e.g. recent stroke or recent myocardial infarction or cardiac condition that severely compromises normal function mitral valve disease, heart failuregrades 24 (based on New York Heart Association classification), severe angina sufficient to prevent any form of physical activity other conditions preventing exercise. clinical diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia secondary causes of hypercholesterolemia hypothyroidism (unless treated and on a stable dose of Lthyroxine) clinically significant renal or liver disease uncontrolled blood pressure major disability disorder requiring continuous medical attention (on steroids or Coumadin)and treatment, such as: chronic heart failure liver disease renal failure or cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancerbasal cell, squamous cell) chronic infections (bacterial or viral) chronic inflammatory diseases (eg. lupus, ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease, celiac disease or gluten sensitivity) other autoimmune disease major surgery &lt;6 months prior to randomization newly diagnosed with diabetes (&lt;3 months) alcohol consumption &gt;3 drinks/d not suitable for MRI examination because of metal implants or claustrophobia food allergies or sensitivity to study foods or study food components (eg. tree nuts, peanuts, soy, wheat, gluten, oats, eggs, milk) already following a portfoliolike diet or have a structured exercise program do not have a family doctor</criteria>
