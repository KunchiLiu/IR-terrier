	<brief_title>Study of Orally Administered AG-881 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors, Including Gliomas, With an IDH1 and/or IDH2 Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this Phase I, multicenter study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of AG-881 in gliomas, that harbor an IDH1and/or IDH2 mutation. The first portion of the study is a dose escalation phase where cohorts of patients will receive ascending oral doses of AG-881 to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase II dose. The second portion of the study is a dose expansion phase where patients will receive AG-881 to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of the recommended Phase II dose. The anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity occurs or the patient is removed at the discretion of the investigator</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Glioma</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patient must be ≥18 years of age Patient must have histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumor, including glioma, with documented IDH1 and/or IDH2 genemutation. Patients in the dose escalation phase must have disease that has recurred or progressed following standard therapy and/or therapy with an inhibitor of mutant IDH1 and/or IDH2, or that has not responded to this therapy. Patients in the expansion phase may have previously untreated disease Patient must have evaluable disease by RECIST v1.1 for patients without glioma or by RANO or RANO LGG criteria for patients with glioma Patients with glioma must have a baseline brain MRI scan Patient must have archived primary tumor biopsies or surgical specimens, or biopsies of recurrent or metastatic samples Patient must be amenable to serial peripheral blood sampling, urine sampling, and tumor biopsies during the study Patient must be able to understand and willing to sign an informed consent Patient must have ECOG PS of 0 to 2 Patient must have expected survival of ≥3 months Patient must have adequate bone marrow function as evidenced by absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 ×10^9/L; hemoglobin &gt;9 g/dL (Patients are allowed to be transfused to this level); platelets ≥75 × 10^9/L Patient must have adequate hepatic function as evidenced by: Serum total bilirubin ≤1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN), unless considered due to Gilbert's disease or disease involvement; Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≤2.5 × ULN. For patients with bone metastases and/or suspected diseaserelated liver or biliary involvement, AST, ALT and ALP must be ≤5 × ULN Patient must have adequate renal function as evidenced by: Serum creatinine ≤2.0 × ULN or Creatinine clearance &gt;40 mL/min based on the CockroftGault glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated: (140Age) x (weight in kg) x (0.85 if female)/72 x serum creatinine Patient must be recovered from any clinically relevant toxic effects of any prior surgery, radiotherapy, or other therapy intended for the treatment of cancer Female patients with reproductive potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to first study drug administration. Patients with reproductive potential are defined as sexually mature women who have not undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or tubal occlusion or who have not experienced natural menopause (i.e., who have not menstruated at all) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., have had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months). Women with reproductive potential as well as fertile men and their partners who are female with reproductive potential must agree to abstain from sexual intercourse or to use two highly effective forms of contraception from the time of giving informed consent, during the study, and for 90 days (females and males) following the last dose of AG 881 Patients who received systemic anticancer therapy or radiotherapy &lt;21 days prior to their first day of study drug administration Patients who received an investigational agent (including AG120 or AG221) &lt;14 days prior to their first day of study drug administration. In addition, the first dose of AG881 should not occur before a period ≥5 halflives of the investigational agent (other than AG120 or AG221) has elapsed. Patients with gliomas who have had prior treatment with bevacizumab (Avastin) are excluded Patients who are pregnant or breast feeding Patients with an active severe infection that required antiinfective therapy or with an unexplained fever &gt;38.5°C during screening visits or on their first day of study drug administration (at the discretion of the Investigator, patients with tumor fever may be enrolled) Patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV congestive heart failure or LVEF &lt;40% by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan obtained within approximately 28 days of C1D1 Patients with a history of myocardial infarction within the 6 months prior to screening Patients with known unstable or uncontrolled angina pectoris Patients with a known history of severe and/or uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias Patients with QTc interval ≥450 msec or with other factors that increase the risk of QT prolongation or arrhythmic events (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of long QT interval syndrome) Patients taking medications that are known to prolong the QT interval unless they can be transferred to other medications within ≥5 halflives prior to dosing, or unless the medications can be properly monitored during the study. Patients with known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or active hepatitis B or C Patients with known dysphagia, shortgut syndrome, gastroparesis, or other conditions that limit the ingestion or gastrointestinal absorption of drugs administered orally Patients with brain metastases that are untreated, symptomatic, or require therapy to control symptoms; or any radiation, surgery, or other therapy, including those used to control symptoms, within 1 month of first dose Glioma patients with evidence of intracranial or intratumoral hemorrhage either by MRI or CT scan</criteria>
