	<brief_title>Adaptation in Lower Extremity After 3 Running Days, With a Group Trained by Eccentric Overload</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Changes in muscle and tendon tissues, due to exercise, could determine in the future the possibility of an injury. Understand the changes in the mechanical tissues is a key tool for prevention. The evaluation of the thickness and area in tendons, the existence of new vessels within the tendon, muscle pennation angle or thermography are tools that have been widely used to detect these changes. Running is one of the activities that can cause more muscle-tendon injuries, specially overuse injuries. However, the eccentric exercise suggest to make some adaptations in different tissues that may be beneficial to prevent damage after exercise.</detailed_description>
