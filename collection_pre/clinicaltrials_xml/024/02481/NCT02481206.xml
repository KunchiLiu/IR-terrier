	<brief_title>Wearable Cardioverter Defibrillator in Hemodialysis Patients (WED-HED) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: To study the impact of wearable cardioverter defibrillator (WCD) use on sudden cardiac death in hemodialysis patients. Study Population: Participants will be patients beginning hemodialysis (&lt;2 months from initiation) who are ≥ 50 years old. Intervention: A WCD will be used for protection against sudden cardiac death (SCD). Study Design: The study will be a multi-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial with 1:1 assignment of treatment and control. Study Size: The study will enroll up to 2,600 subjects. A maximum of 200 sites will be used for enrollment.</detailed_description>
