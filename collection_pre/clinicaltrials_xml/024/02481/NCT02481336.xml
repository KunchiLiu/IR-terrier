	<brief_title>To Study the Individual Variants of Chemotherapy-Induced Neurotoxicity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, observational, cohort study, monitoring the chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity by traditional clinical scales, neurological examinations, and semi-quantitative assessments. Moreover, all the genetic changes will be analyzed by next generation sequencing and we will try to identify relevant variants in individuals who suffer from chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity.</detailed_description>
