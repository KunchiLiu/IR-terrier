	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study of Levosulpiride</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Levosulpiride was administered to 42 healthy male and female (1:1) subjects as tablet (orally) and injection (intramuscularly and intravenously) formulations. Blood samples were collected at regular intervals after single and multiple drug administration. The concentration of levosulpiride in plasma was determined using a validated high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Non-compartmental analysis was performed to estimate pharmacokinetic parameters. The analysis of variance was used to test for linearity and assess the effect of gender on the pharmacokinetic properties of the study drug. Adverse effects were monitored using investigators' questionnaires and subjects' spontaneous reports, vital sign measurements, hematology, clinical chemistry, and electrocardiogram.</detailed_description>
