	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects, good and bad of a new drug called ixazomib (also called MLN9708), when it is given along with a common treatment combination, called Dose-Adjusted EPOCH-R (DA-EPOCH-R, for short). This is a type of study called a phase I/II trial. In the phase I part, the dose of the study drug (ixazomib) will be adjusted (either up or down) to find the maximum (highest) dose that does not cause excessive (too many) harmful side effects. In the phase II part, this dose of ixazomib will be given at the maximum safe dose found in phase I. In both phase I and II, DA-EPOCH-R will be adjusted between cycles depending on how blood cell levels are affected between cycles. Ixazomib is considered investigational because it is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). DA-EPOCH-R is a combination chemotherapy treatment developed over the last 14-15 years, and each of the drugs in this regimen is FDA-approved and considered part of the standard of care.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy, Rituximab, and Ixazomib Citrate in Treating Patients With Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety of ixazomib (ixazomib citrate) given with dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine (vincristine sulfate), cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin (doxorubicin hydrochloride), and rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R) in patients with aggressive, v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC)-aberrant lymphoid malignancies, and to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination. (Phase I) II. To evaluate the efficacy, as measured by 12-month progression free survival (PFS), of ixazomib given with DA-EPOCH-R in patients with aggressive, MYC-aberrant lymphoid malignancies. (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Further evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicity. II. Further evaluate the clinical efficacy, as measured by response rate and overall survival (OS). III. Assess the predictive value of fludeoxyglucose F-18 (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scans on PFS. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the impact of cell of origin (COO) upon response rate, PFS, and OS. II. Assess the feasibility and outcomes of consolidation stem cell transplant (SCT). OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of ixazomib citrate followed by a phase II study. INDUCTION: Patients receive ixazomib citrate orally (PO) on day 1 and day 8 or 15; etoposide intravenously (IV), vincristine sulfate IV, and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV continuously over 96 hours on days 1-4; prednisone PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-5; rituximab IV should be started at 50 mg/hr, and increased in 50-mg/hr increments every 30 minutes to a maximum rate of 400 mg/hr on day 1; and cyclophosphamide IV over 90 minutes on day 5. CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) PROPHYLAXIS: Patients with a negative lumbar puncture (LP) receive methotrexate intrathecally (IT) once per course. Patients with a positive LP receive methotrexate IT or intraventricularly OR cytarabine IT or intraventricularly OR methotrexate IT or intraventricularly, cytarabine IT or intraventricularly, and therapeutic hydrocortisone IT or intraventricularly. MAINTENANCE: Patients not treated with consolidative SCT, receive ixazomib citrate PO BID on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to one year (or as long as deriving benefit) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.</detailed_description>
