	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the current study is to determine whether Ataciguat (HMR1766) slows progression of valve calcification in patients with moderate calcific aortic valve stenosis. Secondary and tertiary objectives are to determine whether Ataciguat slows progression of aortic valve function, reduces systemic inflammation, and prevents left ventricular dysfunction in patients with moderate calcific aortic valve stenosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating the Effects of Ataciguat (HMR1766) on Aortic Valve Calcification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with Moderate Calcific Aortic Valve Stenosis may be eligible for enrollment in this study. Participation lasts 12 months, which includes a total of 3 study visits (baseline/screening visit, 6 month follow up visit and 12 month follow up visit). During each visit, a blood sample will be taken along with other research related tests (Orthostatic Tolerance Standing Test, CT Scan, Echocardiogram, DEXA Scan). Qualifying Participants will be supplied with 6 months worth of study medication or placebo during visits 1 (baseline/screening visit) and 2 (6 month follow up visit) in which they will take at home daily with food. On visit 3 (12 month follow up visit), any remaining study medication or placebo will be returned to study staff.</detailed_description>
