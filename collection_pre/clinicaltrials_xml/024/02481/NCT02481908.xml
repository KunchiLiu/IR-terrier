	<brief_summary>The aim of this investigation was to assess the value of Systolic Time Intervals (STIs) as a method of detecting Left Ventricular Dysfunction (LVD) in patients admitted to the ED for Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) and whether STIs measured under Valsalva manoeuver (VM) could improve the distinction between patients with LVD and those without LVD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>STI Combined to Valsalva Maneuver for the Diagnosis of Left Ventricular Dysfunction in COPD Exacerbations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We included patients admitted to the ED for AECOPD. Measurement of STIs included electromechanical activation time (EMAT), left ventricular ejection time and EMAT/LVET ration. These were performed at baseline and during the first strain phase of the VM using a computerized phonoelectrocardiographic method. The diagnosis of LVD was determined on the basis of clinical examination, echocardiography and brain natriuretic peptide. The values of STIs were compared between patients with and without LVD ; their diagnostic performance was assessed using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC of ROC).</detailed_description>
