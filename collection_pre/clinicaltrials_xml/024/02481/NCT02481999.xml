	<brief_summary>Evaluation of mechanisms and factors of anaesthesia on postoperative delirium and emergence agitation as well as on postoperative cognitive function in children aged 0,5-8 years scheduled for elective surgery. The depth of anesthesia in children for elective surgery aged 0,5-6 years is monitored with intraoperative "Narcotrend-Compact-M-Monitoring". Postoperatively the "Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium Scores (PAED Score)" [Sikich et al. 2004] is used to screen for the frequency of postoperative delirium in the post anesthesia care unit discharge of the child after surgery. Cognitive testings are performed in children of the study group (n= 470) and a control group (n= 80) with the parents support to evaluate deficits in children in their cognitive areas (POCD (Postoperative cognitive deficit)) at three different time points up to three months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pre- and Postoperative EEG-Monitoring for Children Aged From 0,5 to 8 Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According to recent studies in children aged from 0,5 to 8 years "Narcotrend Monitor" (from EEG derived monitoring of the frontal brain waves) can reliably measure the depth of anesthesia [MÃ¼nte et al. 2009; Weber et al. 2005]. Depth of anesthesia in adults is significantly correlated with the incidence of postoperative delirium and longer lasting cognitive deficits [Radtke et al. 2013; Chan et al. 2013; Whitlock et al. 2014]. We know from animal experimental studies that anesthetics have a potential toxic effect in the developing brain. [Sinner et al 2014].</detailed_description>
