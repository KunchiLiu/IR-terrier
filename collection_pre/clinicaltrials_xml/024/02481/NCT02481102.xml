	<brief_title>EASYER (EpiAccess SYstem Registry) A Post Market Observational Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Registry will be a prospective non-randomized single-arm trial of up to 150 patients enrolled in up to ten (10) centers in the United States. The overall duration of the registry is estimated to be 18 months per site. For the patients the registry duration will be from the time of procedure until discharge from the hospital, estimated to be approximately four (4) days. Prior to enrollment, patients will be evaluated on the basis of the latest available data to establish eligibility. Eligible patients will be considered enrolled in the registry after written informed consent is obtained. As EpiAccess is only used for the access portion of the procedure, the safety performance and effectiveness endpoints are acute from the time of needle insertion until pericardial sac access is achieved. Follow up clinical examinations will be performed according to institutional standard of care. No special tests are required for this device.</detailed_description>
