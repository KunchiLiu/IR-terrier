	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of pembrolizumab when given together with docetaxel or gemcitabine hydrochloride in treating patients with previously treated urothelial cancer that has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment (advanced) or that has spread from the primary site (place where it started) to other places in the body (metastatic). Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving pembrolizumab together with docetaxel or gemcitabine hydrochloride may be a better treatment for urothelial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab and Docetaxel or Gemcitabine Hydrochloride in Treating Patients Urothelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) when given in combination with docetaxel or gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) in patients with advanced or metastatic platinum-treated urothelial cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess in a preliminary manner the efficacy of this combination (overall response rate and progression free survival). II. To determine in an exploratory manner programmed death (PD)-ligand (L)1 expression in archival tumor specimens and to correlate this with patient outcomes. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pembrolizumab. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms. (Patients who had received prior gemcitabine hydrochloride/cisplatin or gemcitabine hydrochloride/carboplatin [GC] or methotrexate, vinblastine sulfate, adriamycin, and cisplatin [MVAC] therapy are assigned to Arm A). ARM A: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1. ARM B: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV as in Arm A and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 6 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Have locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer that is not amenable to curative surgical treatment Have histologically or cytologically confirmed urothelial tract carcinoma Be previously chemotherapytreated; all patients may have received up to two prior lines of chemotherapy (excludes systemic therapy) for recurrent/advanced disease, as long as one of those regimens was platinumbased; (it is anticipated that patients would have been previously treated with MVAC or GC, or variations of these standard frontline regimens) Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial Have measurable disease based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 Have provided tissue from an archival tissue sample or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion Life expectancy of greater than 6 months Have a performance status of 0 to 1 on the Zubrod performance scale Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,500/mcL Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dL or &gt;= 5.6 mmol/L Serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) OR measured or calculated* creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/min for subject with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN; (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] can also be used in place of creatinine or creatinine clearance [CrCl]) Creatinine clearance should be calculated per institutional standard Serum total bilirubin =&lt;

if the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication;
