	<detailed_description>The present study will test the implementation and sustainability of (a) a Computer-Assisted Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment (CACBT) for youth anxiety and (b) the BASC-2 TRS to identify anxious youth in the school setting using a cohort-sequential design (i.e., three years at 20 schools over the span of five years). There are 3 phases: Phase I (baseline): Gather data on prevalence and services provided via screening measures and treatment trackers: Phase II (implementation): Train school staff in the identification of anxious youth (i.e. BASC-2 TRS) and the provision of the intervention (i.e., CACBT), modifying assessment and treatment procedures so as to best fit each individual school. Identify barriers and facilitators of implementation by gathering the qualitative experience of school staff: Phase II (sustainability): Discontinue training and supervision. Assess sustainability of the assessment and intervention. Identify barriers and facilitators of implementation by gathering the qualitative experience of school staff.
