	<brief_summary>This is a two-stage study. In the first stage, 30 subjects with stroke (onset &gt; 2 weeks) are recruited, and they are assessed and recorded with clinical characteristics, sympathetic nerve testing, and twice symptom-limit exercise capacity tests. The second stage would recruited 90 subjects with stroke (onset&gt;2 weeks), and they are randomized to one of three groups (control, low-intensity, high-intensity). They are evaluated before and after the four-week interval with clinical characteristics and twice symptom-limit exercise capacity tests (baseline and after four-week training) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a two-stage study. In the first stage, 30 subjects with stroke (onset &gt; 2 weeks) are recruited, and they are assessed and recorded with sympathetic nerve testing, anthropometry, and twice symptom-limit exercise capacity tests.The second stage would recruited 90 subjects with stroke (onset&gt;2 weeks), and they are randomized to one of three groups. The control group undergoes traditional rehabilitation only, The low-intensity exercise group receives a low-intensity four-week cycle ergometry and traditional rehabilitation. The The high-intensity exercise group gets a high-intensity four-week cycle ergometry and traditional rehabilitation. They are evaluated by sympathetic tests, anthropometry, functional scales and activity questionnaires, and symptom-limit exercise capacity tests before and after the four-week training.</detailed_description>
