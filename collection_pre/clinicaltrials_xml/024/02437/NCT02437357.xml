	<brief_title>A Trial on Metacognitive Training for Depression (D-MCT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite the existence of evidence-based treatment methods, a significant treatment gap remains for major depression. While in acute psychiatric treatment of severely depressed patients a pharmacological treatment is usually applied, depression-specific psychotherapeutic (group) concepts are rarely part of the treatment, though recommended in clinical guidelines. A main reason is that present group concepts were designed primarily for outpatient settings and do not meet the structural requirements of inpatient care (i.e., short residence time, continuous admissions and dismissals). Metacognitive Training for Depression (D-MCT) is a new low-threshold, modular group intervention which was designed to fill this treatment gap by addressing contextual and structural shortcomings of existing concepts for the use in inpatient treatment. The training targets depressive symptoms by changing (meta-) cognitive biases identified in both cognitive models of depression and basic research. D-MCT was positively evaluated with regard to feasibility and acceptance in a non-randomized pilot study. Aim of the present randomized-controlled trial is to investigate the efficacy of D-MCT as an add-on intervention in inpatient treatment of depressed patients compared with a standard add-on group therapy (Positivity Training, PT). Based on a power analysis, the investigators target a sample size of 60 depressed patients, who will be randomized either to D-MCT or PT. Blind to diagnostic status, symptom level as well as cognitive biases will be assessed pre- and post-treatment (8 group sessions) as well as 3 months later (follow-up). Primary outcome parameter is severity of depressive symptoms measured with the HDRS total score (17-item version). Secondary outcome measures are self-assessed depression (BDI), dysfunctional beliefs (DAS), metacognitions (MCQ), self-esteem (RSE), and quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF).</detailed_description>
