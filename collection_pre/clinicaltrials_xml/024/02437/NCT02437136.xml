Additionally the purpose of the study is to assess how effective entinostat and pembrolizumab are in combination in patients with Non-small Cell Lung Cancer and Melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ph1b/2 Dose-Escalation Study of Entinostat With Pembrolizumab in NSCLC With Expansion Cohorts in NSCLC and Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SNDX-275-0601 is an open-label, Phase 1b/2 study evaluating the combination of entinostat plus pembrolizumab in patients with advanced metastatic or recurrent NSCLC or melanoma. The study has 2 phases, a Dose Escalation/Confirmation Phase (Phase 1b) and an Expansion Phase (Phase 2). An additional cohort (Entinostat Monotherapy Immune Correlate [EMIC] Cohort) evaluating single agent entinostat for 2 weeks followed by the combination will also be evaluated in patients with NSCLC in the Phase 2 expansion phase. Toxicities will be assessed by the Investigator using the United States (US) National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03. Dose Confirmation: The prospective MTD/RP2D identified in the Dose Escalation Phase will be confirmed in 9 patients in Dose Confirmation Cohort(s) to obtain additional AE, immune correlate, and anti-tumor activity data on entinostat in combination. Phase 2 (Expansion): In the Expansion Phase, entinostat in combination will be evaluated using the RP2D identified in the Dose Escalation/Confirmation Phase. Up to 3 Expansion Cohorts consisting of distinct subsets of patients with solid tumor cancers may be explored. Expansion cohorts may include: 1. Cohort 1: NSCLC 2. Cohort 2: Patients with NSCLC (any histology) who have previously been treated and responded and then progressed on either a PD-1 or PD-L1-blocking antibody 3. Cohort 3: Patients with melanoma who have previously been treated with and unequivocally progressed on either a PD-1 or PD-L1-blocking antibody EMIC Cohort: 15 NSCLC patients Stage 2 of Cohort 1 will be randomly assigned to participate.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with NSCLC: 1. Has histologically or pathologicallyconfirmed recurrent/metastatic NSCLC. 2. If has adenocarcinoma, required to have previously been tested for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, with results available for collection in this study, and, if positive, has been treated with prior EGFR or ALK therapy. 3. Received at least 1 chemotherapeutic regimen in the advanced/metastatic setting and experienced documented, unequivocal progressive disease by either RECIST 1.1 or clinical assessment. 4. Patients with NSCLC enrolled in Cohort 1 of the Expansion Phase should not have been previously treated with a PD1/PDL1blocking antibody Patients in Expansion Phase, Cohorts 2 and 3 5. Previously treated with a PD1/PDL1blocking antibody and experienced experienced documented, unequivocal progressive disease by irRECIST during or after such treatment. Patients with Melanoma: 6. Has a histologically or cytologicallyconfirmed diagnosis of unresectable or metastatic melanoma and experienced unequivocal progressive disease following a PD1 or PDL1blocking antibody and, if BRAF V600 mutationpositive, a BRAF inhibitor. All Patients 7. Aged 18 years or older on the day written informed consent is given. 8. If has brain metastases, must have stable neurologic status following local therapy for at least 4 weeks without the use of steroids or on stable or decreasing dose of ≤10 mg daily prednisone (or equivalent), and must be without neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other AEs. 9. Evidence of locally recurrent or metastatic disease based on imaging studies within 28 days before the first study drug dose: At least 1 measurable lesion ≥20 mm by conventional techniques or ≥10 mm by spiral CT scan or MRI, with the last imaging performed within 28 days before the first study drug dose. If there is only 1 measurable lesion and it is located in previously irradiated field, it must have demonstrated unequivocal progression according to RECIST, version 1.1. 10. If receiving radiation therapy, has a 2week washout period following completion of the treatment prior to receiving the first study drug dose and continues to have at least 1 measureable lesion, per above criterion. 11. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. 12. Has acceptable, applicable laboratory parameters. 13. Female subjects must not be pregnant. 14. If male, agrees to use an adequate method of contraception 15. Experienced resolution of toxic effect(s) of the most recent prior chemotherapy to Grade 1 or less (except alopecia). If patient underwent major surgery or radiation therapy of &gt;30 Gy, they must have recovered from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention. 16. Willing to have fresh tumor samples collected during screening and at other time points designated as mandatory, per the Schedule of Study Assessments. 17. Able to understand and give written informed consent and comply with study procedures. Patients meeting any of the following criteria are not eligible for study participation: 1. Diagnosis of immunodeficiency or receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug. The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the Sponsor. 2. Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years (i.e., with disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment. 3. History of interstitial lung disease (ILD). 4. Allergy to benzamide or inactive components of entinostat. 5. History of allergies to any active or inactive ingredients of pembrolizumab. 6. History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator, including, but not limited to: Myocardial infarction or arterial thromboembolic events within 6 months prior to baseline or severe or unstable angina, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV disease, or a QTc interval &gt; 470 msec.
