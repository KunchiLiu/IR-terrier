	<brief_summary>Metformin is an oral antidiabetic of the biguanide class derived from galega officinalis. Historical cohort of patients with diabetes have shown that diabetics on Metformin had a better chance of survival than diabetics not on Metformin. These observations have led to in vitro studies of metformin on cancer cells. It was thus demonstrated that Metformin has anti-proliferative properties. The aim of our study is to evaluate the efficacy of metformin in combination with neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients eligible for the trial and having signed their consent to participate will undergo a dosimetric scan at baseline. 48 hours later (minimum), a Metformin therapy will be started at a dosage of 850 mg 2 times / day ( = 1700 mg / day). Seven days later (minimum) and up to 48 hours before surgery, the dosage of Metformin will be increased to 850 mg 3 times / day ( = 2550 mg / day). This very same day (J10), patients will start a radiochemotherapy. For 5 weeks, 5 days out of 7, patients will receive 800 mg/m² of Capecitabine 2 times / day (on morning and evening) ( = 1600 mg / m² / day) and a 3D irradiation or an Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) of a total dose of 50 Gy (5 sessions of 2 Gy per week). 6 to 8 weeks after completion of the chemoradiotherapy, surgery will be scheduled. It will consist of a tumor resection with total resection of the meso rectum. Prior to the start of treatment, patients will have a clinical and a paraclinical examination and will undergo a laboratory examination. Once a week during the radiochemotherapy, patients will have a clinical examination and will undergo a laboratory examination. Three weeks after the end of the radiochemotherapy, patients will have a clinical examination. Before surgery, patients will have a clinical and a paraclinical examination. Finally, at the end of the study, patients will have a clinical examination.</detailed_description>
