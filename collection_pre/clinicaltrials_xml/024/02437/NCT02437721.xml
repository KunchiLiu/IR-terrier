	<brief_summary>The study is designed to show equivalence of an infant formula containing L-5- Methyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF) compared to a standard infant formula containing folic acid in respect to weight gain of healthy term infants receiving these infant formulae exclusively during the first 4 months of life. Healthy non breast fed infants will be randomized to receive either a standard infant formula with folic acid or a corresponding formula with MTHF instead of folic acid. Besides weight and length further anthropometric measures will be taken monthly from the age of 4 weeks to the age of 16 weeks and at the age 4 and 16 weeks blood samples will be taken for the determination of folate status and genotyping. As a reference the same measures will be taken in a group of breast fed infants, whose mothers` folate status will be determined as well.</brief_summary>
