	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate oxidative stress and/or inflammation in patients with Gaucher disease type I using a series of biomarkers and correlate with measurements of currently used diagnostic biomarkers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxidative Stress-Related Biomarkers in Gaucher Disease: A Preliminary Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will determine oxidative stress and/or inflammation related biomarkers in whole blood and/or plasma in adult subjects with Gaucher disease. Fifteen milliliter blood sample will be collected during three independent visits over a period of approximately 3 months. These samples will be processed to separate plasma from red blood cells and frozen until assays are performed. Standardized immunoassay methods and LC/MS based methods will be adopted to assay a series of biomarkers in these samples. These data will be correlated with currently used diagnostic biomarkers.</detailed_description>
