	<brief_summary>The purposes of this study are - to test the hypothesis that elimination or reduction of dietary animal proteins leads to an improved prognosis in tumor patients - to estimate the effect size and thus to enable sample size calculations for further studies - to test the feasibility and tolerance of different diets, especially a vegan diet, in cancer patients and to proof that a vegan diet does not lead to a deterioration of health, tumor progression or to malnutrition - to test the online platform as a study platform - to test validity of self reported and online generated data</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Elimination or Reduction of Dietary Animal Proteins on Cancer Progression and Survival - A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participating cancer patients select one of 3 defined diets (omnivor/lacto-ovo-vegetarian/vegan) at baseline and will continue their prescribed oncological therapy at their attending physician/clinic. Participants provide data (cancer history, tumor behavior, food frequency questionnaires, questionnaires referring to quality-of-life) at baseline and at 3 and 6 months with optional data entry points at 12 and 124 months and a follow up questionnaire at 12 and 24 months. Data is entered online via the study platforms www.essenundkrebs.net and www.foodandcancer.net in German and English language (no additional clinical visits are required).</detailed_description>
