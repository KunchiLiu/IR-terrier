	<brief_summary>Although a condition for surgery, robotic interventions applied with steep Trendelenburg-lithotomy (ST-L) position may cause positional injury and peripheral neuropathy if good position is not achieved on the operating table. This study will be a 7-year retrospective examination of postoperative positional injury (PPI) in patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) for prostate diagnosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Robot Assisted Radical Prostatecomy and Positional Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients who underwent RARP between 2008-2014 will be evaluate. Patients with known peripheral neuropathy, lumbar-cervical discopathy, or history of orthopaedic surgery or trauma will exclude. The demographic data of patients, ASA, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CMI), Body Mass Index (BMI), operating time (OT) and Trendelenburg time (TT) will obtain from patient records. Patients will be questioned as to whether or not PPI had developed, if so, in which extremity, in what form (sensory-motor), duration, whether or not a doctor had been consulted, if so, what treatment had been given and whether or not the PPI had continued.</detailed_description>
