	<brief_title>Early Access Program (EAP) for Ibrutinib in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-center (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) early access program (EAP) study. The study will be conducted in 2 phases: a Screening Phase (approximately 30 days prior to administration of first dose) and a Program Drug Phase (Day 1 up to 30 Days after last dose of study drug). Enrolled participants will receive 420 milligram (mg) oral ibrutinib once daily on a 28-day cycle until disease progression, occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, no longer achieving clinical benefit, or the end of program. Treatment will be continuous (without interruption) and self-administered. Disease evaluations will be conducted according to local standard of care as clinically indicated. Participant's safety will be monitored throughout the study. All enrolled and on-going participants in the program will continue to receive ibrutinib by the EAP until marketing approval or 6 months after this date.</detailed_description>
