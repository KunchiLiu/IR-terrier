	<criteria>1. Clinical symptoms consistent with IPF 2. Age 40 through 80 years 3. Diagnosis of UIP or IPF by HRCT and surgical lung biopsy as outlined in table 1. Only patients fulfilling the category "YES" will be included in the study. 4. Extent of fibrotic changes (honeycombing, reticular changes) greater than extent of emphysema on HRCT scan 5. No features supporting an alternative diagnosis 1. Acute exacerbation within the last 6 weeks. 2. Any relevant lung disease other than pulmonary fibrosis. 3. Acute inflammatory disease (e.g. common cold) within the last 6 weeks. 4. Acute or chronic hepatic disease. 5. Renal failure or renal replacement therapy.</criteria>
