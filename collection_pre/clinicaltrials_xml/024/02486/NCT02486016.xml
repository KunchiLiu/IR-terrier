	<brief_title>Transdermal Patch CVD 2000: The Effect of Heat on Fentanyl Release From Fentanyl Patches in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study is intended to determine the effect of heat on FDA-approved fentanyl transdermal patches and whether the heat applied will result in more fentanyl being absorbed through the skin than without applying heat. This is important given that little is known about how the release of fentanyl is affected by heat, particularly for generic products that are also available over the counter. This study will use fentanyl patches (brand name and generic patches) that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are already sold over the counter to customers in the United States, and will not include any placebos.</detailed_description>

Any condition that would, in the opinion of the Medically Accountable Investigator (MAI), place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury or render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol. 15. Inability to communicate or cooperate with the investigators. 16. History of consumption of alcohol within 24 hours prior to dose administration. 17. Within 72 hours prior to dosing, use of antihistamines or use of topical drugs at patch site. 18. Subject has an obvious difference in skin color between arms or the presence of a skin condition, open sore, scar tissue, tattoo, or coloration that would interfere with placement of test articles, skin assessment, or reactions to drug. 19. Use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors 21 days prior to study. 20. Failure to pass opioid dependence challenge test on each procedure day before application of the fentanyl patch. Each subject will be injected subcutaneously with naloxone HCl (0.8 mg injection) and will be observed for 45 minutes for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal.</criteria>
