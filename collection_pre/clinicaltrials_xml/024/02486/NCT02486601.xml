	<brief_summary>This is a non-randomized pauci-centre, open-label phase II study. The treatment will consist in a chemotherapy by FOLFOX and nab-paclitaxel following modalities determined in the Brown University Phase I study. In neoadjuvant setting : 3 months of treatment Main criteria of Withdraw of the treatment: in case of tumor progression, non acceptable toxicity, or patient decision. Post-operative treatment (for 6 additional cycles) is recommended, but will depend on the result of the neo-adjuvant treatment and the ability of patients to receive adjuvant chemotherapy based on tolerance of neo-adjuvant treatment and general post-operative condition (i.e. adjuvant treatment if no progression during neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, less than 80% of residual viable tumor compared to initial tumor volume, acceptable tolerance and post-operative PS 0 - 2). Adjuvant treatment must be initiated within 8 weeks post-operatively.</brief_summary>
