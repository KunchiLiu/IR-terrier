	<brief_title>Study of Single Doses of IV Aerucin in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I trial will be conducted as an open label trial in 15 healthy adults. All subjects will receive a specific intravenous dose of Aerucin. There are three study groups, each with a specific dose of Aerucin. Study Group 1 will receive 2.0 mg/ kg of Aerucin . Study Group 2 will receive 8.0 mg/kg of Aerucin . Study Group 3 will receive 20 mg/kg of Aerucin . The dose levels of Aerucin are selected for this study based on animal studies showing protection in an animal model and absence of adverse effects in toxicological studies. Groups will be enrolled sequentially.</detailed_description>

Abnormal CBC laboratory values (per local laboratory parameters) from blood collected at screening (&gt;5% above ULN or &gt;5% below LLN) 3. Abnormally elevated laboratory values (per local laboratory parameters) from blood collected at screening for ALT, AST, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), (&gt;10% above ULN) 4. Abnormal urinalysis that, in the opinion of the investigator, is clinically significant 5. Positive screening urine test for illicit drugs (opiates, cocaine, amphetamines) 6. Has received an immunoglobulin product in the 120 days prior to Study Day 0 7. History or evidence of autoimmune disease 8. History or evidence of any past, present, or future possible immunodeficiency state, including laboratory evidence of HIV 1 infection. 9. History or evidence of chronic hepatitis 10. History of evidence of Pseudomonas infection 11. Received a systemic antibiotic with 14 days prior to Study Day 0 12. Participation in any other investigational study during the study period 13. Received immunoglobulin or blood products within 90 days prior to Study Day 0 14. Received any investigational drug therapy or investigational drug within 60 days prior to Study Day 0 15. Received immunosuppressive medications other than inhaled or topical immunosuppressants within 45 days prior to Study Day 0 16. Inability to discontinue daily medications during the study other than: oral contraceptives, vitamins, nonprescription nutritional supplements, aspirin, antihistamines inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled beta agonists, inhaled anticholinergics 17. All female subjects: currently pregnant or lactating/nursing; positive screening urine pregnancy test; or positive urine pregnancy test on the day of any study dosing 18. History or evidence of allergic disease or reaction that, in the opinion of the investigator, may compromise the safety of the subject 19. History or evidence of any other acute or chronic disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the evaluation of the safety or immunogenicity of the drug or compromise the safety of the subject 20. Medical, psychiatric, occupational, or substance abuse problems that, in the opinion of the investigator, will make it unlikely that the subject will comply with the protocol 21. Any other reason at discretion of the investigator</criteria>
