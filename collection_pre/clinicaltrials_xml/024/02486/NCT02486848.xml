	<brief_summary>5% topical minoxidil is the maximum dosage approved by the US FDA for the treatment of female pattern hair loss. While topical minoxidil exhibits a good safety profile, the efficacy in the overall population is relatively low i.e., 30-40% re-grow hair. The primary purpose of this study is to assess if a higher dosage of topical minoxidil dosage (15%) will increase the number of responders among female subjects that have been identified through IVD testing as non-responders to 5% topical minoxidil.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Minoxidil Dose Response Study in Females Identified Through IVD Testing as Non-Responders to 5% Topical Minoxidil</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately, 40% of women suffer from female pattern hair loss by the age of 55. Currently, there is only one drug approved by the US FDA for the treatment of female pattern hair loss (AGA) - topical minoxidil. 5% topical minoxidil is the maximum dosage approved by the US FDA for the treatment of female AGA. While topical minoxidil exhibits a good safety profile, the efficacy in the overall population is relatively low i.e., 30-40% re-grow hair. Minoxidil is a pro-drug. To elicit a clinical response, minoxidil must be converted to its active form minoxidil sulfate by a sulfotransferase enzyme found in hair follicles. The investigators have developed an in-vitro diagnostic test that correctly identifies, prior to initiating therapy, 95.9% of non-responders to 5% topical minoxidil. The diagnostic test analyzes the sulfotransferase enzymatic activity in hair follicles to determine if a sufficient amount of minoxidil will be converted to the active form required to induce hair growth. Subjects with low enzymatic activity experience little or no therapeutic benefit and a reduced frequency of adverse events. Consequently, the investigators hypothesize that in subjects with low enzymatic activity (i.e., low minoxidil metabolizers) an increased minoxidil dosage will elicit a therapeutic response with little or no increase in the frequency of adverse events. It is thus the primary purpose of this study to assess if a higher dosage of topical minoxidil dosage (15%) will increase the number of responders among female subjects that have been identified through IVD testing as non-responders to 5% topical minoxidil.</detailed_description>
