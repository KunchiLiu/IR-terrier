	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to establish the working protocols for a general biorepository with the specific aim of procuring tissues and bodily fluids from the human gastrointestinal tract from a diverse range of clinical patients at the UC Davis Medical Center. The establishment of a GI-specific biorepository will support future translational endeavors within the UC Davis campus by providing laboratories with readily available GI tissue and bodily fluid samples to test newly developed hypotheses with relative ease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GI Biorepository of Tissue and Bodily Fluids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>UC Davis is currently lacking a general use biorepository for GI tissues and bodily fluids. As with any translational research study, the procurement of human tissue samples can be a difficult and time- consuming process. The establishment of this biorepository will help streamline GI biospecimen collection and centralize these samples in a conveniently located space to facilitate the implementation of future unspecified translational studies.</detailed_description>
