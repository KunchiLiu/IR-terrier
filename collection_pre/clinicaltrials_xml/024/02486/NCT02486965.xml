	<brief_summary>Fibromyalgia affects 1.4 now 2.2% of the general population whose symptom is the presence of widespread pain in all four quadrants of the body. Currently, there is no causal treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome. The aim of this study is the evaluation of a specific training program on controls of pain in fibromyalgia patients by balancing the stress axis. The primary endpoint is the improvement in the Visual Analogue Scale VAS difference) measured during the test of the thermode (difference between the average VAS measured between the 10th and 40th second of P1 and the average VAS measured between the 10th and 40th of the second P3) between D0 (3rd consultation) and M24 (5th consultation - end of study visit), which will be compared in the two groups..Salivary cortisol is also tested.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of a Specific Training Program on the Neuromodulation of Pain in Fibromyalgia Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A specific training program under the guidance of a physiotherapist, a professor of Adapted Physical Activity (APA) and individualized whose objective is to strengthen the parasympathetic tone and modulate the reactivity of the sympathetic system and the report of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis.This training program consists of three sessions of 45 minutes of physical activity per week for 2 years. The exercise intensity is initially very low and will be gradually increased according to your abilities and your tolerance to stress. A 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) will be carried out by the physiotherapist and by Professor APA, every 6 months to monitor the progression. For tracking the training program, a phone call is scheduled every week during the first 3 months, then a phone call every 15 days during the following months until the end of the study.Evaluation of neuromodulation of pain will be measured thanks to thermodeTest , experimental method implementing a tonic thermal pain using a "Peltier type Thermode" 3 cm2 model TSA II and immersion in a bath of cold water. Participants will be randomly assigned to 2 groups, "Training" group or "Control" group. The control group is a training program supervised by physical therapists and teachers in Adapted Physical Activity, identical to the active program in its follow-up, but the intensity of the sessions is lower. Study schedule : - 1st visit : screening visit at D-30 - 2nd visit : inclusion at D-7 - 3rd visit at D0 - 4st visit between M6 and M9 - 5th visit at M24 The patients included in the study will receive in addition to the training program, taking into bio-psycho-social multidisciplinary.</detailed_description>
