	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of this trial are: In patients at high-risk for restenosis, - To assess non-inferiority of the everolimus-eluting bioresorbable scaffold (BRS) to the everolimus eluting cobalt chromium metallic stent (EES) in target lesion failure (TLF) at 1 year - To assess superiority of the BRS to the EES in TLF between 1 and 5 years</brief_summary>
