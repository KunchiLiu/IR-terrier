	<brief_summary>In case of cervical foraminal stenosis without central stenosis, there are several options; anterior discectomy and fusion (ACDF), tubular retractor assisted micro-foraminotomy (MTPF) and posterior percutaneous cervical foraminotomy and discectomy (P-PECD). P-PECD is a modern technique and there was no RCT with MTPF, although P-PECD showed not inferior result to ACDF. Nowadays MTPF and P-PECD are minimally invasive surgical techniques, but there was no comparative study. The primary object of the study is to compare radiological outcome (segment angle) after MTPF or P-PECD.</brief_summary>
