	<brief_title>Testing mTBI in Athletes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this research study is to assess oculomotor, vestibular and reaction time responses in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) athletes, as well as healthy individuals. These measurements will be recorded using a portable goggle system (IPAS). The goal is to determine whether this IPAS goggle system is effective at diagnosing mTBI. A secondary goal is to determine whether this IPAS goggle system is effective at ruling out the diagnosis of mTBI in athletes and non-athletes that do not have the condition. The IPAS is a portable 3D head mounted display. The IPAS goggles are programmed with a series of tests that track eye motions in response to a target. This device has been determined to be a Non-Significant Risk to study participants. There are three groups of interest in this study: athletes who suffer an mTBI, athletes who do have an mTBI, and healthy non-athletes.</detailed_description>
