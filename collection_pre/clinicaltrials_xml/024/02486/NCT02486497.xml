	<brief_summary>Human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) is a membrane transporter which is a predicting marker for gemcitabine chemotherapy. However, there is a limited evidence of it as an indicator for adjuvant gemcitabine chemotherapy. In this study, investigators try to investigate the role of hENT1 as a indicator of selection of adjuvant chemotherapy regimen between gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjuvant Gemcitabine Versus 5-FU/Leucovorin Based on hENT1 Immunostaining</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After surgical resection of pancreatic cancer, the tissue is immunostained by hENT1 antibody. The grades of immunostaining are categorized as 0 (0%), 1 (&lt;50%), and 2 (&gt;=50%). According to the grade, patients with grade 0 or 1 will be treated with 5-FU and those with grade 2 will be treated with gemcitabine. After the study, investigators will calculate the overall survival and recurrence free survival of the patients and investigate the role of hENT1 as a predictive biomarker for adjuvant gemcitabine chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
