	<brief_summary>The investigators will develop a "risk report" within the primary care electronic health record (EMIS) for patients attending for their National Health Service Health Check. The value of the report for reducing cardiovascular risk will be assessed qualitatively and also quantitatively in a non-randomised comparative trial.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators will design a template within the primary care electronic health record (EMIS) that draws on Health Check data to provide a contemporary "risk report". Included in the report will be clear description of life-time cardiovascular risks, the factors driving those risks and how risk might be reduced through life-style and risk factor modification. The investigators will evaluate the benefits of providing patients with a risk report qualitatively by patient and clinician interviews. Quantitative analysis of the benefit of the risk report will be provided by a non-randomised comparative trial. First, a group of patients undergoing a conventional Health Check will be recalled after three months for a second Health Check, allowing measurement of the change in "Heart Age" - a convenient index of life-time cardiovascular risk. Following introduction of the risk report the investigators will recall a further group of patients for a second Health Check, allowing measurement of the change in "Heart Age". The effect of the risk report will be determined by comparing the change in Heart Age between the two groups of patients.</detailed_description>
