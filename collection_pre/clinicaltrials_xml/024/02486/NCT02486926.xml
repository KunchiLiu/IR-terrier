	<brief_summary>Sevoflurane is widely and frequently used in pediatric anesthesia due to its non-irritating airway properties, rapid induction and emergence. However, it is associated with emergence agitation (EA) in children. EA may cause injury to the child or to the surgical site and is a cause of stress to both caregivers and families. Various pharmacologic agents have been suggested to reduce EA. But the effect of remifentanil on EA is still controversial. This study was designed to compare the effects of remifentanil and remifentanil combining alfentanil on EA in children undergoing ophthalmic surgery with sevoflurane anesthesia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Remifentanil and Remifentanil-Alfentanil Administration in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One hundred and two children, aged 3-9 years, undergoing ophthalmic surgery were studied. General anesthesia was induced with thiopental 5 mg/kg, rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg and sevoflurane. At the time of separation from parents, separation score was recorded. When the children have a separation score of three or four point, they received half dose of thiopental before going to the operation room. They randomly assigned to group S (sevoflurane alone) or group R (sevoflurane with remifentanil infusion at the rate of 0.1 ㎍/kg/min) or group A (sevoflurane with remifentanil infusion and intravenous injection of alfentanil 5 ㎍/kg 10 min before the end of surgery). Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and sevoflurane concentration were checked every 15 minutes after induction of anesthesia. Time to extubation from discontinuation of sevoflurane inhalation was measured. Time to discharge from postanesthesia care unit (PACU) was assessed with postanesthetic Aldrete recovery score. Emergence agitation scoring system was used to evaluate the incidence and severity of EA.</detailed_description>
