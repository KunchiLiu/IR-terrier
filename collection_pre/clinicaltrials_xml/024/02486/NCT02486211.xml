	<brief_summary>This study evaluates if amantadine will increase the rate of awakening in patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest but comatose (not following commands) after their resuscitation. Half of the participants will receive amantadine and the other will receive placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Amantadine to Speed Awakening After Cardiac Arrest</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Amantadine has been used to help patients awaken following traumatic brain injury, but it has not been studied in patients with anoxic brain injury. Amantadine is a dopamine agonist and may help with stimulating the brain to awaken. The investigators will randomize subjects who remain comatose 72 hours following resuscitation from cardiac arrest to either amantadine or placebo. They will be treated with either amantadine or placebo for 7 days.</detailed_description>
