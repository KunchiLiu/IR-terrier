	<brief_summary>This study is designed to compare progression-free survival (PFS) from randomization among patients randomized on the BMT CTN 1302 protocol, "Multicenter Phase II, Double-blind Placebo Controlled Trial of Maintenance Ixazomib after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for High Risk Multiple Myeloma". It is hypothesized that Ixazomib maintenance therapy will result in improved PFS in patients with high-risk multiple myeloma following Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) compared to placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation With Ixazomib for High Risk Multiple Myeloma (BMT CTN 1302)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is designed as a Phase II, multi-center double-blind trial that randomizes patients with high risk Multiple Myeloma to Ixazomib maintenance or placebo 60-120 days after allogeneic HSCT. The primary objective of this randomized trial is to compare progression free survival from randomization as a time to event endpoint between patients randomized to Ixazomib maintenance or placebo. Secondary objectives are to describe for each treatment arm: rates of grade II-IV and III-IV Graft-Versus-Host-Disease (GVHD), chronic GVHD, best disease response rates, disease progression, transplant related mortality, overall survival, rates of Grade ≥ 3 toxicity according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0, incidence of infections, and health-related quality of life.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age ≥ 18.0 years and &lt; 66.0 years at the time of enrollment. 2. Patients must meet ONE of the criteria outlined in either a, b, c OR d: 1. Patients with high risk multiple myeloma in partial response (PR) or better at the time of enrollment with no prior progression and within 18 months from initiation of systemic antimyeloma therapy, which may include single or planned tandem autologous HSCT. [High risk is defined by the presence of any one of the following: deletion of chromosome 13 by conventional cytogenetics, hypodiploidy, abnormality in chromosome 1(1q amplification or 1p deletion), t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20) or deletion of 17p by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or conventional karyotyping; high risk criteria based on commercially available gene expression profiling (GEP) ; and elevated beta2 microglobulin (≥ 5.5 mg/L at diagnosis), detected at any time prior to enrollment]; or 2. Patients with high risk multiple myeloma (criterion 3a above) in very good partial response (VGPR) or better at the time of enrollment with at most 1 prior progression within 18 months from initiation of systemic antimyeloma therapy, which may include single or planned tandem autologous HSCT; or 3. Patients with standard risk multiple myeloma in VGPR or better at the time of enrollment with 1 prior progression within 18 months from a single or planned tandem autologous HSCT; or 4. Patients with primary plasma cell leukemia in VGPR or better at the time of enrollment with no prior disease progression and within 18 months prior to initiation of antimyeloma therapy which may include single or planned tandem autologous transplant . 3. Patients must have a related or unrelated peripheral blood stem cell donor that meet one of the following criteria: 1. A sibling donor who is a 6/6 match at HLAA and B (intermediate or higher resolution) and DRB1 (at high resolution using DNAbased typing) and must be willing to donate peripheral blood stem cells and meet institutional criteria for donation OR 2. A related donor (other than sibling) who is a 8/8 match for HLAA, B, C (at intermediate or higher resolution) and DRB1 (at high resolution using DNAbased typing) and must be willing to donate peripheral blood stem cells and meet institutional criteria for donation OR 3. An unrelated donor who is an 8/8 match at HLAA, B, C, and DRB1 (at high resolution using DNAbased typing) and must be willing to donate peripheral blood stem cells and meet institutional criteria for donation. 4. Cardiac function: Ejection fraction &gt; 40% 5. Estimated creatinine clearance greater than 40 mL/minute (using the CockcroftGault formula and actual body weight) 6. Pulmonary function: Diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) ≥ 40% (adjusted for hemoglobin) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) ≥ 50% 7. Liver function: total bilirubin &lt; 2x the upper limit of normal and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 2.5x the upper normal limit (Patients with Gilbert's Disease are permitted to exceed the defined bilirubin value of 2x the upper limit of normal, however measurements of direct bilirubin should be done to confirm this diagnosis). 8. Female subjects (unless postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, or surgically sterilized), agree to practice two (2) effective methods of contraception at the same time, or agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception) through 90 days after the last dose of maintenance therapy (see Section 2.6.2 for definition of postmenopausal). 9. Male subjects (even if surgically sterilized) must agree to one of the following: practice effective barrier contraception (see Section 2.6.4.1 for list of barrier methods), or practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of from the time of signing the informed consent through 90 days after last dose of maintenance therapy. 10. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study related procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care. 11. Able to comply with the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements. 1. Karnofsky Performance Score &lt; 70% 2. Prior allogeneic HSCT 3. Patient with purely nonsecretory multiple myeloma [absence of monoclonal protein (M protein) in serum as measured by electrophoresis and immunofixation and the absence of Bence Jones protein in the urine defined by the use of conventional electrophoresis and immunofixation techniques and the absence of involved serum free light chain &gt;100 mg/L]. 4.

Failure to have fully recovered (i.e. no toxicities &gt; Grade 1) from the reversible effects of prior chemotherapy. 19.
