	<brief_summary>Empowering Patients On Choices for Renal Replacement Therapy (EPOCH-RRT) study seeks to identify factors that matter the most to patients with kidney disease and study how they are impacted by different types of dialysis. The inclusion of patients, caregivers, and patient advocacy organizations as research partners will assure that the study addresses questions of greatest relevance to patients facing the need for dialysis. Aim two is based on preliminary results of Aim one interviews, and in collaboration with the Patient Advisory Panel, the investigators developed a brief questionnaire to be administered to participants in the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS) and Peritoneal Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (PDOPPS). Two separate versions of the questionnaire were created to reflect unique aspects of in-center hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD).</brief_summary>
