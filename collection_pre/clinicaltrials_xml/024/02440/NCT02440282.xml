	<brief_summary>Diabetic foot ulcer is the most common cause of non traumatic lower extremity amputations (LEA) associated with diabetes. Traditionally general and spinal anesthesia were the preferred modality of anesthesia. The use of sciatic nerve block has recently gained popularity, however, without the supporting evidence of any benefits. This study was to evaluate the comparison of anesthesia modalities for hemodynamic stability and postoperative pain in diabetic foot patients undergoing minor LEA.</brief_summary>
