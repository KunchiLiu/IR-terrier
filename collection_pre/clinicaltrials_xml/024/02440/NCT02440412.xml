	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the effect of a single session of Massage Therapy in salivary cortisol level. All participants were assessed on three conditions: Massage session, rest in supine position listening music, and under normal working conditions. The hypothesis of the investigators is that the effect of the massage action in reduction of cortisol is superior to only rest.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Massage Therapy in Cortisol Level</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several studies have postulated that one of the physiological markers of the effect of massage therapy is to reduce the level of cortisol, the "stress hormone". However it is not clear whether the effect is due to the manual action on the skin, or only by the relaxation induced rest. Therefore the variation of salivary cortisol in both conditions, and also in everyday working conditions was compared. Cortisol has a circadian cycle, with a maximum value upon awakening, which decreases during the morning; therefore a sample of saliva (in Salivette tube) it was collected in the three experimental conditions at the same hour time in the morning: 8:45(after intervention), and 9:30 and 10.30 (both, before).</detailed_description>
