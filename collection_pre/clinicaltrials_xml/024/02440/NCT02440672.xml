	<brief_title>JOURNEY™ II CR Total Knee System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, non-randomized, single cohort, multicenter study to evaluate the clinical outcomes of TKA using the JOURNEY™ II CR Total Knee System in subjects with degenerative joint disease (DJD) requiring primary total knee replacement. One hundred and seventy (170) subjects will be enrolled at up to 18 clinical sites globally. Follow-up clinical assessments will be performed at 3 months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, and 10 years post-operatively.</detailed_description>
