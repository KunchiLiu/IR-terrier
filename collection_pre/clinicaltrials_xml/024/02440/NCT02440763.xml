	<brief_title>The EUROSCA Natural History Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The key goal of EUROSCA-NHS is to determine and compare the rate of disease progression in SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 and SCA6. To this end, a newly developed and validated ataxia scale (Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia, SARA) will be used. EUROSCA-NHS has a number of secondary aims including determination of the order and occurrence of non-ataxia symptoms, assessment of activities of daily living (ADL) and quality of life (QoL), and identification of predictors of disease progression and survival. Substudies will deal with the development of brain atrophy, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), progression of peripheral neuropathy, as assessed by nerve conduction studies, and specific clinical aspects of SCA.</detailed_description>
