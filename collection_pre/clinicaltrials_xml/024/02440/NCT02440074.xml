	<brief_summary>This trial pretends to validate for clinical use a bioengineered product composed of mesenchymal stem cells produced by the Instituto de Biologia y Genetica Molecular (IBGM), Valladolid (MSV, which have already been approved by the Spanish Regulatory Agency for three previous clinical trials) and a cross-linked matrix of autologous plasma patented by The Blood and Tissue Bank of Asturias (WO2008/ 119855) for bone maxillary cysts refilling. These two groups collaborate in the present project with the team of Maxillofacial Surgery of the Hospital Universitario del RÃ­o Hortega, who leads the clinical trial and deals with the medical aspects. The proposed trial is based on positive results obtained in previous animal studies performed by the present multidisciplinary team. A phase I / II clinical trial with 10 patients suffering from bone cysts in the maxillofacial region is proposed. Autologous mesenchymal stem cells isolated from a bone marrow sample will be seeded in the autologous plasma matrix and cultivated for 3 weeks. At this time, the cyst will be removed by surgery and the cavity filled with the protein matrix containing the mesenchymal cells. Follow up tests will be conducted at 3 weeks, 3 and 6 months following the evolution of the cavity by panoramic radiography and computerized tomography scan.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The proposed test is based on previous animal experiments with positive results by the multidisciplinary team applicant, whose results are presented in paragraph 2.6 (group results Valladolid) and Annex I (group results Oviedo). The investigators propose phase I-II trial with 10 patients with a common condition and difficult to solve volumetric regeneration therapies, such as bone cysts in the maxillofacial region. Autologous mesenchymal cells isolated from a sample obtained from the cancellous bone of the tuberosity intraoral mandibular later and after expansion, will be conveyed in the matrix of autologous serum. The total process takes 6-8 weeks. After this time, perform the osteotomy and enucleation of the cyst under local anesthesia and the residual cavity is filled with bioimplant containing the MSV-H. Once the bioimplant, there will be clinical controls at 2 weeks, 2 and 6 months, to follow the evolution of regeneration by bone cavity in panoramic radiograph and CT scan. This project proposes a novel approach to therapy twice, combining a tissue engineering protocol (bioimplant) consisting of autologous mesenchymal cells have already been approved by the unit cell production of Valladolid (MSV-H), and a new protein matrix obtained autologous serum crosslinked in order to stimulate the regenerative capacity of maxillary cystic bone defects.</detailed_description>
