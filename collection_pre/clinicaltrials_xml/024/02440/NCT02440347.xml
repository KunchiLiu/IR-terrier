	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to investigate and compare pulpal anesthesia and cardiovascular parameters obtained with 0.6 ml of 4% articaine with epinephrine (1:100.000) for anterior and middle superior alveolar nerve (AMSA) block performed by standard and computer-controlled delivery in healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Articaine Computer-controlled and Conventional Delivery for Anterior and Middle Superior Alveolar Nerve Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traditionally, pulpal anesthesia is obtained by infiltration or mandibular nerve block. However, it is not always possible to achieve complete pulpal anesthesia with previously mentioned anesthetic techniques. It is well documented that administration of 0,6-0,9 ml of anesthetic solution with palatal approach with anterior middle superior injection (AMSA) provided successful pulpal anesthesia from central incisor to second premolar. In addition, palatal soft tissues from midpalate to free gingiva and from central incisor to first molar are fully anesthetized with AMSA. The injection site is located at a point that bisects the maxillary first and second premolars, and midway between the crest of the free gingival margin and mid-palatine suture. The needle is orientated at a 45-degree angle with the bevel facing the palatal tissue. AMSA presents intraosseous anesthetic technique. Traditionally, palatal injection administered with conventional syringe was described as very painful. On the other hand, computer controlled local anesthetic delivery system (CCLADS) has been recommended for AMSA as a system which allows slow administration of anesthetic solution, with constant pressure. It was shown that AMSA do not provide undesired buccal and upper lip anesthesia. The AMSA technique has been recommended for proceÂ¬dures ranging from operative restorations, crown preparation to scaling and root planning. The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare parameters of pulpal anesthesia and cardiovascular function after AMSA injection of 4% articaine with epinephrine (1:100.000), delivered by conventional syringe or CCLADS. Study sample will comprise 30 healthy (ASA1) volunteers who will receive 0.6 ml 4% articaine with epinephrine (1:100.000) by conventional syringe, and after two-week washout period the same amount of local anesthetic by CCLADS. Parameters of pulpal and soft tissue anesthesia (onset and duration) for all maxillary teeth on the anesthetized side, as well as parameters of cardiovascular function (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate) will be monitored and compared.</detailed_description>
