	<brief_summary>Low-phenylalanine diets are commonly prescribed to people with phenylketonuria (PKU), an inborn disease which causes accumulation of amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) in the blood. High blood Phe levels can cause mental, behavioural, neurological, and physical problems. Thus, low-phenylalanine diets help patients to manage their condition but it is not clear whether they have an impact on appetite, energy intake and changes in body weight. This is important to explore as prevalence of obesity in this population is rising high. This study aims to find out the effect of PKU-type meals on appetite, appetite biomarkers, and post-meal energy expenditure. The investigators will recruit 26 healthy adults and ask them to participate in two experimental trials. On one occasion the participants will be asked to consume a PKU-supplemented drink followed by a PKU type-lunch and on another occasion the supplement and lunch will be based on normally consumed foods. Series of blood samples will be taken and appetite will be assessed during both experiments. Both experimental trials will finish with consuming an "all-you-can-eat" buffet.</brief_summary>
