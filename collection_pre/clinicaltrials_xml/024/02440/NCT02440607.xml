	<brief_summary>Clinical decision support tools with in the electronic medical record can improve clinical care processes. To date, there is little evidence evaluating crisis management with such decision support tools. The investigators aim to create an electronic cognitive aid with embedded decision support to aid clinicians during the management of a crisis. In order to test the effectiveness of this tool, investigators seek to compare the simulated medical management of a crisis (malignant hyperthermia) using a traditional cognitive aid (laminated card) versus a dynamic electronic visual aid with decision support.</brief_summary>
