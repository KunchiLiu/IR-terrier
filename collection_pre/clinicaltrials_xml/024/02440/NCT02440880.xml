	<brief_summary>Nowadays Cesarean sections became the most popular surgery worldwide with the consumption of the hospital resources and the continuous need to decrease the costs, work load and medical stuff engagement. One of the most common problem is the need to control pain post operatively, this issue increase the work load over the pain management team and increase lead to patient in satisfaction. This study will test the usage of dexamethasone with different doses (4 and 8 mg) either locally or intravenously (I.V.) with the local anesthetics in TAP (transversus abdominis plane) block to prolong the duration of the block and decrease the need of post-operative analgesics.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Nowadays Cesarean sections became the most popular surgery worldwide with the consumption of the hospital resources and the continuous need to decrease the costs, work load and medical stuff engagement. One of the most common problem is the need to control pain post operatively, this issue increase the work load over the pain management team and increase lead to patient in satisfaction.(1,2,3) The presence of the adjuvant which can be added to the conventional anesthetic medications can prolong the duration of action and decrease the need for frequent post-operative analgesics.(4,5) The idea of adding a catheter or placing an epidural catheter still have a quite limitation regarding the patients compliance, delayed ambulation and high costs, these limitations redirect the anesthetist again to the use of adjuvant with a single shot block to prolong the duration of it and decrease the need of subsequent analgesics.(6) Dexamethasone proved to be an effective adjuvant in prolongation of the nerve blocks with the question regarding the proper route and dose (7,8,9,10). This study will test the usage of dexamethasone with different doses (4 and 8 mg) either locally or intravenously (I.V.) with the local anesthetics in TAP (transversus abdominis plane) block to prolong the duration of the block and decrease the need of post-operative analgesics.</detailed_description>
