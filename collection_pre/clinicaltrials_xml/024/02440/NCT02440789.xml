	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out about the safety of sirolimus in individuals with HIV infection who are also being treated with ART. The investigators want to learn whether sirolimus will decrease inflammation and immune activation in the body; whether sirolimus will change the level of HIV in the participants' blood; and how sirolimus interacts with ART in the blood. Sirolimus is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to prevent organ rejection in patients aged 13 years and older receiving kidney transplants. Sirolimus has also been used for the prevention of complications after stem cell transplants and as a treatment for certain kinds of cancers in HIV-infected patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>HIV1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV1 antigen, plasma HIV1 RNA viral load. NOTE: The term "licensed" refers to a US FDAapproved kit, which is required for all investigational new drug (IND) studies. WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or different test principle (eg, indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV1 RNA viral load. Currently on continuous ART for ≥24 months prior to study entry. This is defined as continuous active therapy for the 24month period prior to study entry with no treatment interruption longer than 5 consecutive days and a total duration off treatment of no more than 7 days in the 90 days prior to study entry. CD4+ cell count ≥400 cells/mm3 obtained within 60 days prior to study entry at any US laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent, or at any networkapproved nonUS laboratory that operates in accordance with Good Clinical Laboratory Practices (GCLP) and participates in appropriate external quality assurance programs. Plasma HIV1 RNA below the level of quantification (eg, &lt;20, &lt;40, &lt;50, or &lt;75 copies/mL depending on the assay) for ≥24 months by any US laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent, or at any networkapproved nonUS laboratory that operates in accordance with GCLP and participates in appropriate external quality assurance programs. Participants must have at least one documented HIV1 RNA below the level of quantification obtained 1224 months prior to screening and one HIV1 RNA less than the level of quantification obtained within 12 months prior to the screening HIV1 RNA. NOTE: One month = 30 days. Plasma HIV1 RNA measurements above the limit of quantification but &lt;200 copies/mL in the 24 months prior to screening are allowed if directly followed by HIV1 RNA below assay limit, but none in the 6 months prior to screening. Plasma HIV1 RNA level of &lt;40 copies/mL obtained by the Abbott real time assay or &lt;20 copies/mL by the Roche COBAS TaqMan HIV1 Test, Version 2.0 assay within 60 days prior to study entry at any laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent. For females of reproductive potential (defined as women who have not been postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months or documentation that the woman has undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or salpingectomy), negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 48 hours prior to study entry. NOTE: Patientreported history is acceptable documentation of hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy, tubal ligation, tubal microinserts, vasectomy, and menopause. Females of reproductive potential who are participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy must agree to initiate effective contraceptives before sirolimus therapy, continue use during sirolimus therapy, and maintain use for at least 12 weeks after sirolimus therapy has been stopped. Female subjects and/or their male partners MUST agree to use appropriately at least one of the following: Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide Intrauterine device (IUD) Tubal ligation Hormonebased contraceptive NOTE: Sexual activity with an infertile partner is not sexual activity that can lead to pregnancy. Females on hormonebased contraceptives at study entry must have been on the same method for at least 90 days prior to study entry. Ability and willingness of subject or legal guardian/representative to provide informed consent. Laboratory evaluations obtained within 60 days prior to entry by any US laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent, or at any networkapproved nonUS laboratory that operates in accordance with GCP and participates in appropriate external quality assurance programs. White blood cell (WBC) ≥3000/mm3 Platelet count ≥125,000/mm3 ANC &gt;1300/mm3 Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt;1.25 x ULN Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;1.25 x ULN Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥60 mL/min as estimated by the CockcroftGault equation: For men, (140 age in years) x (body weight in kg) ÷ (serum creatinine in mg/dL x 72) = CrCl (mL/min)* For women, multiply the result by 0.85 = CrCl (mL/min) NOTE: A program to assist in calculations is available on the DMC website at: http://www.fstrf.org/ACTG/ccc.html Fasting or nonfasting triglyceride level ≤350 mg/dL Fasting or nonfasting LDL &lt;160 mg/dL Urine protein to urine creatinine ratio ≤1 gram from random urine collection Serious illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization until subject either completes therapy or is clinically stable on therapy in the opinion of the site investigator for at least 30 days prior to study entry.
