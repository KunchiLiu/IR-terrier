	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies the use of gallium-68 (68Ga)-DOTA-Bombesin positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in imaging patients with prostate cancer. PET uses a radioactive substance called 68Ga-DOTA-Bombesin, which attaches to tumor cells with specific receptors on their surfaces. The PET scanner takes pictures that capture where the radioactive drug is "lighting up" and attaching to tumor cells, which may help doctors recognize differences between tumor and healthy prostate tissue. MRI uses radio waves and a magnet to make a picture of areas inside the body. Using 68Ga-DOTA-Bombesin in diagnostic procedures, such as PET/MRI, may allow doctors to identify smaller tumors than standard imaging.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the feasibility and biodistribution of 68Ga-DOTA-Bombesin (BAY 86-7548 or 68Ga-DOTA RM2). OUTLINE: Patients receive 68Ga-DOTA-Bombesin intravenously (IV) and then undergo PET/MRI approximately 60 later. After completion of study, patients are followed up at 24 hours and 1 week.</detailed_description>
