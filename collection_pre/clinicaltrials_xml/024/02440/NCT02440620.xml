	<brief_summary>This study will describe the epidemiology including prognosis of heart failure related to treatment with anthracycline and trastuzumab for breast cancer. In a prospective study Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer patients scheduled for trastuzumab treatment at Odense University Hospital, will be offered advanced echocardiographic examination, test of bio-markers and genetic markers for the purpose of investigating if early identification of patients in particular risk of developing heart failure is feasible.</brief_summary>
