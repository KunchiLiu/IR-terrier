	<brief_summary>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the fourth cause of death in the Western world. Surgery remains the only treatment offering an advantage in terms of overall survival (5-year survival range, 15-25%), but unfortunately only 10-20% of patients present resectable disease at the time of diagnosis. Since the approval of gemcitabine as a standard treatment for advanced pancreatic patients, no drug or combination of drugs has significantly improved the prognosis. Recently, as compared with gemcitabine, FOLFIRINOX was associated with a survival advantage (11.1 vs 6.8 months), but had increased toxicity. In some retrospective studies, modified FOLFIRINOX regimen (60/120 mg/m2 of oxaliplatin and irinotecan) has an improved safety profile in digestive malignancies. The purpose of this phase II multicenter study was to investigate the efficacy and safety in patients with pancreatic cancer who progressed in gemcitabine-based first line chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
