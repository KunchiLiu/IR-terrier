	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes is the chronic disease with the most important development in France, and particularly in the Saint-Etienne area due to his specific population. Different studies showed the interest of screening targeted on high risk population to reduce cardiovascular risks and mortality. The current screening recommandation is an opportunist targeted screening on population older than 45 years with risk factors by a fasting glucose every 3 years, and a communautaire screening targeted on population older than 45 years suffering precarity with or without risk factors by capillary blood glucose or fasting glucose. The objective of the Saint√© Diabete network is to optimize the screening of diabetics, their follow-up and their treatments. Using a self-administered questionnaire during a medical visit could be a simple, cheap and efficient tool to detect diabetics as soon as possible.</brief_summary>
