	<brief_summary>This non-interventional study will include a representative sample of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-mutations in Greece. Eligible NSCLC patients, for whom the physician has decided to initiate treatment with the study medication (afatinib, GIOTRIF®) will be treated according to the local prescribing information and standard medical practice in terms of visit frequency and types of assessments performed. The study will investigate the impact of GIOTRIF (Afatinib) on patients' disease-related symptom burden and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in a real world clinical setting in Greece.The Average Symptom Burden Index (ASBI) score of the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) in eligible patients, after 6 months of therapy, will be analyzed. The overall study duration period is expected to be 48 months, including a 36-month enrollment period and a minimum 12-month follow-up period.</brief_summary>
