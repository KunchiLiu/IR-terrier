	<brief_summary>The nucleus accumbens (NAcc) has a significant role in the process of opiate addiction and the initiation of relapse after detoxification. There is evidence that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the NAcc exerts a positive effect on individuals with severe heroin addiction via inhibitory action . The investigators hypothesise that bilateral stimulation of the NAcc will significantly reduce withdrawal symptoms and thus enable the patients to substantially decrease their Levomethadone usage.</brief_summary>
