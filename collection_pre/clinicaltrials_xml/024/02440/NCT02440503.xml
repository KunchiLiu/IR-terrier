	<brief_summary>The investigators research group conducted a feeding study in 2012 (IRB 07-0003) that included breastfed infants consuming different infant solid foods. The investigators results showed that different solid foods, especially the protein content of the food, is important on infant's gut bacteria profile and growth. Although the first year of life is critical in obesity development later in life, data are very limited on the effect of protein from solid foods, an important component of infant diet, especially in breast-fed infants. In this study, the investigators will re-contact these participants, who are now in their early childhood (~5 years old), to evaluate the long-term effect of various macronutrient quantities in solid foods, by assessing the participants' growth, body composition, and gut bacteria profile.</brief_summary>
