	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess and explain (at least apart) anorectal disorders of patients with Spina Bifida by an automatic neuropathy responsive of enteric nervous system and epithelial barrier dysfunctions. The investigators' aim hypothetics is that autonomic neuropathy of patients with Spina Bifida induce enteric nervous sytem and epithelial barrier dysfunctions which explain anorectal disorders of these patients. Thexpect to show a decreased of 5% of enteric neurons per ganglia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anorectal Dysfunction in Patients Suffering From Spina Bifida : From Clinic to Neuro-epithelial Function (ANOSPIN)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spina Bifida is rare disease related to a failure of the closure of neural tube during the embryonic period. This malformation results in a variety of clinical disorders (neurologic, urologic, orthopedic, anorectal), depending on the level of the spinal cord lesion. Anorectal functional disorders remain underestimated and unknown from a pathophysiological point of view with subsequent uncodified therapeutic strategy. Patients with Spina Bifida always present autonomic neuropathy that contributes partially to the anorectal disorders. These disorders may be related to a closed relationship between autonomic and enteric nervous system. Both nervous systems play a key role in anorectal disorders during others neurological disaeses have a common and simultaneous development from neural crest and induce colonic epithelial changes related to the closed connection between epithelial barrier and enteric nervous system. All of this remains hypothetic because no data regarding the impairment of enteric nervous system and epithelial barrier are available and no study are ongoing on this topic.</detailed_description>
