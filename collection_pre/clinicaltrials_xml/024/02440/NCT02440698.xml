Participants (n=80) are employees of a large multi-national food company's R&amp;D division located in Australia, Switzerland, USA and the UK. They underwent a genetic test for personalized nutrition in March 2015 that was offered at no cost through the company wellness program. A registered dietitian completed a pre-test consultation and disclosed the test results with DNA-based dietary advice. The test provided information on 7 components of diet and additional information on individual risk for gluten intolerance.</brief_summary>
