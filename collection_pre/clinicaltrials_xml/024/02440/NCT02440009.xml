	<brief_summary>The study evaluates the addition of itraconazole to glucocorticoids in management of acute stages of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). Half of the participants will receive glucocorticoids while the other half will receive itraconazole and glucocorticoids</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial of Itraconazole in Acute Stages of Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The management of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) includes two important aspects namely institution of immunosuppressive therapy in the form of glucocorticoids to control the immunologic activity, and close monitoring for detection of relapses. Another possible target is to use antifungal agents to attenuate the fungal burden secondary to the fungal colonization in the airways. Oral corticosteroids are currently the treatment of choice for ABPA associated with bronchial asthma. They not only suppress the immune hyperfunction but are also anti-inflammatory. Itraconazole, an oral triazole with relatively low toxicity, is active against Aspergillus spp. in vitro and in vivo. The activity of itraconazole against Aspergillus spp. is more than that of ketoconazole. The administration of itraconazole can eliminate Aspergillus in the airways and can theoretically reduce the allergic responses in ABPA. We hypothesize that itraconazole when given in the acute stages of ABPA will decrease the chances of relapse and progression to glucocorticoid-dependent ABPA.</detailed_description>
