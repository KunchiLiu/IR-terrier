	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to compare the functional capacity of exercise by six-minute walk test before and after thoracic surgical procedure in subjects who have undergone the Fast-track protocol with those who were under conventional care. Researchers want to find out if Fast-track is a strategy to enhance functional capacity after thoracic surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Postoperatory Recovery in Thoracic Surgical Procedure, Fast-track Protocol vs. Conventional Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fast track programs represents a new approach to the management of patients undergoing surgery. It is perioperative care pathway designed to achieve early recovery and helps to minimize postoperative morbidity and mortality. These multimodal approaches focuses on enhancing recovery and reducing of surgical stress by minimal invasive surgery, optimized pain relief, early nutrition and ambulation. In postoperative, the bed rest leads to the increase in muscle loss and weakness, impairs pulmonary function, predisposes to venous stasis and thromboembolism, increases infection complications and reduces functional capacity. However, information on the results of Fast-track protocols in functional capacity of exercise during hospital stay is sparse. The six-minute walk test is use to measure of functional capacity of exercise in different populations and to detect changes after interventions. The distances traveled in two six-minute walk test (preoperative and postoperative) will be compared between the two groups (Fast-track and Conventional). In this trial the investigators will consider Fast-track protocol to be feasible to enhance functional capacity of exercise after thoracic surgery.</detailed_description>
