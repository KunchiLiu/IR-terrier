	<brief_summary>Flexors tendon injuries are frequent and serious with a potential of definitive functional aftereffects. In the case of partial injury, the treatment is debated. There are 2 techniques of possible repair, the direct suture and the tangential resection. The investigators have already demonstrated that this last technique was favorable for injuries going to 50 %. In the case of partial section between 50 and 75 %, the investigators think that the technique of tangential resection compared with the direct suture would not increase the risks of secondary breaks, would authorize even an immediate mobilization and would decrease the secondary complications. The main objective is to highlight that the tangential resection is not lower than the classic technique on the clinical plan The secondary objectives are to highlight the non-inferiority of the tangential technique in clinical terms (pains, dexterity, complications), radiologics (MRI, ultrasound) and functional (function, go back to leisures and professional activities)</brief_summary>
