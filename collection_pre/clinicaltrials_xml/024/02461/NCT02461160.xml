	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-915. TAK-915 is being tested to find a safe and well-tolerated dose. This study will look at the pharmacokinetic characteristics (how the drug acts throughout the body) of the drug and safety and tolerability (lab results, vital signs, ECG, and side effects) in healthy people (including elderly) who take TAK-915. The study will enroll a total of approximately 112 patients. This study is designed to consist of 5 different dosing schedules: single rising dose (SRD), multiple rising dose (MRD), drug-drug interaction (DDI), bioavailability and food effect (BA/FE), and Elderly Subject Single Dose (ESSD). The study population for SRD will consist of 48 participants enrolled into 6 cohorts. Each cohort will have 8 randomized participants, with 6 receiving a single dose of TAK-915, and 2 receiving matching placebo under fasted conditions. The starting dose is 30 mg. The dose for Cohorts 2 through 6 will be determined based on data collected from previous cohorts. The study population for MRD will consist of 32 participants enrolled into 4 cohorts. Each cohort will have 8 randomized participants, with 6 receiving one dose of TAK-915 on Day 1 and daily dosing on Days 8-14, and 2 receiving matching placebo under fasted conditions. The dose for each cohort in Part 2 will be determined based on data collected from completed SRD cohorts of the study. The study population for DDI will consist of 12 participants enrolled into 1 cohort. All participants will receive one dose of TAK-915 on Day 3 and daily dosing on Days 10-16 under fasted conditions. All participants will also receive a single dose of Midazolam 2 mg on Day 1 and Day 16. The dose of TAK-915 in this cohort will be determined based on data collected from SRD cohorts and will be the same dose that is administered in MRD Cohort 8. The study population for BA/FE will consist of 12 participants enrolled into 1 cohort. TAK-915 will be administered in 3 single-dose regimens in a 3-way crossover design using 50 mg oral dose treatments (Regimen A: TAK915 50 mg oral suspension formulation in fasted state; Regimen B: TAK-915 50 tablet formulation in fated state; Regimen C: TAK-915 50 tablet formulation in fated state). TAK-915 dosing will occur on Day 1 of each treatment period followed by a 14 day washout period. The study population for ESSD will consist of 8 elderly participants (ages 65-75 years) enrolled into 1 cohort. All 8 participants will receive a single dose of TAK-915 50 mg suspension under fasted conditions. This single-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 70 days. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic including a period of confinement to the clinic and will be contacted by telephone 12 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. In the opinion of the investigator, the participant is capable of understanding and complying with protocol requirements. 2. The participant or, when applicable, the participant's legally acceptable representative signs and dates a written, informed consent form and any required privacy authorization prior to the initiation of any study procedures including requesting that a participant fast for any laboratory evaluations. 3. Is a healthy man or woman, aged 18 to 55 years, inclusive at the time of informed consent and first study medication dose for all cohorts will be included. Note that Cohort 12 will enroll healthy, elderly men and women, aged 65 to 75 years, inclusive. 4. Weighs at least 50 kg and has a body mass index (BMI) from 18.0 to 35.0 kg/m^2, inclusive at Screening. 5. A male participant who is nonsterilized and sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential agrees to use adequate contraception from signing of informed consent throughout the duration of the study and for 12 weeks after last dose. 6. A female participant with no childbearing potential, defined as the participant has been surgically sterilized (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation) or who are postmenopausal (defined as continuous amenorrhea of at least 2 y ears and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt;40 IU/L). 1. Has received any investigational compound within 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication. 2. Has received TAK915 in a previous clinical study or as a therapeutic agent. 3. Is an immediate family member, study site employee, or is in a dependent relationship with a study site employee who is involved in the conduct of this study (eg, spouse, parent, child, sibling) or may consent under duress. 4. Has uncontrolled, clinically significant neurologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, metabolic, gastrointestinal, urologic, immunologic, endocrine disease, or psychiatric disorder, or other abnormality, which may impact the ability of the participant to participate or potentially confound the study results. 5. Has a known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation of TAK915 and/or midazolam. 6. If female, the participant is of childbearing potential (eg. premenopausal, not sterilized). 7. Has a positive urine drug result for drugs of abuse at Screening or Checkin (Day 1). 8.
