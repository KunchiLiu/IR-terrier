	<brief_summary>ELITE (Eliminate Thromboembolism: Improving Anticoagulation in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation Patients) is a two year research project to assess warfarin management issues faced by atrial fibrillation (AF) patients in ambulatory settings.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Eliminate Thromboembolism: Improving Anticoagulation in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ELITE will be a prospective, multicenter observational study of 500 participants to characterize demographics, comorbidities, risk profiles, socioeconomic status, and patient preferences related to anticoagulation management. The primary study endpoint will be warfarin discontinuation without resumption as documented in the medical record. Secondary outcomes of interest include warfarin adherence and factors associated with suboptimal adherence and/or permanent discontinuation. Clinical data, including demographics, medical history, and comorbidities, will be abstracted and entered by site coordinators. An internal survey developed by Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI) will be administered to patients during regularly scheduled clinic visits. Survey items will include patient treatment priorities, perceived risk of bleeding and/or stroke, barriers to adherence, and treatment satisfaction. Subjects will complete a survey at baseline and at the followup visit closest to 6 months after enrollment. This study will provide the foundation for numerous potential future questions about medication adherence and barriers to treatment, such as a survey on physician preferences/ shared decision-making (concordance between physician and patient preferences), followup to capture clinical events, and interventions to improve long-term medication adherence in AF.</detailed_description>
