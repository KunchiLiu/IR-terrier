	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine cross-sectional and longitudinal medical, behavioral, and cognitive differences between PTEN ASD and other groups, as well as to identify cognitive, neural systems, and molecular biomarkers specific to PTEN ASD. In addition, this study will be creating and maintaining a biorepository and linked phenotypic database for PTEN ASD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Natural History Study of Individuals With Autism and Germline Heterozygous PTEN Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a set of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by social communication/interaction impairments and restricted/repetitive behaviors. ASD associated with germline heterozygous PTEN mutations (PTEN ASD) is a genetically defined sub-group that, may be one of the more prevalent genetic disorders contributing to ASD (0.5-2%). The purpose of this research study is to carefully track the phenotypic and molecular characteristics of PTEN ASD and identify biomarkers for intervention studies. Individuals with PTEN ASD (ages 3 to 21), with macrocephalic ASD without a PTEN mutation (macro-ASD), healthy controls, and individuals with PTEN mutations without ASD (PTEN no-ASD) will be asked to participate in this study. Both males and females will be asked to participate. Additionally, to be eligible for study participation, individuals' primary communicative language must be English. The study involves 5 visits (3 on site visits) over the course of two years. Study visits will vary in length from about 4 hours to 6 hours. Study visits involve a physical exam, medical history questions and neuropsychological assessments and a blood draw done for laboratory studies. Individuals who have a clinically indicated MRI will have their scan extended for 15 minutes as part of this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Individuals ages 3 to 21 years old at the time of consent who have documentation of a clinical diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder diagnosis and/or a verified PTEN mutation from a medical or mental health professional for inclusion in the PTEN ASD, PTEN noASD or ASD macrocephaly groups. Macrocephaly (head circumference greater than or equal to 98th percentile) for inclusion in the ASD macrocephaly group. Youth ages 317 and adults age 1821 who do not have an autism spectrum disorder or a PTEN mutation for inclusion in the control group. Consent from parents or guardians or an adult with or suspected of having an autism spectrum disorder that does not require a legal guardian or an adult who is the healthy sibling of an individual with an autism spectrum disorder. Youths who are able (some young or severely impaired participants may not be able to provide assent) will be asked to provide assent. Families with multiple children who meet the above inclusion criteria will be permitted to have as many children participate as they wish. A separate consent form will be filled out for each child enrolled in the study. Primary communicative language must be English Clinically significant medical disease that would prohibit participation in the study procedures. Individuals with contraindication to MRI will be excluded from the MRI portion of the study such as: 1. Cardiac pacemaker. 2. Intracranial aneurysm clips, metallic implants or external clips within 10 mm of the head. 3. Implanted metallic devices such as pumps or neurostimulator devices. 4. Metallic foreign material within the orbits. 5. Pregnancy. 6. Claustrophobia. No history of significant brain lesions or pathology including: 1. History of large vessel strokes, brain tumors or previous neurosurgery.</criteria>
