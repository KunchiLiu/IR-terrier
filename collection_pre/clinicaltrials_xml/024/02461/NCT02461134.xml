	<brief_summary>Chronic graft versus host diseasre (GVHD) is a serious reaction that might occur in a person (the host) who has received cells or organs (graft) from another person because the graft attacks the host's cells. Currently there are no approved therapies for chronic GVHD in the USA, and patients with chroninc GVHD are treated with immunosuppressant drugs. T-lymphocytes (a type of white blood cells) are likely to play a role in the development of chronic GVHD. Due to the capacity of ponesimod to block the traffic of T-lymphocytes, ponesimod may be a new therapeutic approach to treat chroninc GVHD. The main objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of several doses of ponesimod in subjects with chronic GVHD who did not respond to standard available treatments.</brief_summary>
