	<detailed_description>The leading cause of liver disease for both adults and children in the US is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), an obesity-related liver disease closely associated with the metabolic syndrome. NAFLD increases the risk of liver disease but also increases risk of type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the metabolic syndrome. Invasive liver biopsy has been considered the best diagnostic tool for confirming NAFLD. This study will establish magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) / magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) as a quantitative noninvasive "virtual biopsy" and benefit the health of children with liver diseases by decreasing risk and improving diagnosis. Specifically, in NAFLD, this fat quantification protocol will be broadly useful in future research studies, including therapies for NAFLD as well as for patient diagnosis and follow-up.</detailed_description>
