	<brief_title>Cabergoline Versus GnRH Antagonist Rescue and Cabergoline in the Prevention of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is the most serious complication of assisted reproduction. Complications of OHSS include vascular thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, renal failure, electrolyte disturbances, ascites, hydrothorax ,torsion of the ovary, abortion or rarely death. Previous studies revealed that converting a long GnRH agonist cycle to an GnRH antagonist cycle (GnRH antagonist rescue) reduced the risk of OHSS. Other studies revealed that cabergoline (potent dopamine receptor agonist on D2 receptors)was effective in preventing OHSS. The aim of study is to compare the efficacy of GnRH antagonist rescue combined with cabergoline with cabergoline in the prevention of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in high risk patients undergoing ovarian stimulation for IVF-ET with long GnRH agonist protocol.</detailed_description>
