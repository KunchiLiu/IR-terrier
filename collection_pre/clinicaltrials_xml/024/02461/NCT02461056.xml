	<brief_summary>Intravenous form of ibuprofen is recently approved by FDA and reports are rare on the co-administration with opioids. The investigators searched whether intravenous ibuprofen-hydromorphone combination is synergistic, additive, or infra-additive on postoperative pain using combination index (CI), dose reduction index (DRI) and isobologram.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Synergistic Effect of Ibuprofen and Hydromorphone for Postoperative Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ninety patients, undergoing breast surgery, were included in one of the three groups (Ibuprofen, Hydromorphone, Ibuprofen+Hydromorphone groups). Positive analgesic efficacy was defined as a numeric rating scale (NRS) ≤3 on a 0-10 NRS, 30 min after the drug administration. Drug was administered by the Dixon and Mood up-and-down method. Starting doses were ibuprofen 50 mg, hydromorphone 0.25 mg, or ibuprofen 25 mg + hydromorphone 0.125 mg. The maximum doses were ibuprofen 800 mg, hydromorphone 2 mg, or ibuprofen 400 mg + hydromorphone 1 mg. Combination index (CI) (additive: 0.9-1.1, synergism: &lt;0.9, antagonism: &gt;1.1), dose reduction index (DRI, a measure of how much the dose of each drug in a combination can be reduced), and isobologram were used to define the nature of their interaction.</detailed_description>
