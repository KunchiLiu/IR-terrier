	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and the ability of MK-1075 to suppress viral load (VL) in HCV-infected participants during 7 days of once daily dose administration. The primary hypothesis is at a once-daily dose that is sufficiently safe and well tolerated in HCV-infected participants, the mean maximum HCV RNA (log10 IU/mL) reduction is at least 3 log10 IU/mL as compared to baseline following multiple dose oral administration of MK-1075 in HCV genotype 1 (GT1) and genotype 3 (GT3) infected participants.</brief_summary>
