	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine whether a novel integrated cognitive-behavioral treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance dependence (i.e., Treatment for Integrated Posttraumatic Stress and Substance use; TIPSS) is more effective than cognitive-behavioral treatment for substance dependence alone with regard to PTSD symptoms and substance use quantity and frequency.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The proposed study is a randomized controlled clinical trial, comparing the efficacy of two cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions: standard CBT for substance dependence and a novel integrated CBT program for PTSD and substance dependence. The study will run for approximately 3 years. A total of 100 participants will be enrolled at a rate of 4 participants per month over 25 months to ensure that 80 participants complete the protocol (presuming 20% attrition). Each participant will attend 12 treatment sessions, meeting twice per week for 6 weeks. Treatment sessions will last 1-hour each. Primary study outcomes will include frequency and quantity of substance use and PTSD symptom severity. Substance use-related outcomes will include: rates of substance abstinence, as measured by (1) urine toxicology testing, (2) alcohol breath level analyses, and (3) participants' self-report of substance use. PTSD symptom outcomes will include symptom severity ratings as measured by clinical interview (i.e., Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale-5; CAPS-5) and self-report (Posttraumatic Checklist; PCL-5). Secondary study outcomes will include examination of mediational effects. Specifically, changes in distress tolerance, as indexed via self-report (Distress Tolerance Scale) and computer/behavioral tasks (i.e., Mirror-Tracing Task, Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task-Computerized Version, Breath-Holding Task), are expected during the course of the treatment. Changes in cue reactivity are also expected over the course of treatment, as indexed by decreased psychophysiological reactivity (heart rate, respiration rate) during script-driven imagery tasks (listening to trauma/drug related scripts vs. netural). A total of four sessions (baseline/screening and sessions 4, 8, 12) will be preceded by the laboratory sessions.</detailed_description>
