	<criteria>1. Male or Female 2. Age ≥ 50 years 3. The presence of an active choroidal neovascular lesion secondary to AMD 4. On treatment with antiVEGF therapy (Lucentis®, Eylea® or Avastin®) 5. Must have received at least 3 antiVEGF treatments over the 26week period prior to screening (Screening Visit) 6. Evidence that the macular fluid has responded to antiVEGF in the past based on OCT in the opinion of PI 7. At screening, evidence of subretinal fluid and retinal cystic changes 8. Must have received antiVEGF treatment within 10 days prior to APL2 treatment (antiVEGF can be administered on the same day of the screening visit after the screening procedures have been completed) 9. OCTs of sufficient quality to allow for the assessment of the central macular fluid can be obtained 10. Female subjects must be: Women of nonchildbearing potential (WONCBP), Or Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) with a negative pregnancy test at screening and must agree to use protocol defined methods of contraception for the duration of the study 11. Males with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use protocol defined methods of contraception and agree to refrain from donating sperm for the duration of the study 12. Willing and able to give informed consent 1. Choroidal neovascularization associated with other ocular diseases such as pathologic myopia, ocular histoplasmosis or posterior uveitis, etc 2. Decreased vision due to retinal disease not attributable to choroidal neovascularization, such as nonexudative forms of AMD, geographic atrophy, inherited retinal dystrophy, uveitis or epiretinal membrane, a vitelliformlike lesion of the outer retina (e.g., as in pattern dystrophies or basal laminar drusen), idiopathic parafoveal telangiectasis, or central serous retinopathy 3. Additional ocular diseases that have irreversibly compromised or, during followup, could likely compromise the VA of the study eye including amblyopia, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, clinically significant diabetic macular edema, severe non proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or proliferative diabetic retinopathy 4. Decreased vision due to significant media opacity such as corneal disease or cataract, or opacity precluding photography of the retina 5. Cataract surgery within three months of enrollment 6. Presence of any hemorrhage 7. History of treatment for CNV: 1. Previous PDT treatment within 30 days prior to enrollment in the study 2. Previous extrafoveal or juxtafoveal thermal laser photocoagulation within 30 days prior to enrollment in the study 8. Intraocular surgery (including lens replacement surgery) within 3 months prior to randomization 9. Medical problems that make consistent followup over the treatment period unlikely (e.g. stroke, severe MI, end stage malignancy), or in general a poor medical risk because of other systemic diseases or active uncontrolled infections 10.
