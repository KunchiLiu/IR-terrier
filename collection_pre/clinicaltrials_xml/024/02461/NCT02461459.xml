	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to characterize the developmental phenotype of ASD and ID and identify biomarkers using advanced MRI methodology predictive of ASD and ID presence and severity in pediatric patients with TSC. In addition, this study will be establishing infrastructure for the collection and storage of human bio-specimens, including genetic material, from TSC patients and their family members with ASD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Intellectual Disability (ID) Determinants in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a multi-system disease that usually exhibits a high variability in clinical findings both among and within families. About 50% of individuals with TSC develop intellectual disability (ID) and/or autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The purpose of this research study is to learn more information about ASD/ID in individuals with TSC through neurobehavioral assessments and magnetic resonance imaging so that ultimately effective treatments and interventions for ASD/ID can be realized. Individuals with TSC will be asked to participate in this study if they are between the ages of 3 and 21 years old and have been diagnosed with suspected or confirmed autism spectrum disorder and/or intellectual disability. Both males and females will be asked to participate. Additionally, to be eligible for study participation, individuals' primary communicative language must be English. Also, the participant and at least one biological parent will be asked to provide biological specimens including DNA and RNA for inclusion in the TSC RDCRN Biorepository. The study involves 5 visits (3 on site visits) over the course of two years. Study visits will vary in length from about 4 hours to 6 hours. Study visits involve a physical exam, medical history questions and neuropsychological assessments. Blood will be drawn during the baseline visit for DNA and RNA studies. Individuals with TSC have annual MRI scans as clinically indicated. The clinical scan will be extended for 15 minutes as part of this study.</detailed_description>
