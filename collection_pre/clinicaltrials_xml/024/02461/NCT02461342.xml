	<brief_summary>A large-scale, community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted to explore the extent to which genetic, environment and its interactions associated with cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) in general Chinese population. A total of more than 2000 participants were recruited by using multiple stages sampling (first cluster sampling and then simply sampling). Data involved in variables of genetic, environment were collected. Every participants was complete DNA extracted and genotyped by using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Cardiovascular autonomic functions were measured by using short-term heart rate variability (HRV) to evaluate the outcome of CAN. Genetic analysis were employed to evaluate genetic variants, environmental risk factors and its interactions for CAN.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Survey Chinese participants with undiagnosed CAN Aged 3090 years, were included in this study. Some subjects were excluded from the study to eliminate potential confounding factors that may have influenced their CA function. Briefly, the exclusion criteria were as follows: 1. history or findings of arrhythmia and hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism 2. pregnancy or lactation 3. serious hepatic or renal dysfunctions (GFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2). Of these subjects, complete baseline data were obtained for 2,092 (69.46%) of the participants.</criteria>
