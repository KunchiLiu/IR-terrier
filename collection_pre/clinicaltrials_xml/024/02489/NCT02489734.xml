	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the incidence of emergence delirium will be reduced when end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane decreases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post Extubation Delirium and End-tidal Sevoflurane Concentration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sevoflurane induction and maintenance were selected. Intubation was performed after lidocaine spray on vocal cord. After that, an effective caudal or brachial plexus block was performed. End-tidal concentration of sevoflurane was maintained at 2.5%. Spontaneous respiratory was maintained. Sevoflurane was stopped after the end of surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups: high concentration group (Group HC, end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane when extubating &gt;=0.5%) and low concentration group (Group LC, end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane when extubating &lt;0.5%). Patients in Group LC were extubated when they coughed or purposeful movement appeared. The patients whose end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane &gt;= 0.5% were excluded. Patients in Group HC were extubated when any of the criteria was met: 1.the patient coughed or purposeful movement appeared 2.end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane decreased to 0.5%. A trained nurse (blind to groups) recorded PAEDs scores in PACU.</detailed_description>
