	<brief_summary>Appreciation of the central role for arterial vasodilatation in the pathogenesis of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) has led to routine use of vasoconstrictors in combination with albumin as a medical therapy for HRS. Terlipressin have been explored but the optimal approach for such therapies has not yet been established. As compared with albumin, treatment with terlipressin and albumin is effective in improving renal function in patients with cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome. Our previous study showed that mean arterial pressure (MAP) is a predictor of hepatorenal syndrome occurrence in cirrhotic patients with ascites. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of targeting an early and substantial increase in mean arterial pressure in the prevention of type 2 HRS.</brief_summary>
