	<brief_summary>Standard treatment for AL Amyloidosis is high-dose melphalan and stem cell transplant. This study will compare the safety and effectiveness of standard treatment with high-dose melphalan and stem cell transplant, compared with investigational bortezomib when used in combination with standard treatment with high-dose melphalan and stem cell transplant for AL amyloidosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of HDM/SCT Versus HDM + Bortezomib/SCT in AL Amyloidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study seeks to enroll patients with AL amyloidosis who have been recommended for standard treatment with high-dose melphalan and stem cell transplant. Standard treatment for this disease is high-dose melphalan and stem cell transplant. The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of standard treatment with high-dose melphalan and stem cell transplant, compared with investigational bortezomib when used in combination with standard treatment with high-dose melphalan and stem cell transplant for AL amyloidosis. Patients enrolled in this study will receive either standard treatment with high-dose melphalan and stem cell transplant, or investigational bortezomib used in combination with standard treatment with high-dose melphalan and stem cell transplant.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histological diagnosis of primary systemic (AL) amyloidosis based on: Deposition of amyloid material by Congo red stain showing characteristic apple green birefringence,AND… evidence of a clonal plasma cell dyscrasia with monoclonal protein in the serum or urine by immunofixation electrophoresis studies AND/OR abnormal serum free light chain assay AND/OR clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow exam demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry or in situ hybridization AND… evidence of organ involvement other than carpal tunnel syndrome. Patients with senile, secondary, localized, dialysisrelated or familial amyloidosis are not eligible. Confirmation of tissue diagnosis at all sites of organ dysfunction is encouraged, but not required. 2. Patients must be &gt; 18 years of age. 3. Patients must have a performance status of 02 by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) criteria 4. Patients must have left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt; 45% by echocardiogram within 60 days of enrollment 5. Pulmonary Function Tests must show diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) &gt; 50%. 6. All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines. 1. Patients with recent (&lt; 6 months) myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV or arrhythmia which are refractory to medical therapy are ineligible. 2. Prior chemotherapy with alkylating agent allowed only if no evidence of Myelodysplastic Dysplastic Syndrome (MDS) morphologically or cytogenetically. Total cumulative dose of oral melphalan must be &lt; 300 mg. Patients should not have received any cytotoxic therapy &lt; 4 weeks prior to registration and should have fully recovered from the effects of such therapy. 3. Patients must not have overt multiple myeloma (&gt;30% bone marrow plasmacytosis and, extensive (&gt;2) lytic lesions and hypercalcemia). 4. No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated Stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any other cancer from which the patient has been diseasefree for 5 years. 5. Patients must not be HIV positive. 6. Pregnant or nursing women may not participate. Women and men of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method.</criteria>
