	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Vitamin D to Treat Contrast-induced Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin D is primarily generated in the skin, in response to direct absorption of ultraviolet B radiation. Vitamin D can also be obtained through fortified foods and oral supplements. Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a generally reversible form of acute kidney injury that occurs mostly within 2-3 days of exposure to contrast medium (CM). The estimated incidence of CIN ranges from 2%-50%, and coronary angiography (CAG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or both, are associated with CIN in about half of cases. Recently low vitamin D status has been shown to be associated with increased risk of CIN. However, its effects on CIN patients remain unclear. The investigators planned to determine the efficacy of vitamin D on the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients undergoing coronary angiography. This study may shed light as to whether oral vitamin D supplementation can be an adjunct therapy in CIN patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The main inclusion criteria were patients who underwent coronary angiography. The exclusion criteria were as follows: patients with chronic renal failure, chronic liver disease, bone disorders, and/or thyroid disorders. Patients were also excluded if they were taking vitamin D3 tablets or other lipidregulating drugs.</criteria>
