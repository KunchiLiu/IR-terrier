	<brief_summary>To evaluate the following safety and efficacy parameters for VM-1500: - Decrease in viral load to non-quantifiable level (&lt;50 copies/ml) at Week 12 (Stage I) - Decrease in viral load to non-quantifiable level (&lt;50 copies/ml) at Week 24 (Stage II) - Decrease in viral load during 48 weeks of treatment - Percentage of subjects with at least 10-fold (1 log10) decrease in viral load at Week 4 - Percentage of subjects with decrease in viral load to &lt;400 copies/ml at Week 12 - Percentage of subjects who continued to receive the investigational treatment up to Week 48 - СD4+ and СD8+ cell count change during 48 weeks of the study - Percentage of subject who developed HIV-1 resistance to the investigational treatment by week 48 - Frequency of adverse events (AE) of different severity according to subjective complaints, physical assessment, vital signs, laboratory tests, ECG - Frequency of adverse events of special interest, including of central nervous system (CNS) effects - VM-1500 pharmacokinetic profile in selected subjects</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Signed Patient Information and Informed Consent Form. 2. Males and females, age ≥ 18 years. 3. HIV1 infection, confirmed serologically in IFA or immunoblot analysis (or documented HIV1 infection). 4. Clinically stable HIV infection (clinical stages 1 or 2 according to the WHO classification). 5. Indications (in the Investigator's opinion) for ART, according to the WHO Summary Guideline for use of antiretroviral drugs in HIV prevention and treatment (2013). 6. HIV1 RNA plasma level ≥ 5 000 copies/ml at screening. 7. СD4+ Тcells number &gt; 200 cells/mm3 at screening. 8. Laboratory parameters as follows: White blood cells ≥ 2900/mm3 (2,9 x 109 cells/l) Absolute neutrophils ≥ 1500/mm3 (1,5 x 109 cells/l) Platelets ≥ 100000/mm3 (100 x 109 cells/l) Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dl Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN AST and ALT≤ 2.5 x ULN Renal function GFR &gt; 60 ml/min 1. Primary HIV1 resistance to ART. Viral resistance mutations are defined as any basic mutations of resistance to NNRTIs, according to the updated list of VIH1 resistance mutations (International AIDS society, 2013), associated with drug resistance in any genotype. 2. History of antiretroviral therapy (ART), including for the prevention of vertical transmission of HIV. 3. Acute hepatitis or hepatic cirrhosis of any etiology; antiHCV antibodies or HBsAg at screening. 4. Signs of acute infection or positive test result for syphilis, hepatitis A, Toxoplasma gondii, cytomegalovirus, gonorrhea, Chlamydia trachomatis during 30 days before screening. 5. Opportunistic infections of the Category C (Centers of Disease Control (CDC), 2008), excluding Kaposi's sarcoma not requiring systemic therapy. 6. History of tuberculosis of any localization, or tuberculosis at screening, according to xray examination. 7. History of malignant tumors (except basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or cervical carcinoma in situ, eliminated and cured ≥ 5 years ago).</criteria>
