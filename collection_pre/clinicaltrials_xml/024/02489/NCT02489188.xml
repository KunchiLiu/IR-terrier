	<brief_summary>To date, detailed analysis of movement patterns in orthopaedic conditions are mainly performed in research projects. Because these tests are time consuming, they are not feasible in clinical routine or in standard examinations. Novel technologies allow capturing detailed movement patters within a few minutes. The aim of this regional study is to compare aspects of movement tasks measured using a mobile gait analysis system to those measured using laboratory based systems and to determine aspects of gait patterns relevant for different orthopaedic conditions. Moreover, the researchers will investigate if these relevant aspects can be altered using surgical treatment or manual therapy.</brief_summary>
