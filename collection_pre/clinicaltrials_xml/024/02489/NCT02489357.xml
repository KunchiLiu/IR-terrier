	<brief_summary>This pilot phase II trial studies the side effects and how well pembrolizumab and cryosurgery work with short term androgen ablation to treat patients with prostate cancer that has traveled from the original tumor, through the body, and formed a small number of new tumors in other parts of the body (oligo-metastatic). Cryosurgery, also known as cryoablation or cryotherapy, kills tumor cells by freezing them. The process also incites an immune response within the ablated tumor. Giving monoclonal antibodies such as pembrolizumab which enhance a systemic anti-cancer immune response, may augment the effects of cryosurgery and increase tumor killing at distant (metastatic) sites.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab and Cryosurgery in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed, Oligo-metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess feasibility via the proportion of men reaching a low prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir (&lt; 0.6 ng/ml) at 1 year. II. Evaluate the safety of cryotherapy to the prostate combined with pembrolizumab. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the effects of combination cryotherapy / pembrolizumab on programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in the prostate as assessed by biopsy performed 6 months post treatment. OUTLINE: Patients receive standard of care androgen ablation with degarelix subcutaneously (SC) once a month for 8 months. Within 1 month of receiving degarelix, patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 3 days of receiving the first dose of pembrolizumab, patients undergo whole gland cryoablation of the prostate. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12 weeks for up to 1 year.</detailed_description>

grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent; Note: subjects with =&lt; grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study; Note: if subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment;
