	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the GORE® EXCLUDER® Conformable AAA Endoprosthesis to treat an infrarenal aneurysm located in the abdominal aorta. Performance of the GORE® EXCLUDER® Conformable AAA Endoprosthesis will be judged by separate performance goals.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study design is a prospective, nonrandomized, international, multicenter study comprised of two parallel substudies. The total subject population will be 190 subjects with 80 subjects assigned to the Short Neck Substudy and 110 subjects to the High Neck Angulation Substudy. This clinical study will include fifty-six sites in the US. Each enrolled subject will undergo periodic follow-up evaluations involving physical exams and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans at specific, protocol-defined intervals for a period of five years following the GORE® EXCLUDER® Conformable AAA Endoprosthesis implant. Each Substudy will be evaluated and reported independently from each other according to the Safety and Effectiveness Endpoints. No comparative analyses between these substudies are planned.</detailed_description>
