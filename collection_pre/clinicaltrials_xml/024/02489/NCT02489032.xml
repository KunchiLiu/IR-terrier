	<brief_summary>The goal of the proposed research is to complete the development of a web-based program to train Employee Assistance Program (EAP) and EAP-affiliated managed behavioral health organization (MBHO) practitioners to conduct screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) for problem alcohol use among working adults.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Web-Based Training for EAP Alcohol Screening, Brief Intervention, and Refer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Phase 2, the investigators propose to develop the SBIRT Training &amp; Support Tool with two components: (1) online SBIRT Training for call-center and face-to-face practitioners conducting alcohol SBIRT and (2) SBIRT Support Tool with mobile/web interactive alcohol screening tools and brief intervention protocols to facilitate use of SBIRT by practitioners. The SBIRT Training component will provide practitioners with the skills, knowledge, motivation, and self-efficacy to: (a) screen their clients for unhealthy alcohol use with validated screening tools; (b) provide brief, motivational interviewing-informed intervention; and (c) make appropriate referrals. The training program will incorporate the Phase 1 content and expand the curriculum to include the use of additional validated alcohol screening tools. Content for alcohol SBIRT will be derived from NIAAA evidence-based materials. The SBIRT Support Tool will provide a mobile/web interface for practitioners to use interactive screening and brief intervention forms with (a) prompts for validated questions in the screening or brief intervention; (b) motivational interviewing-informed dialogue suggestions; (c) online resources (i.e., standard drink list; importance, confidence rulers); and (d) alcohol education and referral information. The practitioner will use the SBIRT Support Tool to (a) screen clients for alcohol use with interactive validated screening tools; (b) provide brief intervention for individuals based on their screening score; and (c) provide referral to treatment for individuals based on their screening score.</detailed_description>
