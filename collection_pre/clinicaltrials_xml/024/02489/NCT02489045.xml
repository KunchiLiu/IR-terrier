	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, non-randomized trial that will be conducted at two clinical sites, Thomas Jefferson University (TJU) and the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP). Enrolled patients undergoing trans-jugular liver biopsy with hepatic vein pressure gradient (HVPG) measurements will receive a continuous infusion of SonazoidÂ® (GE Healthcare, Oslo, Norway) co-infused with 0.9% NaCl solution over a 5-10 minute time period. Ultrasound imaging will be performed using a Logiq 9 scanner with a 4C transducer (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) and the novel SHAPE (subharmonic aided pressure estimation) algorithm will be used to measure pressure values in the hepatic and portal veins. Data will be stored on a PC and compared to pressure-catheter measurements, Subjects identified in the initial examination as having portal hypertension (by HVPG results) will be monitored by SHAPE for up to 18 months. These subjects typically have surveillance Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans every 6 months to screen for liver cancer, and at those times a repeat SHAPE examination will be performed (ideally within 1 month of their clinically indicated imaging follow up appointment). In patients who undergo more frequent screening (generally 3 month intervals), SHAPE exams will be performed at 6 month intervals. Any repeat trans-jugular liver biopsies performed in this population will also trigger a repeat SHAPE study. Results of blood test evaluations (performed every 3 months in this population), medication, concomitant imaging study or procedure (including endoscopies) will be noted (all blood tests and imaging are clinically indicated only and are not required by this protocol). The end point for this part of the study will be any one new complication (e.g., liver cancer) or a marked worsening in any complication, liver transplantation, death, or the end of this clinical trial (after 3 years). The investigators expect these patients will be monitored three times during the course of this clinical trial. The time to reach the end point will be noted if a new complication or a marked worsening in any complication occurs.</brief_summary>
