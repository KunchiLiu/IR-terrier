	<brief_title>RRx-001 in Small, Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, Ovarian Cancer and Neuroendocrine Tumors Prior to Re-administration of Platinum Based Doublet Regimens (QUADRUPLE THREAT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label, four-arm, three stage, pilot study for co-administration of RRx-001 with autologous blood once weekly until progression followed by reintroduction of platinum-based doublet therapy. The study is designed to explore the potential of the epigenetic agent RRx-001 to sensitize patients who previously responded and now have failed a platinum based doublet. In the first stage of the study three (3) subjects with SCLC, NSCLC, ovarian cancer and HGNEC in each arm will receive RRx-001 until progression or intolerable toxicity at which point a platinum doublet therapy will be introduced or reintroduced. The first three patients will enrolled for safety and assessment for unacceptable toxicity. Each cohort will initially enroll 3 patients to assess for safety. If one of the 3 patients enrolled has an unexpected Adverse Events, then this combination would be considered unacceptable and the cohort would be stopped. If no unexpected AE occur then additional patients will be enrolled, a total of 10 patients per cohort. Each cohort will undergo a temporary pause after 10 patients are enrolled to assess safety and efficacy. If greater than 1/3 of patients (4 patients) have unexpected AE, then this cohort will be stopped for unacceptable toxicities. If at the completion enrollment of 10 subjects, at least 1 will need to have stable disease or better. If any arm has 1/10 subjects that has stable disease or better, then additional patients would be enrolled in this arm. Total patients that can be enrolled are 31 patients with NSCLC, 26 patients with SCLC, 26 patients with High Grade Neuroendocrine and 26 with Ovarian Cancer.</detailed_description>
