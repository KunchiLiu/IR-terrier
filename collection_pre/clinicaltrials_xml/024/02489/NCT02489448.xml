	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to address the following hypotheses: (i) Anti-PD-L1 therapy with MEDI4736 administered concomitantly with weekly nab-paclitaxel followed by MEDI4736 concomitant with ddAC neoadjuvant chemotherapy will induce higher pathologic complete response (pCR) rate (&gt;55%) in triple negative breast cancer than historical pCR rates (30-40%) observed with chemotherapy alone. (ii) MEDI4736 can be safely co-administered at full dose with sequential with nab-paclitaxel (100mg/m2) and ddAC (60 mg/m2 and 600 mg/m2 respectively).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant MEDI4736 Concomitant With Weekly Nab-paclitaxel and Dose-dense AC for Stage I-III Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the Phase I portion of the trial is to assess the safety of MEDI4736 combined with chemotherapy and determine if full dose of MEDI4736 can be administered concomitantly with full dose weekly nab-paclitaxel followed by dose-dense AC chemotherapies, respectively. The primary objective of the Phase II portion of the study is to estimate the pCR rate with MEDI4736 in combination with weekly nab-paclitaxel x 12 treatments followed by MEDI4736 in combination with ddAC x 4 treatments for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 negative (triple negative, TNBC), clinical stage I-III breast cancer. Pathologic complete response is defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (i.e. ypT0/Tis ypN0). Secondary objectives include: to assess the safety and toxicity of adding anti-PD-L1 antibody, MEDI4736 to standard of care neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the Phase II portion of the trial. The study will also monitor for events of special clinical interest with a suspected auto-immunologic etiology including grade â‰¥3 colitis, hyperthyroidism, hypophysitis, hypothyroidism, pneumonitis, rash and anti-drug-antibody (ADA) immune complex disease (manifested by symptoms of arthralgias, abdominal pain, back pain, and vasculitis). Exploratory objectives include: to assess correlation between response to therapy and immune parameters of the tumor at baseline and post-treatment in patients who have residual cancer after therapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Newly diagnosed histologically confirmed stage IIII, ER, PR and HER2 negative invasive breast cancer as defined by the ASCO CAP guidelines for whom systemic chemotherapy would be indicated based on physician judgment following standard NCCN practice guidelines. 2. Willing and able to provide written informed consent for voluntary participation in the trial. 3. Willing to undergo a baseline tumor core needle biopsy and blood draws for correlative science studies. 4. Eighteen years of age or older on the day of signing informed consent. 5. Female subjects must either be of nonreproductive potential or must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test upon study entry. 6. Patients should have adequate organ function to tolerate chemotherapy, as defined by: peripheral granulocyte count of &gt; 1,500/mm3 platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3 hemoglobin &gt;9 g/dL total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) each &lt; 1.5 x ULN serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN or serum creatinine clearance &lt; 50mL/min INR/PT/PTT each &lt; 1.5 x ULN TSH within normal limits 1.
