	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of the yoga skills training (YST) versus a caring attention control (AC) group among 60 adults with colorectal cancer (CRC) receiving chemotherapy to determine preliminary efficacy for the primary outcome of fatigue, secondary outcome of depressive symptoms, and possible mediators (i.e., psychological stress, circadian disruption, inflammation) as assessed by standard measures. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To measure the impact of the YST versus the AC on daily assessments of fatigue, depressive symptoms, and proposed mediators in the same trial and explore relationships among daily and standard assessments. II. To qualitatively assess perceived efficacy of the YST and AC and acceptability of new methodology through semi-structured interviews in a subset of 20-40 participants. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups. GROUP I (YST): Patients participate in YST consisting of four 30 minute in-person yoga sessions at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8 that instructs skills to enhance mindfulness and promote relaxation, through instruction of awareness, movement, breathing practices, and meditation. GROUP II (AC): Patients participate in four 30 minute in-person sessions of supportive conversation at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8. After completion of study, patients are followed up at 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
