	<brief_title>Webnovela for Hispanic Dementia Family Caregivers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of Webnovela program is to evaluate and develop materials for helping caregivers to cope with caregiving, alleviate related distress, and improve their quality of life. The investigators are evaluating different materials, which may provide caregiving strategies, practical tips and help to enhance caregivers' skills to deal with demanding tasks of caregiving, alleviate related stress, and improve quality of life. Research Program Steps: 1. Caregivers will be asked some simple questions about themselves and their family members to see if they are eligible for the project (fill out Enrollment Form and Informed Consent). 2. A Program survey will be sent, which can be completed online, or returned in a pre-mailed envelope. 3. Participants will receive links to online resources, related materials and instructions. The investigators ask participants to access the online resources, read provided brochures and guides, and follow the instructions. Materials are expected to help participants in their caregiver role. 4. After completing the program, the second and final survey should be filled out online or returned by pre-mailed envelope.</detailed_description>
