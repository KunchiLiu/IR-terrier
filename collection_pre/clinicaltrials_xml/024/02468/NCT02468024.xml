	<brief_title>JoLT-Ca Sublobar Resection (SR) Versus Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SAbR) for Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy has been shown in single institution phase II and matched cohort studies to be effective at controlling primary early lung cancer. Recent pooled analysis of both the STARS and ROSEL randomized trials comparing SABR versus lobectomy have shown a significantly improved 3-year survival with SABR, giving further impetus for successful completion of a randomized trial . Pre-randomized trial- Patients will be screened and pre-randomized to either SR or SAbR. Informed consent will be obtained after patients are made aware of the randomized assignment. Despite pre-randomization prior to consent, patients maintain their right to accept or decline any/all study activities. Only consenting patients will be allowed to participate in study activities, including observation after either randomized treatments or observation after standard of care treatment, while those declining consent will be managed by their physician(s) off study.Patients will be accrued and followed for a minimum of 2-years after treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 years. ECOG performance status (PS) 0, 1, or 2. Radiographic findings consistent with nonsmall cell lung cancer, including lesions with ground glass opacities with a solid component of 50% or greater. Those with ground glass opacities and &lt;50% solid component will be excluded. Biopsy confirmed nonsmall cell lung cancer. Tumor ≤ 4 cm maximum diameter, including clinical stage IA and selected IB by PET/CT scan of the chest and upper abdomen performed within 60 days prior to registration. All clinically suspicious mediastinal N1, N2, or N3 lymph nodes (&gt; 1 cm shortaxis dimension on CT scan and/or positive on PET scan) confirmed negative for involvement with NSCLC by one of the following methods: mediastinoscopy, anterior mediastinotomy EUS/EBUS guided needle aspiration, CTguided, videoassisted thoracoscopic or open lymph node biopsy. Tumor verified by a thoracic surgeon to be in a location that will permit sublobar resection. Tumor located peripherally within the lung. NOTE: Peripheral is defined as not touching any surface within 2 cm of the proximal bronchial tree in all directions. See below. Patients with nonperipheral (central) tumors are NOT eligible. No evidence of distant metastases. Availability of pulmonary function tests (PFTs spirometry, DLCO, +/ arterial blood gases) within 90 days prior to registration. Patients with tracheotomy, etc, who are physically unable to perform PFTs (and therefore cannot be tested for the Major criteria in 3.1.10 below) are potentially still eligible if a study credentialed thoracic surgeon documents that the patient's health characteristics would otherwise have been acceptable for eligibility as a high risk but nonetheless operable patient (in particular be eligible for sublobar resection). Patient at highrisk for surgery by meeting a minimum of one major criteria or two minor criteria No prior intrathoracic radiation therapy. NOTE: Previous radiotherapy as part of treatment for head and neck, breast, or other nonthoracic cancer is permitted so long as possible radiation fields would not overlap. Previous chemotherapy or surgical resection specifically for the lung cancer being treated on this protocol is NOT permitted. No prior lung resection on the ipsilateral side. Nonpregnant and nonlactating. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 60 days prior to registration. Perimenopausal women must be amenorrheic &gt; 12 months prior to registration to be considered not of childbearing potential. No prior invasive malignancy, unless diseasefree for ≥ 3 years prior to registration (exceptions: nonmelanoma skin cancer, insitu cancers). Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent. evidence of distant metastases prior intrathoracic radiation therapy. NOTE: Previous radiotherapy as part of treatment for head and neck, breast, or other nonthoracic cancer is permitted so long as possible radiation fields would not overlap. Previous chemotherapy or surgical resection specifically for the lung cancer being treated on this protocol is NOT permitted. No prior lung resection on the ipsilateral side. pregnant and lactating women prior invasive malignancy, unless diseasefree for ≥ 3 years prior to registration (exceptions: nonmelanoma skin cancer, insitu cancers).</criteria>
