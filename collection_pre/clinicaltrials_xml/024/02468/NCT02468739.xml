	<brief_title>Effect of GM1 in Prevention of Taxanes Induced Neurotoxicity in Operable Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Taxanes is a key agent in the treatment of breast cancer. However, peripheral neuropathy markedly limits the use of taxanes. There are no way to relieve or eliminate taxanes-related neurotoxicity. Monosialotetrahexosyl ganglioside (GM1) present a role of neuroprotective properties. This multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was performed to assess the efficacy of GM1 for preventing taxanes induced neurotoxicity in operable breast cancer patients who received taxanes-based adjuvant chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
