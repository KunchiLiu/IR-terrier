	<brief_summary>The QTRAC method is an electrophysiological technique that assesses peripheral nerve axonal excitability, using computerized analysis of the muscular response of musculus abductor pollicis brevis, to series of electrical stimulations of the median nerve. Because of its high sensitivity to small changes in axonal excitability, QTRAC may help improve the follow-up of patients suffering from peripheral neuropathy caused by anti-myelin-associated-glycoprotein antibodies (anti-MAG neuropathy), as axonal excitability is early affected in this disease. The main aim of the study is to compare QTRAC results in anti-MAG neuropathy patients, with QTRAC results in healthy persons (matched for sex and age). A secondary aim is to determine whether or not the disease's clinical severity (measured by quantitative clinical scores) is correlated with the results of the QTRAC and could be predicted by a model based on the several parameters measured in the QTRAC exploration. 100 anti-MAG neuropathy patients will undergo a QTRAC exploration and a thorough neurological examination with clinical scoring. The results will be compared with data (matched by sex and age) from the reference database on healthy subjects, that is provided with the QTRAC software. The investigators expect to prove that QTRAC results are modified in anti-MAG neuropathy patients, and that the clinical severity of the disease can be predicted by a combination of QTRAC-measured parameters.</brief_summary>
