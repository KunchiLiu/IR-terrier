	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if electrical stimulation (small levels of electricity) can safely and effectively reduce pain following total knee replacement. This study involves a device called the SPRINT System. The SPRINT System delivers mild electrical stimulation to nerves in the leg that received the knee replacement. The SPRINT System includes a small wire (called a "lead") that is placed through the skin in the upper leg. It also includes a device worn on the body that delivers stimulation (called the SPRINT Stimulator).</brief_summary>
