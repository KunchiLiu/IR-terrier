	<brief_summary>In order for flexible sigmoidoscopy to be a successful screening procedure, the bowel must be free of solid matter so the endoscopist has a clear view, increasing the chance of detection of abnormalities. This is achieved through the use of bowel cleansing preparations, which are administered prior to the procedure. Enemas are the preferred method as they clear the lower bowel more quickly than oral formulations and do not require dietary restrictions. The medical device being tested in this clinical investigation is NER1008, an enema which contains PEG3350 (polyethylene glycol 3350). PEG3350 is an osmotic agent, which holds the water content in the rectum and sigmoid colon, consequently increasing stool volume, resulting in rectal distension and subsequent distal colon emptying. The increased colonic luminal content stimulates the motility, propulsive transportation and rectal evacuation of the distal colon content. This study is designed to assess the performance of NER1008 in bowel cleansing and compare this with the performance of Fleet® enema, which is widely used for this purpose.</brief_summary>

Subjects with a clinically relevant history or presence of abnormal gastrointestinal motility. 4. Subjects with a significant history of hereditary bowel disorders. 5. Subjects with abnormal findings on the digital rectal examination performed at screening. 6. Use of laxatives or motility altering drugs in the 3 months preceding enema administration. 7. Use of any prescription or overthecounter medication (including vitamins, herbal and mineral supplements) within 14 days prior to enema administration (or within 5 half lives if longer), with the exception of Investigatorapproved hormonal contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and occasional paracetamol. 8. Participation in a clinical drug study during the 30 days preceding enema administration in this clinical investigation. 9. Donation of blood or blood products within 30 days prior to enema administration or during the clinical investigation, except as required for this clinical investigation 10. Pregnant or lactating females. 11. Any clinically significant illness within 28 days prior to enema administration. 12. History or presence of any significant drug allergy, or a known allergy or contraindication to polyethylene glycols, Fleet® enema or midazolam. 13.
