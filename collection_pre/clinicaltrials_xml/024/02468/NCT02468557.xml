	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy of single agent idelalisib and in combination with chemotherapy in adults with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. This study will also define the the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of idelalisib in combination with chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
