	<brief_summary>Study aim : To compare a novel strategy of lesion preparation with noncompliant balloons before implantation of BVS (Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold). Hypothesis: Predilatation with non-compliant balloons could facilitate optimal deployment of BVS. By achieving good scaffold apposition a need for post-dilatation could be significantly reduced. This is expected to result in better short- and long-term outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimal Lesion Preparation With Non-compliant Balloons Before Implantation Of Bioresorbable Scaffolds (OPreNBiS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design: Following pre-dilatation a BVS will be implanted and optical coherence tomography (OCT) will be performed in all patients. After OCT post-dilatation with non-compliant balloons might be performed if this is considered necessary by the treating interventionist. Final OCT will be performed in all patients. 1:1 Randomization of two strategies before the implantation of bioresorbable scaffolds: - OPN strategy (study group): pre-dilatation with OPN NC Â® Super High Pressure PTCA (Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty) balloons - standard strategy (control group): pre-dilatation with a standard (compliant) balloon Enrolment: Randomization of 50 patients - 25 in the OPN strategy (study group) - 25 in the standard strategy (control group)</detailed_description>
