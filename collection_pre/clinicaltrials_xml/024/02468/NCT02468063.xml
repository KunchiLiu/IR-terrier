	<brief_summary>The consecutive patients admitted to Intensive care unit of Hepatology department of ILBS and full filling all the eligibility criteria will be enrolled in 1:1 ration by the process of randomization.- The study is an open level study. The investigators will strictly follow the randomization table to give therapy as per the intervention arm. - Intervention:-the therapeutic intervention is vasopressor i.e. noradrenaline alone and terlipressin along with noradrenaline to maintain the MAP &gt;65mm Hg. - Intervention arm - Arm (A) - Noradrenaline - Arm (B) - Noradrenaline + low dose terlipressin</brief_summary>
