	<brief_summary>Acute lung injury (ALI) is the vital complication of Stanford type A aortic dissection. It is confirmed that Xenon has the significant protective effect on important organs and has no suppression on the cardiovascular system. Furthermore, our earlier trial has already clarified that static inflation with 50% Xenon during cardiopulmonary bypass could attenuate ALI for Standford A acute aortic dissection. However the protection effect was restricted for the limited time. Aimed to enhance the protection effect of Xenon, we designed this randomized trial that anesthesia with 50% xenon one hour before and after CPB and pulmonary static Inflation with 50%,75% and 100% Xenon during CPB respectively.</brief_summary>
