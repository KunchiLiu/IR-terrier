	<brief_summary>The purpose of this extension study is to: 1) evaluate the durability of effect on skeletal muscle mass, strength and physical function upon discontinuation of treatment received in the core study and 2) evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of an additional 24 weeks of bimagrumab treatment in older patients with sarcopenia who previously received 24 weeks of treatment in the core study. The parallel group, placebo-controlled randomized withdrawal design will allow an unbiased comparison of the duration of effect upon withdrawal from 3 different dose regimens of bimagrumab and placebo on changes in muscle quantity and patient physical function in a population of older adults with sarcopenia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Withdrawal Extension Study of Bimagrumab 70, 210, 700 mg in Older Adults With Sarcopenia Previously Participating in the Core Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to assess the durability of effect of bimagrumab (BYM) by comparing withdrawal of BYM (i.e., BYM/placebo PBO switch) treatment with continued BYM administration every 4 weeks for 24 additional weeks of treatment (following participation in the core study) in older adults with sarcopenia as measured by change from week 25 to week 49 on the 6MWT. The secondary objectives are: - To evaluate the effect of BYM given intravenously every 4 weeks for 24 additional weeks of treatment (following completion of 24 weeks of treatment in the core study) on safety and tolerability as assessed by measures such as vital signs, clinical laboratory variables, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and adverse events as compared to treatment with PBO in older adults with sarcopenia. - To evaluate the durability of effect of BYM by comparing withdrawal of BYM (i.e. BYM/PBO switch) treatment with continued BYM administration every 4 weeks for 24 additional weeks of treatment (following completion of 24 weeks of treatment in the core study) in older adults with sarcopenia as measured by change from week 25 to week 49 on: - performance on the Short Physical Performance Battery score mobility as measured in gait speed (GS measured as a component of the SPPB) over 4 meters - total lean body mass and appendicular skeletal muscle index measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men and postmenopausal women aged 70 years or older that have participated in, and have completed the full study treatment period per protocol (24 weeks/EOT visit) in the preceding core study (CBYM338E2202) Use of prohibited treatments as per recommendations outlined in protocol. History of severe hypersensitivity reaction in the core study (CBYM338E2202) History of breaking of the blind (inadvertently or for emergency reasons) in the core study (CBYM338E2202) History of adverse event(s) in the core study (CBYM338E2202) that in the judgment of the investigator, taking into account the subject's overall status, prevent the subject from entering the extension study Clinically significant abnormal liver function tests that would have resulted in discontinuation of study drug while participating in the core study(CBYM338E2202) as per protocol Any medical condition or laboratory finding, which, in the opinion of the investigator prevents the subject from continuing participation in the study, may interfere with participation in the study, might confound the results of the study, or pose an additional safety risk to the subject in administering bimagrumab Concurrent enrollment in a clinical trial involving an investigational drug or off label use of a drug, or any other type of medical research judged to be scientifically or medically incompatible with this study (not including enrollment in BYM338E2202 core study).</criteria>
