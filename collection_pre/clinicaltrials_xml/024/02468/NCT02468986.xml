	<brief_summary>Heart disease is the major contributor of early death in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and is not influenced by traditional risk factors. Blood vessel dysfunction has been associated with heart disease and complications such as heart attack. The vessel dysfunction is thought to be mediated in part to inflammation. RA patients have evidence of vessel dysfunction seen on ultrasound that improves after medications are given. The purpose of this study is to evaluate patients with controlled or uncontrolled rheumatoid arthritis to determine if there is a difference in the protein expression in the cells that line the blood vessels compared to healthy people.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Venous Endothelial Cells in Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will consist of a cross sectional analysis of venous endothelial cells in rheumatoid arthritis patients who have controlled or uncontrolled disease and healthy controls. We will collect venous endothelial cells by placing an IV in antegrade position in the forearm and a thin wire will be inserted to collect the cells from the inner lining of the vein. The cells will processed and stained for markers of endothelial function and oxidative stress including endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), phospho-eNOS, nuclear factor kappa B (NFÎºB), and nitrotyrosine using immunofluorescence technique. Flow mediated dilation (FMD) by ultrasound of the brachial artery on the contralateral arm will be used as an additional marker of endothelial function. A blood sample will be taken for analysis of inflammatory markers (sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein) and cytokine analysis (IL-1, IL-6, TNFa) by cytokine bead array and flow cytometry.</detailed_description>
