	<brief_title>A Phase 3 Substudy to Evaluate Executive Function in Adults With PKU Who Are Participating in the Phase 3 Study, 165-302</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 3 substudy enrolling approximately 100 subjects, aged ≥ 18 to ≤ 70 years old, with PKU who are concurrently treated with BMN 165 or placebo in Part 2 and BMN 165 in Part 4 of Study 165-302. No study drug is administered as part of this study. For this study, subjects will be asked to perform computer-based assessments (CANTAB) that assess executive function (specifically, attention, working memory, cognitive flexibility) and to answer questions about their current state of self perception (subject global assessment comprised of seven questions). The study visits are as follows: screening, baseline visit, and 3 additional study visits at different time points in the study.</detailed_description>
