	<brief_title>A Community-based Depression Screening Intervention for Middle-aged Suicide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Suicide is a major cause of premature death, particularly among middle-aged adults, in the majority of Western and Asian countries. A strong association of suicide and depression often indicates the necessity of a high-risk approach for suicide prevention. Improvements in identification and treatment can lead to better depression outcomes and suicide prevention. The investigators hypothesize that a 4-year community-based intervention, consisting of universal depression screening and subsequent care support in the target areas and health education programs, would result in reduced suicide rates among the middle-aged adult population in areas with a high suicide rate.</detailed_description>
