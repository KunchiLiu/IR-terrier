	<brief_title>Pilot Synovial Fluid Molecular/Stem Cell Response to PRP in Knee Osteoarthritis: Clinical &amp; Imaging Outcome Correlation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study 18 subjects with mild to moderate symptomatic knee osteoarthritis will be recruited per an IRB approved protocol with explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects who are enrolled and meet all criteria will be blinded and randomized (2:1) to receive Platelet Rich Plasma or normal saline "control". Prior to the intervention, a synovial fluid aspiration will occur. At follow up number one (approximately 10 days from baseline) a repeat aspiration will occur and a differential analysis of the molecular and biochemical effects will be undertaken; this data will serve as the primary outcome measures. This data will be correlated to clinical and imaging outcome measures which will be secondary outcome measures completed at baseline and intermittently throughout the study. The duration of the study is one year.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Early/Mild to Moderate Stage knee osteoarthritis (KOA), as determined by KellgrenLawrence Grade 2 to 3 on PA standing radiograph within the past three months; A prospective subject who has a diagnosis of nonend stage KOA (i.e., a potential study candidate) and expresses interest in participating but has no XRAY within the specified timeperiod will be sent for a fresh XRAY. This XRAY will be read by a radiologist &amp; be paid for by the study. 2. &gt;=40 years of age; 3. Average 100point VAS score of &gt;50, on average, within the past 3 months*, with KOA felt to be the primary contributor to pain. Alternate 10point scales with pain scores averaging &gt;5 may be considered if the prospective subject also completes a VAS with score &gt;50 at screening. 4. Exam consistent with KOA being primary etiology of pain; 5. No signs of inflammatory arthropathy in medical record, history or physical examination; 6. A &gt;3 millimeter intraarticular (IA) effusion present on ultrasound evaluation. 7. [If a chronic liver or renal disease patient, evidence of stable disease over/within the past six months, else exclusion.] 8. Veteran receiving care at McGuire VAMC. 1. Morbid obesity (BMI &gt;40); 2. Poorly controlled diabetes (hemoglobin A1C &gt; 7.5 or fasting blood glucose of &gt;200) in last 6 months; 3. Ipsilateral knee surgery, trauma within last 6 months, or corticosteroid injection within 3 months. 4. 4. History of inflammatory arthropathy (RA, SLE or crystalline arthritis of the knee)**; 5. Any rheumatoid arthritis or gout diagnosis is exclusionary. 6. Current infection of the affected joint or any other uncontrolled or untreated active infection. 7. Moderate to severe anemia (hemoglobin &lt; 11 g/dl) or thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 100,000); Hemoglobin &gt;17 g/dl or &lt;11 g/dl and/or platelet counts &gt;500,000 or &lt;100,000 platelets/Î¼l. [CBC obtained within 6 months will be required, even if obtained at initial screening visit.] 8. Individuals on dialysis, with liver failure, or uncontrolled renal or liver disease are excluded. In those with chronic renal or liver disease, documentation of stable disease within the most recent 6 months will be required. 9. Individuals on a therapeutic anticoagulant (e.g., Warfarin, Dabigatran, Enoxaparin) and those with a history of coagulopathy are excluded. Per standard clinical practice, subjects on antiplatelet therapy are not excluded. 10. Pregnancy or breastfeeding; Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy screen prior to enrollment. Female subjects of childbearing potential must confirm they are not actively breastfeeding prior to enrollment. 11. Current illicit drug abuse / active alcohol abuse (i.e, Current substance abuse); 12. Uncontrolled psychiatric disorder; 13. Lack of transportation (i.e., to get to/from appointments at VAMC) and/or willingness to attend study appointments (screening/consent, Intervention, Day10followup, Month6 followup, and then visits overthephone / inperson / or via Telehealth for Month3 and Month12; 14. Advanced or currently active cancer. 15. Blood disorders (such as Sickle Cell Anemia, TTP, others) 16. Vulnerable populations: Individuals incapable of making informed decisions will not be enrolled, nor will those under some form of incarceration.</criteria>
