	<detailed_description>The breast cancer diagnostic process is associated with anxiety and depression. Physical exercise has emerged as an attractive non-pharmacologic approach to mitigating the psychological and physical sequelae of breast cancer and its treatments, however pre treatment interventions are not integrated into current practice. This study aims to determine the effectiveness and feasibility of a pre treatment exercise intervention in attenuating levels of anxiety and depression following breast biopsy and throughout the diagnostic period.</detailed_description>
