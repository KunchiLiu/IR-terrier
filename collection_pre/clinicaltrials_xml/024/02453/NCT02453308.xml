	<brief_summary>This study is an open-label randomised trial comparing standard ACT treatment with matching triple artemisinin-based combination therapies (TACTs), evaluating efficacy in safety and tolerability. The estimated total sample size is 2040 patients from 16 sites in Asia and 1 site in Africa. There are 2 arm study groups that have 2 treatment arms each. Study group A: A.1: Artemether-lumefantrine for 3 days. versus: A.2: Artemether-lumefantrine for 3 days. plus: Amodiaquine for 3 days. Study group B: B.1: Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for 3 days. versus: B.2: Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for 3 days. plus: Mefloquine hydrochloride for 3 days. According to the WHO guideline, all patients except for children under the age of 1 year or a weight below 10 kilograms will also be treated with a single dose of low dose primaquine.</brief_summary>

Artemether-lumefantrine (ACT arm) In Cambodia, Myanmar, Vietnam and Thailand, the following two combinations will be used: 1. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine combined with mefloquine (TACT arm) or 2.

In DRC patients with a parasitaemia of 10,000 to 250,000/ul are eligible) Fever defined as &gt;/= 37.5Â°C tympanic temperature or a history of fever within the last 24 hours Written informed consent (by parent/guardian in case of children) Willingness and ability of the patients or parents/guardians to comply with the study protocol for the duration of the study Signs of severe/complicated malaria Haematocrit &lt; 25% or Hb &lt; 5 g/dL at enrollment (DRC: Hct&lt;15% and Hb &lt;5 g/dL due to high prevalence of anemia). Acute illness other than malaria requiring treatment For females: pregnancy, breast feeding Patients who have received artemisinin or a derivative or an artemisinin containing combination therapy (ACT) within the previous 7 days Treatment with mefloquine in the 2 months prior to presentation will be an exclusion criteria in the DHAP+MQ sites History of allergy or known contraindication to artemisinins, or to the ACT or TACT to be used at the site e.g. neuropsychiatric disorders will be a contraindication for the use of mefloquine. Previous splenectomy QTcinterval &gt; 450 milliseconds at moment of presentation Documented or claimed history of cardiac conduction problems Earlier participation within the TRACII trial or another trial in the previous 3 months.</criteria>
