	<brief_summary>This proposed study will assess the hemodynamic effects and measure the systemic absorption of topically applied oxymetazoline in patients undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery, turbinate surgery, or adenoidectomy. These patients will be receiving oxymetazoline as standard of care during the surgery.</brief_summary>
