	<brief_title>XNKQ Acupuncture Compared to Control Interventions Measured With EEG and fMRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To develop a better understanding of the cerebral response to a complex somatosensory intervention with XNKQ acupuncture and to build a foundation for future studies with stroke patients our study aims to evaluate changes of brain activity and brain structure in healthy subjects after XNKQ acupuncture in comparison to three control interventions. We will use EEG, structural MRI, and resting-state functional connectivity MRI to assess neuronal responses in 28 healthy subjects to a) strong manual needle-stimulation of the acupuncture points DU26, PC6 and SP6 (XNKQ acupuncture), b) insertion of needles on the acupuncture points DU26, PC6 and SP6 without stimulation (control 1), c) strong manual needle stimulation of three non-acupuncture points (control 2), and d) insertion of needles on three non-acupuncture points without stimulation (control 3). With this, our study aims to create results which inform future studies in patients and might be helpful for the rehabilitation of deficits after stroke.</detailed_description>
