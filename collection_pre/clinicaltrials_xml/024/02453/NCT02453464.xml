	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of Humanized Anti-VEGF Monoclonal Antibody (Sevacizumab) Injection in combination with FOLFIRI in patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer. This study includes two stages. Stage 1 is the dose-escalation stage. Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Sevacizumab has been established, additional patients will be enrolled in the cohort-expansion stage (Stage 2).</brief_summary>
