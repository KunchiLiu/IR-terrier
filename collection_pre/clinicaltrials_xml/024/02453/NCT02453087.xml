	<brief_summary>This open-label, multicenter, Phase 1/1b study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of increasing doses of DCDS0780A in participants with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In the combination portion of the study, the safety and tolerability of DCDS0780A in combination with rituximab or obinutuzumab will be assessed.</brief_summary>
