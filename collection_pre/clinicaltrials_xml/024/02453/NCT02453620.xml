	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of entinostat and nivolumab when given together with ipilimumab in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment (metastatic) or that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable) or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes or other parts of the body. Entinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth (locally advanced/metastatic). Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving entinostat and nivolumab together with ipilimumab may be a better treatment in patients with solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Entinostat, Nivolumab, and Ipilimumab in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors That Are Metastatic or Cannot Be Removed by Surgery or Locally Advanced or Metastatic HER2-Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of entinostat and nivolumab with or without ipilimumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors. II. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination of entinostat and nivolumab with ipilimumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors and to further confirm the safety of the combination therapy in subjects with advanced HER2-negative breast cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate whether treatment with entinostat alone or in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab results in an increase in the ratio of tumor antigen-specific effector T cells (Teff) to regulatory T cell (Treg) in tumor biopsies compared to baseline. II. To describe preliminary anti-tumor activity of entinostat and nivolumab in combination with or without ipilimumab in patients with advanced solid tumors. III. To assess preliminary anti-tumor activity in an expansion cohort of patients with advanced breast cancer treated at the RP2D. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore changes in immune-related biomarkers (e.g., expression of checkpoint receptors (programmed cell death 1 [PD-1]/programmed cell death ligand-1 [PD-L1]), the number of myeloid derived suppressor cells [MDSCs], inflammatory T cell signature, T cell receptor [TCR] repertoire) in tumor biopsies or peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) pre- and post-therapy. II. To correlate changes in immune-related biomarkers pre- and post-combination therapy with response. III. To measure tumor-specific mutations and mutant neo-antigens recognized by patient T cells in tumor biopsies and to describe association with response. IV. To evaluate changes in frequency of T cells recognizing tumor-specific mutant neo-antigens in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) pre- and post-therapy. V. To evaluate changes in candidate gene expression, including the azacitidine (AZA) immune genes (AIM genes) in malignant tissue, gene methylation silencing in circulating deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and malignant tissue pre- and post-therapy. VI. To correlate the pharmacodynamic outcomes (e.g., safety, efficacy, and changes in gene methylation status) with the exposure of entinostat (i.e., pharmacokinetics) when co-administered with nivolumab with or without ipilimumab. VII. To conduct pharmacogenomic association analyses to assess the potential clinical utility of cluster of differentiation (CD)86 gene polymorphisms as genetic determinants of immune mediated adverse events. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive entinostat orally (PO) on days -14 and -7 and then weekly, nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1 and then every 2 weeks, and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1 and then every 6 weeks for 4 doses. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months for up to 5 years.</detailed_description>
