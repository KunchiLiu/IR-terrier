	<brief_summary>Surgery for breast cancer is associated with significant pain. The serratus nerve block targets the interfascial plane either below or above the serratus muscle, blocking thereby the lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerves. The purpose of this randomized controlled double-blinded study is to see whether the addition of a serratus nerve block to a general anesthesia results in a better postoperative pain control in patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of the Serratus Block on Pain Control After Breast Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence of severe acute postoperative pain after breast surgery is high. Regional anesthesia has the potential to provide superior pain relief with fewer side effects compared to standard systemic opioid therapy. The search for a regional anesthesia technique for breast surgery has been ongoing as this technique needs to be time efficient, relatively risk-free and also practicable in an out-patient setting. The serratus block is a promising technique that may combine these advantages.</detailed_description>
