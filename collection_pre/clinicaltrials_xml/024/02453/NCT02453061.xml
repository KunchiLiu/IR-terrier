	<brief_summary>In the study the investigators plan to include 100 early affected HD patients (5 ≤ UHDRS ≤ 40) in a randomized, double-blind, controlled study in 2 centers (France and the Netherlands). Patients will receive either triheptanoin at 1g/kg of body weight per day (n = 50), or a control oil (n = 50) at 1g/kg of body weight per day for 6 months followed by an open label phase using triheptanoin for another 6 months. Efficacy of triheptanoin will be evaluated by measurements of caudate volume using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging and brain energy metabolism as evaluated by the ratio of inorganic phosphate/phosphocreatine, during visual stimulation, using 31P-MRS. Clinical improvement will be evaluated by UHDRS, TFC, and PBA-S scores as well as performance on the neuropsychological battery; patient quality of life will be evaluated with qualitative research methods after 6 months and with the SF-36 questionnaire before and after treatment; biological tolerance and compliance will be evaluated by routine biochemical blood tests, plasma and urine measurements of triheptanoin oil derivatives and patient report.</brief_summary>
