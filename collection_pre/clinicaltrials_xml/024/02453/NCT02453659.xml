	<brief_summary>The long-term goal of this program of research is to develop and disseminate an efficacious, group-based distress tolerance treatment for weight concern (DT-W) that will significantly increase smoking cessation rates among women. The objective of this project is to conduct a preliminary randomized controlled trial (RCT) (N = 60) comparing DT-W to a Health Education (HE) comparison intervention, in which both groups also receive standard behavioral smoking cessation treatment (ST) including counseling and transdermal nicotine patch (TNP), and examine potential mechanisms that may underlie the efficacy of DT-W in improving smoking outcomes at 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-ups.</brief_summary>
