	<brief_summary>Research has shown that reducing the time spent sitting can reduce the risk of many diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease, and improve health. It is estimated that many older adults typically spend 70% of their waking day sitting, but little is known about whether reducing sitting promotes health and well-being in this age group. The aim of this research is to investigate the health effects of reducing sitting time by replacing it with short periods of standing or walking in adults over the age of 65.</brief_summary>
