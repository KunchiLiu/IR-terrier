	<brief_summary>This study is a multicenter ,randomization, open control study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Raltitrexed-based chemotherapy and 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy in the peri-operative treatment of patients with Liver Metastasis From colorectal cancer (CRC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Compare Efficacy and Safety of Raltitrexed-based and 5fu-based Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Colorectal Liver Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The contrast analysis is separately done on Raltitrexed plus oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin;Raltitrexed plus irinotecan and 5-fluorouracil plus irinotecan.To investigate the objective response rate,the R0 resection rate, the early tumor shrinkage （ETS）and depth of response(DPR) and the safety profile.</detailed_description>
