	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Diagnosis of T2DM prior to informed consent 2. Male and female patients on diet and exercise regimen for at least 12 weeks prior to informed consent who are: 1 drugnaïve, defined as no antidiabetic drugs for at least 12 weeks prior to informed consent, or 2 pretreated with one oral antidiabetic drug (for sulfonylurea, with up to half of the maximum approved dose) on stable dosage for at least 12 weeks prior to informed consent (for thiazolidinedione, therapy has to be unchanged for at least 18 weeks prior to the informed consent, for linagliptin 5 mg at least 16 weeks prior to Visit 1). Individual antidiabetic drug (except linagliptin) will have to be discontinued at Visit 1. 3. HbA1c at Visit 1 1 HbA1c =8.0% and =10.5% for patients who are drugnaïve, or 2 HbA1c =7.5% and =10.5% for patients with one oral antidiabetic drug (except linagliptin), or 3 HbA1c =7.5% and =10.0% for patients with linagliptin 5 mg 4. HbA1c =7.5% and =10.0% at Visit 4 for randomisation into the doubleblind treatment period. Patient who are pretreated with linagliptin 5 mg for 16 weeks or more prior to Visit 1 and meet the criteria of HbA1c can directly move on to the runin (Visit 4). 5. Age =20 years at informed consent 6. BMI =40.0 kg/m2 at Visit 1 (screening) 7. Signed and dated written informed consent by date of Visit 1 in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation Exclusion criteria: 1. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia with a glucose level &gt;270 mg/dL (&gt;15.0 mmol/L) after an overnight fast during the openlabel stabilisation period (from Visit 2 to Visit 4) and runin period (from Visit 4 to Visit 5) , confirmed by a second measurement (not on the same day and done either at the central or at local laboratory). 2. Acute coronary syndrome (STelevation myocardial infarction [STEMI], nonSTEMI, and unstable angina pectoris), stroke or transient ischemic attack within 12 weeks prior to informed consent 3. Indication of liver disease, defined by serum levels of either alanine aminotransferase (ALT [SGPT]), aspartate aminotransferase (AST [SGOT]), or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) above 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) as determined during screening, openlabel stabilisation period and/or runin period 4. Impaired renal function, defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (MDRD formula) as determined during screening, openlabel stabilisation period and/or runin period 5. Known hereditary galactose intolerance 6. Known contraindications to linagliptin and empagliflozin according to the Japanese label 7. Any previous (within 2 years prior to informed consent) or planned bariatric surgery (or any other weight loss surgery) or other gastrointestinal surgery that induce chronic malabsorption 8. Medical history of cancer (except for resected noninvasive basal cell or squamous carcinoma) and/or treatment for cancer within the last 5 years 9. Known blood dyscrasias or any disorders causing haemolysis or unstable red blood cell (RBC) count (e.g. malaria, babesiosis, haemolytic anaemia). 10. Treatment with insulin, GLP1 agonists, within 12 weeks prior to informed consent 11. Treatment with antiobesity drugs within 12 weeks prior to informed consent or any other treatment at the time of screening (i.e., surgery, aggressive diet regimen, etc.) leading to unstable body weight 12. Current treatment with systemic steroids (other than inhaled or topical steroids) at informed consent or change in dosage of thyroid hormones within 6 weeks prior to informed consent or any other uncontrolled endocrine disorder except T2DM 13. Premenopausal women (last menstruation =1 year prior to informed consent) who: 1 are nursing or pregnant or 2 are of childbearing potential and are not practicing an acceptable method of birth control, or do not plan to continue using this method throughout the trial and do not agree to submit to periodic pregnancy testing during participation in the trial. Acceptable methods of birth control include tubal ligation, intra uterine devices/systems, oral contraceptives, complete sexual abstinence, double barrier method and vasectomised partner 14. Known or suspected allergy or hypersensitivity to trial products or related products (e.g., DPP4 inhibitors or SGLT2 inhibitors) 15. Alcohol or drug abuse within the 12 weeks prior to informed consent that would interfere with trial participation or any ongoing condition leading to a decreased compliance to trial procedures or trial drug intake, by the judgment of the investigator 16. Intake of an investigational drug in another trial within 30 days prior to Visit 1 or participation in the followup period of another trial (participation in observational studies is permitted) 17. Any other clinical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would jeopardize patient¿s safety while participating in this clinical trial</criteria>
