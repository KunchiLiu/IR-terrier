	<brief_summary>We propose to examine Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) patients for evidence of airway inflammation as a first step to characterize the reported bronchodilator responsiveness. Airway biopsy studies are invasive and thus we propose to perform induced sputum studies to document the amount and type of inflammation present. Another ancillary non-invasive measure of airway inflammation that we will use is exhaled nitric oxide (NO). The primary objective of this study is to determine if CDH patients have any evidence of airway inflammation. The hypothesis of this study is that children with CDH do not have evidence of airway inflammation associated with bronchodilator responsiveness. Based on this information, treatment for CDH patients will hopefully be more accurate and appropriate for their specific needs.</brief_summary>
