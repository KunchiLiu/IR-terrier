	<brief_summary>The MoodNetwork, a patient-powered research network (PPRN), is one of 18 PPRNs participating in Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute's (PCORI) PCORnet network. Its objective is to improve the nation's capacity to conduct comparative effectiveness research that reflects questions of greatest importance to patients and other stakeholders. A robust data infrastructure will be built that, in phase one, allows participants to contribute data, including those from participant questionnaires, visualize their own health information in intuitive and helpful ways, and share their aggregated de-identified health information within and outside of the Network.</brief_summary>
