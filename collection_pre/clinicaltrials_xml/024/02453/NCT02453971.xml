	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of the German eCHECKUP TO GO (eCHUG-D) in students. Compared to the control group subjects who conducted eCHUG-D should have less alcohol consumption and less alcohol associated problems after three and six months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial to Evaluate the Effects of the German eCHECKUP TO GO in Students</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effectivity of the eCHUG-D will be checked through a prospective randomized-controlled web-study. All students at the participating universities will be informed about the PsSt-study. They have to agree to the informed consent to take part in the study. A missing agreement leads to exclusion. All subjects get an individual random login-code for study participation. After random assignment (intervention (eCHUG-D) vs. control group) all subjects have to answer the same web-questionnaires about their alcohol consumption (see outcome variables). Subjects of the intervention group are then requested to conduct eCHUG-D and to fill in their login-code at the end of the program. The 3-month and 6-month follow-ups contain similar questions about alcohol consumption and alcohol related consequences. On 6-month follow-up additional questions ask about the acceptance of eCHUG-D (intervention group) and the acceptance of the study in general (control condition). Earlier studies showed the effectiveness of eCHUG in US college samples. The primary endpoint of the study ist the amount of alcohol consumed. We hypothesize that the eCHUG group will show significantly lower levels of alcohol intake than the control group</detailed_description>
