	<brief_summary>Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is considered as standard diagnostic procedure in melanoma patients carrying a reasonable risk for metastases. In numerous studies the prognostic role of micro metastases in the sentinel node (SN) was described. However, the prognostic value of a complete lymph node dissection in patients with a positive SN is still unclear. This study was planned to analyse the survival outcome of patients with a positive SN receiving complete lymphadenectomy versus watchful waiting.</brief_summary>
