	<brief_summary>This study investigated the use of novel plasma and urinary biomarkers to predicte the development of hepatorenal syndrome in patients with advanced cirrhosis. The biomarkers investigated include plasma cystatin C, plasma NGAL, plasma NAG, plasma IL-18, plasma ADMA, plasma BTP, urinary KIM-1 and urinary LFABP. These biomarkers will be checked in advanced cirrhotic patients who have or have not developed hepatorenal syndrome and compared between the two groups. These biomarkers will also be correlated with the occurence of hepatorenal syndrome.</brief_summary>
