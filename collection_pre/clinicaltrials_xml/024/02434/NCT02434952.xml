	<brief_summary>In Cambodia, falciparum is becoming more difficult to treat because drugs are becoming less effective. The investigators can help to try to prevent the spread of this resistant malaria by adding a drug that will make it more difficult for the mosquito to drink up the malaria in people's blood. If the mosquito cannot drink up the malaria, then the malaria cannot develop in the mosquito so it will not be able to inject malaria back into people when it bites. The drug the investigators will use is called primaquine. Primaquine commonly causes the red cells in the blood to break apart if they are weak. Red cells need enzymes to work properly and weak red cells have low amounts of an enzyme called glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). The investigators want to know if treating malaria with primaquine will be safe for the red cells. To do this study, the investigators need to know if a subject has low G6PD or not.</brief_summary>
