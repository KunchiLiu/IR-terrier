	<brief_title>Doppler-guided Endoscopic Treatment in Peptic Ulcer Bleeding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluates if performance of a control endoscopy with doppler-guided endoscopic treatment is associated with an improved outcome in term of lower rate of rebleeding and lower rate of bleeding-related mortality. A potential risk of increased risk of complications (in particular perforation) among patients treated with control endoscopy is also evaluated. Outcomes are prospectively registered based on patient records.</detailed_description>
