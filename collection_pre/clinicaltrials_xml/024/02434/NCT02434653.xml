	<brief_title>A Comparison Between Two Strategies for Postpartum Anemia Diagnosis and Follow up After Vaginal Deliveries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anemia is common following delivery. It is associated with some serious complications including increased risk for syncope and in severe cases even cardiogenic shock. Yet, anemia-associated symptoms might manifest relatively late after the patient have lost a fair amount of blood, which was not diagnosed early enough. To date, there are not acceptable guidelines for monitoring hemoglobin levels after delivery. Theoretically, there are 2 approaches for hemoglobin monitoring - one by taking hemoglobin levels in order to diagnose anemia in patients reporting anemia-associated symptoms. The other approach is by screening of women at increased risk for post-partum anemia. In the present study we aimed to compare those 2 approaches.</detailed_description>
