	<brief_summary>This surgery involves the use of a finger joint replacement device for treatment of patients with certain kinds of arthritis (osteo - arthritis or post traumatic arthritis) and who expect to place their hands in heavy loading situations, or patients needing revision of a failed implant placed in the PIP joint. A joint replacement surgery is an operation where the arthritic joint is removed and a metal and plastic joint is inserted to replace the natural joint. The surgery is expected to last about 2 hours. The procedure is done in the operating room and requires general anesthesia or an axillary block. (General anesthesia affects the entire body and is accompanied by a loss of consciousness. An axillary block results in anesthesia of the hand and forearm only. A tourniquet is applied to the arm to prevent bleeding during the surgery.)</brief_summary>
