	<brief_summary>The objective of this Open Label Study is to evaluate effects of Rolapitant IV solution, and its metabolite, on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the P-gp substrate (digoxin), the BCRP substrate (sulfasalazine), and multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP) probe substrates in a healthy adult population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open Label, Single Dose, Three Part Study to Assess the Effects of Rolapitant (2 mg/mL IV Solution) on the Pharmacokinetics of Digoxin; Sulfasalazine; and the Cooperstown Cocktail (Midazolam, Omeprazole, Warfarin, Caffeine, and Dextromethorphan in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Part A will compare the PK of oral digoxin alone and in combination with an IV infusion of rolapitant. - Part B will compare the PK of an oral dose of sulfasalazine alone to the PK of an oral dose of sulfasalazine in combination with an IV infusion of rolapitant - Part C will compare the PK of an oral dose of the Cooperstown Cocktail (midazolam, omeprazole, warfarin, caffeine, and dextromethorphan) alone and when given in combination with an IV infusion of rolapitant.</detailed_description>
