	<brief_summary>Task-oriented repetitive movement can improve movement performance in patients with neurological or orthopedic lesions. The application of robotics can serve to assist, enhance, evaluate, and document neurological and orthopedic rehabilitation of movements. Arm therapy is used in neurological rehabilitation for patients with paralyzed upper extremities due to lesions of the central or peripheral nervous system, e.g. after stroke or spinal cord injury. The goal of the therapy is to recover motor function, improve movement coordination, learn new motion strategies ("trick movements"), and/or prevent secondary complications such as muscle atrophy, osteoporosis, and spasticity.</brief_summary>
