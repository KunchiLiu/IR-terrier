	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety of Rosuvastatin in Children and Adolescents With Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a long-term extension (LTE) to the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study of rosuvastatin 20 mg once daily (QD) versus placebo QD in children and adolescents (aged from 6 to &lt;18 years) with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) (Study D3561C00004). The study is designed to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of rosuvastatin 20 mg in pediatric patients with HoFH. In this study all patients will receive rosuvastatin 20 mg QD. Investigators will also be permitted to titrate the dose of rosuvastatin from 20 to 40 mg per day if they feel it is warranted to more aggressively treat patients' elevated LDL-C levels. This up-titration will not be permitted in Asian patients. Pharmacokinetic data of the trough plasma exposure of rosuvastatin will also be assessed for the pediatric patients with HoFH taking a daily dose of rosuvastatin 40 mg. The primary outcome measures to be assessed include 1) Adverse events, including: - The frequency and severity of adverse events, - Rate of discontinuations due to adverse events, - Abnormal serum and urine laboratory values, electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical examinations, and vital signs; and 2) Assessments of growth.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Prior to any study related procedures being performed, provision of written informed consent from a parent/both parents or guardian and statement of assent from the child or adolescent (if required by Institutional Review Board [IRB] or Independent Ethics Committee [IEC] according to local regulations and guidelines). Study D3561C00004 participants who have had their 18th birthday (adults) will be required to provide written informed consent. Communication should take place between the Investigator, patient/guardian and child/adolescent to confirm understanding and required compliance with the requirements of the study. 2. Male and female children and adolescents who were aged 6 to &lt;18 years at the onset of Study D3561C00004 (even if they had their 18th birthday during that study) with: Documentation of genetic testing confirming 2 mutated alleles of the LDL receptor gene locus; and/or Documented untreated LDL C &gt;500 mg/dL (12.9 mmol/L) and TG &lt;400 mg/dL (4.5 mmol/L) and at least 1 of the following criteria: Tendinous and/or cutaneous xanthoma prior to 10 years of age; or Documentation of HeFH in both parents by: genetic and/or clinical criteria 3. Negative pregnancy test (b human chorionic gonadotropin analysis) prior to baseline in females of child bearing potential: Female patients of child bearing potential must adhere to a pregnancy prevention method (abstinence, chemical, or mechanical) during the study and 3 months following the last dose; Male patients should refrain from fathering a child (including sperm donation) during the study and up to 3 months following the last dose; and 4. Were taking study drug at the end of Study D3561C00004 and are willing to follow all study procedures including adherence to dietary guidelines, study visits, fasting blood draws, and compliance with study treatment regimens. 1. History of statin inducted myopathy or serious hypersensitivity reaction to other HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), including rosuvastatin, at Visit 1 of Study D3561C00004. 2. Fasting serum glucose of &gt;9.99 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) or glycosylated hemoglobin &gt;9% during Study D3561C00004 or patients with a history of diabetic ketoacidosis within the past year. 3. Uncontrolled hypothyroidism defined as thyroid stimulating hormone &gt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) at any time during Study D3561C00004. 4. Evidence of active liver disease or hepatic dysfunction (except a confirmed diagnosis of Gilbert's disease) as defined as nontransient elevations of ALT or AST elevations ≥3 times the ULN or nontransient total bilirubin ≥2 times the ULN during the Study D3561C00004. 5. Definite or suspected personal history or family history of clinically significant adverse drug reactions (ADRs), or hypersensitivity to drugs with a similar chemical structure to rosuvastatin as well as other statins.</criteria>
