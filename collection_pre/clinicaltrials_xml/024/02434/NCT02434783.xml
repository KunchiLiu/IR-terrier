	<brief_summary>Current evidence cannot explain the clinical features of peripheral arterial disease only from the principle of reduced blood flow. Explanations have therefore in addition been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction of skeletal muscles. This study will elucidate whether there is a relation between clinical variables of the different levels of arterial insufficiency in peripheral arterial disease and mitochondrial respiratory capacity.</brief_summary>
