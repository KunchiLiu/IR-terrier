	<brief_title>Immunogenicity and Safety of Liquid Bivalent Oral Poliomyelitis Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Beijing TiantanBio has been one of the two suppliers of tOPV in China since 1985, with control of polio in China evidence of the effectiveness of its vaccine. The company plans to introduce a liquid formulation of bOPV (types 1 and 3) to meet increasing global demand with the phasing-out of tOPV. The proposed study is intended to provide data sufficient to obtain WHO prequalification for the TiantanBio bOPV, thus making the vaccine available to help meet global demand.</detailed_description>
