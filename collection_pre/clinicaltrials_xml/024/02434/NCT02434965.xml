	<brief_title>Autologous Cord Blood and Human Placental Derived Stem Cells in Neonates With Severe Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and feasibility of intravenous administration of autologous cord blood (CB) and autologous human placental derived stem cells (HPDSC) in neonates with severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). It is hypothesized that the administration of autologous CB and autologous HPDSC will be safe and well tolerated in neonates with severe HIE. Additionally, postnatal neuro-developmental outcomes in neonates with HIE after autologous CB and HPDSC therapy will be measured; HIE injury to the neonate/infant brain post autologous CB and HPDSC therapy by imaging will be characterized; the pluripotent stem cell properties of CB and HPDSC will be characterized; serum levels of selected circulating cytokine and neurotrophic factors in neonates with HIE before and after autologous CB and HPDSC therapy will be compared and immune cell phenotype and function in neonates with HIE before and after autologous CB and HPDSC therapy will be compared.</detailed_description>
