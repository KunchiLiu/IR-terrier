	<brief_title>Development of a Comprehensive AP Training Curriculum for Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project will develop and test a comprehensive, web based training system for the artificial pancreas (AP) prototype identified as eDAPT (electronic Diabetes Artificial Pancreas Training). This e-learning training program is to prepare people with diabetes and their physicians on the use of UVA's Artificial Pancreas prototype -- Diabetes Assistant (DiAs), a software platform for the development and outpatient testing of smart phone based systems for Closed Loop Control of diabetes. The e-learning training program will be used in adjunct to in-person training with study staff at the onset of a clinical trial. It will be especially important as the number of clinical sites that use DiAs continue to grow both in the United States and internationally. It is also a critical step in moving the DiAs closer to a commercial product. A validated training program is required to proceed with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for both pivotal clinical trials and commercial approval of the AP.</detailed_description>
