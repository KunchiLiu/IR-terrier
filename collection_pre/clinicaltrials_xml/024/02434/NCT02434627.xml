	<brief_summary>The investigators' previous work in males with Becker Muscular Dystrophy shows that functional sympatholysis is restored by acute inorganic nitrate supplementation. This was translated from work using the mdx mouse model of dystrophinopathy. Recent work has shown that there is a frank improvement in grip strength when mdx mice are treated with an inorganic Nitric Oxide (NO) donor. The purpose of this study is to determine if chronic treatment with an inorganic NO donor can benefit patients with muscular dystrophy beyond blood flow regulation.</brief_summary>
