	<brief_title>NIvolumab COnsolidation With Standard First-line Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy in Locally Advanced Stage IIIA/B Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over the past decade, concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy has become the first choice treatment for most patients with stage III non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). However, as at least half of patients with NSCLC are too old or have multiple comorbidities to withstand this aggressive treatment, sequential chemotherapy and radiotherapy is often given. Currently, approximately 30% of patients are alive 5 years after con¬comitant therapy, 20% after sequential therapy, and about 10% after radiotherapy alone. These figures remain approximately the same with the addition of surgery. After chemo-radiotherapy, at least 30-40% of the patients show local tumour progression on CT scans as first site of relapse. Also after surgery, about 30% of patients fail locally as a first site of recurrence. In addition, more than half of the patients eventually develop distant metastases that may have been present but undetected at the time of staging or that may have come from persistent or recurring local disease. It is thus obvious that new approaches that preferentially tackle both local and distant disease sites are needed to improve long-term survival and cure rates. Dose-limiting toxicity of thoracic radiotherapy includes radiation pneumonitis (RP). Starting from two months after the end of radiotherapy, about 15% of the patients develop increasing dyspnoea and cough, provoked by a mixed T-lymphocyte infiltrate in lung areas that have been irradiated. RP may happen up to 6 months post-treatment, however about three quarters of RP cases occur 3 months after radiotherapy. Besides dose and volume parameters of the radiotherapy, such as the mean lung dose (MLD) or the V20 (that is the percentage of the lungs that received more than 20 Gy), the most important risk factor for developing RP is the inflammatory status of the lungs before therapy. The more baseline inflammation, the higher is the risk of RP. Inflammation in the lungs can be visualized and quantified by measuring the 18F-fluoro-D-deoxyglucose (FDG) in the lung parenchyma by standard FDG-PET-CT scans obtained at the time of staging. As the relative FDG uptake in the lung vs. the aorta is used, no specific calibration of the PET-scanner is required. Attempts to improve the long-term survival include radiotherapy dose escalation/acceleration, new chemotherapy combinations, and adding biological agents and cancer vaccines to standard regimens. At present, none of these have demonstrated an improved outcome. Improved understanding of the immune profile of NSCLC has led to immunotherapeutic strategies, including inhibitory molecules responsible for abrogating an anti-cancer immune response such as PD-1 and CTLA-4. Bristol-Myers Squibb's nivolumab, an investigational monoclonal antibody that inhibits the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 expressed on activated T cells, has demonstrated positive results in phase I trials of previously treated patients with advanced NSCLC. However, rare cases of severe or fatal pneumonitis have been reported throughout clinical trials using anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 compounds. Pre-clinical data show a clear beneficial effect by combining local radiotherapy and anti-PD-1. Not only was the local tumour control increased, but an "abscopal" effect on distant metastases could be observed. Radiotherapy clearly acted as an "in situ" tumour vaccination resulting in the induction of specific anti-tumour immunity in all sites of the body that could result in a clinical anti-tumour effect because of the combination with anti-PD-1. While the role of immunotherapy is currently being evaluated as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy or tyrosine kinase inhibitors in all lines of treatment of advanced NSCLC, as monotherapy in early NSCLC adjuvant setting as well as monotherapy in consolidation after completion of definitive chemo-radiotherapy, it has not yet been assessed in combination with radiotherapy. While anecdotal data of concurrent treatment in the palliative setting suggest acceptable safety and a good tolerability of such combination, a formal prospective assessment is required before embarking on any trial comparing concurrent versus sequential checkpoint inhibitors and radiotherapy designs. The rationale for concurrent checkpoints and radiotherapy resides in the description of cases of unexpected immune sensitization offered by such combination, with the demonstration of tumour responses to localized radiotherapy after immune stimulation in non-irradiated sites - called the abscopal effect. A strong rationale is also provided by pre-clinical models showing a synergistic effect of such approaches in various in vitro and in vivo models. In summary, there is a definite unmet need in multi-disciplinary care to improve the prognosis of patients diagnosed with stage III NSCLC, with a strong rationale supporting the combination of chemo-radiotherapy with anti-PD-1. A major theoretical concern is the development of pneumonitis, a rare toxicity of both radiotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors. The main aim of the current trial proposal is therefore to evaluate the pneumonitis rate in patients being treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy in combination with concomitant or sequential nivolumab treatment.</detailed_description>
