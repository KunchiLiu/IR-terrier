	<brief_summary>Patients who undergo bone marrow transplant for different types of cancer are exposed to many treatments such as steroids and whole body radiation. These treatments make the transplant possible but also make their bones weaker and more prone to fractures which can be a source of significant disability and decreased quality of life for cancer survivors. Our trial will investigate whether giving one dose of Zoledronic acid (a commonly used drug given to preserve bone mass in osteoporosis) before bone marrow transplant can protect from the bone loss caused by the transplant procedures. The investigators are also interested in studying the complex interactions of bone, muscle and fat which are greatly affected after bone marrow transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Trial of Zoledronic Acid to Prevent Bone Loss in Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: To determine whether a single dose of zoledronic acid pre-transplant will prevent HSCT-related bone loss without impeding engraftment, compared with placebo. Secondary Objectives: To identify bone and muscle deficits and alterations in fat distribution prior to HSCT, compared with healthy controls.</detailed_description>
