	<brief_summary>- The aim is to describe disease mechanisms of severe and cerebral malaria and identify new targets for adjunctive therapies. - Despite treatment between 10-30% of patients with severe malaria die. - Metabolic acidosis and cerebral malaria are major complications associated with mortality across all age groups. Still, their underlying pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. - Using a metabolomics approach, this study aims to characterise the spectrum of acids accumulating during acidosis, and investigate patterns of metabolic dysregulation associated with coma and seizures.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Severe/Cerebral Malaria: Any P. falciparum parasitaemia detected by asexual stages on a peripheral bloodslide or a positive rapid diagnostic test in combination with one or more Modified WHO Criteria for Severe Malaria (Hien et al, 1996) &lt; 24 hours after treatment commencement with either parenteral artemisinin or quinine Age &gt; 12 years Full informed written consent obtained Uncomplicated malaria: Any level of Plasmodium parasitaemia, detected by asexual stages on a peripheral bloodslide or a positive rapid diagnostic test without any of the complications of severe malaria stated above. Age &gt; 12 years Full informed written consent obtained Sepsis: Clinical signs of infection in combination with any two of the following signs: 1. Heart rate &gt; 90 beats per minute; 2. Respiratory rate &gt; 20 breaths per minute, a PaCO2 of &lt; 32 mmHg, or the use of mechanical ventilation for an acute respiratory process; 3. Tympanic temperature &gt; 38°C or &lt; 36 °C; 4. Whitecell count of &gt; 12x109/L or &lt; 4x109/L, or a differential count showing 10% immature neutrophils ; Negative peripheral blood slide for any stages of malaria parasites or a negative rapid diagnostic test for falciparum and vivax malaria [As bacterial culture is not routinely available at the study site, positivity of cultures is not required] Age &gt; 12 years Full informed written consent obtained Acidosis: Clinical suspicion of metabolic acidosis in combination with any of the following: 1. Peripheral venous bicarbonate &lt; 15 mmol/L 2. Peripheral venous base excess &lt; 3 mmol/L Negative peripheral blood slide for any stages of malaria parasites or a negative rapid diagnostic test for falciparum and vivax malaria; and not meeting any of the inclusion criteria for sepsis as stated above. Age &gt; 12 years Full informed written consent obtained Encephalitis: GCS &lt; 11/15 Documented fever &gt; 38°C Onset of symptoms &lt; 2 weeks, with an indication a lumbar puncture as part of the diagnostic work up Negative peripheral blood slide for any stages of malaria parasites or a negative rapid diagnostic test for falciparum and vivax malaria Age &gt; 12 years Full informed written consent obtained Healthy volunteers: No chronic or acute disease No fever in the past 2 weeks Age &gt; 16 years Full informed written consent obtained Known preexisting chronic medical conditions including advanced hepatic disease.</criteria>
