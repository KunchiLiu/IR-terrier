	<brief_summary>This is a single arm, open label Phase II study of MPDL3280A, an anti-PD-L1 antibody administered as neoadjuvant therapy to subjects with either BCG-refractory non-muscle invasive transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder, or muscle-invasive TCC appropriate for cystectomy and refusing or ineligible for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Enrolled patients will be assigned sequentially to dose levels in cohorts of 6 patients per dose level. The starting dose level is 1200mg x 1 dose and will be escalated in subsequent cohorts to 1200mg q 3 weeks x 2 doses, and finally 1200mg q 3 weeks x 3 doses to determine the impact of increasing number of treatments on the modulated immune response with the tumor tissue. Subjects with adverse pathology (pT3/pT4 or N+) will be offered the option of adjuvant MPDL3280A for up to 16 cumulative cycles of treatment. After all neoadjuvant study therapy is administered, each subject will undergo cystectomy to evaluate pathologic response to treatment and for immunologic characterization in the resected tissue. Serum and urine will be obtained as well to characterize circulating immune responses. After the multi-dose portion of the study has completed accrual two expansion cohorts of up to 15 patients each with NMIBC or MIBC will be accrued at the highest dose level for further characterization of safety, efficacy, and immunologic analysis. Patients with pT3, pT4, or N+ disease at the time of cystectomy and no metastatic disease will be offered the option of adjuvant MPDL3280A for up to a total of 16 cumulative cycles. All subjects will be followed clinically for up to 2 years to assess for disease recurrence.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>18 years of age or older ECOG performance status 0, 1 Histologically document transitional cell carcinoma with the presence of any of the following stages: CIS, highgrade Ta, any grade T1, or any grade cT2T4, considered appropriate for radical cystectomy. Subjects with mixed histology are required to have a dominant TCC pattern. For subjects with NMIBC, BCGrefractory or BCGresistant disease. BCGrefractory disease is defined as the absence of a complete response by 6 months in patients who have received induction and maintenance OR two induction courses of BCG. BCGresistant disease is defined as persistent or recurrent disease after 2 induction courses of BCG within 1 year OR cancer recurrence within 1 year of initiation of therapy for patients who have received induction plus maintenance BCG therapy. Subjects with NMIBC must be suitable for and willing to undergo a radical cystectomy at the completion of study therapy. For subjects with muscle invasive disease: not suitable neoadjuvant cisplatinbased chemotherapy as determined by the following: Creatinine clearance less than 60ml/min. GFR should be assessed by calculation from serum/plasma creatinine (CockcroftGault formula) CTCAE Gr &gt;/= 2 hearing loss CTCAE Gr &gt;/= 2 neuropathy Subjects with MIBC not meeting the above criteria are still eligible provided the patient declines neoadjuvant cisplatinbased chemotherapy, after specific informed consent describing the known benefits of cisplatinbased chemotherapy. The reason for declining must be documented. Adequate bone marrow function defined as WBC &gt; 2500 cells/mm3 ANC &gt; 1500 cells/mm3 Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL. Patients may be transfused or receive erythropoietic treatment to meet this criterion. Platelet count &gt; 100,000 cells/mm3 Adequate renal function: Serum creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dL OR calculated CrCl &gt; 30ml/min Serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN (except for patients with documented Gilbert's disease) AST and ALT &lt; 2.5 x ULN Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent. Have available evaluable archival tumor tissue for PDL1 biomarker assessment. Presence of PDL1 antigen on tumors is NOT required for study entry. The effects of MPDL3280A on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry, during study participation, and for 90 days after study treatment discontinuation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and for 90 days after completion of study drug administration. Subjects with primary TCC of the ureter, urethra, or renal pelvis without TCC of the bladder are not allowed. Known distant metastatic disease (e.g. pulmonary or hepatic metastases). Subjects with malignant lymphadenectomy in the abdomen or pelvis considered appropriate for radical cystectomy and lymphadnectomy with the goal of complete resection of all malignant disease are allowed. Intravesical chemo or biologic therapy within 6 weeks of first treatment. Prior systemic chemotherapy for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Subjects who have received prior intravesical chemotherapy are allowed. Prior treatment with CD137 agonists or immune checkpoint blockade therapies, including anti CTLA4, antiPD1 and antiPDL1 therapeutic antibodies. History of autoimmune disease, including but not limited to myasthenia gravis, myositis, autoimmune hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, vascular thrombosis associated with antiphospholipid syndrome, Wegner's granulomatosis, Sjogren's syndrome, GuillainBarre syndrome, multiple sclerosis, vacuities, or glomerulonephritis.
