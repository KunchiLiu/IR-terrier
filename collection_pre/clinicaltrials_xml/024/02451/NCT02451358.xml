	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to generate immunogenicity and safety data in the whole population to support registration of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) in India: Primary objective: - To describe in each age group the immune response induced by a single injection (subjects aged &gt;9 years) or 2 injections (subjects aged 6 months to 8 years) of QIV. Secondary objective: - To describe in each age group the safety profile of QIV.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of a Single Dose or Two Doses of a Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine in Subjects Aged 6 Months or Older in India</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All participants will be vaccinated with the quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) (split-virion, inactivated) Northern Hemisphere (NH) 2014-2015 formulation by the intramuscular (IM) route. Immunogenicity of the vaccine will be assessed at baseline (Day 0) and 28 days after the last injection. Safety data will be collected up to 28 days after each vaccination. Serious adverse events (SAEs), including adverse events of special interest (AESIs) will be collected throughout the trial.</detailed_description>

A prospective subject should not be included in the study until the condition has resolved or the febrile event has subsided Identified as an Investigator or employee of the Investigator or study center with direct involvement in the proposed study, or identified as an immediate family member (i.e., parent, spouse, natural or adopted child) of the Investigator or employee with direct involvement in the proposed study.</criteria>
