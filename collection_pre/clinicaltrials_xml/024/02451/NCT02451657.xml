	<criteria>Males and females aged 6 to 11 with diagnosis of Down syndrome (Trisomy 21). Children may have standard trisomy 21, Robertsonian translocation, isochromosome 21 (so called 21q21q Robertsonian translocation), Down syndrome with reciprocal translocation or mosaicism. Down syndrome children meeting clinical diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety disorders, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, can participate in the study provided they are considered clinically stable or on stable medication for at least 8 weeks prior to the baseline visit.
