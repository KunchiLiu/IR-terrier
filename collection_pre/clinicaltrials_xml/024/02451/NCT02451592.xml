	<brief_title>Fungemia in Hematologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The coordinating center provides all participating centers with an epidemiologic form, in order to collect data in a comparable way. The requested informations include type of malignancy and its treatment, environmental expositions, laboratory work up, antifungal prophylaxis, clinical signs of infection, microbiological findings, antifungal therapy and outcome of infection at 30 days. The planned sample size is about 300 patients to be recruited in 35 participating center over 5 years, in a retrospective-prospective fashion. Data check will be performed at the coordinating center. Missing data will be managed to minimize incomplete reports. Statistical analysis will be performed by an independent reviewer, in order to assess risk factors predictive of fungal infection and outcome.</detailed_description>
