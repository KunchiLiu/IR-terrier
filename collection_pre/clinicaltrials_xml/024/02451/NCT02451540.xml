	<brief_summary>In this study the efficacy of Roflumilast in addition to LAMA/LABA therapy will be assessed using Functional Respiratory Imaging. In total 40 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stages C and D, who are stable on LABA/LAMA therapy and who are prone to dynamics hyperinflation will be included in this study. To indicate the susceptibility to dynamics hyperinflation patients should have a baseline Borg Fatigue score after the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) above 4. The patients will be randomized in such a way that 1 out of 2 patients will receive placebo and 1 the active component. Image parameters will be assessed and the correlation with lung function and health related quality of life will be checked before and after treatment.</brief_summary>
