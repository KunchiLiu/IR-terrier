	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: Demonstrate clinical benefit of Toujeo in achieving individualized HEDIS HbA1c targets (&lt;8% if age 65 years or with defined comorbidities (as listed in Appendix G) or otherwise &lt;7%) at 6 months without documented symptomatic (BG 70mg/dl) hypoglycemia at any time of day from baseline to 6 months in uncontrolled insulin naive patients with type 2 diabetes initiating basal insulin therapy in a real world setting. Secondary Objectives: Compare Toujeo to other commercially available basal insulins at 6 and 12 months after initiating insulin therapy in a real world setting in terms of: - Patient persistence with assigned basal insulin therapy - Risk of hypoglycemia including the incidence and rate of documented symptomatic and severe hypoglycemia - Changes in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, body weight - Differences in patient- and provider- reported outcomes (including Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire Status and Change Versions DTSQs and DTSQc), Hypoglycemia Patient Questionnaire, and patient and provider reported Global Effectiveness Scale (GES) - Healthcare resource utilization including hospitalizations and emergency department or other provider visits and healthcare costs.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : Patients with T2DM, as defined by the American Diabetes Association/World Health Organization, diagnosed for at least 1 year at the time of the screening visit, insufficiently controlled after at least 1 year of treatment with 2 or more of the following: oral agents (metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, dipeptidyl peptidase4 [DPP4] inhibitors, or sodiumglucose cotransporter 2 [SGLT2] inhibitors) or glucagonlike peptide1 (GLP1) receptor agonists approved for use with insulin. Adult patients who have signed an Informed Consent Form and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Authorization Form. Exclusion criteria: HbA1c &lt;8.0% or &gt;11.0%. Males or females &lt;18 years of age. Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Any clinically significant abnormality identified on physical examination, laboratory tests, or vital signs at the time of screening, or any major systemic disease resulting in short life expectancy that in the opinion of the Investigator would restrict or limit the patient's successful participation for the duration of the study. Use of any product containing insulin (Lantus, Levemir, Humulin, Novolin, Humalog, Novolog, Apidra, or Afrezza) since the time of diagnosis with T2DM other than temporary use during pregnancy or hospitalization. Use of any product containing insulin (Lantus, Levemir, Humulin, Novolin, Humalog, Novolog, Apidra, or Afrezza) occurring within 3 months prior to the time of screening. Use of oral hypoglycemic agents other than those noted in the inclusion criteria, GLP1 receptor agonists not approved for use with insulin, or any investigational agent (drug, biologic, or device) within 3 months prior to the time of screening. All contraindications to commercially available insulin therapy or warnings/precautions of use as displayed in the respective national product labeling for these products. Pregnancy or lactation. Women of childbearing potential with no effective contraceptive method. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
