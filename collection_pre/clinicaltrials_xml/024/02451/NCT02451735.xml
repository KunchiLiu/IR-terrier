	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to review and evaluate the effectiveness of new educational materials (informational booklet &amp; DVD) that promote participation in genetic counseling among breast cancer survivors. There are two phases to this study: Part 1 - reviewing the newly developed educational materials, and Part 2 - evaluating the effectiveness of the newly developed educational materials</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Counseling for Breast Cancer Survivors (GC for BC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part 1: Intervention Development Aim 1: Develop a psychoeducational intervention (PEI) for high-risk breast cancer survivors about genetic counseling (GC) and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). Part 2: Intervention Pilot Aim 2: Assess the feasibility and acceptability of a PEI from the perspective of the BC patients and health care professionals. Exploratory Aim 3: Estimate the preliminary efficacy of the PEI compared to standard clinical care. We hypothesize that women in the intervention group will have higher uptake of GC, greater increases in knowledge, and more perceived benefits related to GC compared to the control group.</detailed_description>
