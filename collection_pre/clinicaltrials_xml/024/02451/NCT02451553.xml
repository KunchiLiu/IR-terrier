	<brief_summary>This phase I/Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of afatinib dimaleate when given together with capecitabine in treating patients with solid tumors, pancreatic cancer, or biliary cancer that has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment and has not responded to previous treatment. Afatinib dimaleate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving afatinib dimaleate together with capecitabine may be a better treatment for solid tumors, pancreatic cancer, or biliary cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Afatinib Dimaleate and Capecitabine in Treating Patients With Advanced Refractory Solid Tumors, Pancreatic Cancer or Biliary Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of afatinib (afatinib dimaleate) in combination with capecitabine in patients with advanced solid tumors (phase I) and pancreatico-biliary cancers (phase Ib). (Phase I/Ib) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate biomarkers of response from metastatic tumor biopsies, including markers related to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) pathways via OncoPlex or other equivalent gene sequencing assay. (Phase I/Ib) II. Evaluate rates of response and stable disease, duration of response, time to progression, progression-free and overall survival. (Phase I/Ib) OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of afatinib dimaleate followed by a phase Ib study. Patients receive afatinib dimaleate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and capecitabine PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PHASE I: PHASE I: Histologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy PHASE I: Life expectancy &gt;= 12 weeks PHASE I: No limit on the number of prior systemic therapies for metastatic disease PHASE I: Prior treatment with erlotinib, gefitinib or EGFRblocking monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab and panitumumab) is allowed PHASE I: Signed informed consent PHASE I: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 02 PHASE I: Measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1 PHASE I: Must be willing to provide metastatic tumor tissue biopsy samples (may be fresh or archival paraffin embedded) at baseline PHASE I: In order to perform a retrospective biomarker analysis with the next generation gene sequencing University of Washington (UW)OncoPlex assay; fresh tumor biopsies will be done if considered safe and feasible by treating physician and radiologist; patients who already have OncoPlex or other equivalent gene sequencing assay (eg Frontier One, Perthera, Caris etc) test results available from prior metastatic tumor site biopsy are eligible to participate, without the needed of a repeat tumor biopsy, but the test results need to be provided to the study principal investigator PHASE I: Females of childbearing potential must use an effective method of contraception (barrier method of birth control or abstinence) from the time of consent until at least 180 days following discontinuation of protocol therapy; females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 3 days prior to registration for protocol therapy; patients are considered not of child bearing potential if they are surgically sterile (they have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months; females must not be pregnant or breastfeeding PHASE I: Sexually active male subjects must use an effective method of contraception (barrier method of birth control or abstinence) from the time of consent until at least 180 days following discontinuation of protocol therapy PHASE I: Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1500/uL PHASE I: Platelet count &gt;= 100,000/uL PHASE I: Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 gm/dL PHASE I: Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) PHASE I: Transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and/or alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) =&lt; 2.5 x ULN PHASE I: Prothrombin time (PT) (or international normalized ratio [INR]) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) =&lt;

patients who already have OncoPlex or other equivalent gene sequencing assay (eg Frontier One, Perthera, Caris etc) test results available from prior metastatic tumor site biopsy are eligible to participate, without the needed of a repeat tumor biopsy, but the test results need to be available to the study principal investigator PHASE IB: Females of childbearing potential must use an effective method of contraception (barrier method of birth control or abstinence) from the time of consent until at least 180 days following discontinuation of protocol therapy;
