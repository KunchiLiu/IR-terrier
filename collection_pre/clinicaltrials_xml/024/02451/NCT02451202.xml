	<brief_summary>It is unknown the impact of deep neuromuscular paralysis and using a novel agent, sugammadex as an reversal in endolaryngeal surgery. We will conduct a clinical study aiming to compare two treatment strategies; Deep neuromuscular Blockade and moderate Neuromuscular Blockade. We hypothesize that deep NMB will offer better stillness. We will also descriptively examine if patients would be safely discharged from a recovery room.</brief_summary>
