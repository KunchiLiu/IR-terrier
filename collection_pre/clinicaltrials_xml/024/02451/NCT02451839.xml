	<brief_summary>For public health purposes disability is becoming increasingly important as an outcome measure. Despite this, there are few data on the effectiveness of adalimumab on disability outcomes in patients with Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases (IMIDs), particularly in the Phase IV setting. There are even less data available in New Zealand, which did not have the opportunity to participate to a major extent in large, multinational, Phase III pivotal studies of adalimumab in IMIDs. The World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) 2.0 is a simple, validated, free and easy-to-use generic assessment instrument for health and disability. It is applicable across cultures, in all adult populations. It is a responsive measure that can show what difference a treatment makes. Results from study of effect of adalimumab on WHODAS scores and other Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO) of work activity and well-being will be of interest to a variety of stakeholders in the healthcare system including patients, healthcare practitioners and payers.</brief_summary>
