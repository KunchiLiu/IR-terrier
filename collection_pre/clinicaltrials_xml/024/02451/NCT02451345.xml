	<brief_summary>A UCSF PI-initiated study with a primary goal to improve decision quality, anxiety, and uncertainty, thereby increasing appropriate uptake of active surveillance and reducing over-treatment of low-risk prostate cancer. This study involves: completion of questionnaires through the secure website; consultation by a health coach to aid men with prostate cancer in making informed treatment decision (personalized coaching session(s)), bio-specimen collection/analysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decision Support Tools for Men With Prostate Cancer- Clinical &amp; Lifestyle Model</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A UCSF PI-initiated study which includes comprehensive decision support intervention incorporating clinical, lifestyle, tumor genomic, and germline gene variant data. The web and coaching intervention will: 1) summarize key clinical, lifestyle, and biomarker data elements, 2) communicate relative and absolute risks of upgrading/upstaging based on each of these elements, individually and in aggregate, and 3) provide tailored educational information for informed decision making on treatment options . A key aspect of the intervention will be provision of tiered coaching to the men prior to their physician visits to help them enter information accurately into the system, understand the results of the prediction model, document their questions for their physicians, and prepare them to make better-informed treatment decisions. UCSF research team will develop the decision support intervention in phases, initially using only CAPRA (validated clinical risk score), BMI (body mass index), and smoking data ; and then extend it to include information from genomic and genetic inputs as validation work progresses.</detailed_description>
