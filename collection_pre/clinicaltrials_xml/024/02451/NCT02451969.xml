	<brief_title>Safety and Immunogenicity Study of 23-valent Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine in Healthy Children, Adults and Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized, double-blind, single-center, controlled phase III clinical trial. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of an investigational 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) manufactured by Sinovac Biotech Co., Ltd. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that the immunogenicity of the investigational vaccine is non-inferior to that of a commercialized 23-valent PPV manufactured by Chengdu Institute of Biological products Co., Ltd.; the secondary objective is to assess the safety of the investigational and control vaccines. Participants will be grouped into three cohorts by age: child cohort (2 - 17 years old), adult cohort (18 - 60 years old) and elderly cohort (≥ 61 years old). In each cohort, the participants will be randomly assigned into experimental group or control group in the ratio 1:1.</detailed_description>
