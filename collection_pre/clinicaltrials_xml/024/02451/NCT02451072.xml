	<brief_summary>Aim of the present study is to investigate the neuronal correlates of self and of personal meaning as well as the role of the serotonin (5-HT) 2A receptor system in these processes using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and psychometric and cognitive measures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role of 5-HT2A Receptor in the Perception of Self and Personal Meaning in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study aims at identifying the contribution of the 5-HT2A receptor system to the formation of self and personal meaning in normal and altered states of consciousness. Specifically, the effect of the 5-HT2/1/6/7 receptor agonist lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) on self-consciousness, perception and the making of meaning will be assessed in 25 healthy subjects using a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, cross-over design. Furthermore, the contribution of the 5-HT2A receptor to these functions shall be assessed by pretreatment with the specific 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin.</detailed_description>
