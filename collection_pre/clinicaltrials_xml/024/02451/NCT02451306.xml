	<brief_summary>Bipolar disorder (BPD) is often misdiagnosed as unipolar depression. This leads to inadequate treatment and can have negative impact on the course of the disease. There is now preliminary evidence that patients with unipolar and bipolar depression as well as healthy individuals with a heightened risk of BPD can be distinguished from each other based on their brain activity patterns and functional connectivity during resting state. However, the impact of pharmacological treatment on these functional brain measures have not yet been clarified. For common antidepressants it has been shown that they seem to normalise aberrant brain activity patterns and functional connectivity. The problem is that some antidepressants can induce mania or accelerate pathological cycling in depressive patients with unrecognised BPD. Therefore, pharmacological drugs with mood-stabilising properties such as quetiapine are more and more prescribed. Although the effectiveness and tolerability have been proven, the neuronal effects of these adjunctive treatments are not clear. The aim of the study is thus to investigate the impact of quetiapine on measures of brain activity in depressive patients with a heightened risk of BPD. Moreover, the investigators want to examine whether the investigators can distinguish depressive patients with a heightened risk of BPD from depressive patients without a heightened risk of BPD using neuroimaging techniques, and whether these measures can predict the course of the disease.</brief_summary>
