	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of plasma alpha-GST measurements in liver donor (at the time of organ removal) to predict primary dysfunction in liver recipient. The secondary objective was to study the relationship between alpha-GST levels in the plasma of the liver transplant recipient and early graft function recovery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Usefulness of Alpha-GST in Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Graft primary dysfunction (PDF) after liver transplantation is enhanced by the increasing use of extended-criteria allografts. This complication is burdened with high mortality and morbidity rates among liver transplant recipients. Alpha-GST is a short-life hepatocyte enzyme that may be an interesting biomarker for liver injury. A recently developped ELISA technique may allow fast and easy measurement of alpha-GST plasma concentration (Fastpack IP α-GST Immunoassay, Qualigen Inc., Carlsbad, CA). This study aims to evaluate the ability of plasma alpha-GST measurements in liver donor to predict PDF in liver recipient. Methods: Observational study conducted in one center (Beaujon hospital, APHP, Clichy, France). Measurements of plasma levels of alpha-GST using Fastpack IP α-GST Immunoassay (Qualigen Inc., Carlsbad, CA) at the time of organ removal in liver donor and daily from day 0 to day 7 after liver transplantation in recipients.</detailed_description>
