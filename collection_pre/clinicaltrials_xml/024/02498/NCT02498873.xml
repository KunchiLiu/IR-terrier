	<brief_summary>In a competitive scenario, trainers and coaches seek to improve the performance of their athletes organizing macrocycles (year), mesocycles (months), and microcycles (weeks) training aimed at a specific moment of a competition. The organization variables, mainly the intensity of exercise in a training routine can stimulate important physiological pathways and uphold superior gains to VO2max, leading to a peak aerobic performance. However, due to lack of evidence, and the difficulty of control on a large scale, the effects of the intensity organization over a mesocycle periodization are still poorly investigated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Linear Running Periodization x Nonlinear</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is compare two intensity blocks organization a) linear progression intensity (LP) and b) randomized or not intensity linaer (NLP) over five months running training, and a crossover design between subjects, on gains in VO2max, peak velocity (Vpeak) and critical power (CP). Furthermore, the relationship between the gains obtained with the training and the amount of exercise will be established. In our case all dependent variables will increase after training, with no significant differences between the two strategies on dependent variables.</detailed_description>
