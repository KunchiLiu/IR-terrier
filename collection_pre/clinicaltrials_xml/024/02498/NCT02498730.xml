	<brief_summary>Our main objective will be to evaluate the chronic effects (12 weeks) of high-intensity interval training compared to moderate intensity (same total work) on reducing the symptoms of bipolar disorder, cortical changes, as well as on the VO2max. In addition, the investigators will establish what influence of gain to VO2max has on reducing symptoms.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Physical exercise has significant effects on health promotion and the consequent reduction of the severity of bipolar disorder (BD). This review establishes a pattern of response of exercise and potential impact on the pathophysiology of BD; , as well as, produces hypotheses on how acute and chronic effect of exercises may act differently; and provides future perspectives with the focus of the exercise as an important and innovative model of treatment for BD and mental disorder. A critical evaluation of the literature was undertaken including the influence of exercise on health promotion in patients with mental disorders, neurochemical behavior exercise-induced, as well as reflective introduction of news perspectives of training control in severe exercise domain. The exercise induces significant changes in monoaminergic after, and with long-term training, and work with a threshold of exercise can modulate positive effects on mood. Fast adaptive effects from the high intensity interval training should be considered in BD patients. However, there must be caution in his administration. We speculate that exercise may be a way of maintaining euthymia in the case of BD, making it less vulnerable patient to stay longer at a time of neutrality. Future research is needed to adopt a training strategy that is both time efficient in the different areas and adequate for the population in question.</detailed_description>
