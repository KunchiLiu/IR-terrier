	<criteria>All population: Chinese population Adequate hematological function: platelet count greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 100*10^9 per liter (/L), hemoglobin (Hb) &gt;= 12 grams/deciliter (g/dL) (male) or &gt;= 11 g/dL (female), white blood cell (WBC) count &gt;= 4*10^9/L and &lt;= 11*10^9/L Healthy volunteers: Absence of evidence of any active or chronic disease Negative hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (HBV DNA), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb), hepatitis B envelope antigen (HBeAg), hepatitis B envelope antiody (HBeAb) and hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) Adequate liver function: transaminases alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;= 1.0 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) Treatment na√Øve CHB patients: HBsAgpositive (&gt;=250 international unit/milliliter [IU/mL]), compensated liver function, noncirrhotic HBeAgpositive, HBV DNA &gt;= 200,000 IU/ml or equivalent copies/mL, ALT &gt;1.5 times the ULN and ALT &lt;8 times the ULN HBeAgnegative nucleoside/nucleotide analoguetreated CHB patients: Subjects who HBeAgseroconverted on nucleoside/nucleotide analogue therapy (treatment for 1 to 3 years prior to enrollment) with HBV DNA &lt;90 IU/mL or below a detection level acceptable by both the sponsor and investigator for at least the preceding 6 months; HBeAg negative and HBeAb positive HBsAgpositive (&gt;=250 IU/mL), compensated liver function, noncirrhotic ALT &lt;= 1*ULN Use of steroids or other immune suppressive agents within the last 4 weeks that would impact the number/functions of white blood cells (WBC) Any other diseases or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition (including, but not limited to, cancer, lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, or other autoimmune disease) that could confound the result of the study Positive Hepatitis A immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody, Hepatitis C antibody (HCV Ab) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at screening Significant acute infection, example; influenza, acute gastrointestinal symptoms or any other clinically significant illness within 2 weeks Previous/concurrent treatment with interferonbased therapy for CHB</criteria>
