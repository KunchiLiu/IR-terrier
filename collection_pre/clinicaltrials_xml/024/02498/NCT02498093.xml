	<brief_summary>Conventional rehabilitation after total hip arthroplasty (THA) does not seem to restore muscular strength or walking speed. Three-5 years after surgery patients are still not fully rehabilitated. This study evaluates the effects of maximal strength training on the muscular strength in leg press and abduction in patients undergoing THA. Aim of the study is to increase the patients physical function through evidence-based rehabilitation in clinical practice, with gradually less supervision.</brief_summary>
