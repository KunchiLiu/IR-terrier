	<brief_summary>A promising form of enhancing brain function non-invasively involves stimulating the brain using weak magnetic or electric currents. This method is becoming increasingly popular in both clinical and commercial circles; a number of portable, at-home devices are available on the commercial market for personal use. In this study, the investigators aim to determine factors associated with the enhancement of cognitive and motor learning following transcranial direct-current stimulation in healthy young adults. Understanding how participants respond to brain stimulation is critical to maximizing the effectiveness of stimulation and determining its potential as a performance-enhancing aid for mental tasks. Future developments of this study may also inform the capacity of brain stimulation to act as non-drug alternative to treatment for cognitive decline.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Participants must be in good health, between 1835 years of age with no prior history of neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke with paralysis. Participants with cardiac stimulators (pacemakers) and those with metal implants in the skull will be excluded. Pregnant women will also be excluded. Participants will be required to fill out a brief health questionnaire to ensure that they have no conditions that would prevent brain stimulation.</criteria>
