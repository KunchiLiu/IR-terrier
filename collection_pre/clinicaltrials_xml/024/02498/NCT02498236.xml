	<brief_title>Target Engagement for Oxytocin: Dose Ranging Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects with schizophrenia spectrum disorders will be randomly assigned to one of 8 doses of oxytocin. After screening and informed consent subjects will receive either their assigned dose or a placebo. Thirty minutes following the drug administration patients will be evaluated on the EEG and pupillometry tasks followed by two tests that evaluate social salience. One week later subjects will have a second challenge in the alternative (drug or placebo) condition.</detailed_description>
