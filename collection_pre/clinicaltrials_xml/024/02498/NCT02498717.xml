	<brief_title>Preliminary Review of Cold and Active Compression Therapy for Traumatic Calcaneus or Ankle Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Initial research has shown that cryocompression therapy applied post-operatively has been effective in reducing recovery time and improving health and pain factors related to patient recovery. However, there has been limited research into how this translates into positive economic outcomes for both the hospital and the patient. In addition, it can be reasonably hypothesized that the use of the cryocompression therapy system before surgery will lead to an increased rate of reduction in swelling necessary to allow proper operative procedures to take place when compared to the standard ice and elevation (RICE) therapy techniques and cryocompression therapy applied only post-operatively. This should lead to decreased hospital costs and possible improved patient outcomes related to recovery. Study Objectives This study will examine the initial efficacy and cost-effectiveness of using the cryocompression therapy model both pre-operatively and post-operatively in patients that have recently suffered a traumatic calcaneus or ankle fracture compared to the standard pre-operative RICE therapy procedures.</detailed_description>
