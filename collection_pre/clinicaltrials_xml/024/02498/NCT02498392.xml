	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety and tolerability of JNJ-42165279 in participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) with anxiety symptoms who have had inadequate response to treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonergic/noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor (SNRI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability Study of JNJ-42165279 in Participants With Major Depressive Disorder With Anxious Distress</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives), placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group study in participants with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with Anxious Distress. Participants who had treatment initiated with a SSRI/SNRI allowed by the protocol will be evaluated at the investigation site. The site assessment will be reviewed and validated by an independent central rater. The review will include the clinical history of MDD, SSRI/SNRI treatment of adequate dose and duration for the current episode of depression, and current symptom severity on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS17). Enrolled participants will be maintained on SSRI/SNRI treatment throughout the study to determine whether additional treatment with JNJ-4216579 can reduce the symptoms of MDD with anxious distress.The study will consist of 3 phases: a Screening Phase of up to 4 weeks, an 11-week double-blind Treatment Phase, and a 3-week post-treatment (follow up) Phase. The double-blind treatment Phase of the trial will consist of 3 periods. The first period is a placebo lead-in of double-blind duration, after which participants will enter the treatment period when they will be randomly assigned to JNJ-42165279 or continuation on placebo for 6 weeks. Participants who successfully complete the treatment period prior to the end of Week 11, will be treated with placebo for the remaining time of the double-blind phase of the study, which will vary depending on the duration of the placebo lead-in for the specific participant. The total study duration for each participant will be approximately 18 weeks. Efficacy and safety of JNJ-42165279 will be evaluated. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
