	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, open label, Phase 1 dose-escalation study of DSP-7888 Dosing Emulsion administered to adult patients with advanced malignancies. Patients will be administered escalating doses of DSP-7888 Dosing Emulsion intradermally or subcutaneously in accordance with the following regimen: once weekly for four weeks during the Induction Phase, once every 7 to 14 days for 6 weeks during the Consolidation Phase, and once every 14 to 28 days until a discontinuation criterion is met during the Maintenance Phase.</brief_summary>

Patient has an infection requiring treatment with systemic antibiotics or antiviral medication or has completed treatment for such an infection within 14 days prior to planned first dose of study drug 6. Patient requires systemic, pharmacologic doses of corticosteroids (equivalent to &gt;30 mg hydrocortisone/day) Note: Replacement doses (equivalent to ≤ 5 mg prednisone/day), and topical, ophthalmic, and inhalation steroids are permitted as needed 7. Patient has a positive test for Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C antibody, human immunodeficiency virus HIV1 or HIV2 antibody, or has a history of a positive result for hepatitis C virus (HCV) or HIV 8.

Woman who is pregnant or lactating or has a positive pregnancy test at screening. If a woman has a positive pregnancy test, further evaluation may be conducted to rule out ongoing pregnancy to allow the patient to be eligible 12.
