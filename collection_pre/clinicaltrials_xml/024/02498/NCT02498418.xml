	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to demonstrate rifaximin 200-mg tablets (test) and Xifaxan® 200 mg tablets (reference ) are clinically bioequivalent with respect to the clinical cure rates when administered 3 times a day (TID) for 3 days in subjects with travelers' diarrhea.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing Rifaximin With Xifaxan 200mg in Traveler's Diarrhea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, placebo-controlled bioequivalent study with a clinical endpoint in the treatment of travelers' diarrhea. After three unformed stools are recorded within the 24 hours immediately preceding randomization, subjects are to be randomized to receive the generic rifaximin 200 mg oral tablet, the reference listed drug (RLD) 200 mg oral tablet or placebo three times daily for 3 days (i.e., on study Days 1, 2, and 3).

Diarrhea is defined as the passage of at least three unformed stools in a 24hour period. Stools are classified as formed (retains shape), soft (assumes shape of container), or watery (can be poured). When using this classification, both soft and watery stools are unformed and abnormal. 2. At least three unformed stools recorded within the 24 hours immediately preceding randomization. 3. At least one of the following signs and symptoms of enteric infection: abdominal pain or cramps nausea vomiting fecal urgency excessive gas/flatulence tenesmus 4. Women of childbearing potential have a negative pregnancy test prior to beginning therapy and agree to use effective contraceptive methods during the study. 1. Pregnant, breast feeding, or planning a pregnancy. 2. Immediately prior to randomization, acute diarrhea for &gt; 72 hours. 3. Presence of: fever (≥ 100 °F or ≥ 37.8 °C), or hematochezia (blood in stool), or clinical findings suggesting moderate or severe dehydration. 4. Active, uncontrolled, or clinically significant diseases or disorders of the heart, lung, kidney, GI tract (other than infectious diarrhea in travelers), or central nervous system. 5. Administration of any of the following: any antimicrobial agents with an expected activity against enteric bacterial pathogens within 7 days preceding randomization more than two doses of a symptomatic antidiarrheal compound such as antimotility agents, absorbent agents, and antisecretory agents within 8 hours preceding randomization 6. Use of any drug such as aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil), which can cause GI bleeding. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or paracetamol is acceptable. 7. If required during the study antimalarial prophylactic treatment, including doxycycline, is permitted prior to and during the study</criteria>
