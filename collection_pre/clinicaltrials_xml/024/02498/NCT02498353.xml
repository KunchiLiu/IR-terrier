	<brief_title>Comparing Preoperative Short-course Radiotherapy With or Without Local Boost for Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study plans to recruit 100 patients,randomized into study group and control group,patients in study group are given the dose of PTV(planned target volume)-CTV(clinical target volume) 25Gy/5F with a local boost of PTV-GTV(gross tumour volume) 30Gy/5F；patients in control group are given the dose of PTV-CTV 25Gy/5F without a local boost. The other inventions are the same during the whole treatment,after the radiotherapy,they will receive a surgery under TME((total mesorectal excision) principal.Comparing the toxicity of radiotherapy, R0 resection rate,pathological complete remission rate, complications of operation and sphincter retention rate of these two groups to find out weather local boost bringing benefits to patients with local advanced rectal cancer.</detailed_description>
