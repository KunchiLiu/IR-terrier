	<brief_summary>This study is aimed at evaluating single short spinal technique as a form of labour analgesia in a setting where more expensive and labor intensive techniques are not feasible.The study will examine the safety and efficacy of two drug combinations (intrathecal morphine+fentanyl vs intrathecal morphine+bupivacaine) through a randomized control trial. The investigators hypothesize that a single shot of either intrathecal morphine plus fentanyl or intrathecal morphine plus bupivacaine achieve analgesia and are safe in parturients experiencing normal labour.</brief_summary>
