	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and periodontitis are chronic inflammatory diseases. The study aims to determine if the genetic polymorphism of SERPINA1 gene in patients with COPD serve as a risk factor for developing periodontitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Association of SERPINA1 Gene Disturbance in Patients With Lung and Gum Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>periodontitis is a polymicrobial inflammatory disease caused by various modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. the non-modifiable risk factors include genetic polymorphisms like the gene coding for alpha-1-antitrypsinase COPD is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by deterioration of lung function due to loss of elasticity of the lungs. SERPINA1 gene product has a protective role on the connective tissue components of both lungs and gums. Hence, this study tries to determine if the gene polymorphism in COPD serves as a risk factor for developing periodontitis.</detailed_description>
