	<brief_title>The Effects and Safety of Low Calcium Dialysis on Coronary Artery Calcification in Maintenance Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MHD patients recruited in this study were randomly divided into two groups: routine dialysis group (with dialysate calcium concentration 1.5mmol/L) and low calcium dialysis group (with dialysate calcium concentration 1.25mmol/L). All patients were dialyzed thrice weekly for 4 hours with a bicarbonate-based solution. They were followed up in every dialysis interview during the 1-year study, the occurrence of all adverse reactions associated with dialysis were recorded during the study. All patients received heart spiral CT examination before and at the end of the study. Coronary artery calcification was assessed by a certain professional who was not affiliated to the dialysis center.</detailed_description>
