	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess whether administration of a bolus dose of MgSO4 (magnesium sulfate) plus standard therapy is superior to standard therapy alone for the management of Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Obstructive Disease (AECOPD) in the emergency department. The investigators hypothesize that MgSO4 causes faster recovery of the bronchospasm, and a reduction of the dead space, translating to the following clinical outcomes : less hospitalisation, lower length of stay (LOS), better composite outcome of hospitalisation + LOS + readmission for AECOPD.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients presenting to the participant Emergency Departments (ED) with a diagnosis of AECOPD and who receive at least one dose of albuterol, will be randomized to receive either placebo or one dose of MgSO4 2g IV. Security and efficacy outcomes will be measured.</detailed_description>
