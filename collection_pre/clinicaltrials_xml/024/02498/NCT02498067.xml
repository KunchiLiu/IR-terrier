	<brief_summary>The investigators will develop a digital application (app)—"rPlan dual protection" (rPlan)—to be used in the clinic waiting room prior to a gynecological and/or contraceptive visit. The goal of this research is to develop the app and conduct a feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness assessment of rPlan to examine improvement in dual method use, enhancement of contraceptive adherence and continuation, increase of condom use and decrease of sexually transmitted infection (STI) and human immunodeficiency virus(HIV) infection. The research will consist of baseline activities as well as 6 week phone call and 12 week in-clinic survey and STI test, as well as a retrospective chart review.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>rPlan Multimedia Dual Protection Intervention to Reduce Health Disparities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using the investigators' experience in digital media, behavior theory, client-centered interventions, and family planning, the investigators will develop a digital application ("app")—rPlan—to be used in the clinic waiting room prior to a gynecological and/or contraceptive visit. The goal of this research is to develop the app and conduct a feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness assessment of rPlan. This study will develop rPlan, a three-part intervention that includes a precounseling app that promotes dual protection, motivational interviewing-informed counseling, and concomitant printed educational materials. The research will proceed in two phases. In Phase I, the investigators will assemble a 10-member stakeholder advisory team to enhance the PreCounselor app to focus on dual protection, train reproductive health counselors in motivational interviewing, and create concomitant printed educational materials. In Phase II, the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed. The specific aims are to: Aim 1: Develop the rPlan intervention by (1) enhancing the pretested PreCounselor app to focus on dual protection, (2) training reproductive health counselors, and (3) creating concomitant printed educational materials. Aim 2: Conduct a pre/post feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness assessment of rPlan to examine improvement in dual method use, enhancement of contraceptive adherence and continuation, increase of condom use, and decrease of STI/HIV infection. The primary outcome is dual method use, which will be measured via patient report at 6 weeks and 12 weeks post enrollment. The secondary outcomes are contraceptive adherence/uptake (measured at 6 and 12 weeks post enrollment), frequency of unprotected penile-vaginal/anal intercourse (PVI/PAI) (measured at 6 and 12 weeks post enrollment, and risk reduction behaviors (measured at 6 and 12 weeks post enrollment), decisional balance/self-efficacy (measured at 12 weeks post enrollment), and STI infection (12 weeks post enrollment). The research will consist of baseline activities as well as 6 week phone call and 12 week in-clinic survey and STI test, as well as a retrospective chart review to capture interceding visits (e.g., initial contraceptive method selection, method switching, etc.) and diagnoses (e.g., pregnancy, STI/HIV).</detailed_description>
