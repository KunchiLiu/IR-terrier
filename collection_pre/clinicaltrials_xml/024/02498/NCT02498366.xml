	<brief_summary>In order to determine norm values for skeleton muscle disassembly due to physical exertion in healthy and trained population, and developing a prediction test for approval for rhabdomyolysis injuries to return to duty, 50 healthy subjects will undergo a series of different physical tests.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exertional Rhabdomyolysis- Characterization of Prediction Tests for Return to Duty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>50 healthy civilians volunteers will be recruited for this study. Each subject will undergo the physical tests: anthropometric measurements, wingate test, VO2max test, step test and running on the anaerobic threshold, on separate days. Blood sample, lactic acid level (measured in blood drop - finger sting) and urine sample will be taken before and after every test.</detailed_description>
