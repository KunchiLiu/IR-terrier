	<brief_summary>Using Virtual Reality and Robotics Technologies for Vocational Evaluation, Training and Placement (VR4VR) is a project that incorporates Virtual Reality into job training to increase job opportunities for people who have physical or mental disabilities. The investigators are using Virtual Reality and robotics for job evaluation, training and placement of people with disabilities. The investigators' goal is to assess and train people in a safe, adaptable, and fun virtual environment similar to a video game. This is an interventional study with three target populations: autism spectrum disorder, traumatic brain injury, and severe mobility and manipulation impairments. The prototype system allows for a wide range of environments with the vocational evaluator easily controlling the virtual experience, while the job seekers interact realistically.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Procedures If the participant takes part in this study, they will be asked to: - Arrive at the Rehabilitation Robotics &amp; Prosthetics Testbed (RRT) building at the times agreed to between the participant, the job coach and the key research personnel. - Use a virtual reality system that is like a large video game with the job coach. - Complete some skill tasks in the virtual world video game: - Cleaning skills such as vacuum cleaning, mopping and litter collection. - Loading virtual boxes into back of a virtual truck. - Fulfilling orders and deliveries with tangible boxes in a virtual warehouse. - Navigating to different checkpoints in an outdoor virtual environment. - Money management skills such as recognizing coin and bill amounts, counting money and giving correct amount of change to virtual customers. - Communicating with virtual characters. - These tasks will take place in non-real virtual environments such as: warehouse, grocery, parking lot, and outside. - The job coach or counselor will be with the participant just as they would in a traditional job training. - The researchers will ask the participant questions about what they liked and disliked about the virtual reality system video game. These questions can be asked directly or via a form. - There will be 15 minutes break times every hour and the total time will be equal to the participant's normal job coach interactions. - The participant will be asked to participate no more than 5 hours each day, up to 15 days. Number of training days will be decided by the participant, the job coach, and the research staff. - Data related to the time and the performance from the start to the end of each task will be recorded at the background automatically. - Audio/visual and/or video documentation of the study may be recorded. Video and photographic recordings will be used only to aid in presenting the study for academic purposes. All information will be kept anonymous. - Subjects' screening will be performed by the subjects' therapists beforehand, who will decide whether the subject is eligible for this study or not, based on the investigators' inclusion/exclusion requirements. - Total Number of Participants: Up to 100 people (Up to 50 individuals with disabilities and Up to 50 healthy individuals) will take part in this study. A $50 gift card will be given to each participant on their first training session as a thank you gift and an incentive to participate in the study.</detailed_description>
