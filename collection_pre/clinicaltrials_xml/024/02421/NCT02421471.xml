	<detailed_description>Picato速 (ingenol mebutate) gel is a new topical therapy for Actinic Keratosis (AK) in adults which was approved by the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) in December 2013. For AK in face or scalp the 0.015 percent gel is approved to be applied once a day for 3 consecutive days, and for AK in trunk or extremities the 0.05 percent gel is approved to be applied once a day for 2 consecutive days. The re-examination period for Picato速 runs from December 2013 to December 2019, during which at least 3,000 patients who are prescribed ingenol mebutate gel for the first time by investigator's medical judgment must be documented in a standard Post Marketing Surveillance (PMS) study. Each patient is to be observed for 8 weeks following application of ingenol mebutate gel. If a patient is unable to visit the PMS site, the investigator may contact the patient by phone to assess the safety.</detailed_description>
