	<brief_summary>A retrospective, multi-center, proof-of-concept study to evaluate the use of remote monitoring in rural emergency departments to decrease time to treatment decision for pacemaker and defibrillator patients using the St Jude Medical Merlin@home transmitter. The purpose of the study is to determine if utilization of remote monitoring technology in a rural emergency department may improve patient care. Up to 10 rural ED sites will enroll a total of 200 patients. One hundred patients will be in the remote monitoring group comprised of patients with SJM devices compatible with the unpaired transmitter and 100 patients will be in the usual medical care group comprised of patients with SJM devices that are not compatible with the unpaired transmitter or that have a competitor's device.</brief_summary>
