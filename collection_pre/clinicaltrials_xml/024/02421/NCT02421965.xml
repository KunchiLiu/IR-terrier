	<brief_title>Comparing Mobile Health (mHealth) and Clinic-Based Self-Management Interventions for Serious Mental Illness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of the study is to compare two illness self-management interventions for SMI: a clinic-based group protocol (Wellness Recovery Action Planning or WRAP) and an mHealth smartphone intervention (FOCUS). The study is structured as a randomized controlled trial, and data will be collected using a comprehensive mixed-methods quantitative /qualitative approach. This study will evaluate patients willingness to enroll in one of the two illness-self management interventions, patient satisfaction, engagement, symptoms, recovery and quality of life. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) Evaluate and compare the willingness and ability of individuals with SMI to enroll in the two illness self-management interventions; 2) Examine and compare participant engagement and satisfaction with both treatments; and 3) Examine and compare patient outcomes following participation in the interventions. Participants will be randomized to receive 12-weeks of WRAP or FOCUS. Participants allocated to the WRAP group will be provided all other materials (i.e. WRAP binder, handouts) in their first session and will meet weekly in groups with trained facilitators. Participants in the FOCUS group will be given a study smartphone device with FOCUS application and trained by the mHealth support specialist on how to use the functions of the smartphone (i.e. using a touchscreen, call, text) and different features of the FOCUS intervention.</detailed_description>
