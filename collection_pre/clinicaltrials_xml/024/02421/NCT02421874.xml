	<brief_summary>The purpose of this Phase II Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to complete development and evaluate usability and effectiveness of the Wraparound Team Monitoring System (Wrap-TMS), a web-based, electronic behavioral health information system (EBHIS) for the most widely implemented care coordination model in children's behavioral health, the wraparound process. Though wraparound is now considered "evidence-based," implementation in the real world often fails to conform to standards of fidelity and/or use objective data to guide management, supervision, and clinical decision making. Availability of such a system will support efficiency, implementation quality and fidelity, and outcomes for youths enrolled in wraparound. Wrap-TMS features functionality for data entry, management, and basic reporting for the full array of data and information elements needed to manage an integrated care coordination initiative for youths with serious emotional and behavioral disorder (SEBD). In light of our success in Phase I, subsequent partnerships with federal agencies, and inquiries of interest from several states and over 20 provider and managed care organizations, in this Phase II STTR the investigators will complete development of Wrap-TMS, followed by a randomized controlled effectiveness study comparing n=25 wraparound facilitators who use Wrap-TMS serving n=100 families to 25 non-user facilitators serving 100 families on practitioner, implementation, and youth/family outcomes. The evaluation will test two primary hypotheses: 1. Compared to facilitators in the control group, wraparound facilitators trained to use Wrap-TMS will demonstrate (a) greater use of data and feedback in service delivery; (b) greater fidelity to the wraparound process; (c) higher self-reported teamwork, working alliance, and satisfaction with the intervention; and (d) more positive attitudes toward standardized assessment. 2. Compared to the control group, parents of youths receiving services from facilitators trained to use TMS will report (a) greater goal clarity, (b) more data collection and use (c) greater satisfaction with services and progress, (d) better fidelity to wraparound, (e) more effective team functioning, (f) greater treatment alliance, and (f) better youth outcomes including greater progress and improved symptoms and functioning.</brief_summary>
