	<brief_summary>The researchers propose to investigate the prevalence of gadolinium in the urine of patients with a prior gadolinium-enhanced MRI before and after a edetate calcium disodium challenge. Moreover, will investigate if there is any correlation of gadolinium urine levels with levels of endogenous (e.g zinc) and xenobiotic metals.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prolonged Gadolinium Retention After MRI Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators propose to enroll 20 volunteers in this pilot study, including males older than 20 years and postmenopausal women in two groups: Group 1: Individuals who had a gadolinium-enhanced MRI study within 1-4 weeks before participation and Group 2: Individuals who had gadolinium-enhanced MRI study within 3-6 months before enrollment. The results will inform future analyses of gadolinium retention, excretion, and potential symptoms associated with same. Thus, the specific aims of this cross sectional study are to: 1. Evaluate levels of gadolinium in the urine of adults with normal kidney function and a prior MRI performed within 6 months at baseline, and after a single dose of edetate calcium disodium . 2. Evaluate levels of endogenous and xenobiotic metal levels and their relationship with gadolinium levels. 3. Evaluate for symptoms of gadolinium toxicity.</detailed_description>
