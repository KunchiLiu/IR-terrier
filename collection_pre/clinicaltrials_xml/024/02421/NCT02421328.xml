	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, randomized crossover study to recognize the effects of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) versus heated humidified high flow nasal cannula (HHHFNC) on diaphragmatic dimensions and excursion (evaluated by ultrasonography) in preterm infants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Effects of CPAP and HHHFNC on Diaphragmatic Dimensions in Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preterm infants will be recruited consecutively from NICU of Mansoura University Children's Hospital. They will be randomized in two groups; one group will start on nasal CPAP (Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare, Auckland, New Z ealand) (Pressure 5 cmH2O) for 60 minutes and then will be switched to HHHFNC (Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare, Auckland, New Z ealand) (flow of 4 l/m) for another 60 minutes. The other group will start on HHHFNC and then switched to nasal CPAP. After the 2 h study period (2Ã—60 minutes epochs) further respiratory support will be at the discretion of the clinical team. Ultrasonographic assessment of diaphragmatic dimensions and excursion will be analyzed in different respiratory cycles and the average of 3 cycles will be calculated at the end of the 60 minutes periods on nasal CPAP and HHHFNC.</detailed_description>
