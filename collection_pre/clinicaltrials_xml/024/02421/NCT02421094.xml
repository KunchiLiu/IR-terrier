	<brief_summary>A Randomized, Controlled, Double-blind, Parallel Group, Single Center Phase 2 Clinical Trial to Evaluate Multiple Non-Invasive Liver Fibrosis Imaging Methods in the Assessment of the Efficacy of GR-MD-02 for the Treatment of Liver Fibrosis in Patients with NASH with Advanced Fibrosis</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial to Evaluate Efficacy of GR-MD-02 for Treatment of Liver Fibrosis in Patients With NASH With Advanced Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to determine the difference between placebo and GR-MD-02 treatment in the baseline adjusted mean change in liver fibrosis as measured by corrected T1 (cT1) mapping as determined from LiverMultiScan (LMS), a multi-parametric MRI protocol. Secondary objectives include evaluating differences between subjects treated with GR-MD-02 versus placebo in: - The baseline-adjusted change in liver stiffness as measured by MR-elastography - The baseline-adjusted change in liver stiffness as measured by FibroScan® scores. An exploratory objective will be to evaluate the correlation of the three diagnostic modalities of LiverMultiScan, MR-Elastography, and FibroScan®.</detailed_description>
