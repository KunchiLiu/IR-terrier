	<brief_summary>Hypertension affects about 30% of the United Kingdom population and is causally implicated in the aetiology of renal disease, cardiovascular disease and stroke. Ageing, obesity, a poor diet and low levels of physical activity are all risk factors. Studies have shown that adherence to a Mediterranean diet is protective against hypertension and its associated morbidities; olive oil is believed to be a key beneficially bioactive component of that diet. As a source of lipids olive oil is an unremarkable blend of monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids; it is however rich in phenolic compounds, principally oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol, which may be of benefit to health. A recent randomised intervention trial in predominantly hypertensive volunteers showed that adherence to a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra virgin olive oil, reduced blood pressure and other measures of cardiovascular disease risk. Olive phenolics can be extracted cheaply from the waste products of olive oil manufacture, such as the plant leaf and these are used as dietary supplements. In intervention studies in hypertensive or borderline hypertensive patients, olive leaf extract consumption has been shown to reduce blood pressure. Another intervention with established efficacy for improving blood pressure is to increase physical activity. The 'Start Active, Stay Active', Chief Medical Officers report on physical activity recommends that adults achieve 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per week, while data in that report suggest that fewer than 40% of adult men and 30% of adult women achieve these targets. Adherence to the physical activity guidelines may in fact be much worse in sub-sections of the population at higher risk of hypertension. From a public health perspective, holistic guidelines for the prevention of hypertension, or its early diagnosis and management, based around a healthy diet and lifestyle are preferable to pharmaceutical intervention. Lifestyle interventions are economically favourable and they come with fewer side effects and perhaps wider health benefits than antihypertensive drugs. The aim of the study is to evidence the synergistic benefits of consuming plant (and specifically olive) phenolics alongside achieving the recommended guidelines for physical activity in individuals with elevated blood pressure.</brief_summary>
