	<brief_summary>In France, it has be estimated that the hospital readmission rate within 30 days of patients aged 75 or older is 14% (IC95% [12.0-16.7]), nearly a quarter being avoidable. There is evidence that interventions "bridging" the transition from hospital to home involving a dedicated professional (usually nurses) would be most effective in reducing the risk of readmission, but the level of evidence of current studies is low. Our study aims to assess the impact of a program of transitional care from hospital to home for people of 75 years old or more admitted to acute care.</brief_summary>
