	<brief_summary>Our primary hypothesis is that a two weeks high-intensity task-oriented circuit training followed by a structured 3 months home exercise program would have higher benefits compared to a delayed-treatment group as control in people with multiple sclerosis and mild to moderate gait impairment. Our secondary hypothesis is that there could be retention of clinical gains in subjects that underwent TOCT plus structured 3 months home exercise program.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Task-oriented Circuit Training in Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single blind randomized-controlled trial to test the effects of a task oriented training on locomotor function, mobility and balance in multiple sclerosis subjects with mild to moderate gait impairments (EDSS 4-5.5). Subjects and methods:54 multiple sclerosis patients will be recruited in two outpatient rehabilitation clinics (Azienda Ospedaliero- Universitaria di Ferrara and Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Pisana). Informed consent will be obtained. Participants enrolled will be included in 2 different treatment groups: experimental group will receive 10 TOCT sessions over 2 weeks (2 hours/each session) followed by a 3 months home exercise program, whereas control group will be included into a delayed-treatment group. Three subjects with a supervisor physiotherapist will take part at the TOCT. Primary outcome measure will be walking endurance (Six Minute Walking Test); as secondary outcome we will test gait speed (Timed 25-Foot Walk), balance (Dynamic Gait Index) and mobility (Time Up and Go Test); through self-assessment questionnaires we will evaluate motor fatigue (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale - MFIS), walking ability (Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale - 12), health-related quality of life (Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale - 29 and Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis). In addition to clinical outcomes, in a convenience sample we will have: (i) balance assessment (force platform); (ii) motorcortex oxygenation during walking (fNIRS); (iii) muscle oxygenation (NIRS); (iv) force and EMG signal; (v) mechanical and electrical fatigue assessment; (vi) brain connectivity (EEG). Outcome measures will be assessed 1 week prior to treatment initiation (T0), after two weeks to treatment initiation (T1), after the 3 months exercise program (T2) and at 3 months follow-up (T3) to evaluate treatments retention, by a clinician blinded to the treatment. The specific aims will be (i) to test the effects on walking, mobility, balance, fatigue and health-related quality of life; (ii) to test the effects on cerebral oxygenation (fNIRS) during walking; (iii) muscle oxygenation (NIRS); (iv) force and EMG signal; (v) Mechanical and electrical fatigue assessment; (vi) brain connectivity (EEG) and (vii) to investigate the 3 months home exercise program's feasibility, satisfaction and adherence.</detailed_description>
