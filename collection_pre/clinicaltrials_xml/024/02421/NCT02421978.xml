	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to try and provide data linking the impact of increased inflammatory cytokines as a result of chemotherapy and their relationship with increased levels of CNS glutamate and related behavioral and cognitive consequences in breast cancer patients. The investigators will use neuropsychiatric assessments, blood sampling and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) to collect study data.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inflammation-Induced CNS Glutamate During Breast Cancer Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 70% of women with breast cancer experience behavioral and/or cognitive symptoms during treatment with chemotherapy and approximately 30% of women continue to experience these symptoms months to years after treatment completion. There is mounting data to suggest that inflammation may be involved and indicate that chemotherapy-treated breast cancer patients exhibit higher inflammatory markers than non-chemotherapy-treated patients, and inflammatory markers including interleukin (IL)-6 and soluble tumor necrosis factor (sTNFR2) have been associated with chemotherapy-induced depression and fatigue.</detailed_description>
