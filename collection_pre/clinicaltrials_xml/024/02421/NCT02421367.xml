Planned administration or administration of a vaccine/product not planned in the study protocol during the period starting 30 days prior to the first dose of vaccine/placebo until 30 days after the last dose of study vaccine/placebo (routine influenza vaccination will be allowed as long as it is not administered within 14 days of the vaccine/placebo, and will not lead to study exclusion although it should be reported to the PI) 4. History of dengue infection or dengue illness, or history of flavivirus vaccination (e.g., yellow fever, tickborneencephalitis virus [TBEV], Japanese encephalitis, and dengue) 5. Planned administration of any flavivirus vaccine for the entire study duration 6. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product (pharmaceutical product or device) 7. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required) 8. Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency 9. Autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease 10. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the study vaccine/placebo or related to a study procedure 11.

Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests 16. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products during the period starting 90 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine/placebo or planned administration during the study period 17.
