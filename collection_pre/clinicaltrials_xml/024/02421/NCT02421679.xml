	<brief_title>Open Label Extension Safety and Efficacy Study of TNX-102 SL Tablets in Military Related PTSD and Related Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will consist of 4 clinic visits, including Screening/Baseline Visit 1 (Day 0, which is anticipated to be the same date as the final visit in the lead-in P201 study) and visits after 2, 6 and 12 weeks of treatment. The previous requirements in the lead-in study for refraining from the use of certain concomitant medications and trauma-focused psychotherapies will be relaxed. Patients may continue to take rescue therapy for sleep, as appropriate, or they may utilize other medications as needed to help them sleep, per the judgment of the investigator. Eligible patients who provide written informed consent will take one TNX-102 SL tablet daily at bedtime sublingually (under the tongue) for 12 weeks. All patients will be assigned to receive tthe same dosage of TNX-102 SL, regardless of their treatment assignment in the lead-in study. No patients, investigators, or study staff will know the assigned study treatment from the lead-in study, P201, at the time of entry into the extension study. Patient data collected at the Week 12 visit (Visit 9) in the lead-in P201 study will be used as one of the baseline values for this study.</detailed_description>
