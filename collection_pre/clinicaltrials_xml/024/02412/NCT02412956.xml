	<brief_summary>Despite the great health benefits associated with smoking cessation in pregnancy to both mother and baby, few studies to date have examined the applications of text messaging or other communication technologies for smoking cessation in this population. This project is the first step in developing a new dissemination strategy for reaching pregnant smokers. This research will explore how a state-of -the-art, interactive and intensive, text messaging program, SmokefreeMoms Text, can promote smoking cessation in pregnant smokers. This program may have the potential to reach pregnant smokers who are not currently being reached with traditional smoking cessation services. The study Aims are: 1) to elicit qualitative feedback from pregnant smokers and recent quitters (in the past month) about the concept of SmokefreeMoms, the proposed message protocols in SmokefreeMoms, and the proposed messages in SmokefreeMoms (Phase 1); 2) To develop and pilot test a prototype of SmokefreeMoms which is consistent with Clinical Practice Guidelines (Phase 2), and 3) To conduct a formative evaluation of SmokefreeMoms 1.0 with pregnant smokers and recent quitters (Phase 3). 4) To measure the likelihood that pregnant women who smoke cigarettes will join an SMS program by responding to different types of recruitment messages.</brief_summary>
