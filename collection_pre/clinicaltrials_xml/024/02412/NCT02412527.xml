	<brief_summary>Objective: Computerized sleep staging has been verified in a normal population. This study attempts to investigate and verify the interpretation of this computerized sleep staging program in patients with sleep disorders, and improve the accuracy of actigraphy algorithm for sleep duration and postures. 1. Compare the accuracy of computerized sleep-wake analysis with current sleep quality indicators: through actigraphy and heart rate sensors, compare the computerized sleep-wake analysis program with polysomnography, and verify its clinical reliability and validity in sleep disorder patients. 2. Establish the sleep posture detection system: through three-axis accelerometer, develop algorithms for position recording and monitoring during sleep, and upgrade its accuracy according to photography. Methods: Patients ranged from age 20-50 with primary insomnia, periodic limb movement in sleep, simple snores, and obstructive sleep apnea will be enrolled in our study. Routine polysomnography will be applied in sleep center at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, as well as sleep-related questionnaires. At the same time, actigraphy and heart rate sensor patch will be used for sleep posture detection and further computerized sleep-wake analysis. Results will be verified the consistency by comparison with sleep-wake analysis from polysomnographic data and sleep-related questionnaires.</brief_summary>
