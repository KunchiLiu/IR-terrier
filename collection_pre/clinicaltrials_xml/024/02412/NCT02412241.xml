	<brief_summary>This four-year, prospective, longitudinal study will evaluate and validate a patient-reported outcome measure, clinician-reported outcome measures, and imaging techniques in assessing characteristics, trajectory, and progression of lymphedema and fibrosis (LEF) in oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer patients. This clinical trial studies patient-and-clinician-reported measures as well as standard imaging methods to see how accurate they are in identifying and evaluating lymphedema (swelling) or fibrosis (tough or tight tissue) in the head and neck region of patients receiving treatment for newly diagnosed stage II-IV oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancer. Lymphedema and fibrosis (LEF) can lead to physical symptoms, such as trouble swallowing and chewing, as well as psychological and emotional symptoms, such as negative body image and avoiding social interactions. Finding an accurate test to identify and evaluate LEF may allow doctors to treat LEF more quickly and control symptoms more effectively, and thus provide patients with a better quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Establishing Lymphedema and Fibrosis Measures in Oral Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this proposed study is to establish a valid, clinically useful measurement battery for head and neck LEF by achieving these specific aims: Aim 1: To determine the reliability and validity of the patient-reported outcome measure (LSIDS-H&amp;N) for assessing LEF-related symptoms in oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer patients across the trajectory of treatment, recovery, and survival. Aim 2: To determine the reliability and validity of the clinician-reported outcome measures (HN-LEF Grading Criteria and Modified Patterson Scale) for assessing external and internal LEF in oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer patients across the trajectory of treatment, recovery, and survival. Aim 3: To determine the reliability and validity of imaging techniques (CT scan and ultrasonography) in identifying site-specific LEF in oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer patients across the trajectory of treatment, recovery, and survival.</detailed_description>
