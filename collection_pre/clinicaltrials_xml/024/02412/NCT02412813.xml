	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, randomized, multi-center, metal hypersensitivity study comparing OXINIUM and cobalt chrome femoral components in subjects with failed total knee arthroplasty (TKA).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LEGIONâ„¢ Revision Metal Hypersensitivity Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 230 subjects will be randomized (1:1) to receive either an OXINIUM or cobalt chrome femoral components as part of their LEGION revision procedure. The objective of this study is to assess a lower serum metal ion concentration level in at least one of the three major mLTTs (Co, Cr or Ni) over 5 years in subjects receiving OXINIUM versus Cobalt Chrome femoral components as part of the LEGION Revision Total Knee System.</detailed_description>
