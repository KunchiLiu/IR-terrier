	<detailed_description>The traditional location of the LINQ™ insertion procedure is the catheterization laboratory, electrophysiology laboratory, or operating room. The purpose of the RIO 2 International study is to provide clinical and economic evidence to support moving the LINQ™ insertion procedure outside these traditional locations within the hospital, referred to as "out-of-cathlab".</detailed_description>
