	<brief_title>Effect of Trophectoderm Biopsy for Sex Selection on the Pregnancy and Miscarriage Rates of Women Undergoing IVF/ICSI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Records of women who had trophectoderm biopsy for sex selection over the last 3 years will be reviewed. Women will be divided into 3 groups: group 1 will comprise fertile women who had embryo biopsy for sex selection/family balancing, group 2 will comprise infertile women who had trophectoderm biopsy and group 3 will comprise infertile women who had IVF/ICSI without embryo biopsy. The pregnancy and miscarriage rates of the groups will be compared. Before starting the embryo biopsy process couples were seen by a geneticist to assess the feasibility of the procedure for each couple. Couples were then counselled by a gynaecologist specialised in IVF to assess their fertility status and explain the whole procedure including the expected success rates and risks of IVF. Women had standard pituitary down-regulation with GnRHa (Triptorelin 0.1mg, Decapeptyl® Ferring, Germany) day 7 after ovulation of previous cycle or on day 21 of the oral contraceptive cycles. GnRHa was continued for 2 weeks. Human menopausal gonadotrophin(HMG) (Merional ®IBSA) 150-300 IU/day was administered until the day of HCG administration, Transvaginal oocyte retrieval will be performed 34-36 h after the administration of HCG. Day 5 embryos were incubated in calcium/Magnesium free culture. A laser beam was used to produce a hole in the zona pellucida. Trophectoderm cells were collected by gentle suction using the biopsy pipette. Florescent in situ hybridization of the trophectoderm nuclei with probes specific to the X- and Y-chromosomes was performed. the embryos were frozen and the cycles deferred.The embryos were thawed in the following cycle and if possible 2 embryos of the desired sex were transferred.</detailed_description>
