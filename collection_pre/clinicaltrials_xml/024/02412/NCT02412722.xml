	<brief_summary>The purposes of this study are to: evaluate the safety and tolerability of MLN0128 milled active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) capsules administered both as a single agent and in combination with paclitaxel, to characterize the effect of a high-fat meal on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of MLN0128 milled API capsules, and to characterize the PK of MLN0128 milled API capsules when administered on an empty stomach approximately 24 hours after paclitaxel infusion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of MLN0128 as a Single Agent and in Combination With Paclitaxel in Adults With Advanced Nonhematologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called MLN0128. MLN0128 is being tested to assess its safety and tolerability when administered alone or in combination with paclitaxel in people who have nonhematologic malignancies. MLN0128 is also being tested to characterize its pharmacokinetic (PK) properties (how is processed by the body) when administered with a high-fat meal compared to on an empty stomach. This study will look at side effects and lab results in people who take MLN0128 with or without paclitaxel. This open label study will enroll approximately 32 patients. Participants receiving only MLN0128 will participate in a 6-day PK Run-In Period where MLN0128 4 mg capsules are administered under fasted conditions on Days 1 and 4, and with a high-fat breakfast on Day 3. The main treatment period will begin within 14 days from Day 6 of the PK Run-In Period. In the main treatment period participants will receive MLN0128 4 mg daily in a 28-day Cycle for up to 12 Cycles. Participants in the treatment arm receiving MLN0128 and paclitaxel will not have a PK Run-In Period and will receive MLN0128 6 mg daily on Days 2-4, 9-11, 16-18, and 23-25 in a 28-day Cycle for up to 12 Cycles and paclitaxel 80 mg/m^2 intravenously (IV) on Days 1, 8, and 15 in 28-day Cycle, for up to 12 Cycles. The dose of MLN0128 may be modified based on safety and tolerability during each 28-day cycle in either treatment arm. This multi-centre trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 14 months. Participants in the MLN0128 only arm will make up to 32 visits to the clinic and participants in the MLN0128 and paclitaxel arm will make up to 26 visits to the clinic. All participants will make a final visit to the clinic 30 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>

Has left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) within 5 absolute percentage points of institutional standard of normal as measured by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multiple gated acquisition scan (MUGA) within 4 weeks before first study drug administration (ie, if the institutional normal is 50%, participant's LVEF may be as low as 45% to be eligible for the study). 7. Is a female participants who: Are postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, OR Are surgically sterile, OR If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 2 effective methods of contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent form through 90 days after the last dose of study drug, or Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. (Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.) Male participants, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy), who: Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 90 days after the last dose of study drug, or Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
