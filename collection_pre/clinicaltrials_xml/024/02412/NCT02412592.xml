	<brief_summary>Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a serious liver disease worldwide, and the leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBeAg seroconversion is considered to be the satisfied endpoint of antiviral therapy in HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B patients. However, HBV reaction, even reverse back to HBeAg positive and clinical relapse could occur in some patients who achieved HBeAg seronconversion by interferon treatment. In this study, the long-term efficacy of interferon therapy in HBeAg positive patients achieved HBeAg seronconversion after interferon treatment and the factors associated with viral and clinical relapse will be observed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sustained Viral Response in Chronic Hepatitis B Patients Who Achieved HBeAg Seroncongversion After Interferon Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B patients achieved HBeAg seronconversion by interferon treatment will be enrolled and observed for 156 weeks. Serum HBV DNA, HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg, and anti-HBe will be measured every 3 months during the observation period, liver function tests were performed every 3 months also. The liver ultrasonic examination would be taken every 3-6 months. The primary endpoint is sustained viral response, and secondary endpoints is HBV DNA reaction and clinical relapse defined as virla relapse with abnormal ALT during observation period.</detailed_description>
