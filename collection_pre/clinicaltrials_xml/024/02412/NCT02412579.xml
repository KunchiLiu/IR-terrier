	<brief_title>Genetic Profiling of Liver Cancer in Patients Undergoing Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer and a growing trend worldwide. Decision-making regarding treatment for patients is limited by the lack of clinically actionable biomarkers. This is pronounced in the case for determining and monitoring liver transplant recipients. In an effort to improve diagnosis, the use of circulating serum-based microRNA isoforms (isomiRs) can serve as non-invasive, screening biomarkers in HCC patients pre- and post-transplantation of the liver.</detailed_description>
