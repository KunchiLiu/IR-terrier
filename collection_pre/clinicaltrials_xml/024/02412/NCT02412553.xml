	<brief_summary>The study is proposed as a 2-year single site, open-label clinical trial of enteral nutrition or the specific carbohydrate diet in patients with active CD or UC. Patients seeking care in the outpatient clinics of the Division of Gastroenterology at Massachusetts General Hospital will be approached for participation in the trial during their routine outpatient appointments. All patients are required to have a diagnosis of CD or UC confirmed using standard clinical, endoscopic, and histologic criteria. Eligible patients will complete an office visit to confirm eligibility for the study and informed consent will be obtained. They will then be scheduled for a routine colonoscopy as part of their standard clinical care to objectively confirm active disease and obtain biopsies for microbiome and gene expression. The investigators will obtain prior authorization from the subject's insurance company for such colonoscopy, or if it is not covered by the insurance, the investigators will use study funds to pay for the procedure. They will then be assigned to one of two dietary intervention arms based on their preference and will meet with the study registered dietician at the MGH Clinical Research Center (CRC) metabolism and nutrition unit. There, they will receive instruction on the components of the assigned dietary therapy arm - partial elemental diet (enteral nutrition) or specific carbohydrate diet, and will complete a baseline food record (FR). They will adhere to the dietary therapy for 6 weeks after which they can resume normal diet. Clinical, biochemical, nutritional, and microbiological parameters will be measured during and for 6 weeks following the study. They will have 5 study visits during this time.</brief_summary>
