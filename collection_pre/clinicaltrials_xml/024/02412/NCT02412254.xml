	<brief_summary>The investigators will conduct a small pilot study that will randomize ~ 40 70-84 year-old adults with hearing loss to best-practices hearing rehabilitative treatment (hearing assessment, counseling, fitting of amplification devices) versus a successful aging intervention (one-on-one counseling/education sessions on successful aging topics). Participants will be followed for 6 months, and outcomes will focus on communication, quality of life, cognition, and other functional surveys. This pilot study is in preparation for a larger planned trial to investigate if hearing loss treatment can reduce cognitive decline and dementia in older adults.</brief_summary>
