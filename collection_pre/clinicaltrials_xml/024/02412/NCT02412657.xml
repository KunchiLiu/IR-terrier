	<brief_summary>Interscalene brachial plexus block provides excellent but time limited analgesia. Intravenous dexamethasone increases the analgesic duration of a single-shot interscalene block with ropivacaine for shoulder arthroscopic surgery. We want to evaluate the effect of two different doses (dexamethasone 10 mg i.v. vs 4 mg i.v. vs placebo) on the analgesic duration of a single-shot inter scalene block. Our study hypothesis is that dexamethasone 4 mg i.v. is equivalent to dexamethasone10 mg i.v. in prolonging the analgesic duration of a single-shot interscalene block with ropivacaine.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>75 patients will be randomly assigned to three groups: - D10: dexamethasone 10 mg I.V. diluted in normal saline 20cc, immediately after inter scalene block - D4: dexamethasone 4 mg I.V. diluted in normal saline 20cc, immediately after inter scalene block - C: control: Normal saline 20cc I.V., immediately after inter scalene block. These patient will be recruited from 3 hospitals, with two surgeons performing the surgeries. All patients will have their surgery under regional anesthesia only provided by the inter scalene plexus block, with ropivacaine 0.5% 20cc. In the postoperative period, patients will be given analgesic medication on an as needed basis. They will be instructed to take the first analgesic medication once postoperative shoulder pain has reached &gt;3/10. They will note the time and day at which this outcome occurs.</detailed_description>
