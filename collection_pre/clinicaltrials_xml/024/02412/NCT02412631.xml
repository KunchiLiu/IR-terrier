	<brief_summary>Some individuals smoke with the perception that smoking helps control body weight. Smokers gain an average of as much as 10 pounds in the months following smoking abstinence, with heavier and more-dependent smokers gaining more weight. T The Mayo Clinic Nicotine Research Program will randomize 100 nondiabetic, overweight or obese adult smokers to active lorcaserin or placebo for 24 weeks; all of the subjects will receive open-label varenicline for 12 weeks. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a 24-week course of lorcaserin for decreasing weight gain after stopping smoking.</brief_summary>
