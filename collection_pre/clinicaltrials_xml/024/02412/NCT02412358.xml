At baseline professional plaque removal and oral hygiene instruction are performed for all the students, then they are asked to avoid brushing for 1-2 days. Thereafter plaque and gingivitis scores are measured using plaque and gingival indices (PI and GI). Then subjects are instructed to use Pulsar tooth brush for a two-week period and then, GI and PI indices are assessed again. After passing one-week period for wash out, subjects don't brush for 1-2 days and indices are recorded again. The same procedure are done for Cross action, and Butler 411 tooth brushes respectively.</brief_summary>
