	<brief_summary>Open-label combined two-part multi-center clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerabillity of blinatumomab in adult and pediatric Japanese subjects with R/R B-precursor ALL. The Phase 1b part will investigate the safety, efficacy, PK and PD of blinatumomab in adult Japanse subects with R/R B-precursor ALL to determine the MTD (maximum tolerated dose) in both adult and pediatric subjects. Once a dose has been selected in the Phase 1b part, the Phase 2 part will assess the safety and efficacy of the recommeded dose level of blinatumomab identified in the Phase 1b portion of the study in the adult study population.</brief_summary>
