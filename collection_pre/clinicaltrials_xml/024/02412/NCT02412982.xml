	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study to determine if anti-thrombin III (AT-III) serum concentrations differ between patients with normal versus subtherapeutic anti-Xa trough concentrations when placed on enoxaparin 30 mg twice daily for VTE prophylaxis. Secondarily, this study will compare two enoxaparin dosing strategies.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a pilot study to determine if AT-III serum concentrations differ between patients with normal (&gt;= 0.1 IU/mL) versus subtherapeutic (&lt;0.1 IU/mL) anti-Xa trough concentrations when placed on enoxaparin 30 mg twice daily for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis. Secondarily, this study will compare two enoxaparin dosing strategies: standard 30 mg twice daily and a dosing strategy based on trough anti-Xa values in high-risk trauma patients. Specific aims include: 1) to compare the extent of reduced AT-III activity between patients with trough anti-Xa &gt;= 0.1 IU/mL and &lt; 0.1 IU/mL upon initial assay; 2) to determine the proportion of patients who reach goal anti-Xa and the time to goal anti-Xa achievement between two interventional dosing strategies: enoxaparin 40 mg every 12 hours (with consideration to increase to 50 mg every 12 hours if recheck anti-Xa is not at goal) and enoxaparin 30 mg every eight hours; 3) to compare anti-Xa enoxaparin dosing strategies based on VTE, bleeding rates, transfusion requirements, drug discontinuation rate and bioaccumulation, and 4) to determine patient-specific factors that correlate to subtherapeutic anti-Xa such as serial AT-III activity, weight, body mass index, age, cumulative fluid administration, and thromboelastography (TEG).</detailed_description>
