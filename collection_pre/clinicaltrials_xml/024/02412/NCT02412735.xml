	<criteria>Male and female subjects 18 years of age and older If female of childbearing potential, subject is nonpregnant, nonnursing, and agrees to use highly effective methods of contraception for a minimum of 24 months posttreatment Signed informed consent and countryappropriate privacy forms indicating subject is willing to undergo treatment and willing to be available for each examination scheduled over the study duration Have documented diagnosis of moderate radiographic degeneration of an intervertebral disc from L1 to S1, with a disc suspected of causing CLBP Chronic low back pain associated with moderate radiographic degeneration at a lumbar disc is defined as the following (subject must meet all of the listed conditions): 1. Chronic low back pain for at least 6 months 2. Have failed 6 months of conservative back pain care. (Conservative treatment regimens may include any or all of the following: initial rest, medications [e.g., antiinflammatory, analgesics, narcotics/opioids, muscle relaxants], massage, acupuncture, chiropractic manipulations, activity modification, homedirected lumbar exercise program, and noninvasive pain control treatments or procedures) 3. Have at a minimum undergone supervised physical therapy, such as daily walking routines, therapeutic exercises, and back education programs specifically for the treatment of low back pain AND taken a pain medication for back pain (e.g. NSAID and/or opioid medication). 4. Change from normal disc morphology of the index disc as defined by radiographic evaluation by the core imaging evaluation provider. Radiographs must show all of the following: A modified Pfirrmann score of 3, 4, 5 or 6 on MRI at the index disc Modic Grade II changes or less on MRI at the index disc With or without contained disc protrusion at the index disc on MRI e. Low back pain of at least 40mm and not more than 90mm of 100mm on low back pain VAS (average pain over 24 hours) f. Leg pain ≤20mm in both legs on a 100mm VAS scale g. ODI score of at least 30 and no more than 90 on a 100 point scale. Female subjects who are pregnant or nursing, or women planning to become pregnant in the first 24 months posttreatment Extreme obesity, as defined by NIH Clinical Guidelines Body Mass Index (BMI &gt; 40) Have undergone a surgical procedure (e.g. discectomy, intradiscal electrothermal therapy, intradiscal radiofrequency, artificial disc replacement, interbody fusion) on the disc at the index or adjacent level Osteoporosis, as defined by dualenergy Xray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan. A DEXA Tscore of ≤ 2.5 will exclude the subject. Any lumbar intradiscal injection, including steroids, into the index or adjacent discs prior to treatment injection, with the exception of the following injections performed at least 2 weeks prior to study treatment: 1. Contrast medium (discography or other diagnostic injection) 2. NSAIDs 3. Nerveblocking anesthetics (e.g., lidocaine, bupivacaine) 4. Antibiotics 5. Saline Have undergone a procedure affecting the structure/biomechanics of the index disc level (e.g., posterolateral fusion) Active malignancy or tumor as source of symptoms or history of malignancy within the 5 years prior to enrolment on study Have been a recipient of prior allogeneic stem cell/progenitor cell therapy for any indication or autologous stem cell/progenitor cell therapy or other biological intervention to repair the index intervertebral disc An average baseline morphine equivalent dose (MED) of &gt;75mg/day as determined by ediary entries during the screening period Taking systemic immunosuppresants A medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or extenuating circumstance that would preclude participation in the study or potentially decrease survival or interfere with ambulation or rehabilitation. Subjects involved in spinal litigation, including workman's compensation, unless litigation is complete Are transient or has a severe alcohol or substance abuse problem Clinically significant nerve pain (e.g., chronic radiculopathy or neuropathy) Clinically significant sacroiliac joint pain Compressive pathology due to stenosis or disc protrusion on MRI with associated clinical symptoms defined as leg pain VAS&gt;20mm out of 100mm or neurologic deficit on neurologic exam Disc extrusion or sequestration in the lumbar spine on MRI as determined by radiographic core lab Modified Pfirrmann score of 7 or 8 at any lumbar level (L1S1) on MRI evaluation as determined by radiographic core lab Symptomatic involvement of more than one lumbar disc Symptomatic central vertebral canal stenosis as defined by neurogenic claudication Spondylolisthesis or retrolisthesis Grade 2 and above or Spondylolysis at the index or adjacent level(s) Lumbar spondylitis or other undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy affecting the index disc Spinal deformity defined as lumbar scoliosis with a Cobb angle of the lumbar spine greater than 15 degrees Any fracture of the spine at the index or adjacent levels that has not healed, or clinically compromised vertebral bodies at the index level due to current or past trauma Facet pain at the index level or adjacent segments as determined by a diagnostic medial branch block to rule out facet joint involvement. Full thickness annular tears in the index level as determined by free flowing contrast media through the annulus fibrosis.</criteria>
