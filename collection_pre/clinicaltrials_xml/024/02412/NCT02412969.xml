	<brief_summary>This study is to examine the onset of pain relief with two different methods of labor epidural. The traditional labor epidural involves the placement of numbing and anti-pain medicine in the epidural space which surrounds the spinal cord. In order to take effect, the medication has to cross a layer of tissue called the dura. In the current study, the same medications are placed in the epidural space after the dura is punctured with a fine needle. This research, will help evaluate whether this technique will result in earlier onset of pain relief.</brief_summary>
