	<brief_summary>Evaluation of "UroShield" device impact upon side effects and complications of urinary catheter usage. The use of urinary catheters is a common medical practice in the perioperative setting. As such, it exposes the patient to certain comorbidities, including urinary tract infections. The infectious process is known to begin with a development of a biofilm on the catheter's surface. This fact makes it an attractive target for UTI prevention technology. Ultrasound waves were shown to reduce biofilm buildup in-vitro. We plan to determine the efficacy of this method in vivo.</brief_summary>
