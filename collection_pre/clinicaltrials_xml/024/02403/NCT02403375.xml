	<brief_summary>This study is to compare metabolic control, treatment satisfaction, and quality of life during continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII ) therapy with a new insulin pump system with multiple daily injections (MDI) therapy. Furthermore, this study will add clinical data originating from clinical investigation in a special population, i.e. children and adolescents of ages 2 - 17 years , to the existing clinical data of the ACCU-CHEK Insight insulin pump.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Children and adolescents at least 24 months of age, and not more than 17 years of age at screening Diagnosed with type 1 diabetes Diagnosis of type 1 diabetes established &gt; 6 months before study start if &gt;5 years of age Indication for insulin pump therapy according to local guidelines Subject's most recent HbA1c is equal or above 7.0% (53.0 mmol/mol) measured at last assessment before screening within the past 2 months prior to the Baseline Visit into the study Willingness to use automated bolus advice obtained from the AccuChek Insight diabetes therapy system during the study Willingness and ability to participate and comply with study procedures Disease or condition that in the opinion of the investigator is likely to affect compliance or the ability to complete the study Not willing or able to start insulin pump therapy Not willing to selfmeasure blood glucose at least four times daily Significantly impaired awareness of hypoglycemia More than one hospitalization for severe hypoglycemia during the last 12 months History of recurrent ketoacidosis during intensive insulin therapy Known strong plaster incompatibility and/or allergy Unstable chronic disease other than diabetes (e.g. impaired hepatic function, impaired renal function, impaired cardiac function, uncontrolled vascular complications) and any other condition interfering with the study procedures, as per Investigator´s discretion. If on antihypertensive, thyroid, antidepressant or lipidlowering medication, lack of stability on the medication for the past 2 months prior to the Baseline Visit in the study Chronic use of steroids in adrenal suppressive doses, other immunomodulatory medication or chemotherapy Prescription medications other than insulin interfering with diabetes management Acute illness or abnormality (e.g. impaired vision, impaired motor function, acute pain) at the time of screening interfering with study procedures, affecting compliance, or the ability to complete the study as per Investigator´s discretion Either pregnant or breastfeeding Drug dependency Dependency on sponsor or Investigator (e.g. coworker or family member)</criteria>
