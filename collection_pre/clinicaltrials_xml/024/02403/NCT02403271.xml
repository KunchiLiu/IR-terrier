	<criteria>1. Pathologically confirmed Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC, adenocarcinoma or squamouscell carcinoma) 2. Relapsed or refractory disease (Stage III or IV): NSCLC must have failed at least 1 prior treatment. 3. Measurable lesion by RECIST 1.1 4. Adequate hematologic function: ANC &gt;1500 cells/mm3 Platelet count &gt;100,000 cells/mm3 HGB &gt;9.0 g/dL 5. Adequate hepatic and renal function: AST and ALT ≤2.5 x ULN for subjects without liver metastases and ≤3.5 x ULN for subjects with liver metastases Bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN (unless bilirubin rise is due to Gilbert's syndrome or of nonhepatic origin) Creatinine ≤2.0 x ULN or Creatinine Clearance ≥40 mL/min 6. PT/INR &lt;1.5 x ULN and PTT/ aPTT &lt;1.5 x ULN 1. Mixed small cell and NSCLC histology 2. A history of CNS involvement except as follows: Subjects with previously treated CNS metastases that are adequately treated with whole brain radiotherapy, that are neurologically stable, and do not require corticosteroids for symptomatic management for at least 14 days prior to first dose of study drug. There must be no clear evidence of radiographically active disease for at least 90 days prior to enrollment. 3. Antitumor therapy within 21 days of study Day 1 4. Prior treatment with ibrutinib or other BTK inhibitor antiCD137 or CTLA4 antibody. The following are exceptions to this criterion: Subjects previously treated with an antiPD1, antiPDL1, or antiPDL2 antibody. 5. History of allogeneic organ transplant 6. Treatment with a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitor</criteria>
