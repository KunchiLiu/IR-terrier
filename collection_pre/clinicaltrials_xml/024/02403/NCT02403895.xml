	<brief_title>AZD2014 and Weekly Paclitaxel in Squamous NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, phase 2a, multi-centre, single-arm study to assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of AZD2014 and weekly paclitaxel in patients with squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is relapsed or refractory to conventional treatment after at least 1 prior treatment with standard of care (SOC) and for whom weekly paclitaxel treatment is an appropriate treatment choice. The study will simultaneously enrol patients to the following two groups. Group A (intensive PK) will enrol 10 evaluable patients for an intra-patient evaluation of the impact of paclitaxel on exposure to AZD2014, and the impact of AZD2014 on exposure to paclitaxel via intensive PK sampling and non-compartmental PK analysis techniques (NCA). Group B (sparse PK) will enrol 30 patients and sparse sampling and population PK modelling techniques will be employed to estimate exposure to AZD2014 when administered in combination with a weekly paclitaxel dosing regimen. The efficacy and safety of the AZD2014 and weekly paclitaxel combination will be evaluated in all 40 patients using RECIST 1.1, observation of AEs/SAEs and use of conventional safety parameters. Eligible patients will receive study treatment consisting of a single weekly paclitaxel infusion (80 mg/m2) on Day 1 of each week and twice daily (BD) 50 mg doses of AZD2014 on the first 3 days each week for 6 weeks [except Group A patients in Week 1 of Cycle 1 who will take 50 mg BD doses of AZD2014 on Days 3, 4 and 5 (or Days 4, 5 and 6) to accommodate PK sampling], followed by a break from treatment when no paclitaxel or AZD2014 will be given. This 7-week schedule composes one cycle of treatment. AZD2014 will be administered as oral tablets to fasted patients (i.e., no food 2 hours before and 1 hour after each dose). Patients will receive up to 6 cycles of paclitaxel, although additional cycles of paclitaxel may be given if deemed appropriate by the Investigator.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histologically or cytologically proven squamous nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) where treatment with weekly paclitaxel is an appropriate treatment option. 2. Relapsed or refractory disease after at least one line of prior therapy. Subjects must have previously received appropriate line(s) of standard of care (SOC) treatment. 3. Measurable disease by RECIST v1.1 criteria 4. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. 5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. 1. Radiotherapy (except for palliative reasons), chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or immunotherapy during the previous 3 weeks (4 weeks for investigational medicinal products and 6 weeks for nitrosoureas and MitomycinC) before treatment. 2. Ongoing toxic manifestations of previous treatments. Exceptions to this are alopecia or Grade 1 toxicities which, in the opinion of the Investigator, should not exclude the patient. 3. Known leptomeningeal involvement, brain metastases or spinal cord compression. 4. History of hypersensitivity (&gt; Grade 2) to active or inactive excipients of AZD2014, drugs containing Cremophor, taxanes or structurally/chemically similar drugs 5. Current refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal disease, inability to swallow formulated product or previous significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption of AZD2014 6. Patients with Diabetes Type I or uncontrolled Type II (HbA1c &gt; 59 mmol/mol assessed locally) as judged by the Investigator 7. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to entry to the study (excluding placement of vascular access), or minor surgery within 2 weeks of entry into the study and from which the patient has not yet recovered 8. Adequate hematologic function independent of transfusion and growth factor support for at least 7 days prior to screening (with the exception of pegylated GCSF (pegfilgrastim) and darbepoetin which require at least 14 days prior to screening), defined as: Absolute neutrophil count 1500 cells/mm3 (1.5 x 109/L) Platelet count 100.000 cells/mm3 (100 x 109/L) Haemoglobin 9.0 g/dL 9. Adequate hepatic and renal function defined as: Serum aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) if no demonstrable liver metastases or 5 x ULN in the presence of liver metastases Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) &lt; 5 x ULN Serum bilirubin 1.5 x ULN (unless bilirubin rise is due to Gilbert's syndrome or of nonhepatic origin) Estimated Creatinine Clearance 50 ml/min (CockcroftGault) or serum creatinine 1.5 x ULN</criteria>
