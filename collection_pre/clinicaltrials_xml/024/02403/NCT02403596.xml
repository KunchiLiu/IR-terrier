	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the efficacy of tranexamic acid versus placebo on perioperative blood loss using two dosage regimens (standard and extended) after a surgery during total hip arthroplasty in patients receiving the novel fast-acting oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban for prophylaxis of thrombosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blood-sparing During Hip Prosthesis Surgery With ExacylÂ® in Patients Treated With Rivaroxaban</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2011, 140 000 total hip replacements were performed and bleeding remains one of the major complications responsible for significant morbidity. This study will evaluate a new treatment to prevent bleeding due to this surgery. Indeed, the tranexamic acid (Exacyl) will be used in two modes of administration (standard or extended) versus placebo combined with a Rivaroxaban treatment at a dose of 10 mg / day for 35 days. Patients will be randomized (exacyl standard vs exacyl extended vs. placebo) and will be followed for 3 months.</detailed_description>
