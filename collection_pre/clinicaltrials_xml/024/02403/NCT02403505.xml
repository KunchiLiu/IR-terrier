	<brief_summary>That current oncology drugs on USA market have the universal problems about low effectiveness of pharmacology to cancer cells and high risk of toxicology to normal cells can demonstrate following most significantly and most reasonably: it is not enough so far that just only oncology drug targets directly like as cancer patient-specific biomarkers; it must be that oncology drug targets' SNPs via patient-specific haplotype blocks like as real personalized or individualized cancer patient-specific biomarkers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Discovery Stage Clinical Study About Oncology Drugs and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the Sponsor-Investigator's discovery human subjects' study, the investigators will use the ABIRATERONE plus PREDNISONE plus ENZALUTAMIDE (300 patients - Group 1) or the ABIRATERONE plus PREDNISONE plus NILANDRON (300 patients - Group 2) to treat Prostate Cancer patients and will try to look for the relationship between the ABIRATERONE ACETATE TABLET therapeutic efficacy and the drug target CYP17 SNP Genotyping via assay patient-specific haplotype blocks, and the relationship between the ABIRATERONE ACETATE TABLET therapeutic safety and the drug target CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP17 and SULT2A1 SNP Genotyping via assay patient-specific haplotype blocks. According to ABIRATERONE ACETATE TABLET Labeling Directions, the ABIRATERONE drug target CYP17 should be effectiveness-associated; and the ABIRATERONE drug target CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP17 and SULT2A1 should also be risk-associated. The investigators hope to discover the CYP17 SNP Genotypes via patient-specific haplotype blocks which may be effectiveness-associated, and the CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP17 and SULT2A1 SNP Genotypes via patient-specific haplotype blocks which may be risk-associated.</detailed_description>
