	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to develop novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols suitable for patients with multiple sclerosis using advanced MRI such as rotating frame relaxation imaging. In addition, the investigators want to study the correlation between advanced MRI parameters and clinical disease progression.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The diagnosis of relapsing remitting MS made according to the Poser, McDonald's or revised McDonald's criteria (Group I) before participating in the study Initial MS diagnosis of relapsing remitting form of the disease according to the criteria as mentioned above, and conversion into the secondary progressive phase of the disease as evaluated by the referring neurologist according to the clinical evaluation and confirmed by the study physician (Group II). Mental status: Patients must be able to understand the meaning of the study Informed consent: The patient must sign the appropriate Ethical Committee (EC) approved informed consent documents in the presence of the designated staff Any other autoimmune disease than MS requiring immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive medication Highdose corticosteroid treatment within 30 days before participating in the study Prior medical history: Patient must have no history of serious cardiovascular, liver or kidney disease Any psychiatric condition that compromises the subject's ability to participate in the study Infections: Patient must not have an uncontrolled serious infection No contraindications for MRI (cardiac pacemaker, intracranial clips etc)</criteria>
