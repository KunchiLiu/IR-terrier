	<brief_summary>Calcific tendinitis of the rotator cuff is a common cause of chronic pain of the shoulder. Needling and lavage of the calcification is one of the therapeutic options after failure of conservative management with physiotherapy and anti-inflammatory drugs. Needling is usually followed by a corticosteroid injection in the subacromial bursae in order to prevent acute pain reaction due to the intervention. However, the relevance of this injection has never been proven. Moreover, corticosteroid could prevent the inflammatory reaction induced by the needling and thus the body's natural calcium resorption processes. Finally, corticosteroids could have deleterious effect on the tendon structures and favour local infection. Our hypothesis is that corticosteroid have no significant effect on acute pain after needling and therefore should not been performed systematically after needling.</brief_summary>
