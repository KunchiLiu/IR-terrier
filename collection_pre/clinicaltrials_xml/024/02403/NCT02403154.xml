	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to compare patient outcomes of two treatment methods that are currently used as standard of care to treat anterior pelvic ring injuries that require stabilization. The two treatment methods are subcutaneous internal fixation (INFIX) and external fixation (EXFIX). Patients will be given the opportunity to opt out of randomization and participate in one of the observational arms. The first observational arm is comprised of those patients who do not want to randomize and they will undergo anterior pelvic ring stabilization according to the treating surgeon's discretion. The second observational arm will be comprised of patients who consent to be in the study but whose pelvic ring fractures do not require any form of anterior pelvic internal fixation based on the treating surgeon's opinion.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this research is to compare patient outcomes of two treatment methods that are currently used as standard of care to treat anterior pelvic ring injuries that require stabilization. The two treatment methods are subcutaneous internal fixation (INFIX) and external fixation (EXFIX). Patients will be given the opportunity to opt out of randomization and participate in one of the observational arms. The first observational arm is comprised of those patients who do not want to randomize and they will undergo anterior pelvic ring stabilization according to the treating surgeon's discretion. The second observational arm will be comprised of patients who consent to be in the study but whose pelvic ring fractures do not require any form of anterior pelvic internal fixation based on the treating surgeon's opinion. This type of injury requires follow up at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months. At each follow up appointment, the patient will be asked to complete surveys as part of the PROMIS series (Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) which will include surveys about physical function, pain, mobility, sex life satisfaction, depression, and for male patients, a survey about erectile function. In addition to the PROMIS questionnaire for pain, the investigators will also use a visual analogue pain scale and ask what the patient's satisfaction is on a scale of 0-100%. If the patient does not report to clinic for follow up, the research coordinator will call the patient to complete the study questionnaires.</detailed_description>
