	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common medical problem which, despite increasing awareness, remains under-diagnosed. There is a close association between OSA and obesity; 60-70% of patients diagnosed with OSA are either obese or overweight [1]. OSA is also very common among patients with type 2 diabetes. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) has reached epidemic status in the Gulf region. OSA worsens insulin resistance and leads to weight gain through sleep disturbance [2]. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the associations of OSA with diabetes and obesity [3]. At present there is little available information regarding the prevalence of OSA in the UAE, the relationship with T2DM and obesity, and the impact of OSA on health outcomes in the Emirati population. This research will explore these relationships and inform public health decisions regarding diagnostic pathways, service provision and treatment protocols.</brief_summary>
