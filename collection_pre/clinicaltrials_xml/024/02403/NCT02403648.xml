	<brief_summary>BIOD-961 is a dry powder formulation of glucagon intended for use in a device that mixes (reconstitutes) the powder with liquid to make it easier for users to treat patients with severe hypoglycemia. The purpose of this study is to evaluate how much BIOD-961 absorbs into the bloodstream, how much it raises glucose concentrations (the intended effect) and compare to two glucagon products already on the market.</brief_summary>
