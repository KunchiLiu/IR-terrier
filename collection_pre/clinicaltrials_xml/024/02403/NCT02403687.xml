	<brief_title>Prospective Analgesic Compound Efficacy (PACE) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives The primary objective is the change in pain levels as measured by a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary objectives are changes in concomitant pain medication use, quality of life, and patient satisfaction with pain management. Design and Outcomes The study will be conducted at 1 family practice medical clinic in Houston, TX. Patients will be prescribed a pain cream compound based on their symptoms and medical history. Periodic surveys will be administered and concomitant medications recorded to ascertain current pain levels, quality of life, and satisfaction with current pain levels. Blood tests will be performed to monitor liver and kidney function. Interventions and Duration Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory steroid (NSAID) topical cream will be prescribed to patients presenting with pain. For patients with localized pain, they will also be prescribed a transdermal analgesic patch to wear at the site of pain. Subjects will be followed for 24-weeks with surveys administered at baseline, and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24-weeks after baseline with blood tests performed at 12 and 24-weeks. If patients do not find satisfactory pain relief or experience undesirable side effects from the cream they will be given a prescription for an oral NSAID at anytime during the 24-week observation. Sample Size and Population 500 patients will be enrolled in the study between March 1, 2015 and March 1, 2017.
