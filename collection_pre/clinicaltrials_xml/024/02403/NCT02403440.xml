	<criteria>1. Chronical ITP patients. 2. The subjects were diagnosed as ITP with bone marrow aspiration within 3 months before enrollment or in the screening period. And secondary immune thrombocytopenia (e.g., myelodysplastic syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, aplastic anemia) was excluded. 3. Patients had a mean platelet count of less than 30,000/µL in the screening period. 4. Patients receiving chronic maintenance steroid therapy must have received a stable dose for at least 1 month. 5. Patients receiving danazol, mycophenolate mofetil or cyclosporine A must have received a stable dose for at least 12 weeks. 6. Normal PT/INR and APTT. 1. Any prior history of arterial or venous thrombosis (stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism), AND ≥ two of the following risk factors: hormone replacement therapy, systemic contraception (containing estrogen), smoking, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, medication for hypertension, cancer, hereditary thrombophilic disorders (e.g., Factor V Leiden, ATIII deficiency, etc), or any other family history of arterial or venous thrombosis. 2. Preexisting cardiovascular disease (congestive heart failure, New York Heart Association [NYHA] Grade III/IV), or arrhythmia known to increase the risk of thromboembolic events (e.g. atrial fibrillation). 3. Malignant disease 4. Cancer treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. 5. Patients with one of the following conditions should be excluded: Treatment with immunoglobulins within 1 week preceding the first dose of study medication. Treatment with splenectomy or rituximab within 12 weeks preceding the first dose of study medication. Treatment with eltrombopag or Nplate within 4 weeks preceding the first dose of study medication. Treatment with cyclophosphamide or vinca alkaloids within 4 weeks preceding the first dose of study medication. 6.
