	<brief_summary>Unlike the management of patients with various forms of accidents (e.g. polytrauma), only a few data exists for the emergency management of patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding. The aim of our study is to develop optimal diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms for the management of acute upper and lower gastrointestinal bleedings.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gastrointestinal Bleeding Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a common medical emergency. Up to 15% of patients still die worldwide. The gastroduodenal ulcer disease is the most common cause of gastrointestinal bleeding. Even lower gastrointestinal bleeding occurs especially in patients of older age. The goal of our data acquisition and evaluation is to learn whether existing diagnostic or therapeutic procedures are of relevance in the management of acute gastrointestinal bleedings. Unlike the management of patients with various forms of accidents (e.g. polytrauma), only a few data exists on patients with acute gastrointestinal bleedings. The aim of our study is to develop optimal diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms of acute gastrointestinal bleeding. Therefore our prospective data registry should answer different questions: When is the right time for a gastroscopy or colonoscopy? Should every patient with a suspected gastrointestinal bleeding receive endoscopy? Which clinical und laboratory findings influence the success of therapy? Does endoscopic procedures have an influence on the length of hospital stay? Against this background we will record treatment findings separately. This includes clinical (e.g. age, sex, date of admission, department of admission, onset of symptoms), laboratory (e.g. blood count), history of medications (e.g. new anticoagulation's) and endoscopic findings (e.g. active bleeding). Furthermore the length of inhospital stay will be recorded. Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 7 days.</detailed_description>
