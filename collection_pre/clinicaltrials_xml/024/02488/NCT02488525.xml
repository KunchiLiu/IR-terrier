	<brief_summary>Main objective of the study is to demonstrate that a prophylactic treatment with VWF factor concentrate after implantation of continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD) reduces the frequency of clinically significant bleeding within 3 months after implantation in comparison to the usual care. Adult patients with functional defects of VWF measured after implantation of continuous LVAD are randomly assigned to prophylactic treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention of Hemorrhage After Implantation of Mechanical Circulatory Support</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This time point was chosen because the bleeding events are maximal within the first 3 months after implantation. - Adult patients &gt; 18 years who need a CF-LVAD due to advanced heart failure. - Functional To determine the potential indication of Wilfactin® in the field of CF-LVAD and avoid widespread use and to establish evidence-based recommendation To improve the knowledge of the role of VWF concentrate in bleeding and angiogenesis after CF-LVAD implantation and to provide some results about mechanism involved angiogenesis or hemostasis.</detailed_description>
