	<brief_summary>Multicenter open-label study of BGB324 as a single agent and in combination with cytarabine in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. BGB324 is a potent selective small molecule inhibitor of Axl, a surface membrane protein kinase receptor which is overexpressed in up to half of AML cases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multicenter Open-label Study of BGB324 as a Single Agent and in Combination With Cytarabine in Patients With AML</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a dose-escalation and cohort expansion study of BGB324, an Axl kinase inhibitor, in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) either as a single agent or in combination with cytarabine. Study objectives include identifying the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BGB324 in AML patients who have received previous treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy (with or without haematopoietic stem cell transplantation) or a targeted or biologic agent. Identifying the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) profile of BGB324. To explore the safety and efficacy of BGB324 and to characterise the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of BGB324.</detailed_description>
