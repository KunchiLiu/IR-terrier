	<brief_summary>Closed-loop strategy is composed of three components: glucose sensor to read glucose levels, insulin pump to infuse insulin and a dosing mathematical algorithm to decide on the required insulin dosages based on the sensor's readings. A dual-hormone closed-loop strategy would regulate glucose levels through the infusion of two hormones: insulin and glucagon. The main objective of this project is to compare the efficacy of single-hormone closed-loop strategy, dual-hormone closed-loop strategy and sensor-augmented pump therapy to regulate glucose levels in outpatient settings for 5 consecutive days in adults with type 1 diabetes. The investigators hypothesized that dual-hormone closed-loop strategy will reduce the time spent in hypoglycemia compared to single-hormone closed-loop strategy, which in turn will be more effective than sensor-augmented pump therapy to reduce time spent in hypoglycemia.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Males and females ≥ 18 years of old. 2. Clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes for at least one year. 3. The subject will have been on insulin pump therapy for at least 3 months. 4. HbA1c ≤ 10%. 5. Live in the area of Montreal. 1. Clinically significant nephropathy, neuropathy or retinopathy as judged by the investigator. 2. Recent (&lt; 6 months) acute macrovascular event e.g. acute coronary syndrome or cardiac surgery. 3. History of pheochromocytoma or insulinoma (glucagon could induce a hormonal response of these tumors) 4. Beta‐blockers at high dose based on investigator's evaluation of dosage interference with glucagon (glucagon can modify effect of betablockers, mostly evident at very high doses) 5. Chronic indometacin treatment (can prevent glucagon effect on liver thus its ability to raise glucose) 6. Warfarin chronic treatment if INR monitoring cannot be evaluated (can increase the risk of bleeding) 7. Anticholenergic drug (risk of interaction) 8. Pregnancy. 9. Severe hypoglycemic episode within two weeks of screening. 10. Current use of glucocorticoid medication (except low stable dose and inhaled steroids). 11. Known or suspected allergy to the trial products 12. Other serious medical illness likely to interfere with study participation or with the ability to complete the trial by the judgment of the investigator. 13. Anticipating a significant change in exercise regimen between admissions (i.e. starting or stopping an organized sport). 14. Treatments that could interfere with glucagon</criteria>
