	<brief_title>An Evaluation of Weekly Tafenoquine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects were treated for 3 days with halofantrine to clear any existing parasitaemia. At the end of the clearance period, subjects free from malaria parasitaemia were randomized and received a loading dose of the study treatment (tafenoquine 200 mg, Mefloquine 250 mg or placebo) for tree days, followed by study treatment (tafenoquine 200 mg, mefloquine 250 mg or placebo, respectively) once a week for 24 weeks. After the treatment period subjects attended weekly follow-up safety visits until week 28.</detailed_description>
