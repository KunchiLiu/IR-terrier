Females who were lactating. Subjects given antimalarial drugs for treatment within two weeks of study drug initiation. Subjects with clinically significant abnormalities (to include but not limited to abnormal hepatic or renal function) as determined by history, physical and routine blood chemistry and haematology values. Subjects with known hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs. Subjects unwilling to remain in the area, report for drug administration or blood drawing during the 34 month duration of the study. Subjects with G6PD deficiency (as determined by two separate qualitative tests per subject administered using distinct methods; methods used were visual dye and filter paper methods). Subjects with any of the following laboratory values: haemoglobin (Hb) &lt;8g/dL, platelets &lt;80,000/mm3, white blood cell count (WBC) &lt;3000/mm3, creatinine &gt;1.5mg/dL, alanine transaminase (ALT) &gt;60IU or 1+ haematuria as detected by urine dipstick.</criteria>
