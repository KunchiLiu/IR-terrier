	<brief_summary>Nosebleeds that persist even after adequate traditional nasal packing may require aggressive treatment strategies to stop bleeding. Currently these strategies include a surgical approach to cut off blood supply to the vessel that is bleeding. FloSeal Hemostatic matrix is a gel like medical therapy that is inserted into the nose and is engineered to stop bleeding in severe cases, possibly avoiding the need for surgery. In this study the investigators will randomize patients to either receive FloSeal Hemostatix matrix or traditional nasal packing as a treatment for severe nosebleeds. The main outcome will be whether the investigators are able to stop bleeding with FloSeal or traditional packing alone and whether additional measures are necessary to stop the bleeding. The investigators will also perform a patient comfort survey and cost analysis. Even if FloSeal has equal effectiveness in treating nosebleeds as traditional packing, if it is much more comfortable for patients then it may be the favourable treatment.</brief_summary>
