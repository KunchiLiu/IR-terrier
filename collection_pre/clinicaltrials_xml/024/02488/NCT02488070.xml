	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies gallium-68 (68Ga)-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) (gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA ligand Glu-urea-Lys[Ahx]) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) or PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in identifying tumors in patients with prostate cancer that has come back after a period of improvement (recurrent). 68Ga-PSMA is a radioactive drug that may attach to specific prostate cancer cells and light up. Scanners, such as PET/CT or PET/MRI, can then be used to take pictures of the body to see where the cancer is. Using 68Ga-PSMA for PET/CT or PET/MRI may allow doctors to identify smaller tumors than standard methods.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the feasibility and biodistribution of 68Ga-PSMA. OUTLINE: Patients receive gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA ligand Glu-urea-Lys(Ahx) intravenously (IV) and then undergo PET/CT or PET/MRI approximately 45 to 60 minutes later. After completion of study, patients are followed up at 24 hours and 1 week.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Provides written informed consent Known diagnosis of prostate cancer Patient has suspected recurrence based on biochemical data (prostate specific antigen [PSA] &gt; 2 ng/mL) Able to remain still for duration of each imaging procedure (about one hour) Unable to provide informed consent Inability to lie still for the entire imaging time Inability to complete the needed investigational and standardofcare imaging examinations due to other reasons (severe claustrophobia, radiation phobia, etc.) Any additional medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or other extenuating circumstance that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may significantly interfere with study compliance</criteria>
