	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to detect BOS in an early stage by using the outcome parameters generated by Functional Respiratory Imaging (FRI). Robust and automated segmentation algorithms will be developed for these parameters, focusing on quantitative computed tomography (CT) image analyses to provide the physician a more sensitive diagnostics tool. The evolution of rejection over time will be monitored using non-rigid image registration methods.</brief_summary>
