	<brief_title>The Effects of Using Fertile Chip in Sperm Selection for Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection in Unexplained Infertility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the current study is to evaluate to effectiveness of sperm selection by using fertile chip in unexplained infertile couples on intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles. On study arm sperm selection will be performed by using special microchannel system which is called fertile chip (FC) without using sperm wash procedure. This FC system leads to select lineer motile progressive sperm selection. In control group, sperm selection will be performed by classical way which sperm will be undertaken to sperm wash by gradient method. After selection of sperm in both arms, ICSI will be performed. The outcomes of ICSI schedule will be assesed by fertilization and clinical pregnancy rates.</detailed_description>
