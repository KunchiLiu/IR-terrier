	<brief_summary>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an immune mediated chronic inflammatory bowel disease that results at least in part of an abnormal immune response to environmental factors including the intestinal microbiota. Thus, use of probiotics (microorganisms that are believed to provide health benefits when consume) may restore the gastrointestinal microbiota and reduce intestinal inflammation. Propionibacterium freudenreichii is used for the production of fermented food products (cheese). Some selected strains have strong anti-inflammatory properties. Use of cheese based on a monoxenic culture of anti-inflammatory strain of Propionibacterium freudenreichii may decrease disease activity during ulcerative colitis.</brief_summary>
