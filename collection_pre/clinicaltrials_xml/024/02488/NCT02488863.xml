	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis (OA) represents the leading cause of disability worldwide, and the knee is the most commonly affected joint. Knee OA has been traditionally attributed to peripheral mechanisms, but peripheral damage, inflammation, and psychological factors have failed to significantly account for the presence, absence, or severity of chronic OA-related pain. Recent studies show that individuals with OA-related pain exhibit dysfunctional pain modulation supporting a significant central nervous system (CNS) contribution. However, the CNS mechanisms underlying these changes in pain modulation are not currently known, nor their relation to clinical pain progression. The proposed pilot examines brain circuits recently described in predicting the transition from acute to chronic pain, in predicting clinical and experimental pain changes as well as physical performance and mobility changes in older persons with knee OA pain over a one year period. The findings will provide novel and important information regarding the mechanisms underlying aberrant pain processing and its functional consequences in older adults with knee OA. The information learned can be subsequently used to target treatment and prevention strategies in future studies of older adults. The central hypothesis is that increased functional and structural connectivity of cortico-striatal regions will be significantly associated with baseline clinical and experimental pain and decreased physical function in persons with symptomatic knee OA and will account for more rapid clinical pain and disability progression overtime.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lifetime risk of developing symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA) exceeds 40%, and OA prevalence is rising due to the increased age and obesity of the U.S. population. Historically, OA has been conceptualized as a regional pain condition whose symptoms are driven by peripheral pathophysiology. However, the poor correspondence between measures of disease severity and clinical symptoms suggests that factors above and beyond peripheral tissue damage must contribute to OA-related pain. Recent studies demonstrate generalized alterations of pain processing among individuals with OA. However, no investigator to date has examined the brain circuits that are the focus of this proposal in patients with symptomatic knee OA. An improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying OA-related changes in pain modulation will provide a basis for the development of targeted preventive and rehabilitative strategies. In light of evidence emphasizing plasticity of white matter connections, and the potential pain relieving effects of non-invasive brain stimulation interventions, it seems reasonable to identify these connections as potential targets for future treatment approaches. Given the expected growth of the older population, such strategies could have a monumental impact in reducing healthcare expenditures and improving quality of life of older adults.</detailed_description>
