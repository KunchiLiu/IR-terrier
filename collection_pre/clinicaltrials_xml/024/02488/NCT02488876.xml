	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to collect non-individual related blood samples for the compelling of a unique database of tissue samples to understand the inflammatory responds after cardiac surgery on an on-going basis. This includes especially protein analyses and genetic testing for certain neurotransmitters in the blood and tissues to understand disease markers related to heart disease. The study is designed as an openly recruiting biobank with the purpose to later serve multiple study purposes. Outcomes refer to protein analyses and genetic testing for neurotransmitters in the blood and tissues.</brief_summary>
