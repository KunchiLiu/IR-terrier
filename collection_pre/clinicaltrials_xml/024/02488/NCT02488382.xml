	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of Lonquek which is a pegylated (long-acting) version of Filgrastim recombinant human G-CSF (G-CSF) in mobilizing sufficient number of stem cells for autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with lymphoma and multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
