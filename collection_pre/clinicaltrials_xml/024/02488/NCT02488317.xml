The inclusion of patients, caregivers, and patient advocacy organizations as research partners will assure that the study addresses questions of greatest relevance to patients facing the need for dialysis. For Aim 3, the investigators are going to compare measures related to the decision-making process between patients receiving and not receiving a decision aid focusing on Peritoneal Dialysis and Hemodialysis.</brief_summary>
