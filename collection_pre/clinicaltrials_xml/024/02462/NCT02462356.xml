	<brief_summary>This study evaluate multiple-portal VATS and uniportal VATS lobectomy for NSCLC, half of participants will receive multiple VATS, while the other half will receive uniportal VATS lobectomy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multiple-portal VATS Versus Uniportal VATS Lobectomy for Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conventional VATS and uniportal VATS lobectomy can be performed each for NSCLC. Conventional VATS lobectomy employ 3 or 4 ports for completing the operation. Usually the camera port is performed at the seventh or eighth intercostals space within the trocar, so it's easy to cause the intercostals nerve and vessel injure, and still create obvious pain. However, the lobectomy for lung cancer can be accomplished with a single incision. According to the initial results, Uniportal VATS (UVATS) lobectomy procedure has been wide adopted by less acess trauma, relieve postoperative pain. But these were retrospective and descriptive, not randomized study. Further randomized control studies will be required to demonstrate that there are more benefits in UVATS techniques compared with conventional VATS for lobectomy.</detailed_description>
