	<brief_summary>This study sought to investigate the changes in objective memory performance (including immediate recall and delayed recall), subjective memory complaints and degree of depression in older adults with mild cognitive impairment after Virtual interactive memory training (VIMT).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Protocol of Virtual Interactive Memory-Training Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind randomized controlled study has a 2-arm parallel group design. All subjects will be randomized by the block randomization, into intervention group (Virtual interactive memory training, VIMT), or active control group (Passive information activities, PIA). Training sessions of the VIMT group are 45 minutes/day, 3 days/week, for 12 weeks (36 sessions each). The training of PIA group is the same as VIMT group. We constructed a rigorous VIMT program adhering to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting guidelines. We expect to determine the improvement in memory function and degree of depression of older adults with mild cognitive impairment after using the VIMT.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Participants must endorse at least two items from a list of frequent subjective memory complaints by patient and/or an informant 2. Objective memory impairment on neuropsychological tests of memory 1.5 SD or more below age/education norms 3. Clinical neurologic examination by the MiniMental State Examination (MMSE) score of 24 or higher, and cutoff score of 23/24 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) 4. No impairment in personal activities of daily living (PADL) as determined by clinical interview with participant and family 1. The clinical diagnosis of dementia was based on the DSMIVTR 2. Active in another cognitive or memoryrelated training in the past year 3. Comorbid medical conditions that would predispose them to imminent functional decline or cognitive impairment 4. A diagnosis of major neurological or psychiatric illness history and/or behavioral problems that would sufficiently impair performance to make participation impossible 5. Severe losses in vision, hearing, or communicative ability</criteria>
