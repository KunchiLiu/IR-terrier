	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria (patients must): 1. Be scheduled for ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation due to the arrhythmia being recurrent, poorly tolerated and/or unable to be controlled with at least one antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Persistent atrial fibrillation in this study is defined as the following: 1. AF lasting at least 7 days but no more than 12 months without cardioversion Or 2. AF lasting at least 48 hours but no more than 12 months prior to cardioversion to terminate AF 2. Be able and willing to give informed consent Exclusion Criteria (patients must not): 1. Have a history of AF longer than 12 months 2. Have any of the following: 1. Patients with implanted prosthetic, artificial, or repaired cardiac valves in the chamber being mapped 2. Patients with implanted pacemaker or ICD 3. Patients with history of embolism or an inability to tolerate anticoagulation therapy during and after an electrophysiology procedure 4. Stents in the area of the pulmonary veins 3. Have a contraindication for transfemoral venous access or any other element of an AF ablation procedure 4. Have a contraindication for transseptal left atrial access including atrial septal occluder device 5. Have a left atrial appendage occlusion device 6. Have had prior ablation for atrial fibrillation 7. NYHA class IV congestive heart failure 8. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 40% 9. Have or have had rheumatic mitral valve disease 10. Have a left atrial diameter of &gt;55 mm (any dimension) 11. Have had a myocardial infarction within the prior three months 12. Have had any atrial surgery (including valve repair/replacement) in the right or left atrium 13. Have an intracardiac thrombus (must be confirmed via ultrasound prior to mapping) or dense spontaneous echo contrast 14. Have clinically significant severe tricuspid and/or mitral valve regurgitation or moderate or severe tricuspid and/or mitral valve stenosis 15. Have had any prior stroke or transient ischemic attacks (TIA) or systemic embolism 16. Be pregnant or nursing 17. Have a life expectancy of less than one year 18. Be currently enrolled in any other clinical treatment study</criteria>
