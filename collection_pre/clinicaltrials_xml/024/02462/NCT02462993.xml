	<detailed_description>Background: Aloe vera is considered to be the most promising and high-ranking agent as an all-purpose herbal plant amongst herbal agents used in dentistry. This study was designed to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effectiveness of locally delivered aloe vera gel as an adjunct to scaling and root planing in the treatment of chronic periodontitis. Methods: Twelve subjects diagnosed with chronic generalized periodontitis were selected and randomly divided into two groups: Test group which received scaling and root planning (SRP) followed by application of aloe vera gel as a local drug delivery agent in the deepest periodontal pocket and control group which received SRP alone. Clinical evaluation was undertaken using Plaque index (PI), Gingival index (GI), Probing pocket depth (PPD), Relative attachment level (RAL) and Gingival marginal level (GML) and microbiologic counts (total colony count/ml) were assessed at baseline, 6 weeks and 3 months.</detailed_description>
