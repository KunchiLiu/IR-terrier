	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to create a rapid scan of the pancreas and ovaries that could be used in the future to screen patients at risk for pancreatic or ovarian cancers. Currently, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examinations of the pancreas and ovaries can last 30-45 minutes each. The investigators hope to create a rapid pancreatic and ovarian MRI evaluation that can be used as a screening tool that is completed in approximately 15 minutes. They will compare different tools available on modern MRI scanners to see which one reliably offers high quality images of the pancreas and ovaries.</brief_summary>
