	<brief_summary>The study will be a prospective open-label single-center study in previously treated patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or Acute Lymphoid Leukemia (ALL). Treatment efficacy and safety of the combination of Oshadi D (DNase in Oshadi carrier) and Oshadi R (RNase in Oshadi carrier) with Salvage Chemotherapy will be evaluated. Oshadi D and Oshadi R were shown to have anti-tumor activity and good safety profile. Patients will receive Oshadi D and Oshadi R oral treatment combined with salvage chemotherapy. Patient will be evaluated throughout the study for safety and tolerance to multiple dose regimens of Oshadi D and Oshadi R. Efficacy will be determined by percentage of bone marrow blasts assessment at day 28 post therapy initiation.</brief_summary>
