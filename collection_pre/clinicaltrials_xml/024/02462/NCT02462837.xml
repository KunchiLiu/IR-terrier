Subject is excluded if using restricted medications not meeting protocolspecified criteria: (i) Phytotherapy for BPH or a 5alpha reductase inhibitor within 3 months, with persistent urinary symptoms and AUASS more than 7. (ii) Taken an oral alpha agonist, anticholinergic or cholinergic medication within 5 days of the first screening visit with the following exception(s): a singular dose given in ER or on the hospital floor prior to procedure, topical anticholinergic eye drops used for glaucoma or inhaled anticholinergic used for COPD. (iii) Taken tricyclic antidepressants within 2 weeks of the first screening visit. (iv) Taken an estrogen, androgen, or any drug producing androgen suppression, or anabolic steroids within 3 months with the following exceptions: any topical creams for local treatment. 3.

Subject has known neurogenic bladder. 6. Subject with uncontrolled chronic pain problems or on chronic pain medications. 7.

Subject has evidence of a symptomatic active urinary tract infection, chronic inflammation such as interstitial cystitis, previous pelvic radiation therapy or previous or current malignant disease of the pelvic organs, or bladder stones (which can be located in different anatomical location and can cause LUTS similar to bladder infection and pain related to their location in the bladder which could mask the treatment effect). 11. Subject who is currently under active treatment with botulinum toxin (and all other bladder paralytics) intravesically. 12. Subject has moderate to severe hepatic impairment [ALT (SGPT) or AST (SGOT) value greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal in the clinical center lab; confirmed on a second measurement]. 13. Subject has severe renal impairment or End Stage Renal disease (i.e., creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dl). 14. Subject has severe uncontrolled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure ≥180mmHg and /or diastolic pressure ≥ 110mmHg). 15. Subject has a clinically significant abnormal ECG in their chart or has a known history of QT prolongation or currently taking medication known to prolong the QT interval. Any patient taking Digoxin. 16. Subject has a known or suspected hypersensitivity to Mirabegron or any of the inactive ingredients. 17. Subject has a concurrent genitourinary malignancy, or active cancer (except noninvasive skin cancer) within the last 5 years prior to screening. Men with a history of prostate cancer regardless of curability are not eligible. 18.
