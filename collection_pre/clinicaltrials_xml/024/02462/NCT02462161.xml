	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial will examine the effects of intranasal insulin aspart on cognition, daily function, blood and CSF markers of Alzheimer's disease, and amyloid deposition in the brain. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive insulin aspart or placebo during a 12-week treatment period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Nasal Insulin to Fight Forgetfulness - Short-Acting Insulin Aspart</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A growing body of evidence suggests that insulin plays a role in normal memory processes and that insulin abnormalities may contribute to cognitive and brain changes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Interestingly, insulin administered to the nasal cavity is transported within a few minutes into the brain, but does not affect blood sugar or insulin levels. This trial will consist of a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group trial in which 30 participants with AD or MCI receive twice daily intranasal administrations of insulin aspart (20 IU bid) or placebo (saline bid) for 12 weeks. All participants will appoint a "support person" to answer a collateral questionnaire and supervise the administration of the study drug. All participants and study partners will undergo the intensive, structured training program in the self-management of intranasal insulin administration. Cognitive testing and blood collection will occur at baseline, after 6 weeks of treatment, and at the end of the 12 week treatment period. Participants will also receive a lumbar puncture to measure AD biomarkers in the subject's cerebral spinal fluid (CSF).</detailed_description>
