	<brief_summary>This study compare the effects on microalbuminuria improvement in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treated with saxagliptin or glimepiride.All patients received metformin and/or acarbose, and randomly receive saxagliptin (5mg/d) or glimepiride (1-4mg/d).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Saxagliptin's Effects on Microalbuminuria Improvement in Type 2 Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both sitagliptin and glimepiride are hypoglycemic agents,but they do so by different mechanisms.sitagliptin can delay degradation of glucagon-like peptide -1 (GLP-1) by inhibit DPPIV to decrease serum glucose level.glimepiride stimulates islets B cell to secrete insulin to decrease serum glucose level. Preclinical studies and several clinical trials (including vildagliptin, sitagliptin, linagliptin, exenatide) suggested that DPP-4i/GLP-1 might have a potential to lower albuminuria, albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) or improve glomerular filtration rate(GFR) and the effect might be independent of changes in glucose control. Recently, SAVOR outcomes also showed that saxagliptin might have nephroprotective effects, and the proportion of patients with microalbuminuria converted into normal albuminuria after saxagliptin treatment for 1 year is 31.3%, but the mechanism is still unclear.</detailed_description>
