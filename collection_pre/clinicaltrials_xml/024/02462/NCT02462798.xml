	<brief_summary>Iron deficiency anaemia is a major problem for women worldwide. Cereal foods are a major source of iron, but much of this is not bioavailability due to it being bound by the high amounts of phytate present in cereals. Destruction of phytate by the phytase enzyme can release iron and increase its bioavailability. In a human cell model of iron uptake, sourdough fermentation, which included activation of phytase, the enzyme that breaks down phyate, led to improved iron bioavailability. This clinical trial will attempt to demonstrate that this concept also works in humans</brief_summary>
