	<brief_title>Risk Analysis for Cardiovascular Autonomic Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A large-scale, community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted to explore the extent to which risk factors associated with cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) in general Chinese population. A total of more than 2000 participants were recruited by using multiple stages sampling (first cluster sampling and then simply sampling). Data involved in demographic information, clinical biomarkers such as glucose and lipids profiles, medical and therapy history were collected. Every participants was complete DNA extracted and genotyped. Cardiovascular autonomic functions were measured by using short-term heart rate variability (HRV) to evaluate the outcome of CAN. Univariate and multiple variables analysis have been performed to examine potential environmental and genetic risk factors of CAN. In addition, clinical risk model, simply screening model and non-linear system model such as artificial neural network was created, respectively.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Survey Chinese participants with undiagnosed CAN Aged 3090 years, were included in this study. Some subjects were excluded from the study to eliminate potential confounding factors that may have influenced their CA function. Briefly, the exclusion criteria were as follows: 1. history or findings of arrhythmia and hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism 2. pregnancy or lactation 3. serious hepatic or renal dysfunctions (GFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2). Of these subjects, complete baseline data were obtained for 2,092 (69.46%) of the participants.</criteria>
