	<brief_summary>Objectives to investigate the incidence and associated factors for early postoperative cognitive dysfunction in the patients with peritoneal surface malignancies undergoing cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemo-therapy(CRS-HIPEC).Methods fifty patients aged 18-65 yr were included in the research and were grouped base on the score of neuropsychological assessments which had done in the ward at 7 day before and after the surgery. The investigators monitored various indicators in the perioperative period, such as age, body weight, sex, education, duration of operation, intraoperative blood loss, cardiovascular events, amount of fluid infused per hour. Meanwhile, the concentration of serum amploid A (SAA),IL-1beta,TNF-alpha,HMGB1,S100b,cortisol and Abeta40 were measured at the various stage of the operation and 24 hours after the operation, and the differences of data between postoperative cognitive dysfunction(POCD) and Non-POCD groups were analyzed.</brief_summary>
