	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to conduct a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of the web-based The-Optimal-Lymph-Flow ™ system for managing chronic pain and symptoms related to lymphedema focusing on primary outcomes of pain reduction, secondary outcomes of symptom relief, limb volume difference by infra-red perometer, body mass index, quality of life related to pain. Recruitment includes 120 patients who will be randomized according to pain/aching/soreness, and tenderness. Participants in the intervention group will be provided the web-based The-Optimal-Lymph-Flow ™ intervention and encourage to access and learn about the program during the 1-4 weeks of the study. Participants in the control group will receive the web-based arm precaution program. All the participants will have monthly online assessment of pain and symptoms at 4 and 8 weeks post-intervention as well as two in-person research visits, that is, prior to intervention and 12 weeks post-intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhancing Management of Chronic Pain and Symptoms Among Women Treated for Breast Cancer (Lymph-Flow)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite current advances in cancer treatment, many breast cancer survivors still face long-term post-operative challenges as a result of suffering from daily pain and other distressing symptoms related to lymphedema, i.e. abnormal accumulation of lymph fluid in the ipsilateral upper limb or body. The purpose of this research study is to conduct a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of the web-based The-Optimal-Lymph-Flow ™ system for managing chronic pain and symptoms related to lymphedema focusing on primary outcomes of pain reduction, secondary outcomes of symptom relief, limb volume difference by infra-red perometer, body mass index, quality of life related to pain. Recruitment includes 120 patients who will be randomized according to pain/aching/soreness, and tenderness. Participants in the intervention group will be provided the web-based The-Optimal-Lymph-Flow ™ intervention and encourage to access and learn about the program during the 1-4 weeks of the study. Participants in the control group will receive the web-based arm precaution program. All the participants will have monthly online assessment of pain and symptoms at 4 and 8 weeks post-intervention as well as two in-person research visits, that is, prior to intervention and 12 weeks post-intervention. The study length for patients is 12 weeks.</detailed_description>

Patients may or may not have a history of lymphedema or have been treated for lymphedema. 5.
