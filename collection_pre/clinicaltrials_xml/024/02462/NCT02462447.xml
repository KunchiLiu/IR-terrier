	<brief_summary>Men with and without prostate cancer will have a PET/CT scan that measures the level of the amino acid sarcosine. PET is a scanning method that uses short lived radioactivity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carbon-11 Labeled Sarcosine in Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tissue levels of the amino acid sarcosine are elevated in prostate cancer compared to normal prostate tissues and further increased in metastases from prostate cancer. This research project is designed to test whether 11C-sarcosine (a chemical that is linked to short lived radioactivity) would be useful to detect prostate cancer in men using PET/CT imaging. The uptake and distribution of 11C-sarcosine in men with known or suspected prostate cancer will be determined and compared with results from 11C-choline PET/CT.</detailed_description>
