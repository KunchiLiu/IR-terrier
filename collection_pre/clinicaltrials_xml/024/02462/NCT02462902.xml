	<brief_summary>300 consecutive patients with cirrhosis of any aetiology admitted with features of sepsis and sepsis induced hypotension to the intensive care unit, the emergency department and the step down units of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, New Delhi, who fulfil the inclusion criteria. This study will be a single centre prospective randomized comparative trial. Patients will be randomized into two groups. Group A will receive crystalloid, 0.9% sodium chloride solution (total of 30ml/kg over 30 minutes) and Group B will receive colloid, 5% albumin (250 ml over 15 minutes).</brief_summary>
