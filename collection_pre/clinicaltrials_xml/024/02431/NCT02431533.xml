	<detailed_description>Probiotics, particularly Bifidobacterium infantis, Sacchromyces boulardii, Lactobacillus plantarum and combination probiotics may help regulate how often people with IBS have bowel movements.

PX0612 PX0612 is a probiotic which is composed of the following ingredients contained in a veggie capsule, being one dose: Bacillus coagulans 200 million colony forming units 16.0mg Bacillus subtilis 100 million colony forming units 4.8mg Enterococcus faecium 100 million colony forming units 0.6mg Fructo-oligosacharride a nutrient for the packaged product 600.0mg Total 621.4 mg Bacillus coagulans is a non-pathogenic, Gram positive, spore forming bacteria that produces lactic acid. Though not normally found in the gut. Bacillus coagulans strains have been used as general nutritional supplements and agents to control constipation and diarrhea in humans and animals.</detailed_description>
