	<brief_summary>This study randomizes postmenopausal women with symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse planning native tissue transvaginal surgical repair to 6-8 weeks of preoperative and 1-year continued postoperative vaginal estrogen cream compared to placebo cream. This clinical trial and basic science investigation are designed to understand the mechanisms by which local estrogen treatment affects connective tissues of the pelvic floor and determine whether its use before and after prolapse repair will (i) improve success rates of the surgical intervention and minimize prolapse recurrence and (ii) impact favorably upon symptoms of other pelvic floor disorders.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation to Minimize Prolapse Recurrence of the Vagina Using Estrogen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind randomized trial of intravaginal estrogen (conjugated estrogens, 0.625mg/1g cream) vs. placebo in postmenopausal women (n=222 total) with symptomatic prolapse beyond the hymen planning transvaginal native tissue repairs. Medication will be started 6-8 weeks before surgery and continued for 1 year postoperatively, i.e. until scar remodeling is complete. The investigators aim to determine if pre- and postoperative intravaginal estrogen therapy (i) results in anatomic and patient-reported subjective improvement in pelvic organ support, and (ii) impacts other pelvic floor disorders (overactive bladder and incontinence, sexual function and pain, postoperative cystitis), satisfaction, quality of life, and vaginal wound healing. Finally, (iii) the investigators will determine the potential mechanisms by which local estrogen treatment alters pelvic organ support by examining full-thickness vaginal wall biopsies taken at the time of surgery for histologic, connective tissue, and smooth muscle synthesis and degradative changes. The investigators expect this will highlight other novel targets for future therapies in prolapse repair and prevention.</detailed_description>
