	<brief_title>EHR‚ÄêBased Medication Complete Communication Strategy to Promote Safe Opioid Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research has shown that patients frequently leave the emergency department without sufficient knowledge about how to safely use their newly prescribed opioid pain relievers. Additionally, educational interventions have the ability to increase patient knowledge about medications. In this study, education interventions will be implemented at the level of the EHR and prompt increased provider counseling with a goal of improving patient knowledge and safe use of opioids after ED discharge. The investigators will conduct a three-arm provider randomized controlled trial among English-speaking adults prescribed hydrocodone-acetaminophen to evaluate the effectiveness of the EMC2 strategy, with and without SMS text reminders, to improve patient understanding and safe use of their medication compared to usual care. This study will be conducted at an urban, academic emergency department (annual volume &gt;85,000 patient visits) in Chicago, IL. English speaking patients will be recruited and assessed in person at baseline, and by phone at 2-4 days, 7-14 days, and 1 month after recruitment.</detailed_description>
