Screening clinical chemistry or hematology laboratory value that is considered clinically significant, in the opinion of the Investigator. Abnormal findings on screening ECG, deemed clinically significant, by the Investigator. Subjects who are actively participating in an experimental therapy study or who have received experimental therapy within 30 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) of the Baseline visit. Subjects who are a poor medical risk because of other systemic diseases or active uncontrolled infections, in the opinion of the investigator. Treatment with overthecounter topical medications for the treatment of acne vulgaris including benzoyl peroxide, topical antiinflammatory medications, corticosteroids, αhydroxy/glycolic acid on the face within 2 weeks prior to Baseline.

Dose and frequency of use of any hormonal therapy started more than 12 weeks prior to Baseline must remain unchanged throughout the study. Hormonal therapies include, but are not limited to, estrogenic and progestational agents such as birth control pills. Prior use of androgen receptor blockers (such as spironolactone or flutamide).
