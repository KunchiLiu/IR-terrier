	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, non-comparative, open-label clinical trial to assess the Pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of miltefosine using an allometric dose algorithm in the treatment of children with primary Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) in eastern Africa. Efficacy and Pharmacodynamics (PD) will be assessed as secondary outcomes. The proposed study aims to assess whether drug exposure in children can be increased to equivalent adult drug exposure by using the miltefosine allometric dose given BID for 28 days in paediatric VL patients aged 4-12y and whether this dose is tolerable. The present study is also expected to provide the basis for minimum time to reach sufficient drug exposure for miltefosine activity to guide optimal treatment duration to be used in combination therapy for visceral leishmaniasis. The PK data will be assessed in this trial using a compartmental population PK approach.</brief_summary>
