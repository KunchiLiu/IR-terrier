	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in volunteer breath-holding capacity in response to gadoxetate disodium (Eovist) administration, compared with saline, and gadoterate dimeglumine (Dotarem). Healthy volunteers will be recruited from three study sites. These subjects will be given three, blinded, randomized injections while undergoing an MRI of their liver and holding their breath. During the scan, the subjects' oxygen saturation and heart rate will be closely monitored. Following the scan, the subjects will complete a questionnaire regarding the breath hold.</brief_summary>
