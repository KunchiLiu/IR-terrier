	<brief_summary>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in North America and in the world. The vast majority of lung cancers are associated with cigarette smoking. Unfortunately, the majority of lung cancers are detected at an advanced stage when they have a very poor prognosis. A substantial amount of data has been reported on low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening. Yet endorsement of lung cancer screening has not been universal because of outstanding concerns which need to be addressed. Our study will aim to screen at risk Albertans for lung cancer with LDCT scan at baseline, year 1 and year 2 while attempting to fill some knowledge gaps on this topic.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in North America and in the world. The vast majority of lung cancers are associated with cigarette smoking. Lung cancer incidence and mortality rates are similar because lung cancer is a highly fatal disease. Unfortunately, the majority of lung cancers are detected at an advanced stage when they have a very poor prognosis. A substantial amount of data has been reported on low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening. The results of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) showed a 20% reduction in mortality from lung cancer with LDCT screening in addition to a 6.7% decrease in all-cause mortality, the first ever screening intervention to demonstrate an improvement in this latter outcome. Yet endorsement of lung cancer screening has not been universal. Although the NLST results are encouraging, more investigation is needed. The objectives of this study are to prospectively compare the performance of a lung cancer risk prediction model (RPM) vs. NLST criteria to inform optimal inclusion criteria for a clinical screening program; to prospectively compare a novel screening based nodule malignancy probability calculation which has been developed in the Pan-Canadian Early Detection of Lung Cancer study vs. NLST criteria; to complete a randomized controlled trial as a substudy comparing an intensive tobacco cessation counseling program to a usual care arm for subjects with ongoing tobacco use; to perform a cost analysis evaluating the incremental costs associated with LDCT screening for lung cancer compared to no screening; to determine the average cost associated with incidental findings, false positive findings and lung cancers found during the screening period; and to compare cost implications of both screening enrollment criteria. The backbone of this research project will be the screening of at risk individuals for lung cancer with LDCT scan. Eight hundred at risk Albertans will be screened at baseline, year 1 and year 2. Additional clinical LDCT or other investigations may result from findings on the study CT scans.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects between the ages of 55 and 80 with a risk prediction model (RPM) ≥1.5% (≥ 1.5% risk of lung cancer over 6 years) OR NLST criteria (age 5574; ≥ 30 packyear smoking history; ongoing smoking or quit within 15 years). Ability to provide informed consent and participate in study procedures. Any medical condition, such as severe heart disease (e.g. unstable angina, chronic congestive heart failure), severe lung disease or lung disease requiring supplemental oxygen that in the opinion of the physician unlikely to benefit from screening due to shortened lifeexpectancy from the comorbidities or inability to tolerate diagnosis and treatment of a screen detected abnormality.
