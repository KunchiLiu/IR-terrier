	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria (All Subjects): Male or female (sterile or postmenopausal) subjects between 1875 (both inclusive) years of age and healthy as determined by absence of clinically significant deviation from normal in medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory determinations (except for renal impaired subjects). Subjects must have a BMI between 18 kg/m2 and 38 kg/m2 and weight at least 50 kg and no more than 120 kg. Additional inclusion criteria for subjects with normal renal function: An absolute GFR as determined by MDRD equation and conversion within normal range as determined by GFR &gt; 90 mL/min Inclusion Criteria (for subjects with impaired renal function): Subjects must have documented stable renal disease without evidence of renal progressive disease (stable renal disease is defined as no significant change, such as a stable absolute GFR, for 4 weeks prior to study entry. Exclusion Criteria (All Subjects): Subject has received a renal transplant at any time in the past and is on immunosuppressant therapy History or presence of impaired cardiac function Any surgical or medical condition that may significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs Administration of CYP3A4/5 inhibitors or inducers or CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic windows Administration of medications that prolong the QT interval Subject has a history of immunodeficiency diseases, including HIV, as confirmed by (HIV1, HIV2) test Receipt of investigational product in another clinical trial within 4 weeks of dosing Exclusion Criteria (for subjects with impaired renal function): Severe albuminuria &gt; 300 mg/day Subjects undergoing any method of dialysis Subjects with renal impairment due to hepatic disease (hepatorenal syndrome) Other protocoldefined Inclusion/Exclusion may apply.</criteria>
