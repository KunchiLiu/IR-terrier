	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority in efficacy of a darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (D/C/F/TAF) fixed dose combination (FDC) tablet versus Darunavir/Cobicistat (DRV/COBI) FDC coadministered with Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) FDC in human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infected, antiretroviral (ARV) treatment naive adult participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Darunavir/Cobicistat/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide (D/C/F/TAF) Fixed Dose Combination (FDC) Versus a Regimen Consisting of Darunavir/Cobicistat FDC With Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate FDC in Treatment-naive HIV Type 1 Infected Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 3, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (a medical research study in which neither the researchers nor the participant know what treatment the participant is receiving), active-controlled (study in which the experimental treatment or procedure is compared to a standard [control] treatment or procedure) study. The study consists of 5 periods: a Screening period, Double-blind treatment period, Single-arm treatment period, Extension period and a Follow-up period. Participants will receive either darunavir (DRV)/ cobicistat (COBI)/emtricitabine (FTC) /tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) fixed dose combination (D/C/F/TAF FDC) or DRV/COBI FDC along with FTC/TDF FDC. Primarily percentage of participants with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -1 Ribonucleic acid (RNA) less than (&lt;) 50 copies per milliliter (copies/ml) defined by snapshot analysis will be evaluated. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
