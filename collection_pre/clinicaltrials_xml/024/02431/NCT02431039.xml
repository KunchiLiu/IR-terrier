	<brief_summary>This study is to investigate whether NEOSORB Plus antibacterial suture (chlorhexidine diacetate coated PGLA910) is not inferior to NEOSORB suture (PGLA910) in the points of intraoperative handling.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Between NEOSORB Plus and NEOSORB</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Enrollment 1. Urologic surgery which needs fascia and subcutaneous tissue repairs 2. Clean and clean-contaminated surgery 3. Patients aged more than 18 years and under 80 years 2. Randomization 1. NEOSORB Plus (chlorhexidine diacetate coated PGLA910) or NEOSORB (PGLA910) suture 2. Stratification by operative methods: Open surgery vs. laparoscopic or robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery 3. Follow-up with 30 days 1. Primary endpoint: intraoperative handling during operation 2. Secondary endpoint: wound healing assessment on postoperative 1st (+1) days and 11th (Â± 4) days 3. Safety evaluation: counting adverse events within postoperative 30 days</detailed_description>
