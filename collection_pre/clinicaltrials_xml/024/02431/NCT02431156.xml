	<brief_summary>Patients who underwent mini-monovision (with bilateral myopic defocus, MM-BMD) surgery for presbyopia correction with monofocal intraocular lenses implantation are supposed to have sufficient uncorrected vision capacity for activities of daily living (ADLs) that require: a) distant vision(DV), (ie. driving), b) intermediate vision (IV), (ie. computer word processing), c) near vision (NV), (ie. book reading). Primary objectives of the study are: 1) the development of a series of tasks in a research setting that will simulate common ADLs that require DV, IV, and NV. 2) the identification of potential correlations of the tasks in the research setting with demographic, clinical and other parameters of the study participants.</brief_summary>
