	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: Chronic Hepatitis B virus infection Negative for Hepatitis A IgM, C, D and HIV Liver biopsy, Fibroscan® or equivalent elastographybased test obtained within the past 6 mon demonstrating liver disease without evidence of bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis supported by platelet count greater than the central laboratory LLN at screening Positive for Hepatitis B surface antigen Nucleos(t)ide treatment for at least 1 year with ongoing nucleos(t)ide analogue treatment at randomization HBV DNA &lt;90 IU/mL for ≥6 mon prior to randomization Screening laboratory values within normal range ALT ≤1.5x ULN from 2 measurements separated by at least 14 days during the 6 mon prior to randomization and ALT at screening ≤1.5x ULN AST, TBili, DBili, GGT, Alk Phos and albumin within normal range or judged to be not clinically significant by PI and medical monitor at screening For men and women who are not postmenopausal [i.e. ≥ 12 months of nontherapyinduced amenorrhea, confirmed by follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), if not on hormone replacement] or surgically sterile (vasectomy in males or absence of ovaries and/or uterus in females) agreement to remain abstinent or use 1 highly effective or combined contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment period and at least through week 12 after last dose EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Pregnant or breastfeeding females Positive serum pregnancy test at screening or positive urine pregnancy test at randomization Use of topical corticosteroids at or near the intended administration site Autoimmune disorders, transplant recipients, other immunosuppression including any concurrent condition requiring the use of immunosuppressive/immunomodulating agents (eye dropcontaining and infrequent inhaled corticosteroids are permissible) Need for systemic antiviral treatment (other than for chronic hepatitis B infection) Documented history or other evidence of decompensated liver disease (e.g., ascites, bleeding from esophageal varices, ChildPugh clinical classification B or C); History of other evidence of a medical condition associated with chronic liver disease [e.g., hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), toxin exposure, thalassemia, etc.] Documented history or other evidence of metabolic liver disease within 1yr of randomization Abnormal renal function including serum creatinine &gt;ULN or calculated creatinine clearance &lt;70 mL/min (using the Cockcroft Gault formula) History of or suspicion of HCC Screening alpha fetoprotein greater than 13 ng/mL Prior history or current malignancy other than adequately treated BCC, unless history of BCC is near dintended administration site History of significant medical conditions [e.g., cardiac (including ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias), renal disease, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, neurological] Significant acute infection (e.g., influenza, local infection) or any other clinically significant illness within 2 weeks of randomization Administration of any blood product within 3 mon of randomization History of seizures (unless seizure free for 5yrs)</criteria>
