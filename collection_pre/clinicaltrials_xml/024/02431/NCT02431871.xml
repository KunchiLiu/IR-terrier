	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to assess long term effects of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) to overall health and quality of life later in life. We compare hip radiographs, hip symptoms, clinical examination, head asymmetry, dental examination and intraoral scans of 170 children and young adults treated for DDH in their childhood with age and sex matched controls.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is the most common musculoskeletal disorder in infancy. However there are few reports of long term effects of successfully treated DDH. Incidence of DDH in neonatal period is approximately 1-10/1000 depending on screening protocols used, the age of the infant during screening and which ultrasonographic findings are considered normal and which DDH. The prevalence of hip dysplasia in adult population is grossly 4 % when using Wibergs Center Edge (CE) ≤ 20° as definition of dysplasia. It is still unclear, what is the relation between adult acetabular dysplasia and developmental dysplasia in children. Hip dysplasia overall is a major contributing factor in hip osteoarthrosis and total hip replacement in young adults. The aim of this study is to assess long term effects of developmental dysplasia of the hip to overall health and quality of life later in life. We compare hip radiographs, hip symptoms, clinical examination, head asymmetry, dental examination and intraoral scans of 170 children and young adults treated for DDH in their early childhood with age and sex matched controls.</detailed_description>
