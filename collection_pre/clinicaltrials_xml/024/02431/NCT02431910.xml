	<brief_title>Immediate and Delayed Effects of Kinesio Taping on the Neuromuscular Performance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sixty volunteers, females will be recruited and randomly divided into 3 groups with 20 members each: control group (CG) - 10 minutes at rest; placebo group (PG) - Kinesio Taping (KT) without application of tension in the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus (VM) and rectus femoris (RF); and Kinesio Taping group (KTG) - application of KT with tension in VL, VM and RF. All volunteers will be evaluated for their distance from the single and triple hop test, postural balance (baropodometry), the joint position sense (JPS), the knee extensor torque (concentric and eccentric assessment at 60 Â°/s) and electromyographic activity of the VL muscle in five distinct stages: the first before the intervention (AV1), the second immediately after (AV2) and the following three 24h (AV3), 48 (AV4) after the intervention protocol. Soon after the AV4, KT will be removed after 24 hours and take place the last review (AV5).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Be recreationally active, with no history of osteomyoarticular lesion or surgery in the lower limbs in the previous six months, noncorrected neurological, vestibular, visual and/or hearing impairments, in addition to displaying no allergy to adhesive material. Individuals experiencing pain during collection procedures or who do not perform exercises as instructed by the researchers would be excluded.</criteria>
