	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to compare effectiveness of paliperidone palmitate (PP: paliperidone palmitate once-monthly and 3-month injections) versus oral antipsychotic (OAP) on delaying time to treatment failure. The study will also evaluate changes in cognition, functioning, brain intracortical myelin (ICM) volume following treatment with PP compared with OAP in participants with recent-onset schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Compare Disease Progression and Modification Following Treatment With Paliperidone Palmitate Long-Acting Injection or Oral Antipsychotics in Participant's With Recent-onset Schizophrenia or Schizophreniform</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Prospective, matched-control, Randomized (assignment of study drug by chance), open-label, flexible-dose, study in participants with recent-onset schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder to compare disease progression and disease modification following treatment with PP long-acting injection (once-monthly followed by 3-month injections) or OAP (Any of the following 7 OAPs are permitted: aripiprazole, haloperidol, olanzapine, paliperidone ER, perphenazine, quetiapine, and risperidone). The study consists of 3 parts. Part-1 (Oral Run-In Phase), Part-2 (Disease Progression) and Part-3 (Extended Disease Progression and Disease Modification) with unique endpoints. Screening period will be up to 4 Weeks. Duration of Parts will be as: 2 months for Part-1, 9 months for Part-2 and Part-3. All participants will initially receive oral Paliperidone Extended Release (ER) in Part-1. After paliperidone treatment in Part-1, participants will be randomized into 1:2 ratio to receive PP or OAP in Part-2. Participants who complete Part-2 will enter into Part-3 wherein OAP group participants of Part-2 will be re-randomized into 1:1 ratio to OAP-OAP group and OAP-PP group, and PP group will continue without further randomization. Treatment failures will be evaluated in Part-2 and Part-3 of the study. Also changes in cognition, functioning, brain intracortical myelin (ICM) volume will be evaluated in the study. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout.</detailed_description>
