	<brief_summary>Elastic compression stockings are recommended in the treatment venous insufficiency. Degressive compressive stockings have been used for many decades and are characterized by a high pressure applied at the ankle and a decreasing pressure from the ankle to the knee. Progressive compressive stockings were developed to have a maximal pressure at the calf. This concept is based on the calf pump role in the venous return. Patients with PAD (Peripheral Arterial Disease) often suffer from venous insufficiency. But elastic compression stockings are strictly contraindicated for patients with PAD because highest pressures on ankle could slow down the superficial microcirculation. On patients with PAD and venous insufficiency, the progressive compressive stockings could be well indicated. Strongest pressure at the calf should increase the pump effect and the muscle mechanical efficiency during the walk without deleterious effect.</brief_summary>
