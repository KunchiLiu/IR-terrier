	<brief_title>The Expression of ZEB1 in CTCs Associated With Metastasis and Recurrence for Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Invasion and metastasis of tumors and postoperative recurrence are the main causes of death in patients with gastric cancer and are also the key factors affecting the clinical treatment and prognosis. In this study, the investigators will detect the expression of ZEB1 in different types of CTCs(epithelial,mesenchymal and mixed phenotype) for gastric cancer by CanPatrolTM2 detection technology.Our investigation of the relationship between ZEB1 and the occurrence and development as well as the invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer is expected to provide data for the prognosis and targeted therapy of gastric cancer. Approximate 100 consecutive patients with gastric cancer and CTCs(+) will be enrolled in this study.Detection of ZEB1 expression in CTCs at baseline will show the relationship between ZEB1 and clinicopathological variables. Postoperative follow-up of ZEB1 expression in CTCs will be performed every three months in the first year and every six months in the following two years. The results may indicate the role of ZEB1 in CTCs about invasion and metastasis for gastric cancer .The aim of this study is to clarify the clinical significance of ZEB1 expression in CTCs for gastric cancer.</detailed_description>
