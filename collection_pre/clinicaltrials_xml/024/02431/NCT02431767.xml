	<brief_title>Evaluating the Safety and Immunogenicity of PENNVAX速-GP DNA Vaccine and IL-12 Plasmid, Delivered Via Intradermal or Intramuscular Electroporation in Healthy, HIV-Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the PENNVAX速-GP HIV-1 DNA vaccine and IL-12 DNA adjuvant, given by intradermal (ID) or intramuscular (IM) injection with electroporation (EP), in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults. All study injections will be given using an EP device, which uses an electric pulse to briefly open tiny pores in the cells. Researchers will evaluate whether EP increases the immune response to the vaccine. The study will enroll participants in four groups. Within each group, participants will be randomly assigned to receive the PENNVAX速-GP DNA vaccine/IL-12 DNA adjuvant or placebo. Each group will receive different doses of the vaccine. Enrollment will begin with Group 1, which will receive a low dose of the vaccine and adjuvant. Study staff will review safety data from Group 1 before enrolling people in Groups 2, 3, and 4 at higher doses. Participants in all groups will receive injections at study entry (Day 0) and Months 1, 3, and 6. At each injection visit, participants in Groups 1 and 4 will receive injections in one arm, and participants in Groups 2 and 3 will receive injections in both arms. Groups 1, 2, and 3 will receive ID injections, and Group 4 will receive IM injections. Participants will attend study visits at Day 0, Week 2, and Months 1, 1.5, 3, 3.5, 6, 6.5, 9, and 12. Visits will include physical examinations, urine collection, blood collection, HIV and risk reduction counseling, and assessments and questionnaires. Some participants may have photographs taken of the injection site (this is optional). Study staff will contact participants at Month 18 for follow-up health monitoring.</detailed_description>

Virology Negative HIV1 and 2 blood test: participants must have a negative Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved enzyme immunoassay Negative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) Negative antihepatitis C virus antibodies (antiHCV), or negative HCV polymerase chain reaction if the antiHCV is positive Urine Normal urine: Negative urine glucose, and Negative or trace urine protein, and Negative or trace urine hemoglobin (if trace hemoglobin is present on dipstick, a microscopic urinalysis with red blood cells levels within institutional normal range). Reproductive Status: Participants who were born female: negative serum or urine beta human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test performed prior to vaccination on the day of initial vaccination. Persons who are NOT of reproductive potential due to having undergone total hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy (verified by medical records), are not required to undergo pregnancy testing. A participant who was born female must: Agree to consistently use effective contraception (see Appendix B of the protocol) for sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy from at least 21 days prior to enrollment through the last required protocol clinic visit. More information on this criterion is available in the protocol. Or not be of reproductive potential, such as having reached menopause (no menses for 1 year) or having undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation; Or be sexually abstinent. Participants who were born female must also agree not to seek pregnancy through alternative methods, such as artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization until after the last required protocol clinic visit General: Blood products received within 120 days before first vaccination Investigational research agents received within 30 days before first vaccination Body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 40; or BMI greater than or equal to 35 with 2 or more of the following: age greater than 45, systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg, current smoker, known hyperlipidemia Intent to participate in another study of an investigational research agent during the planned duration of the HVTN 098 study Pregnant or breastfeeding Subcutaneous contraceptive device Vaccines and Other Injections: HIV vaccine(s) received in a prior HIV vaccine trial. For participants who have received control/placebo in an HIV vaccine trial, the HVTN 098 Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT) will determine eligibility on a casebycase basis. NonHIV experimental vaccine(s) received within the last 5 years in a prior vaccine trial. Exceptions may be made for vaccines that have subsequently undergone licensure by the FDA. For participants who have received control/placebo in an experimental vaccine trial, the HVTN 098 PSRT will determine eligibility on a casebycase basis. For participants who have received an experimental vaccine(s) greater than 5 years ago, eligibility for enrollment will be determined by the HVTN 098 PSRT on a casebycase basis. Live attenuated vaccines other than influenza vaccine received within 30 days before first vaccination or scheduled within 14 days after injection (e.g., measles, mumps, and rubella [MMR]; oral polio vaccine [OPV]; varicella; yellow fever) Influenza vaccine or any vaccines that are not live attenuated vaccines and were received within 14 days prior to first vaccination (e.g., tetanus, pneumococcal, hepatitis A or B) Allergy treatment with antigen injections within 30 days before first vaccination or that are scheduled within 14 days after first vaccination Immune System: Immunosuppressive medications received within 168 days before first vaccination.
