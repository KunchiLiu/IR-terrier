	<brief_title>Efficacy &amp; Safety Study of KPT-330 in Erythropoietin-Refractory Lower-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-arm, open-label, study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) compound, Selinexor given orally to patients with transfusion-dependent, EPO-refractory lower-risk MDS (Low risk and Intermediate-1 as defined by IPSS). Patients will be dosed at the clinic on clinic visit days and received Selinexor for dosing at home on additional days. Patients will be evaluated for disease response according to the 2006 IWG response criteria for MDS. This includes evaluation for altering the natural history of disease, cytogenic response hematologic improvement, and quality of life.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of Low risk or Intermediate1 risk MDS with any cytogenetic abnormalities (according to the IPSS criteria); patients must have bone marrow biopsy/aspiration or tumor tissue available from within 1 month prior to first dose or collected during the Screening period. Patients &gt;18 years at Screening who are not candidates for hematopoietic cell transplantation. Received 1 prior line of treatment; typically erythroidstimulating agents (ESAs). Red blood cell (RBC) transfusiondependent anemia while treated with or after discontinuation of EPO. Transfusion dependence is defined as the requirement for at least 2 units of RBCs transfused during the 8 weeks prior to study initiation. Use of recombinant EPO within 8 weeks prior to screening. Patient has a concurrent active malignancy or prior history of malignancy other than MDS (except basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and in situ of the cervix) unless free of disease for at least 1 year. Unstable cardiovascular function: Symptomatic ischemia, Uncontrolled clinically significant conduction abnormalities (i.e., ventricular tachycardia on antiarrhythmic agents are excluded; 1st degree atrioventricular (AV) block or asymptomatic Left anterior fascicular block/Right bundle branch block (LAFB/RBBB) will not be excluded), or Congestive heart failure (CHF) New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class â‰¥3, or myocardial infarction (MI) within 3 months. Uncontrolled infection requiring parenteral antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals within 1 week prior to first dose. Infections controlled on concurrent antimicrobial agents are acceptable, and antimicrobial prophylaxis per institutional guidelines is acceptable. Active bleeding Grade 34, in the last 4 weeks prior to enrollment.</criteria>
