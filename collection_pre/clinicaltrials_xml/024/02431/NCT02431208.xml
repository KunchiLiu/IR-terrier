	<brief_summary>This multicenter, open-label, Phase I study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab alone or in combination with daratumumab and/or various immunomodulatory agents in participants with MM who have relapsed or who have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). The planned duration of this study is approximately 36 months. Cycle length will be 21 days in Cohorts A to C and 28 days in Cohorts D to F.</brief_summary>
