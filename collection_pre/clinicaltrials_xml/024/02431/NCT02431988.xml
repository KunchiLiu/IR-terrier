	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to administer novel cluster of differentiation antigen 19 (CD19) specific Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells (CAR19 T-cells) to patients with relapsed or resistant Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) to assess the safety and efficacy of this strategy as a bridge to allogeneic transplantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of CAR19 T-cells as an Optimal Bridge to Allogeneic Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) resistant to or relapsing following rituximab-containing chemotherapy regimens have a poor prognosis. Patients may receive salvage chemotherapy and possibly an autologous stem cell transplant (auto-SCT). A proportion of these patients, however, will not respond to the chemotherapy or may relapse after the auto-SCT and therefore require novel treatment options. Such patients may benefit from an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-STC). In this study the investigators aim to administer CAR19 T-cells to act as a bridge to the transplant strategy. Specifically, (1) the feasibility of generating CD19 specific Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells called CAR19 T-cells, (2) the safety of administering the CD19 CAR T-cells in this setting, (3) how well the CAR19 T-cells engraft and (4) to evaluate how effective these cells are as a bridge to allogeneic transplantation. Following informed consent and registration to the trial, patients will undergo an unstimulated leucapheresis for generation of the CAR19 T cells. Whilst the cells are being generated, patients will proceed with a further cycle of standard salvage (recommended ifosfamide, epirubicin and etoposide (i.e. the IVE regime), and should not receive rituximab. Patients will receive pre-conditioning with intravenous fludarabine and cyclophosphamide prior to infusion of a single dose of CAR-modified T-cells. An escalating dose protocol will be employed to identify a minimum effective dose of CAR19 T-cells.</detailed_description>
