	<brief_title>Infant Microbiota and Probiotic Intake Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine the effects of supplementing the probiotic Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis for the first 21 days of life in healthy term breastfed infants delivered via C-section or vaginal delivery on gut bacteria composition during, 1 week, and 1 month after supplementation compared with matched-control term infants receiving standard care. The investigators' specific aim is to compare the fecal microbiota (total B. infantis, total Bifidobacterium, total bacteria and composition of microbiota) between the supplement and control groups.</detailed_description>
