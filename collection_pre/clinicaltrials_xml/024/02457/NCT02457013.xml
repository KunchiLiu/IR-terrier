	<brief_summary>1. The purpose of the study is to evaluate prospectively the clinical benefits of High flow nasal canula (HFNC: 2l/kg/min) versus nasal CPAP( continuous positive airway pressure) (n-CPAP: 7 cmH2O) in the initial management of bronchiolitis in infants. 2. Design: non-inferiority study, prospective, controlled, randomized, multi-center. 3. Design: Infants less than 6 month admitted in pediatric intensive care unit for respiratory distress (mWCAS &gt;3) secondary to bronchiolitis but not requiring mechanical ventilation will be randomized in two groups: "n-CPAP"(nasal continuous positive airway pressure) or "HFNC" during 24 hours. 4. Conditions of measurements: Primary endpoint: Proportion of failure in both arms during the first 24 hours. Failure criteria: A raise of the Clinical score for respiratory distress (mWCAS) (1 point) or respiratory rate (10/min /H0 and above 60/min) or discomfort (EDIN) (1point /H0 and above 4) or apnea. Secondary outcomes: Assessment at H1, H12, H24 of mWCAS, respiratory and heart rate, EDIN score, skin lesions, FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen ) required to achieve an oxygen saturation between 94 and 97%, transcutaneous PCO2 (carbon dioxide partial pressure) (correlated to an initial gas analysis), Report SpO2 / FiO2 5. Statistic: Intention to treat Analysis. Expected number of patients: 71 per arm: 142 children. 6. Study Schedule: October 2014-April 2016</brief_summary>
