	<detailed_description>This study aims at defining the cause of renal stones and the risk pattern for recurrence of renal stones episodes (any kind of stones) in HIV1 patients. Primary Objective : - Finding the cause of renal stone in HIV patients defined as stone composition if stone is available or more probable pathophysiological mechanism - Risk profile for stone recurrences estimated on risk indices in HIV1 patients Secondary Objective(s) - Identify prevalence of recurrences and describe co-morbidities associated with stone disease - Describe urological management for renal stones in HIV patients - Describe the causes of drug induced renal stones</detailed_description>
