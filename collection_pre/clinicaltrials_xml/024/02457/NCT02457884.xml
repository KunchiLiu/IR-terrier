	<brief_summary>Diabetic macular oedema (DMO) is a sight-threatening problem for diabetic patient who has swelling in macula. Patients with DMO can receive laser treatment and achieve good acuity finally. However, some patients still have difficulties in reading even after proper treatment. In this project, the investigators aimed to explore the effectiveness of different training paradigms in improving reading performance in patients with DMO.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Training in Reading Rehabilitation for Patients With Diabetic Macular Oedema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with diabetic macular oedema (DMO), after receiving laser photocoagulation, achieved good outcomes in distance acuity. However, some patients, particularly those developing parafoveal scotoma, still had difficulty in reading. Inability to read or reading very slowly leads to the potential loss of job, as well as the enjoyment of reading for leisure. In this study, the investigators aimed to investigate the effectiveness of reading rehabilitation using perceptual learning paradigms in enhancing reading performance in patients with reading difficulties due to DMO. Also, the fundamental mechanisms explaining the reading problems in patients with DMO reading Chinese will be examined. The investigators hypothesize that the perceptual training would show an improvement in reading. The investigators' primary hypothesis is that temporal visual processing speed and spatial visual span will be improved after perceptual training. The investigators' secondary hypothesis is that the reading speed and fixation stability will be improved after training.</detailed_description>
