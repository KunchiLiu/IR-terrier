	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of tirabrutinib (ONO/GS-4059) in combination with other targeted anti-cancer therapies in adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoproliferative malignancies. This study consists of two parts: Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion. During the dose escalation phase, participants will be sequentially enrolled in a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation study design, to receive oral tirabrutinib combined with idelalisib entospletinib +/- obinutuzumab. The Dose Expansion Phase will enroll additional participants with a single B-cell lymphoproliferative malignancy disease type to further evaluate efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics.</brief_summary>
