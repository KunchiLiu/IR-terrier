	<brief_summary>Many responders to the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster continue to experience significant mental and physical health problems. Two of the most common health problems, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and respiratory illness, often occur together. Mental health conditions, such as PTSD, make physical illnesses worse and interfere with treatment. The primary goal of this study is to test a mind-body treatment designed to reduce both PTSD and respiratory symptoms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stress Management Program for World Trade Center (WTC) Responders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mind-body interventions including relaxation training and other coping skills are effective for patients with both mental and physical health problems. A leading mind-body treatment is the Relaxation Response Resiliency Program (3RP) developed at Harvard. This treatment has been shown to reduce both mental and physical health symptoms. The objective of this study is to adapt the 3RP to WTC responders and test its ability to reduce both PTSD and respiratory symptoms. This treatment will be compared to a Health Enhancement Program that addresses negative health behaviors. The investigators will randomly assign 175 patients with ongoing WTC-related PTSD and respiratory illness to the 3RP or Health Enhancement Program and will assess outcomes immediately after the treatment and at 3 and 6 month follow-ups.</detailed_description>
