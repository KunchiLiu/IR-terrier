	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the preference of Calcichew D3 500/400 (containing 500 mg calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D) with Adcal-D3 600/400 (containing 600 mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D) in Test Group 1, and to compare Calcichew D3 500/800 (containing 500 mg calcium and 800 IU vitamin D) with Kalcipos-D 500/800 (containing 500 mg of calcium and 800 IU of vitamin D) in Test Group 2.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Calcichew D3 Preference Study in Participants Eligible for Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called Calcichew D3 new formulations: Calcichew D3 500/400 and Calcichew D3 500/800. Calcichew D3 500/400 and Calcichew D3 500/800 are being tested to treat or prevent calcium or vitamin D deficiencies. Calcichew D3 500/400 will be compared to Adcal-D3 600/400 as prescribed in clinical practice and Calcichew D3 500/800 will be compared to Kalcipos-D 500/800 as prescribed in clinical practice. This Crossover study will enroll approximately 276 patients equally divided between the two test groups (138 patients each). Within each test group, participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of two treatment sequences, as described below. Test Group 1: - Calcichew D3 500/400 (containing 500 mg calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D) chewable tablet - Adcal-D3 600/400 (containing 600 mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D) chewable tablet Test Group 2: - Calcichew D3 500/800 (containing 500 mg calcium and 800 IU vitamin D) chewable tablets - Kalcipos-D 500/800 (containing 500 mg of calcium and 800 IU of vitamin D) chewable tablets Participants in Test Group 1 will take either Calcichew D3 500/400 or Adcal-D3 600/400 for 14 days and then will crossover to take either Calcichew D3 500/400 or Adcal-D3 600/400 treatment for 14 days. Participants in Test Group 2 will take either Calcichew D3 500/800 or Kalcipos-D 600/400 for 14 days and then will crossover to take either Calcichew D3 500/800 or Kalcipos-D treatment for 14 days. This multi-center trial will be conducted In the United Kingdom and Germany. The overall time to participate in this study is 28 days. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic including a final visit assessment at Day 28.</detailed_description>
