	<brief_summary>Pulse pressure variation (PPV) is a well-known dynamic preload indicator to predict fluid responsiveness. However, its usefulness in open-chest conditions has been equivocal. The investigators evaluated whether PPV measured during Valsalva maneuver can predict fluid responsiveness after sternotomy.</brief_summary>
