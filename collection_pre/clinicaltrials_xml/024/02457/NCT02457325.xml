	<brief_summary>The present clinical trial randomized compared the clinical efficacy of the local anesthetics articaine in two concentrations, 2% and 4%, in association with 1:200,000 adrenaline, for the removal of lower third molars. Onset, duration of postoperative analgesia, duration of anesthetic action on soft tissues, intraoperative bleeding, hemodynamic parameters, postoperative mouth opening and wound healing at the 7th postoperative day were evaluated. For this purpose, 50 healthy volunteers underwent removal of symmetrically positioned lower third molars, in two separate appointments (one to two months apart), under local anesthesia with either articaine 2% or 4% (both with 1:200,000 adrenaline) in a double-blind, randomized and crossed manner.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The present clinical trial randomized compared the clinical efficacy of the local anesthetics articaine in two concentrations, 2% and 4%, in association with 1:200,000 adrenaline, for the removal of lower third molars. Onset, duration of postoperative analgesia, duration of anesthetic action on soft tissues, intraoperative bleeding, hemodynamic parameters, postoperative mouth opening and wound healing at the 7th postoperative day were evaluated. This study evaluated the clinical efficacy of two concentrations (2% and 4%) of the local anesthetic articaine, a local anesthetic of moderate duration, associated with adrenalin at 1: 200,000 in 50 patients aged less than 18 years and in need of extraction of the two third molars with similar positions. Evaluated the following parameters: 1) onset of action of the anesthetic agent, 2) the total amount of anesthesia used during surgery, 3) onset and duration of surgery after the administration of the local anesthetic, 4) the incidence, type and severity of adverse reactions, 5) postoperative control of mouth opening, 6) subjective evaluation of postoperative pain, 7) postoperative duration of anesthesia, 8) Total amount of relief medication and 9) heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure before during and after surgery. The comparative analysis of the data and the application of proper statistical tests provided the basis for an assessment of the efficiency of both concentrations of the local anesthetic articaine (2% and 4%) with adrenalin at 1: 200,000.</detailed_description>
