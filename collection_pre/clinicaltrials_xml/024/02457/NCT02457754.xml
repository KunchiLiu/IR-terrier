	<brief_summary>Several studies have shown a high association between physical fitness and present and future health. Two of the main epidemics of the industrialized world are obesity and osteoporosis, diseases that could be prevented with early interventions from childhood. Both, physical activity and physical fitness have shown an association with these diseases, but tools for assessing them in early ages are still in development. Moreover, there is a lack of physical fitness reference values in preschool children and the relation of pathologies with physical fitness in these ages is still to be demonstrated. Therefore, through a simple and precise methodology displayed in the school and adapted for the younger we intend to: Provide a combination of safe and precise field tests to evaluate health related physical fitness in preschool children. Analyze body composition, risk of overweight, obesity and low mineral density and their relation with physical activity. The evaluation of these health-related physical fitness variables in early ages is of great interest to clinic and public health.</brief_summary>
