	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Spinal Stenosis</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Patient is skeletally mature and has at least moderate impairment in function, experiences relief in flexion from his/her symptoms of leg/buttocks/groin pain, with or without back pain, and has undergone at least 6 months of nonoperative treatment; 2. Patient is treated surgically at 1 or 2 contiguous lumbar motion segments with the coflex Interlaminar Device from L1L5 after decompression of stenosis at the affected level(s), where such use is not contraindicated as noted below. 1. Prior fusion or decompressive laminectomy at any index lumbar level; 2. Radiographically compromised vertebral bodies at any lumbar level(s) caused by current or past trauma or tumor (e.g., compression fracture); 3. Severe facet hypertrophy that requires extensive bone removal which would cause instability; 4. Grade II or greater spondylolisthesis; 5. Isthmic spondylolisthesis or spondylolysis (pars fracture); 6. Degenerative lumbar scoliosis (Cobb angle of greater than 25°); 7. Osteoporosis; 8. Back or leg pain of unknown etiology; 9. Axial back pain only, with no leg, buttock, or groin pain; 10. Morbid obesity defined as a body mass index &gt; 40; 11. Active or chronic infection systemic or local; 12. Known allergy to titanium alloys or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents; 13. Cauda equina syndrome defined as neural compression causing neurogenic bowel or bladder dysfunction; 14. Vulnerable population including pregnant women, prisoners, students and employees of treating physicians, and others who can be subject to coercion; 15. Patient is unwilling to complete his/her surveys.</criteria>
