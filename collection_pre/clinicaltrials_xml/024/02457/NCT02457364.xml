	<brief_summary>Ventral hernias are among the most common surgical diseases among patients.The natural history of patients with ventral hernias who are managed non-operatively is unknown. The aim of this prospective trial is to document the natural history of patients who are undergoing initially non-operative management. The investigators hypothesize that 1) the risk of emergency ventral hernia repair is low, 2) the risk of elective ventral hernia repair is high, and 3) patients managed non-operatively will develop increasing hernia size and symptom progression. This is a prospective observational study of all patients undergoing non-operative management at LBJ General Hospital. Patients will be consented and then followed for 5 years. Phone interviews will be done with these patients yearly to assess surgical and medical history, information about their hernia, including pain level due to the hernia, as well as function and quality of life.</brief_summary>
