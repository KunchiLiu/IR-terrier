	<brief_title>Abuse Liability of Pregabalin and Its Effects on Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pregabalin is currently being explored as a pharmacotherapy for substance use disorders. Open-labeled, uncontrolled studies indicate modest efficacy of pregabalin in benzodiazepine withdrawal symptom management and as a long-term benzodiazepine dependence treatment. Concurrently, there is increasing information from case reports and adverse drug event registries regarding pregabalin abuse in patients with substance use disorders. Given that the abuse liability of pregabalin has not been clearly established, nor its effects on benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms in inpatients, this study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over, abuse liability study of a single dose of pregabalin 300mg, nested within a randomized,double-blind placebo-controlled, feasibility study evaluating pregabalin's effects on withdrawal symptoms in inpatients undergoing medically-assisted withdrawal from benzodiazepine, zopiclone or zolpidem.</detailed_description>
