	<brief_summary>This study will assess the effects of administration of VX-745 for 12 weeks on amyloid plaque burden in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Subjects who meet entry criteria will undergo 11C-PiB (Carbon-11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B) positron emission tomography (PET) at baseline and after 45 days of dosing with VX-745. Cognitive testing will also be conducted at baseline and day 45.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Willing and able to provide informed consent Diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to probable AD or of mild AD MMSE range: 20 to 28 Evidence of amyloid pathology by amyloid PET scan Participants may be taking medications for AD, provided that the dose of these medications has been stable for &gt;3 months Proficiency in Dutch and adequate visual and auditory abilities to be able to perform all aspects of the cognitive and functional tests Adequate visual and auditory abilities to perform all aspects of the cognitive and functional assessments. Evidence of neurodegenerative disease other than AD Inability for any reason to undergo PET and fMRI scans (including notably: history of allergic reaction of any severity to 11CPiB injection; pacemaker, vascular stent or stent graft) Psychiatric disorder that would compromise ability to comply with study requirements Significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, liver, infectious disease, immune disorder or metabolic/endocrine disorders or other disease that would preclude treatment with p38 MAP kinase inhibitor and/or assessment of drug safety and efficacy Recent (&lt;90 days) changes to AD medications prescribed for cognitive reasons or with the potential to impact cognition Participation in a study of an investigational drug less than 6 months or 5 halflives of the investigational drug, whichever is longer, before enrollment in the study Male subjects with female partner of childbearing potential who are unwilling or unable to adhere to contraception requirements Female subjects who have not reached menopause or have not had a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy/salpingoophorectomy Positive urine or serum pregnancy test or plans desires to become pregnant during the course of the trial Any factor deemed by the investigator to be likely to interfere with study conduction</criteria>
