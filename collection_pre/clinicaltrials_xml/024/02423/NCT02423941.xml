	<brief_summary>To evaluate whether retrograde caval reperfusion of liver graft could be superior over antegrade portal reperfusion in regard of incidence and severity of early allograft liver dysfunction. All eligible enrolled liver transplant candidates will be randomized to receive either: 1. retrograde caval, followed by sequential portal-arterial, reperfusion or 2. antegrade, sequential portal-arterial reperfusion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Retrograde rEperfusion in Dbd Donor LIver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize that retrograde caval reperfusion could be superior over antegrade portal reperfusion in regard of incidence and severity of early allograft liver dysfunction. Chi-square method of sample size estimation with a=0,05, b=0,20 and P1-P2 = 0,25 required a 41 subject per group (Stephen B Hulley, Steven R Cummings, Warren S Browner, Deborah G Grady, Thomas B Newman.-4th ed. Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2013). After signing the informed consent 90 patients will be randomized to study and active-control group (45 each). Only patients undergoing classical technique (retrohepatic IVC resection) of liver transplantation without vena-venous bypass will be enrolled to the study. In the study group after completion of both caval anastomoses (super and infra-hepatic) the infra-hepatic cava-clamp is released and removed allowing the filling and flushing the liver retrogradely through the hepatic veins. 300 ml of blood is drained via donor portal vein and the vein will be clamped. Suprahepatic cava-clamp is released and removed allowing venous return to the right atrium. Portal vein anastomosis will be constructed. Before the last 2-3 stitches another 100 ml will be drained retrogradely. Recipient portal vein clamp is removed and liver will be reperfused antegradely. After that arterial and biliary anastomoses will be constructed. In the control group cava-clamps are not removed until completion the portal vein anastomosis. Chi-square test and regression analysis will be used to test the difference in incidence of early allograft liver dysfunction in the study groups. Mann-Whitney test will be used to compare the median of highest aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels 24 and 48 hours post-reperfusion.</detailed_description>
