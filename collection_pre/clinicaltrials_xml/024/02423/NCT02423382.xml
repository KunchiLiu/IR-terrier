	<brief_title>Measurement of the Retinal Oxygen Saturaiton After Long-term Silicon Oil Tamponade</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Silicone oil is the first choice treatment for long-term vitreous replacement in complicated cases of retinal detachment. However, it will cause various problems for permanent tamponade, such as keratopathy, glaucoma, cataracts, and silicone oil emulsification3. In addition, silicone oil has the potential to cause retinal toxicity. Moreover, the gravity and mechanical pressure of the silicone oil on the retina may influence retinal blood flow and, and the presence of silicone oil in the vitreous cavity may block the oxygen exchange between the retinal surface and the vitreous humor, resulting in the metabolic disturbance of the retina. In this study, the investigators utilized a noninvasive measurement (Oxymap, Reykjavik, Iceland) to evaluate the effect of silicone oil tamponade on oxygen saturation and diameter in retinal vessels in complicated retinal detachment cases.</detailed_description>
