	<brief_summary>A prospective, randomised, controlled, single-blind, multi-site clinical study employing Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) to stimulate the pelvic floor muscles of women suffering from stress urinary incontinence. Approximately one-hundred and eighty (180) female patients diagnosed with stress urinary incontinence will be enrolled in this study. All patients who are considered eligible to participate in the clinical study and give consent will be randomised to complete either a 12-week treatment programme with the Neurotech Vital Compact device or a 12-week treatment programme with the itouch Sure Pelvic Floor Exerciser. The 12-week treatment programme will be completed by the subjects at home with treatment with the device in accordance with the device Instructions for Use.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomised, controlled, single-blind, multi-site clinical study to be conducted in the United States of America (USA) employing Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) to stimulate the pelvic floor muscles of women suffering from stress urinary incontinence. Approximately one-hundred and eighty (180) female patients diagnosed with stress urinary incontinence will be enrolled in this study. All patients who are considered eligible to participate in the clinical study and give consent will be randomised to complete either a 12-week treatment programme with the Neurotech Vital Compact device or a 12-week treatment programme with the itouch Sure Pelvic Floor Exerciser. The 12-week treatment programme will be completed by the subjects at home with treatment with the device in accordance with the device Instructions for Use. Subjects included in the clinical study will be evaluated at screening, on enrolment into the study (baseline) and during the 12-week treatment programme at 4 and 12 weeks. A telephone call will be made at 1 week to check on the patient's progress. In addition, subjects will be evaluated at 26 week following their commencement of the treatment.</detailed_description>

Subjects who have previously tried and failed to improve their condition using Kegel exercises. 4. Subjects who have been clinically diagnosed with stress urinary incontinence and demonstrate a greater than or equal to 3g urine leakage and a less than or equal to 90g urine leakage (&gt;3g and &lt; 90g) following a bladderfilling protocol and then a standardised stress test (provocative pad weight test) at the baseline assessment. 5. Subjects who score 9 or less (&lt;9) out of 18 for the Urge Incontinence Questions and are confirmed as having predominant stress urinary incontinence on the Medical, Epidemiologic and Social Aspects of Aging Urinary Incontinence (MESA) Questionnaire completed at the screening assessment. 6. Subjects with a Body Mass Index of â‰¤ 35 kg/m2. 7. Subjects of childbearing potential who are using a highly effective contraceptive method (established use of oral, injected, implanted hormonal method of contraception or barrier method of contraception with spermicide). 8. Subjects who are willing not to seek any other treatment for stress incontinence during the study period. 9. Subjects who are able to give voluntary, written informed consent to participate in this study and from whom consent has been obtained. 10. Subjects who are able to understand this study and are willing to complete all the study assessments. 1. Subjects who have an existing medical condition that would compromise their participation in the study, e.g. reduced sensory perception in the contact area of the stimulation electrodes; scars or vaginal tissue wounds, lesions or inflamed/infected areas in the contact area of the stimulation electrodes; vaginal bleeding between menstrual periods; uncontrolled diabetes. 2. Subjects who have a physical condition that would make them unable to perform the study procedures, e.g. pelvic or hip surgery within the past 6 weeks. 3. Subjects who have been diagnosed with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). 4. Subjects with a history of an underlying neurological condition, e.g. Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy. 5. Subjects with any bladder abnormality that would affect the urinary flow through the lower urinary tract including signs or symptoms of an active urinary tract infection, abnormal bladder capacity (e.g., &gt;300 cc), post void residual volume &gt;200 cc, spastic bladder, vesicoureteral reflux or bladder stones. 6. Subjects with a blood clotting disorder or who are taking anticoagulant medications. 7. Subjects who have previously had any urogynaecological related surgery that would affect the pelvic floor muscles or urinary flow through the urethra (excluding hysterectomy). 8. Subjects who have previously had pelvic floor radiation. 9. Subjects who have previously been treated for stress incontinence with injectable bulking agents and/or vaginal probes within the past 6 months. 10. Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of prolapse greater than Stage 2. 11. Subjects who are pregnant or could be pregnant. 12. Subjects who are less than 6 months postpartum or who are lactating. 13. Subjects who have any conductive intrauterine devices or metal implants in the pelvic area, including hip and lumbar spine. 14. Subjects with pelvic pain or fibromyalgia or paravaginal defect. 15. Subjects with an active implanted medical device (i.e. pacemaker, insulin pump etc.) or conditions that may be adversely affected by electrical stimulation (e.g. cardiac arrhythmias). 16. Subjects with a current or active history of pelvic cancer and/or subjects with a life expectancy of less than 12 months. 17. Subjects who are currently involved in any injury litigation claims. 18. Subjects who have participated in a clinical study in the last 3 months or any previous clinical study with BioMedical Research Ltd. 19. Subjects who have been committed to an institution by virtue of an order issued either by the courts or by an authority.</criteria>
