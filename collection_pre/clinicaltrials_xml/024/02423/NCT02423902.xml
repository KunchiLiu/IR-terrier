	<brief_summary>This is a single-arm, phase Ib/II study to examine the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of one cycle of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 immunotherapy in women with advanced breast cancer and pre-study SD or PR after completion of a minimum 12 week course of standard first- or second-line chemotherapy. The patient population will include patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer of all subtypes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 With Veledimex in Subjects With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects who have PD or a CR after the standard chemotherapy are not eligible for the study. Following entry into the trial, patients will go on a treatment holiday from chemotherapy and enter an immunotherapy phase of treatment. Continuation of HER2-targeted antibody therapy is permitted during this immunotherapy phase for women with HER2+ disease. Scans will be conducted at 6 and 12 weeks after the start of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 immunotherapy to determine tumor response. Radiographic PD at week 6 must be confirmed at least 4 weeks later, either at week 12 or earlier if clinically necessitated.</detailed_description>
