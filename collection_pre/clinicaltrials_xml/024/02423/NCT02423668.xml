	<brief_title>Pseudophakic Anterior Chamber Depth Measurement in Second Eye Refinement Cataract Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A retrospective chart review was conducted, including demographics (age and gender) and several parameters for both the first and second eyes, including the intra-ocular lens power calculation using the HofferQ, SRK/T and Holladay 1 formulas. Pentacam HR was used for pseudophakic anterior chamber depth measurement, and manual measurement was performed by a single investigator tracing a line between the anterior surface of the intra-ocular lens and the central corneal epithelium apex. Second eye refinement in the intra-ocular lens power selection for the second eye was performed using a theoretical 50% partial adjustment of the prediction error of the first eye. To relate refractive outcomes to pACD values, the investigators performed subgroup analysis based in consecutive 50Âµm increments in inter-ocular asymmetry of pACD (50-600).</detailed_description>
