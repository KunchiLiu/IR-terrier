	<brief_summary>Normally, cells in human body divide in an orderly way. However in cancer cells, some important proteins, which help control cell growth, start to behave abnormally resulting in faster growth and multiplication. In this study, we are looking at a protein called AKT that helps the cancer cells to develop. Blocking the action of AKT with a drug like AZD5363 may slow down or stop the cancer growing. The development of AZD5363 is intended to provide a new treatment option for patients with cancer. The standard chemotherapy agent, Paclitaxel, is given to destroy cancer cells. AZD5363 may also make the cancer more sensitive to Paclitaxel and so make this agent more effective. A gene called PIK3CA has an important relationship with AKT. In tumours where this gene has been altered, or said to have 'mutated', the response to AZD5363 may be better. PIK3CA mutations are found commonly in breast cancers, and we will test for the presence of these mutations in both blood and tumour tissue samples that we ask you to provide. This study will also look at the relationship between tumours with PIK3CA mutations and the effect of the treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PAKT: AZD5363 in Combination With Paclitaxel in Triple-Negative Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The term triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is generally used to define tumours that do not express oestrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR) and HER2 receptors. This subtype comprises 10-15% of all breast cancers. TNBC has an aggressive clinical course, shares features with basal-like tumours, and has a poorer outcome compared with other subtypes. Clinically, TNBC's are a challenge to treat because there is no role for endocrine or HER2-directed therapy. Chemotherapy is effective, but neo-adjuvant studies have shown that despite initial chemo-sensitivity, TNBC's still had a worse outcome, particularly in women in whom a pathologically confirmed complete response was not achieved. Consequently, there is a clear need to develop specific treatment strategies for the subgroup of TNBC's both in the early and advanced disease setting. AZD5363 is a potent, selective inhibitor of the kinase activity of the serine/threonine AKT/PKB (protein kinase B) that is being developed as a potential treatment for solid and haematological malignancies. AKT is part of the AGC family of kinases. Mammalian cells express three closely related AKT isoforms: AKT1 (PKBa), AKT2 (PKBß) and AKT3 (PKBgamma), all encoded by different genes. This is a placebo-controlled, multi-centre, 2-arm randomised phase II trial of Paclitaxel + AZD5363 versus Paclitaxel + placebo in patients with triple-negative (ER-negative, PR-negative/unknown, HER2-negative) advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Patients will be randomised into either of the Arms Paclitaxel + Placebo OR Paclitaxel + AZD5363. Randomisation will be stratified by the following criteria: - Number of metastatic sites (&lt;3, =3) - (Neo)Adjuvant chemotherapy (end of (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy =12 months ago, end of (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy &gt;12 months or no prior (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy).</detailed_description>
