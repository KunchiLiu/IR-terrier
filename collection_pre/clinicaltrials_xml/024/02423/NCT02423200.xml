	<brief_summary>This study will assess the effects of VX-745 on markers of disease in the central nervous system of patients with MCI due to AD or with mild AD. The study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of VX-745 in these patients during 6 weeks of dosing, as well as the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of VX-745 during dosing.</brief_summary>
