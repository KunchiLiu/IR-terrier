	<detailed_description>This study aimed to examine the possible relationship between hand grip strength (HGS) and maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) in healthy individuals. All individuals underwent assessment of inspiratory muscle strength by maximum inspiratory pressure, and evaluation of hand grip strength. MIP was measured using a U-type water manometer calibrated in centimetre of water (cmH2O), while the HGS was measured with hydraulic hand dynamometer calibrated in Kg.</detailed_description>
