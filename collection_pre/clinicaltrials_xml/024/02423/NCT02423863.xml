	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of sequential intratumoral (IT) plus intramuscular (IM) Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid stabilized with polylysine and carboxymethylcellulose (poly-ICLC, Hiltonol®) for treatment of study subjects with advanced accessible solid tumors</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cycle 1, Weeks 1 through 8 • Weeks 1 and 2 (Days 1, 3 and 5 of each of the two weeks) study subjects receive a priming treatment course, which consists of a total of 6 IT injections of 0.5 mg Poly-ICLC into the same lesion. A pre-treatment biopsy will be on the day of the first IT injection prior to the injection. One readily accessible tumor site will be targeted for intra-tumoral injection of Poly-ICLC. - Weeks 3-5, study subjects will receive a boosting treatment course, consisting of IM injections of Poly-ICLC twice weekly. A second biopsy will be performed prior to, or within 7 days following the last injection of cycle 1. The pre-designated and injected target lesion will be biopsied. - Weeks 6-8 will be a rest period with no treatments. A third biopsy of target lesion will be performed prior to, or within 7 days of the last IT injection in cycle 2. Cycle 2, Weeks 9 through 16 - Weeks 9 and 10 study subjects receive a second priming treatment (IT injections thrice weekly 10). - Weeks 11-13 study subjects receive a boosting treatment course of 1 mg Poly-ICLC IM injections twice weekly. The second cycle IT injections may target a different metastatic site at the discretion of the investigator, but a given cycle will only target one site with repeated injections. - Weeks 14-16 will be a rest period with no treatments. If clinically indicated, as per standard of care, during week 16 study subjects may have a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis and extremities or neck to assess for response, using Immune related Response Criteria (irRC). MRI of the brain may also be obtained as part of clinical follow of their disease, as per standard of care. Study subjects who have possible progression or inflammatory pseudoprogression of disease but no significant functional decline will be kept on study at the discretion of the investigator. Cycle 3, Weeks 17 through 26 - Weeks 17 and 18 study subjects will receive a third priming treatment (IT injections thrice weekly). - Weeks 19-21 study subjects receive another boosting treatment course of 1 mg Poly-ICLC IM injections twice weekly) The third cycle IT injections may target a different metastatic site at the discretion of the investigator, but a given cycle will only target one site with repeated injections. - Weeks 22-26 will be a rest period with no treatments to allow for evaluation of response at week 26, in the absence of possible drug induced acute inflammation Maintenance Therapy Week 27 through 36 • Weeks 27 to 36 study subjects with complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) may be offered maintenance therapy with administration of 1 mg IM Poly-ICLC twice weekly. At week 36 a repeat tumor assessment, including optional tumor biopsy, will be performed. Follow up Period: • After completion of treatment subjects may be contacted by telephone twice yearly for up to 36 months to inquire on their health status (e.g., alive, dead, remission, progressive disease, on new cancer treatment). Study subjects with an initial tumor response but then long-term recurrence during the follow up period may be offered additional cycles of treatment depending on the subject's health status, costs and/or drug availability.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of one of the following: Melanoma Squamous head and neck cancer Sarcoma NonMelanoma skin cancers 2. Sarcoma Patients must be 14 years of age or older. All other patients must be 18 years of age or older. 3. Unresectable disease. Patients with resectable disease may be enrolled after having refused surgery after a documented consultation with a surgeon. 4. Disease has progressed through at least one systemic therapy or through local irradiation within the preceding 6 months. 5. Radiologically or visually measurable recurrent or metastatic disease that is measurable and at least 10mm in longest dimension. 6. At least one accessible primary or metastatic tumor site that can be readily injected IT with polyICLC with or without ultrasound guidance. This lesion can be superficial cutaneous, subcutaneous or within a readily accessible lymph node and must measure at least 10 mm in longest dimension. 7. The tumor site selected for injection cannot have been irradiated within 8 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) 8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤ 2. 9. Acceptable hematologic, renal and liver function as follows: Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1000/mm3, Platelets &gt; 50,000/mm3, Creatinine ≤ 2.5 mg/dl, Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5mg/dl, Transaminases ≤ 2 times above the upper limits of the institutional normal, INR&lt;2 (international normalized ratio) if off of anticoagulation. Patients on anticoagulation therapy with an INR&gt;2 may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator if they have not had any episodes of severe hemorrhage and if the site to be injected is not located in the oropharynx or another area where achieving homeostasis would be complicated by local anatomy. 10. Patients must be able to provide informed consent. 11. Patients with the potential for pregnancy or impregnating their partner must agree to follow acceptable birth control methods to avoid conception. Contraception must be continued for at least 2 months following the last dose of polyICLC. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test. While animal reproductive studies have been negative, the simulated viral infection and antiproliferative activity of this experimental drug may theoretically affect the developing fetus or nursing infant. 1. Serious concurrent infection or medical illness, which would jeopardize the ability of the patient to receive the treatment outlined in this protocol with reasonable safety. 2. Bulky intracranial metastatic disease with shift of midline structures or progressive brain metastasis such that ongoing therapy for these brain metastasis is required at the time of enrollment. 3. In the opinion of the local PI: Head and neck cancer patients with airway tumor recurrence that may compromise breathing or swallowing if inflammation or edema is transiently aggravated by Hiltonol injection. Head and neck cancer patients with tumor invading major blood vessels for whom there may be a risk of blockage or bleeding if inflammation or edema is transiently increased by Hiltonol injections. 4. AIDS defined as a CD4 (cluster of differentiation 4) count less then 200 in the context of HIV seropositivity or chronically is taking immunosuppressive medication such as steroids or transplant related medications. 5. Life expectancy of less than 6 months in the judgment of the study physician. 6. Persistent toxicity from recent therapy that has not sufficiently resolved in the judgment of the study physician. 7. History of active immunotherapy in the previous month.</criteria>
