	<brief_summary>The daily requirement of threonine, an essential amino acid, will be evaluated in healthy adult males and in adult males with Crohn's Disease or ulcerative colitis using the indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) method. Participants will consume specially formulated diets with varying levels of threonine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Threonine Requirement in IBD Adults and Healthy Adult Controls</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Threonine is an essential amino acid which must be obtained from the diet. It is a component of mucin. Mucin, in turn, is a key protein in the mucous membrane that protects the lining of the intestine. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of inflammatory conditions that affect the colon and small intestine. IBD primarily includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). In UC, the inflammation is usually in the colon whereas in CD inflammation may occur anywhere along the digestive tract. Studies in animals have shown that more threonine is used when there is inflammation in the intestine. The threonine requirement in healthy participants and in IBD patients will be determined using the indicator amino acid oxidation method. The requirement derived in healthy participants will be compared to that derived in patients with IBD. Each participant will take part in two x 3 day study periods. The first two days are called adaptation days where the subjects will consume a liquid diet specially designed for him. The diet will be consumed at home. It contains all vitamins, minerals, protein and all other nutrients required. On the third day, the participant will come to the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. Subjects will consume hourly meals for a total of 8 meals and a stable isotope 13C-phenylalanine. Breath and urine samples will be collected to measure the oxidation of phenylalanine from which the threonine requirement will be determined.</detailed_description>

Sinai Hospital, Toronto. Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis Uncontrolled inflammation which will likely require surgery or escalation of therapy in the next 4 weeks Concomitant treatment:corticosteroids &gt; 20mg/day Subject who cannot be expected to comply with the study procedures.
