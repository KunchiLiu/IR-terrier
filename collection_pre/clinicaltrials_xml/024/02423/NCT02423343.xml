	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the study drug known as galunisertib in combination with nivolumab in participants with advanced refractory solid tumors and in recurrent or refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or glioblastoma.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>For Phase 1b, must have advanced refractory solid tumors in any line of therapy. In the Phase 2 if fewer than 3 NSCLC, HCC or glioblastoma participants are not included in the Phase 1b, then a safety runin must occur for any of the cohorts that have fewer than 3 participants in Phase 1. For Phase 2, must have one of the following tumor types: recurrent or refractory NSCLC (any histology), HCC with elevated alphafetoprotein (AFP) â‰¥200 nanogram/milliliter (ng/mL), or glioblastoma (primary). For Phase 2 only, have had disease progression or be refractory or intolerant to 1 prior line of therapy (first line therapy) for recurrent or refractory for NSCLC, HCC or glioblastoma and have refused currently approved secondline therapy. First line therapy is defined as therapy used to treat advanced disease. This may include multiple chemotherapeutic, targeted or immunotherapeutic agents with or without radiation therapy and/or surgery. Each subsequent line of therapy is preceded by disease progression. A switch of an agent within the same drug class (eg, cisplatinum to carboplatinum) within a regimen in order to manage toxicity does not define the start of a new line of therapy. For NSCLC: Prior lines of therapy must include a platinumbased therapy. Investigational agents used in combination with standard therapies are allowed. Participants who received platinumbased neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy and subsequently received platinumbased therapy as firstline therapy are eligible. Participants who have completed neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy with a platinum doublet and have experienced disease recurrence within 6 months of completing the platinum doublet are eligible. Tumors with driver mutations (epidermal growth factor receptor mutation positive or anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion oncogene positive) treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor or crizotinib are eligible. For participants who have progressed on a tyrosine kinase inhibitor or crizotinib or are intolerant to this targeted therapy, that participant must receive platinumbased therapy prior to enrollment in this study. Documentation of such mutations must be available and entered into the electronic case report form (eCRF). Maintenance or switch maintenance therapy after firstline chemotherapy will be considered part of the firstline regimen and is acceptable. Participants who completed and progressed on a platinumcontaining regimen as adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or part of a course of chemoradiation therapy given from locally advanced disease and developed recurrent (local or metastatic) disease within the 6 months before screening would be counted as having received 1 prior platinumcontaining regimen and therefore would not require retreatment with a platinumcontaining regimen for Stage IIIB, IV, or recurrent disease and are eligible. However, participants must have received at least 2 cycles of a platinum doublet based chemotherapy before discontinuation for toxicity. If participants received only one cycle of a platinum doublet and discontinue due to clear progression, that regimen should be counted as a prior line of therapy. For HCC: One prior line of therapy which must include sorafenib or participant must have progressed or been intolerant to sorafenib for participants not eligible for transarterial chemoembolization. Participants who had sorafenib for locally advanced disease or are intolerant to sorafenib are eligible. Participants may have had clinical progression only following sorafenib or local therapy. Must have ChildPugh A only. Participants may have any viral status (hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or none). Have a viral load &lt;100 international units/milliliter (IU/mL). For hepatitis B participants, must be on a nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (lamivudine, telbivudine, adefovir, tenofovir, or entecavir). For Glioblastoma (GB): Previous first line of therapy with at least radiotherapy and temozolomide except for participants with O6methylguanineDNA methyltransferase (MGMT) unmethylated newly diagnosed GB. Participants with MGMT unmethylated newly diagnosed GB may have received radiation therapy only. Have adequate organ function. Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale. Use an approved contraceptive method. Have moderate or severe cardiovascular disease: Have the presence of cardiac disease, including a myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to study entry, unstable angina pectoris, New York Heart Association Class III/IV congestive heart failure, or uncontrolled hypertension. Have documented major electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities which are clinically significant at the investigator's discretion (for example, symptomatic or sustained atrial or ventricular arrhythmias, second or thirddegree atrioventricular block, bundlebranch blocks, ventricular hypertrophy, or recent myocardial infarction). Have major abnormalities documented by Echocardiogram with Doppler (for example, moderate or severe heart valve function defect and/or left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;50%, evaluation based on the institutional lower limit of normal). Have predisposing conditions that are consistent with development of aneurysms of the ascending aorta or aortic stress (for example, personal history of aneurysm in any location, family history of aneurysms in any location, MarfanSyndrome, bicuspid aortic valve, evidence of damage to the large vessels of the heart documented by computed tomography [CT] scan/magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] with contrast). Have evidence of interstitial lung disease that is symptomatic or may interfere with the detection or management of suspected drugrelated pulmonary toxicity or active, noninfectious pneumonitis.</criteria>
