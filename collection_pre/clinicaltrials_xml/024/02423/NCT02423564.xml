Any nongastrointestinal disease/complication that, in the investigator's opinion, may affect subject safety or confound the evaluation of the study endpoints Immunodeficiency (i.e. HIV positive, rheumatoid arthritis, history of organ transplant) Clinically significant abnormal laboratory results at screening (e.g. AST and/or ALT &gt; 2 x ULN, and/or bilirubin &gt; 2 x ULN; serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 x ULN; hemoglobin &lt; 140 g/L for males and &lt; 123 g/L for females) Abdominal or perineal surgery within 6 months of randomization Subjects who plan on engaging in anal intercourse during the runin or treatment periods of the trial.
