	<brief_summary>Many devices are available for nebulising drug solution during invasive mechanical ventilation. Vibrating-mesh nebulizers ensure the highest lung deposition output. A recent international survey on aerosol therapy during mechanical ventilation (Ehrmann et al. 2013) reported that jet nebulizers remained the mostly used. The aim of this study is to compare lung deposition of a radiolabeled administered with both nebulizers during invasive mechanical ventilation by planar scintigraphy.</brief_summary>
