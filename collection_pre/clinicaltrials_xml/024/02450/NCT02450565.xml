	<brief_summary>Neuropathic pain, described as 'pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease on the somatosensory system', affects up to 3-9.8% of the investigators' population, but is often underdiagnosed and undertreated. As treatment is different for patients with neuropathic pain and nociceptive pain, it is important to screen for neuropathic pain. Commonly employed questionnaire-based diagnostic tools in English speaking countries include the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs pain scale (LANSS) and Neuropathic pain questionnaire (NPQ). Self-completed LANSS is particularly useful as it is not restricted to clinician's examination and can be applied in large-scale research. S-LANSS has been successfully translated, validated and used successfully in Arabic and Turkish, but it has not been utilised in the Chinese population. As verbal translations of the English questionnaires used at the bedside may be prone to errors in interpretation and requires medical practitioners to interpret the questions. Therefore a translation and validation study is essential.</brief_summary>
