	<brief_summary>The purpose of this non-inferiority trial is to determine the clinical efficacy of acellular dermal matrix (ADM) in the augmentation of the gum around dental implants as compared to an autologous gum graft (sCTG) obtained from the palate (roof of the mouth) in human adults. AlloDerm is regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as human tissue for transplantation. AlloDerm is processed and marketed in accordance with the FDA's requirements for banked human tissue (21 CFR, Part 1270 and Part 1271) and Standards for Tissue Banking of the American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB). 20 adult subjects will be recruited who are in need of dental implant placement with simultaneous gum grafting to increase the thickness of the facial mucosa. Half of the subjects will be randomized to the ADM group and half will be randomized to the sCTG group. The surgical intervention will be performed according to the protocol and subjects will return for follow-up 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks post-surgery for follow-up measurements of healing, gum thickness, subject perception of pain, and esthetic photographs.</brief_summary>
