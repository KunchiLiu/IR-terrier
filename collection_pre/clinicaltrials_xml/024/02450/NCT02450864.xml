	<brief_summary>Investigators recent data showed anti-inflammatory effect of Effect of Extracorporeal Shockwave Technology (ESWT). Little studies focused on the effect and pathomechanism of ESWT on shoulder stiffness.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Biological Effect of ESWT and the Role of Proinflammatory Cytokines and Cannabinoid Receptor in Shoulder Stiffness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. First year:Investigators intend to further delineate the inflammatory mechanism, such as IL-1Î², CB1, HSP in the incidence of shoulder stiffness. 2. Second year: Investigators intend to conduct a prospective randomized double-blind study for the clinical effect of ESWT on patients with shoulder stiffness. 3. Third year: Investigators wish to test the biologic effect of ESWT on patients with shoulder stiffness and to elucidate the molecular mechanism for this effect through a randomized comparative study.</detailed_description>
