	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of Spinal Cord Stimulation in Heart Failure Patients With Depressed Left Ventricular Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be randomized (1:1) for spinal cord stimulation as an addition to optimal guidelines-driven management or to control group on optimal management only. Spinal cord stimulation will be performed for 30 days, and outcome measures will be testes before stimulation, after 30 days stimulation and after 30 days of further follow-up. The control group will be studied at baseline and after 30 days only.</detailed_description>
