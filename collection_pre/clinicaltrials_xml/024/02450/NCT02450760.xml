	<brief_summary>The goal of this pilot project is to assess adherence with home blood pressure monitoring in hypertensive patients with a history of cerebral infarction and to determine if a social incentive improves adherence with monitoring. Enrolled subjects will all have a history of cerebral infarction and uncontrolled blood pressure, defined by SBP&gt;140 or DBP&gt;90 mm Hg at the time of enrollment. To be eligible subjects will also be required to own a smart phone (iOS or Android operating system). After enrollment, patients will be given a home blood pressure cuff with instructions to monitor their BP twice daily for 90 days. Subjects will be randomly assigned to a social incentive program, in which a social supporter receives updates via email and/or text message on the subject's adherence with BP monitoring and their average blood pressure. This study will provide important pilot data which will inform the design of future studies utilizing connected health and automated systems to improve home blood pressure monitoring and blood pressure control in patients with a history of stroke.</brief_summary>
