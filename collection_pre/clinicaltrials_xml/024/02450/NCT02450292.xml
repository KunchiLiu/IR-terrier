	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Ages 1850 Patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction performed by one of the study investigators at least 5 years ago Isolated ACL tear Type of graft used was bonepatellar tendonbone autograft Type of screw used to attach graft to the tibia and/or femur was a BioComposite interference screws (Arthrex, Inc.) No degenerative joint disease on preoperative Xrays (&gt; 50% joint space loss, presence of osteophytes) Revision ACL reconstructions Types of grafts other than bonepatellar tendonbone autograft were used ACL tear with concomitant pathology Degenerative joint disease on preoperative Xray (&gt; 50% joint space loss, presence of osteophytes) Metal or other types of bioabsorbable screws other than BioComposite interference screws (Arthrex, Inc.) were used ACL reconstruction performed less than 5 years ago Pregnancy Greater than Grade 2 laxity of other ligaments No additional fixation</criteria>
