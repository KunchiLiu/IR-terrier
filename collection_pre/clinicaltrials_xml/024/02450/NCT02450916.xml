	<brief_summary>Objective: In addition to physical discomforts, work-related injuries and illnesses often result in various forms of hardships, including economic hardship, labor conflicts and legal disputes. The physical and psychological health conditions are likely to be worsen when the social supporting systems are not well functioning. In this study, the investigators aim to conduct in-depth interviews with injured workers to study their experiences with the social systems, including employment protection system, workers' compensation system, health care system and other social welfare systems, and to explore how the systems may affect workers' physical and psychological health. Methods: Face-to-face interviews will be conducted with a semi-structured questionnaire. Subjects who had ever experienced work-related injuries or diseases (including muscular skeletal disorders and work-related cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases) over the past 3 years are invited. The investigators anticipate to recruit a total of 60~100 cases, whom will be recruited through the assistance of occupational physicians, occupational health centers, labor groups and unions. Interview time will be limited to 1 hour. Anticipated results and contribution: Findings of this study will help to advance our knowledge concerning the functions of current social systems and the hardships of workers who suffer from work-related injuries and diseases. Suggestions will be provided for the improvements of current systems. Keywords: work-related injury, occupational disease, workers' compensation, psychological, policy.</brief_summary>
