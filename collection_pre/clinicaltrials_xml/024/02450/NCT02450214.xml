	<brief_summary>Lipoabdominoplasty and liposuction are one of the most common plastic surgeries. The management of postoperative pain is complex. Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) are insufficient, while opioids are avoided by their adverse effects and regional techniques are hampered by a premature discharge. In this context, the investigators seek an intraoperative multimodal analgesic technique blocking NMDA receptors with ketamine plus magnesium to significantly decrease postoperative pain.</brief_summary>
