	<brief_summary>This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the ALK inhibitor LDK378 when used as single agent in patients with ALK-rearranged stage IIIB or IV NSCLC previously treated with alectinib. Treatment with LDK378 750 mg qd will continue until the patient experiences disease progression as determined by the investigator according to RECIST 1.1, unacceptable toxicity that precludes further treatment, pregnancy, start of a new anticancer therapy, discontinues treatment at the discretion of the patient or investigator, lost to follow-up, death, or study is terminated by Sponsor.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of Stage IIIb or IV NSCLC that carries an ALK rearrangement as determined locally by Vysis ALK Break Apart FISH Probe Kit (Abbott Molecular Inc.) test. Patients must have NSCLC that has progressed at study enrollment. Patients must have received previous treatment with alectinib for treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Prior therapy with crizotinib as ALK inhibitor therapy in addition to alectinib is allowed. Alectinib doesn't need to be the last therapy prior to study enrollment. No particular sequence of prior alectinib and crizotinib is required for enrollment. Patients must be chemotherapyna√Øve or have received only one line of prior cytotoxic chemotherapy. Age 18 years or older at the time of informed consent. Patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the excipients of LDK378. Prior therapy with other ALK inhibitor investigational agents except crizotinib and alectinib. Prior systemic anticancer (including investigational) therapy aside from alectinib, crizotinib and one regimen of previous cytotoxic chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Patients with symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases who are neurologically unstable or have required increasing doses of steroids within the 2 weeks prior to study entry to manage CNS symptoms. Patient with history of interstitial lung disease or interstitial pneumonitis, including clinically significant radiation pneumonitis. Ptients with history of carcinomatous meningitis. Patient with a concurrent malignancy or history of a malignant disease other than NSCLC that has been diagnosed and/or required therapy within the past 3 years. Patient has clinically significant, uncontrolled heart disease and/or recent cardiac event (within 6 months) Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
