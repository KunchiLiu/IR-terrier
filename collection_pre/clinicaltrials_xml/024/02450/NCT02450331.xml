	<brief_summary>This Phase III, open-label, randomized, multicenter study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant treatment with atezolizumab compared with observation in participants with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma (UC) who are at high risk for recurrence following resection. Eligible participants will be randomized by a 1:1 ratio into atezolizumab group or control group.</brief_summary>
