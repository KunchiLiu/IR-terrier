	<brief_title>Study to Determine the Antibody Response to 500µg G17DT in Treatment of Patients With Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Another study, GC2, initiated prior to the start of this study investigated the appropriate dose and dosing schedule for G17DT in patients with Stage I-III gastric cancer. The highest dose tested in the GC2 study was 250µg. This dose was well tolerated but was not considered sufficiently immunogenic. Since tolerability had not constrained dosing up to 250µg, the GC5 study was designed to investigate a 500µg dose administered as a regimen of 0, 2, and 6 weeks.</detailed_description>
