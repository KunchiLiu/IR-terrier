	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death of dialysis patients and poor fluid management is associated with the increased risk. One of the principal limitations in avoiding chronic fluid overload in this patient group is the refilling rate the rate at which fluid is transferred from tissues into the vascular system. If this rate cannot match the prescribed rate of fluid removal during dialysis the patient will end up with chronic fluid overload. Two proposed methods of increasing the rate of refilling are intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices, which increase the pressure of the fluid in tissue, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) which activates the muscle pump and lymphatic drainage. This investigation will trial the use of these two methods in patients suspected of having inadequate refilling rates. Outcome measures will be based on fluid status, presence of oedema and quality of life.</brief_summary>
