	<brief_summary>Subjects with confirmed diagnosis of Irritable Bowel Syndrome will be blinded and randomly assigned to one of two groups, the low FODMAP diet or the conventional IBS diet group. They will be referred to do three hydrogen breath tests prior to diet education. Upon completion, subjects will attend dietitian consultations at Week 0, 6 and 10 for diet assessment, education and reinforcement. At Week 4 and 8, dietitians will telephone patients to check on diet compliance and answer any diet question. Two sets of questionnaires, the IBS Global Improvement Scale and the IBSQOL will be given to patients to complete before each dietitian visit at week 0, 6 and 10. Two sample t-test and Chi square test will be used to test the difference between the two groups and the association between breath tests results and responds to the two diets.</brief_summary>
