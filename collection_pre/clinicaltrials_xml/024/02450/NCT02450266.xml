	<brief_summary>Patients will be submitted to a multiparametric MRI examination of the prostate. Subsequently, all participants will be randomized (1:1) into both study arms. In study arm A patients will be submitted to the gold-standard which comprises systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy. In study arm B patients will be submitted to targeted prostate biopsy based on the multiparametric MRI findings.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing MRI/Ultrasound Fusion-guided Prostate Biopsy Versus Systematic Transrectal Ultrasound-guided Biopsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In men with previously negative prostate biopsy and persistent elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value, it is unclear which biopsy strategy offers the highest detection rate for significant prostate cancer. The hypothesis of this study is that targeted MRI/ultrasound fusion-guided biopsy improves the detection rates of significant prostate cancers compared with systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy. Men with at least one previously negative transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy and persistently elevated PSA values (&gt; 3 ng/ml) or PSA velocity &gt;0.75 ng/ml/p.a. will be submitted to a multiparametric MRI examination of the prostate. Subsequently, all participants will be randomized (1:1) into both study arms. In study arm A patients will be submitted to the gold-standard which comprises systematic transrectal ultrasound--guided prostate biopsy. In study arm B patients will be submitted to targeted prostate biopsy based on the multiparametric MRI findings. Targeted biopsies will be performed using MRI/ultrasound fusion-guided.</detailed_description>
