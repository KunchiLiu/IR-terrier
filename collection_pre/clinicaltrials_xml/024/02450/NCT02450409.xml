	<brief_summary>Beside the current standard of classical mechanical alignment of total knee replacements, increased interest is being shown in anatomical alignment. However, no surgical technique is capable of controlling the stability of the joint in midflexion. The purpose of the present study was to present and evaluate a new surgical technique, which aims to reduce the need for soft-tissue release and optimize stability in midflexion.</brief_summary>
