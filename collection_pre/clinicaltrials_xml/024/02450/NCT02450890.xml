	<brief_title>Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of ORADUR®-Methylphenidate in Children and Adolescents With ADHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase III, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, two-way cross-over study aims to observe the efficacy and safety of ORADUR®-Methylphenidate in children and adolescents with ADHD age 6 to 18 years old. The study is comprised of four main phases: a screening period lasting about 14 days, an open-label titration period lasting 2 to 4 weeks, a double-blind and placebo controlled two-way cross-over study period of 4 weeks (2 weeks for Period 1 and 2 weeks for Period 2), then a follow-up phase of 2 weeks. Screening baseline is defined as Day 0 (Visit 2). At the last day of the titration period (Day 14 for 22 mg, Day 21 for 33 mg group, and Day 28 for 44 mg group), subjects will be randomly assigned to receive ORADUR®-Methylphenidate at their optimal dose or placebo at a 1:1 ratio according to the randomization scheme during each study period (Period 1 and Period 2) at treatment phase; no washout period will be included between two treatment periods.</detailed_description>

Both subjects and parents/guardians have provided their signed and dated informed consent form for the study. Main exclusion criteria: 1.

By investigator's evaluation, subjects are very anxious, tense or agitated. 3. Subjects known to be allergic to any ORADUR®methylphenidate ingredients. 4. Subjects with an estimated intelligence quotient (IQ) &lt; 80. 5. Subjects are taking a concomitant medication (ex: Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI)) that is likely to interfere with safe administration of methylphenidate within 14 day prior to the study treatment initiation. 6. Subjects are joining other clinical studies and receiving any other investigational medical products within 30 days prior to the study treatment initiation. 7. Subjects have glaucoma (narrow angle glaucoma), ongoing seizure disorder, or other psychotic disorder. 8. Subjects have chronic tics, Tourette's syndrome, or a family history of Tourette's syndrome. 9. Subjects have clinically significant gastrointestinal problems, including narrowing of the gastrointestinal tract. 10. Subjects/caregivers are (in the case of subjects whose parents/caregivers were to fill out the study questionnaires) with drug or alcohol abuse/dependence within the prior 6 months. 11. By the investigators' discretion, subjects with serious or unstable medical illness that will interfere with the evaluations of study efficacy and safety. 12. In the investigators' opinion, subjects cannot understand or follow the instructions given in the study. 13. Psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and followup schedule.</criteria>
