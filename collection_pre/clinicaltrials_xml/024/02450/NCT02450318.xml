	<brief_title>Acute Vascular Response to Exercise in Women With Nonobstructive Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women are more likely to have nonobstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) . The purpose of this study is to examine the acute effect of exercise on vascular function in women with nonobstructive coronary artery disease. Endothelium-dependent and -independent dilation, arterial stiffness and wave reflection will be measured at baseline and after walking on a treadmill at a slow pace for 47 minutes. Endothelium-dependent dilation will be measured using brachial artery flow-mediated dilation via high resolution ultrasonography. Endothelium-independent dilation will be measured using brachial artery dilation to sublingual nitroglycerin. Arterial stiffness and wave reflection will measured using applanation tonometry.</detailed_description>
