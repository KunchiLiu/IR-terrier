	<brief_title>Atripla to Stribild Switch Study to Evaluate Sleep Disturbances</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stribild is a preferred regimen in the Department of Health and Human Services guidelines and has demonstrated non-inferiority to Atripla in treatment na√Øve patients out to 144 weeks (GS-102). Stribild also has statistically significant less Central Nervous System side effects, sleep disturbances and lipid elevations compared to Atripla. This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, changes in Central Nervous System abnormalities and sleep disorders following a switch from virologically suppressed subjects on Atripla to Stribild.</detailed_description>
