	<detailed_description>The study will include obtaining baseline measurements before the season begins in a subset of athletes. Injured athletes will be studied during the season at time of injury, and then longitudinally weeks after injury. Matched controls will be tested following the same schedule as the injured athletes. A pool of contact and non-contact athletes will obtain a baseline measurement prior to the season and then after the season has ended. The study is designed to populate a large database of electrophysiological and clinical data from collegiate athletes.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ConcussionInjury subjects will be defined as follows: Any player who, based on independent clinical impression, is suspected of having suffered a concussion of any severity level, and on whom a routine clinical examination for concussion or head injury would have been conducted prior to implementation of this research protocol according to current standard practice. 1. If loss of consciousness, total duration less than &lt;20 minutes 2. No evidence of abnormality visible on Computerized Tomography (CT) of the head related to the traumatic event (Note: neuroimaging is not required for enrollment) 3. No hospital admission due to either head injury or collateral injuries for &gt;24 hours. 1. Evidence of illicit drug usage 2. Do not speak or read English 3. Current CNS active prescription medications, with the exception of medications being taken for the treatment of Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) 4. Skull abnormalities, e.g. metal plate 5. history of brain surgery or neurological disease.</criteria>
