	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Efficacy and Safety Study of TAK-063 in Participants With an Acute Exacerbation of Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-063. TAK-063 is being tested to treat people who have schizophrenia. This study will look at the different symptoms associated with schizophrenia including cognitive symptoms, personal and social functioning and functional capacity in people who take TAK-063. The study will enroll approximately 160 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groupsâ€”which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need): - TAK-063 20 mg - Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient. All participants will be asked to take the tablets once daily at nighttime. All participants will initially receive TAK-063, 20 mg/day. The dose may be titrated down to 10 mg/day, if intolerable. The multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study is 6 weeks. Participants will be hospitalized until the Week 3 visit. Participants will make 11 visits to the clinic during the treatment and 1 visit during the follow-up.</detailed_description>
