	<brief_summary>Experts believe that increasing the low uptake of screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) requires educating patients about all approved tests and helping them choose one that fits their preferences. As one motto puts it: "The best test is the one that gets done." Screening tests range from more invasive and very sensitive for polyps and cancer (colonoscopy) to less invasive and less sensitive (e.g., fecal immunochemical testing (FIT)). But it is unclear how best to educate patients about the options and the tradeoffs involved. Some guidelines recommend that decision aids, a promising tool in this area, provide patients with detailed quantitative information, including baseline risk, risk reduction, and chance of negative outcomes. But this sort of "comparative effectiveness" data can confuse patients, especially those with limited mathematical ability. Previous studies have not measured the effect of providing quantitative information to patients with varying levels of ability or interest or asked them whether such data is essential for their decision-making. The investigators will conduct a clinical trial to determine the impact on patients who view a decision aid (DA) that includes quantitative information versus a DA without such data. The investigators will also seek to determine whether numeracy moderates the effect of quantitative information.</brief_summary>
