	<brief_summary>A Phase I study of BPX-501 T cell infusion in adults with recurrent or minimal residual disease (MRD) hematologic malignancies post-allogeneic transplant. The treatment consists of increasing doses of BPX-501 T cell infusions to achieve a clinical response. AP1903 will be investigated for the treatment of aGvHD after BPX-501 T cell infusion to determine a dose that can mitigate GvHD and preserve the graft-versus tumor effect.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Gene Modified Donor T Cell Infusion in Patients With Recurrent Disease After Allogeneic Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Un-manipulated donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) is used after stem cell transplantation to treat and prevent relapse, to prevent infections and to establish full donor chimerism. The addition of mature T cells which exhibit a broad repertoire of T cell immunity against viral antigens, as well as against cancer antigens, might provide a clinical benefit. However, an expected side effect of the presence of mature T cells is the potential occurrence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD). The use of a suicide gene switch which would trigger the initiation of the apoptosis of the alloreactive T cells by the infusion of a drug would represent the potential optimal strategy for restoring early immunity with a built in "safety switch" against GvHD side effects. Evidence has emerged that low-dose DLI followed by dose escalation can achieve higher clinical response rate with lower GvHD occurrence. Optimization of DLI dose and schedule as well as strategies of donor T-cell manipulation may lead to the consistent ability to separate GvHD from GvT (graft-versus-tumor) activity and improve the safety of DLI treatment. Our strategy is to infuse escalating doses of manipulated T cells (from the same donor who provided the original hematopoietic stem cell graft) in adults with recurrent or minimal residual disease (MRD) hematologic malignancies post-allogeneic transplant to accelerate immune reconstitution thus improving graft versus leukemic effect while reducing the severity of GvHD.</detailed_description>

Other highrisk hematologic malignancies eligible for stem cell transplantation per institutional standard 2. Recurrent disease that presents &gt;100 days after, or minimal residual disease (MRD) that presents &gt; 30 days after either: 1. Matched related HSCT 2. Mismatched related HSCT 3. Life expectancy &gt;10 weeks; 4. Signed donor and patient/guardian informed consent; 5. A minimum genotypic identical match of 4/8 is required, as determined by high resolution typing, at least one allele of each of the following genetic loci: HLAA, HLAB, HLACw, and HLA DRB1. 6. Performance status: Karnofsky/Lansky score &gt; 50%. 7. Subjects with adequate organ function as measured by: 1. Bone marrow: &gt; 25% donor Tcell chimerism in peripheral blood, obtained after 3 weeks posttransplant; ANC &gt;1 x 10E9/L 2. Cardiac: left ventricular ejection fraction at rest must be ≥ 45% 3.
