	<brief_title>A Prospective, Multi-Center, Pivotal Study to Evaluate the Safety and Effectiveness of the NovaCross™ Micro-catheter in Facilitating Crossing Chronic Total Occlusion (CTO) Coronary Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the NovaCross™ micro-catheter when used to facilitate crossing of Chronic Total Occlusion (CTO) lesions in coronary arteries. The procedure will be conducted on consenting patients diagnosed with a CTO in a coronary vessel that requires revascularization after a previously failed attempt to cross or refractory to 10 minutes of conventional guidewire attempt.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Adult aged 2580 Patient understands and has signed the study informed consent form. Patient has an angiographic documented Chronic Total Occlusion (i.e. &gt;3 months occlusion duration) showing distal TIMI flow 0.

Current participation in another study with any investigational drug or device. Patient is known or suspected not to tolerate the contrast agent. Aortaostial CTO location (Ostial bifurcation origins may be considered), SVG CTO, instent CTO. Intolerance to Aspirin and/or inability to tolerate a second antiplatelet agent (Clopidogrel and Prasugrel and Ticagrelor). Appearance of a fresh thrombus or intraluminal filling defects. Recent major cerebrovascular event (history of stroke or TIA within 1 month) Cardiac intervention within 4 weeks of the procedure Renal insufficiency (serum creatinine of &gt; 2.3mg/dl or 203μmol/L) Active gastrointestinal bleeding Active infection or fever that may be due to infection Life expectancy &lt; 2 years due to other illnesses Significant anemia (hemoglobin &lt; 8.0 mg / dl) Severe uncontrolled systemic hypertension (&gt; 240 mmHg within 1 month of procedure) Severe electrolyte imbalance Congestive heart failure [New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III\IV] CSA Class IV.
