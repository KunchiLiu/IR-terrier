I4. Patient who has completed prior to randomization first line platinumtaxane chemotherapy: 1. Platinumtaxane based regimen must have consisted of a minimum of 6 treatment cycles and a maximum of 9. However if platinum based therapy must be discontinued early as a result of non hematological toxicity specifically related to the platinum regimen, (i.e. neurotoxicity, hypersensitivity etc.), patient must have received a minimum of 4 cycles of the platinum regimen. 2. Intravenous, intraperitoneal, or neoadjuvant platinum based chemotherapy is allowed; for weekly therapy, three weeks are considered one cycle. Interval debulking is allowed. I5. Patient must have received prior to randomization a minimum of 3 cycles of bevacizumab in combination with the 3 last cycles of platinumbased chemotherapy. Only in case of interval debulking surgery, it is allowed to realize only 2 cycles of bevacizumab in combination with the last 3 cycles of platiniumbased chemotherapy. Bevacizumab treatment should be administered at a dose 15mg/kg q3 weeks up to a total of 15 months. I6. Patient must be prior to randomization without evidence of disease (NED) or in complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) from her first line treatment. There should be no clinical evidence of disease progression (physical exam, imagery, CA 125) throughout her first line treatment and prior to study randomization. I7. Patient must be randomized at least 3 weeks and no more than 9 weeks after her last dose of chemotherapy (last dose is the day of the last infusion) and all major toxicities from the previous chemotherapy must have resolved to CTC AE grade 1 or better (except alopecia and peripheral neuropathy). I8. Patient must have normal organ and bone marrow function: 1. Hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL. 2. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L. 3. Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L. 4. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN). 5. Aspartate aminotransferase /Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (ASAT/SGOT)) and Alanine aminotransferase /Serum Glutamic Pyruvate Transaminase (ALAT/SGPT)) ≤ 2.5 x ULN, unless liver metastases are present in which case they must be ≤ 5 x ULN. 6. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.25 x institutional ULN and creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/min. 7. Patient not receiving anticoagulant medication who has an International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤1.5 and an Activated ProThrombin Time (aPTT) ≤1.5 x ULN. The use of fulldose oral or parenteral anticoagulants is permitted as long as the INR or APTT is within therapeutic limits (according to site medical standard). If the patient is on oral anticoagulants, dose has to be stable for at least two weeks at the time of randomization. 8. Urine dipstick for proteinuria &lt; 2+. If urine dipstick i s ≥2+, 24hour urine must demonstrate &lt;1 g of protein in 24 hours. 9. Normal blood pressure or adequately treated and controlled hypertension (systolic BP ≤ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≤ 90 mmHg). I9. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 01. I10. Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor sample from the primary cancer must be available for central BRCA testing and test result must be available for stratification. I11. Postmenopausal or evidence of nonchildbearing status for women of childbearing potential prior to the first dose of study treatment. (see appendix 4) I12. For France only: In France, a subject will be eligible for randomization in this study only if either affiliated to, or a beneficiary of, a social security category. E1. Nonepithelial origin of the ovary, the fallopian tube or the peritoneum (i.e. germ cell tumors). E2. Ovarian tumors of low malignant potential (e.g. borderline tumors), or mucinous carcinoma. E3. Patient with synchronous primary endometrial cancer unless both of the following criteria are met: 1. stage &lt; II, 2. Less than 60 years old at the time of diagnosis of endometrial cancer with stage IA or IB grade 1 or 2, or stage IA grade III endometrioid adenocarcinoma OR ≥ 60 years old at the time of diagnosis of endometrial cancer with stage IA grade 1 or 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Patient with serous or clear cell adenocarcinoma or carcinosarcoma of the endometrium is not eligible. E4. Other malignancy within the last 5 years except: adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer curatively treated in situ cancer of the cervix, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Patient with a history of localized malignancy diagnosed over 5 years ago may be eligible provided she completed her adjuvant systemic therapy prior to randomization and that the patient remains free of recurrent or metastatic disease. Patient with history of primary triple negative breast cancer may be eligible provided she completed her definitive anticancer treatment more than 3 years ago and she remains breast cancer disease free prior to start of study treatment. E5. Patient with myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia history E6. Patient having experienced for at least one cycle, a delay &gt; 2 weeks due to prolonged hematological recovery during the first line chemotherapy E7.
