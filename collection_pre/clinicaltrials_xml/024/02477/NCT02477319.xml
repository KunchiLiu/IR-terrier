	<brief_title>A Two-Part Multicenter Prospective Longitudinal Study of CFTR-dependent Disease Profiling in Cystic Fibrosis (PROSPECT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. Over 1,900 mutations, categorized into five genotypic or functional classes are implicated in causing CF. Severity of disease varies widely in CF based on CFTR-dependent and independent factors. Progressive obstructive lung disease is the main determinant of morbidity and mortality in CF; therefore it is critical to identify biomarker profiles that reflect and predict this phenotypic variability, and understand their relationship to residual CFTR activity. Emerging CFTR modulator therapies that directly target defective CFTR are being evaluated in pivotal clinical trials and may become available in the next few years. It is not known how partial restoration of CFTR function might impact CF disease progression and disease-related biomarkers. Thus there is urgent need to i) identify and validate biomarkers that might reflect partial restoration of CFTR function and can be used to monitor disease progression, and ii) evaluate the mechanistic effects of CFTR modulators and other relevanttherapies in individuals with CF</detailed_description>

To participate in the optional DNA banking component of this study, subject must have signed the informed consent indicating willingness to participate in the genomic component of the study. Refusal to give consent for this component does not exclude a subject from participation in the study. Inclusion Cohorts 23 1.

To participate in the optional DNA banking component of this study, subject must have signed the informed consent indicating willingness to participate in the genomic component of the study. Refusal to give consent for this component does not exclude a subject from participation in the study Part B Inclusion 1.
