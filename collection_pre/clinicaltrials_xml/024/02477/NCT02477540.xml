	<brief_title>A Safety and Efficacy Study of Autologous Bone Marrow Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Critical Limb Ischemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If the participant voluntarily agrees to participate in the clinical trial before registration, the investigator conducts a screening test to evaluate the participant's suitability. A participant that satisfies all inclusion and exclusion criteria is assigned a test group(2-time injection group). Participants conduct cell therapy within 30 days after bone marrow aspiration, and will re-inject autologous mesenchymal stem cells within 30 days after first injection. Participants will make a total of 5 hospital visits after registration, and Safety and Efficacy will be evaluated based on a fixed procedure on every visit.</detailed_description>
