	<brief_summary>Malignant ascites leads to significant morbidity in patients with terminal cancer. Paracentesis can provide relief, but repeat hospital visits, pain, and short duration of relief after paracentesis are detrimental to quality of life(QOL). Two devices are available as alternatives to paracentesis. The impact of either device on QOL has not fully been explored. A pilot nonrandomized trial measuring palliative care QOL and ascites symptom relief using validated survey instruments is proposed.</brief_summary>
