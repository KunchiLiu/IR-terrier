	<brief_summary>Hand osteoarthritis (HOA) which affects the interphalangeal joints and the metacarpophalangeal of the thumb is a common disease, the prevalence of which being about 30 % of the population over than 70. Some forms of HOA are refractory to usual treatments (analgesics, NSAIDs, local injections) and can lead to a high disability. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that IL-6 is involved in the OA process. The aim of the present study is to assess the efficacy of an Interleukin-6-Receptor Inhibitor (tocilizumab) on pain and function in patients with refractory hand OA.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of the Interleukin-6 Receptor Antagonist Tocilizumab in Patients With Hand Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inclusion criteria: aged between 40 and 85 years; HOA according to the ACR criteria; pain intensity of at least 40 (VAS 0-100); at least 3 painful joints within the previous 3 months; at least 3 OA joints (KL grade â‰¥ 2); failure to respond to full dose analgesics and/or NSAID. Exclusion criteria: history or active inflammatory disease involving the hands; previous treatment with TNF inhibitor; history or active chronic infection; latent or active tuberculosis. Patient is randomized to receive investigational product or placebo at week 0 and week 4 (1:1) - arm 1: 2 infusions four weeks apart of tocilizumab 8mg/kg - arm 2: 2 infusions four weeks apart of saline solution Follow-up visits are organized at week 6, and then week 8 and week 12. Primary outcome is the pain as assessed with the VAS at week 6. Secondary outcomes include morning stiffness duration, patient and practitioner global assessments, functional indexes for hand OA, number of painful joints, number of swollen joints. 90 patients is expected to be randomized in 18 months. Each patient sign an informed consent before the beginning of the study.</detailed_description>
