	<brief_summary>Bariatric surgery patients tend to have malabsorption of many micronutrients such as B12, Iron and vitamin D postoperative. So in this study, a monthly high dose of vitamin D3 is giving to patients with their routine supplements and followed up for 6 months. Hypothesis:Bariatric surgery subjects taking monthly high dose cholecalciferol supplements in addition to the standard vitamin D protocol will have a significant rise in serum vitamin D levels compared to the subjects taking only the usual vitamin D protocol.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sun exposure and supplement use questionnaire: A registered dietitian asked each subject for information on sun exposure, vitamins, medications, and any other supplement usage before each blood sample was taken. Lab analysis included serum hydroxy vitamin D levels pre and 3 months postoperative. Descriptive statistics which include both the means and standard deviations were calculated on the study variables. A paired sample t-test was used to determine if there was a significant difference in mean values pre and post vitamin D supplementation. An independent sample t-test was used to assess for significant differences in group (control vs. vitamin D supplement) means. A p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were done using SPSS Version 21 (SPSS, Chicago, III, USA).</detailed_description>
