	<mesh_term>Status Epilepticus</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Subjects two (2) years of age and older Subjects who have: Failed to respond to the administration of at least one firstline agent (e.g., benzodiazepine or other emergent initial AED treatment), according to institution standard of care, and; Failed to respond to at least one secondline agent (e.g., phenytoin, fosphenytoin, valproate, phenobarbital, levetiracetam or other urgent control AED), according to institution standard of care, and; Not previously been administered a thirdline agent but have been admitted to an intensive care unit with the intent of administering at least one thirdline agent for at least 24 hours; or who have previously failed zero, one or more wean attempts from thirdline agents and are now on continuous intravenous infusions of one or more thirdline agent and in an EEG burst or seizure suppression pattern; or who have previously failed one or more wean attempts from thirdline agents and are now either not on a continuous intravenous infusion of at least one thirdline agent or are on a continuous intravenous infusion of one or more thirdline agent but not in an EEG burst or seizure suppression pattern Subjects with SRSE due to anoxic/hypoxic encephalopathy with highly malignant/ malignant EEG features Children (subjects aged less than 17 years) with an encephalopathy due to a rapidly progressing underlying neurological disorder Subjects who have any of the following: 1. a GFR low enough to warrant dialysis but for whatever reason, dialysis is not planned or noncontinuous dialysis planned (that would not adequately remove CaptisolÂ®); 2. severe cardiogenic or vasodilatory shock requiring two or more pressors that is not related to thirdline agent use; 3. fulminant hepatic failure; 4. no reasonable expectation of recovery (for instance, a likely outcome is persistent vegetative state) or lifeexpectancy, in the experience of the investigator, is less than 30 days. Subjects who are being administered more than three thirdline agents concomitantly or in whom the qualifying wean cannot be completed per protocol</criteria>
