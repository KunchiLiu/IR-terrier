	<brief_title>Effectiveness of CelluTome Epidermal Harvesting System in Autologous Skin Grafting of Chronic Wound Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective to this study is to determine the effectiveness of CelluTome™ epidermal harvesting system as an outpatient skin grafting system for selected patients versus inpatient skin graft harvest. This is multi-center prospective, longitudinal case series with comparison to historical controls. In this study, all subjects will receive the same treatment protocol regardless of institution. This will include routine wound photography. Ongoing healing process will be recorded and reviewed. The secondary objectives of this study are to establish an ideal donor site size, recipient site size and ideal patient population (especially high operative risk patients) that would benefit from the use of CelluTome™ Epidermal Harvesting System.</detailed_description>
