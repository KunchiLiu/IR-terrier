	<brief_summary>The investigators will try to assess the effect of endometrial injury preceding the intrauterine insemination cycle on the pregnancy rates compared to cycles with luteal phase support and the control group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endometrial Injury Versus Luteal Phase Support in Intrauterine Insemination Cycles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Group 1: Endometrial biopsy is performed on days 21-24 of the spontaneous menstrual cycle proceeding the intrauterine insemination (IUI) treatment cycle. Two small biopsies are obtained from anterior and posterior walls of the uterus. Group 2: Vaginal progesterone gel is administered for luteal phase support from second day after insemination until pregnancy testing and is continued in the presence of pregnancy until the 12 weeks of pregnancy. Goup 3: Patients are undergone intrauterine insemination (IUI) cycles stimulated with gonadotropin without any intervention. The effect of endometrial injury and luteal phase progesterone support on the pregnancy rate in patients intrauterine insemination (IUI) cycles stimulated with gonadotropin will be compared in terms of biochemical pregnancy rate, clinical pregnancy rate and ongoing pregnancy rate.</detailed_description>
