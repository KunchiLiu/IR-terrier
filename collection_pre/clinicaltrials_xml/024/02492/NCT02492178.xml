	<brief_title>Bio-availability of Rectal Artesunate in Children With Severe Falciparum Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individually randomized, open label, 2-arm, cross-over, clinical trial. Patients are allocated to receive rectal artesunate at admission and intravenous artesunate after 12 hours or intravenous artesunate at admission and rectal artesunate after 12 hours.

The time frame is 24 hours and thereafter patients continue the standard antimalarial therapy.</detailed_description>
