	<brief_summary>Although circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) has been considered as the cornerstone for atrial fibrillation ablation, there has been a substantial recurrence rate. The investigators designed a prospectively randomized study to evaluate whether additional atrial ganglionated plexi ablation guided by the SUMO technology improves the clinical outcome in patients with persistent AF.</brief_summary>

Able to comply with the requirements of the study 1. Reversible cause of atrial fibrillation 2. Previous AF ablation therapy 3. Clinical evidence of active coronary ischemia, significant valvular heart disease, or hemodynamically significant congenital cardiac abnormality 4. Recent (3 months) myocardial infarction (MI), stroke or transient ischemic attack (except if the patient had a DES implanted stent postMI it would be one year) 5.
