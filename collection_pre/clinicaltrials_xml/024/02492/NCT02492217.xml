	<brief_summary>To identify new candidate genes and proteins that are differentially expressed in responders' vs non-responders to anti-TNF alpha therapy at the several time points the investigators will use the transcriptomic and proteomic analyses. Demonstrate a link between gene expression and protein markers regarding prediction to anti-TNF alpha therapy efficacy.</brief_summary>
