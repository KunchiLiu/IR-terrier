	<brief_summary>The objective of Left atrial appendage closure compared to standard antiplatelet therapy in patients with AF who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (LLA-PCI) study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of implantation of left atrial appendage closure compared to standard antiplatelet therapy for prevention of thromboembolic events and stent thrombosis in subjects with AF who underwent PCI.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Left Atrial Appendage Closure Compared to Standard Antiplatelet Therapy in Patients With AF Who Underwent PCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be prospective randomized (1:1) open label pilot study. Patients with unstable angina and non-ST-elevation ACS and history of AF will be included in this study. After PCI and DES implantation TEE will be performed for assessing LAA anatomy and size eligible for left atrial appendage closure device implantation. After screening all patients will be randomized in two groups. The first (control) group will receive standard antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy according to the guidelines (2), the second group of patients will undergo left atrial appendage closure device implantation. After the PCI the first group will take Triple therapy (warfarin + clopidogrel+aspirin) during 45 days and after combination of warfarin+clopidogrel to 6 months after procedure and then only warfarin. The second group will take Triple therapy (warfarin+clopidogrel+aspirin) during 45 days following PCI and after control TEE, warfarin will be discontinued. Then patients from the second group will take DAPT combination (clopidogrel+aspirin) to 6 months after procedure and then only aspirin. Patients will be followed at 45 day, and every 3 months during 12 months of follow up (Figure 1). At each follow-up visits the data regarding clinical events and healthcare utilization will be collected.</detailed_description>
