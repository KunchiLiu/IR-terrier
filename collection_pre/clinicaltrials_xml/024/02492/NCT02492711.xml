	<brief_title>Margetuximab Plus Chemotherapy vs Trastuzumab Plus Chemotherapy in the Treatment of HER2+ Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An evaluation of efficacy, as measured by progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by independent review and overall survival (OS), of margetuximab plus chemotherapy compared to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in patients with advanced HER2+ breast cancer who have received prior treatment with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and ado-trastuzumab emtansine in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or metastatic setting, and who have received at least one, and no more than three, lines of therapy in the metastatic setting.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologicallyproven metastatic or locallyadvanced relapsed/refractory HER2+ breast cancer based on the most recently available tumor biopsy collected from the patient. Tumors may be estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR) positive or negative. Prior treatment with pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and adotrastuzumab emtansine in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or metastatic setting. Prior radiotherapy, hormonal therapies, and other antiHER2 therapies are allowed. Prior treatment with at least one, and no more than three, lines of therapy in the metastatic setting. Patients must have progressed on or following, the most recent line of therapy. Resolution of all chemotherapy or radiationrelated toxicities to ≤ Grade 1 Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks Acceptable laboratory parameters Women of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy test performed within 7 days of randomization and on the first day of treatment. All subjects must agree to use an effective form of contraception for the duration of study treatment and for 7 months after the last dose of study drug Known, untreated brain metastasis. Patients with signs or symptoms of brain metastasis must have a CT or MRI performed within 4 weeks prior to randomization to specifically exclude the presence of radiographicallydetected brain metastases History of uncontrolled seizures within 6 months of randomization History of prior allogeneic bone marrow, stemcell, or solid organ transplantation History of clinically significant cardiovascular disease Clinicallysignificant pulmonary compromise, including a requirement for supplemental oxygen use to maintain adequate oxygenation Any condition that would be a contraindication to receiving trastuzumab as described in the approved local label or a condition that would prevent treatment with the physician's choice of chemotherapy</criteria>
