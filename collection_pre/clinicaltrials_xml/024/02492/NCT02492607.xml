	<brief_summary>A substantial number of DCIS lesions will never form a health hazard, particularly if it concerns slow-growing low-grade DCIS. This implies that many women might be unnecessarily going through intensive treatment resulting in a decrease in quality of life and an increase in health care costs, without any survival benefit. The LORD (LOw Risk DCIS) study is a randomized, international, multicenter, phase III non-inferiority trial, and aims to determine whether screen-detected low-grade DCIS can safely be managed by an active surveillance strategy or that the conventional treatment, being either WLE alone, WLE + RT, or mastectomy, and possibly HT, should remain the standard of care.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Women of age &gt; or = 45 years. Any menopausal status. Calcifications only lesions, detected by populationbased or opportunistic screening mammography. Representative vacuumassisted core biopsies with pure lowgrade DCIS Any size DCIS. Marker placement at biopsy site(s) in the breast. Good correlation between pathological and radiological findings i.e. both findings confirm lowgrade DCIS and no suspicion of intermediate or highgrade DCIS or invasive breast cancer Prior surgery of the ipsilateral breast because of a benign lesion allowed. ASA score 1 or 2 Before patient registration/randomization, written informed consent must be given according to ICH/GCP, and national/local regulations Presence of mass, increased density around calcifications, architectural distortion, stellate lesion on mammography. Presence of bilateral DCIS. Presence of Paget's disease, invasive breast cancer, or lobular carcinoma in situ on cytology or histology. Presence of symptomatic DCIS e.g. DCIS detected by palpation or nipple discharge. Presence of synchronous invasive carcinoma in the contralateral breast. Prior history of invasive breast cancer or DCIS. Prior history of other cancer except carcinoma in situ of the cervix or basocellular carcinoma of the skin. Presence of serious disease that precludes definitive surgical treatment (e.g. cardiovascular/pulmonary/renal disease). Individual from a family with a known BRCA1/2 mutation Presence of pregnancy or breastfeeding. Presence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and followup schedule; those conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial</criteria>
