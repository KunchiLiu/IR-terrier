	<brief_title>Comparisonof Extended Myoectomy and Myoectomy by Morrow in Patients With Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many years myoectomy for Morrow was the gold standard in the treatment of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Currently more retrospective data in the literature about the good results the extended septal myectomy. Use of extended myomectomy eliminates mitral insufficiency due to SAM syndrome. The question remains whether it is possible at hypertrophic cardiomyopathy basal part and mediated mitral insufficiency use only myoectomy by Morrow is achieved regression SAM syndrome and release output of the left ventricle. Planned to create two equal groups of 30 people that will use two methods of surgical treatment of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The study will be terminated in the event of complete AV block more than 2% and unsatisfactory results of a myoectomy requiring perform mitral valve replacement in more than 15% of the patients studied. The study assumed crossover: in case of failure elimination SAM syndrome and mediated mitral insufficiency myoectomy by Morrow for patients will perform extended myoectomy in the case of a good result in patients are moved to the second group. Planned studies the long-term and immediate results of operations: - Quantitative determination of enzymes of myocardial injury: creatine phosphokinase MB and troponin I. - Determination of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (VNP). - MRI with contrast heart to assess remodeling of the heart chambers and heart weight measurements. - TEE evaluation function and mitral valve gradient at the output of the left ventricle.</detailed_description>
