	<brief_title>Effect of Pelvic Floor Stimulation on the Pelvic Floor Function in Cervical Cancer Patients With Type III Hysterectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multi center, open, randomized, controlled clinical trial. All cervical carcinoma patients who undergo type III hysterectomy in the hospitals involved in this study were recruited. 5-7 days postoperative, those who meet the inclusion criteria and without the exclusion criteria and sign the consent were randomized grouped of intervention and control objective by 1:1. At the same time, according to the research hospital, menopausal status (menopause vs menopause) and surgery approach (laparoscopic vs open)，they were further stratified randomly. Patients in the intervention group received electrical stimulation treatment based on conventional clinical nursing, while patients in control group only receive routine clinical care. Except for the treatment of electrical stimulation, other research procedures is the same in the two groups. The recovery rate of urination function, pelvic floor function and life quality of the two group is compared.</detailed_description>
