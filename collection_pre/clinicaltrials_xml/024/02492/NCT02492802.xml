	<brief_title>Effect of Inflammation on Pharmacokinetics of Posaconazole</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective observational study will be performed at the University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands using longitudinal data collection. The design of the study will be that patients starting on posaconazole treatment will be evaluated. After informed consent is obtained medical data will be collected from the medical chart. Posaconazole plasma concentration (trough levels) and inflammatory markers (e.g. C-reactive protein) will be determined in all samples available from routine analysis (often daily). This will result in a detailed data set capturing day to day variations in inflammation and drug concentrations.</detailed_description>
