	<brief_title>Topical Corticosteroids on the Incidence of Postinflammatory Hyperpigmentation After QsNdYAG Laser</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The incidence of post inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) after treating lentigines with Q-switched Nd:YAG laser was 78.3%. - It has been found that the incidence of PIH decreased to 40% after applied topical high potency steroid 2 days after the laser treatment. - By these anti-inflammatory and anti-PIH effects of the high potency steroid, the investigators aimed that the application of steroid 2 days before and 2 days after the laser treatment would be better reduction in the incidence of PIH after Q-switched Nd:YAG laser.</detailed_description>
