	<brief_title>Induction With SVF Derived MSC in Living-related Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this trial is to determine if autologous SVF derived MSC can effectively reduce the need for post transplant immunosuppressant in living-relative kidney transplantation. Emphasis will be placed on the safety of autologous SVF derived MSC infusion, dosage of immunosuppressant, GFR, percentage of acute rejection. 120 patients eligible for the study as described below will be enrolled, with 60 patients in intervention group and 60 in control group. In interventional group we will collect SVF from recipients with special instruments before transplantation, and culture SVF to abstain MSC. The abstained MSC will be infused to the recipients of living-relative kidney transplantation during operation and on 7, 14, 21 POD. We will assess whether induction therapy with autologous SVF derived MSC is feasible in living-relative donor kidney transplantation. The effectiveness of autologous SVF derived MSC induction therapy on reducing of immunosuppressant, reducing the rate of rejection, elevating patient and allograft survival, improving allograft function from day 0 to 12 months after transplantation. Additionally, we will assess the percentage of acute rejection or antibody mediated rejection by Banff criteria, the incidence of delayed graft function (defined as the need for post-transplant dialysis within one week), and the incidence of adverse events including infection, grade 3 and above non-hematologic toxicities, and grade 4 hematologic toxicities.</detailed_description>
