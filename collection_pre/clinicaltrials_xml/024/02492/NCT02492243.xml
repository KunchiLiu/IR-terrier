	<brief_summary>The trial will inform whether detection of ventricular arrhythmias by means of implantable loop recorder (ILR) can help to predict SCD in the large population of survivors of a myocardial infarction with preserved left ventricular function, EF&gt;40%. This may improve risk stratification in these patients, and can inform on the clinical use of subcutaneous monitors to identify post-infarction populations in need for an intervention to prevent sudden death.</brief_summary>
