	<brief_summary>Persons with coeliac disease treated with a gluten free diet will be asked to give blood for a new diagnostic blood test. In this test investigators will use multimerized HLA bound to different gliadin-peptides (tetramer) and with the help of a flow-cytometer identify (along with other relevant T-cell-markers) gluten specific T-cells. Investigators believe that these cells will be present in persons with coeliac disease regardless of gluten-intake. Investigators will compare their findings with two control groups; Persons on a gluten free diet where celiac disease is excluded (gluten sensitive group) and persons on a gluten containing diet (healthy control group). In the initial and main study investigators will look at HLA DQ2.5 individuals, which comprise &gt;90% of all persons with coeliac disease.</brief_summary>
