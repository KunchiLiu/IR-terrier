	<brief_summary>Prior research has investigated the effect of repetitive head trauma as it relates to physiological and psychological function. Boxing is one particular sport which predisposes athletes to a large amount of head impacts. We plan to assess the effects of a boxing tournament on balance, neuropsychological, and visual functions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Acute Effect of Boxing on Balance, Neuropsychological, and Visual Functions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, repeated measures cohort study, which is able to make within-subject (pre and post boxing tournament) comparisons on measures of physiologic and behavioral function. We plan to enroll boxing athletes who are participating in a boxing tournament. Each individual will be assessed on the following tests: balance (dynamic and static balance), vestibular-ocular motor function, neuropsychological function, and symptoms. Additionally, each boxing match will be video recorded and the total number of head impacts they sustain will be documented. - In order to prospectively assess how a boxing tournament affects balance, neuropsychological, and visual functions from pre-tournament assessments to post-tournament assessments (Specific Aim 1), we plan to test all athletes before competition at the Pan-American games begins (pre-test) and after they have been eliminated from the tournament (post-test). - In order to measure the associations between the number of head blows sustained during a boxing tournament with balance, neuropsychological, visual, and symptom deficits, we will also use a video camera to record each match and count the total number of hits to the head.</detailed_description>
