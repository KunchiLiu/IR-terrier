	<brief_summary>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has improved the diagnostic performance of cytology for evaluation of malignant biliary strictures in the US and Europe. The utility of FISH for diagnosis of biliary strictures in Asia is currently unknown. The investigators conducted a prospective study in 2 university hospitals to determine diagnostic performance of FISH for the diagnosis of malignant biliary strictures in Thai patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has improved the diagnostic performance of cytology for evaluation of malignant biliary strictures in the US and Europe. The utility of FISH for diagnosis of biliary strictures in Asia is currently unknown. The investigators aimed to compare the sensitivity of FISH and conventional cytology for the diagnosis of malignant biliary strictures in Thai patients. A prospective study was performed in 2 university hospitals between 2010 and 2013. Patients being evaluated for malignant-appearing biliary strictures were included. Bile duct brushings were collected and assessed by cytology and FISH. Sensitivities with 95% confidence intervals of cytology and FISH were main outcome measurements.</detailed_description>
