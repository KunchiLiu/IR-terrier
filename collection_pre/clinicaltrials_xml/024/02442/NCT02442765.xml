	<brief_summary>Patients with agitation secondary to dementia of the Alzheimer's type. The diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) will be based on the '2011 Diagnostic Guidelines for Alzheimer's Disease' issued by the National Institute on Aging (NIA)-Alzheimer's Association (AA) workgroups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of AVP-786 (Deuterated [d6]-Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide [d6-DM]/Quinidine Sulfate [Q]) for the Treatment of Agitation in Patients With Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible participants for this study must have a diagnosis of probable AD and must have clinically meaningful agitation secondary to AD. This is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study, consisting of 12 weeks of treatment. Approximately 380 participants will be enrolled at approximately 60 centers in North America. Study medication will be administered orally twice-daily from Day 1 through Day 85. Screening must occur within 4 weeks prior to randomization. Following screening procedures for assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible participants will be randomized into the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's Disease (AD) The participant has clinically significant, moderate/severe agitation at the time of screening and for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization The diagnosis of agitation must meet the International Psychogeriatric Association (IPA) provisional definition of agitation Either out patients or residents of an assistedliving facility or a skilled nursing home Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIS) score assessing Agitation is &gt;= 4 (moderately ill) at screening and baseline MiniMental State Examination (MMSE) score is between 6 and 26 (inclusive) at screening and baseline Caregiver who is able and willing to comply with all required study procedures. In order to qualify as a reliable informant (i.e., caregiver) capable of assessing changes in participant's condition during the study, the individual must spend a minimum of 2 hours per day for 4 days per week with the participant. Participant has dementia predominantly of nonAlzheimer's type (e.g., vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, substanceinduced dementia) Participants with coexistent clinically significant or unstable systemic diseases that could confound the interpretation of the safety results of the study (e.g., malignancy, poorly controlled diabetes, poorly controlled hypertension, unstable pulmonary, renal or hepatic disease, unstable ischemic cardiac disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, or unstable valvular heart disease) Participant with myasthenia gravis</criteria>
