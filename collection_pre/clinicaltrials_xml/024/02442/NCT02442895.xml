	<detailed_description>347 IVF cycles (236 patients) analyzed for a retrospective study to evaluate the correlation between the biomarkers of ovarian reserve (antral follicles count, antimullerian hormone, basal follicle stimulating hormone) and number of oocytes and mature oocytes (MII) retrieved during the pick up. For the stimulation were used three different protocols: long luteal, antagonist with daily administration of gonadotropins and antagonist with depot administration of gonadotropins.</detailed_description>
