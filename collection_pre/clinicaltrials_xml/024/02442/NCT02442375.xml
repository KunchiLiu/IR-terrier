	<brief_summary>The objective of the UPGRADE-RT trial is to investigate whether de-escalation of elective radiation dose and introduction of an intermediate dose-level in the treatment of head and neck cancer will results in less radiation sequelae and improved quality of life after treatment whilst the recurrence rate in electively irradiated lymph nodes should not be compromised.

	<criteria>1. Newly diagnosed tumours classified as stage T2‐4 N0‐2 located in the larynx, oropharynx or hypopharynx (unknown primary and oral cavity are not eligible) 2. Histopathological diagnosis of invasive squamous cell carcinoma in the primary tumour 3. Decision for curative intent external beam radiotherapy with elective treatment of the neck made by a multidisciplinary head‐and‐neck oncology team. The patient must be expected to complete the treatment. 4. Radiotherapy planned to start within 6 weeks from baseline imaging of tumour assessment 5. No distant metastasis (M0) 6. WHO performance status 0‐2 7. ≥ 18 years of age 8. Written informed consent 1. Concomitant chemotherapy or EGFR inhibitors for this tumour. 2. Primary tumour of the oral cavity or unknown primary tumour 3. Prior or current anticancer treatment to the head and neck area (e.g. radical attempted or tumour reductive surgery, neo‐adjuvant or concomitant chemotherapy, EGFR inhibitors or radiotherapy), except for endoscopic glottic laser micro surgery. 4. Current participation in any other interventional clinical study. 5. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. 6. Known or suspected HIV infection. 7. History of previous malignancy within the last 3 years, with the exception of surgically cured carcinoma in situ of the cervix, in situ breast cancer, incidental finding of stage T1a or T1b prostate cancer, and basal/squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. 8. Any condition (somatic, psychological, familial, sociological or geographical) rendering the patient unable to understand or complete questionnaires.</criteria>
