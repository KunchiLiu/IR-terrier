	<brief_summary>Dyslipidemia as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an increasing problem in HIV-infected patients who are on antiretroviral therapy especially protease inhibitors including atazanavir. Pitavastatin is a new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor with lesser drug-drug interactions and demonstrable efficacy in decreasing lipid levels in non HIV-infected individuals. The study was conducted as a randomized, double-blind, crossover study comparing the safety and efficacy of pitavastatin versus placebo in HIV-infected patients with dyslipidemia and receiving atazanavir/ritonavir. Patients were randomized to receive either placebo or pitavastatin for 12 weeks, underwent a 2-week washout period, and then were given the other treatment for an additional 12 weeks. Patients were observed for lipid profiles including total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL); and the side effects including clinical and laboratory (serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK)). The follow-up visits were every 4 weeks until the end of the study.</brief_summary>
