	<brief_title>Phase 1 Dexlansoprazole Delayed-Release Capsules for Acid-Related Disorders in Infants Aged 1 to 11 Months</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called dexlansoprazole. Dexlansoprazole is being tested to find a safe and well-tolerated dose and to assess how dexlansoprazole is processed by the body in infants aged 1 to 11 months. This study will look at side effects and lab results in infants who take dexlansoprazole. The study will enroll approximately 24 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 4 treatment groups based on body weight and age: - Dexlansoprazole 10 mg - Dexlansoprazole 15 mg - Dexlansoprazole 20 mg - Dexlansoprazole 30 mg Participants who weigh &lt;3.4 kg will not be enrolled. Participants ≤ 10 weeks of age with a body weight of ≥ 3.4 kg will initially receive Regimen A (dexlansoprazole delayed-release 10 mg capsules). Randomization for participants &gt; 10 weeks of age will be stratified by weight group. Participants whose baseline weight is ≥ 3.4 kg but &lt; 4.1 kg will be assigned to receive Regimen A or Regimen B (dexlansoprazole delayed-release 10 or 15 mg capsules as an initial dose) in a ratio of 1:1. Participants whose weight is ≥ 4.1 kg but &lt; 6.2 kg will be assigned to receive Regimens B or C (dexlansoprazole delayed-release 15 or 20 mg capsules as an initial dose) in a ratio of 1:1. Participants whose weight is ≥ 6.2 kg will be assigned to receive Regimen B, C, or D (dexlansoprazole delayed-release 15, 20, or 30 mg capsules as an initial dose) in a ratio of 1:1:2. All participants will be administered 1 capsule of dexlansoprazole in the morning at the same time each day throughout the study. The study medication may be administered to the participants by opening a capsule and sprinkling the granules on 1 tablespoon of applesauce or pureed apples, or mixing the capsule granules with about 20 mL of water. The food-granule mixture should be administered immediately. The water mixed with the granules will be administered via an oral syringe into the mouth immediately. The granules should not be chewed in mouth. The food or liquid used for administering the study medication should be recorded for Days 1 through Confinement Day 1. The parents of all participants will be asked to record dosing information, the food or liquid used for administering the study medication (Day 1 through Confinement Day 1), food intake, and episodes of vomiting in a diary from Day 2 until the day before Confinement Day 1 (Day 5 to 9). This multicenter trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 114 days. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, including two 2-day visits that may require confinement to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 30 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Prior to any studyspecific procedures being performed and after having the study fully explained and all questions answered, the informed consent form (ICF) must be signed and dated by parent(s) or legal guardian(s). The Screening Period starts at the time of consent. 2. Is a male or female infant 1 to 11 months old, inclusive, on Day 1. Infants who were born prematurely must be ≥ 45 weeks old based on corrected gestational age. 3. At the Initial Screening and Day 1 visits, participant must have body weight percentileforage within the 5th through 95th percentile by age, inclusive, as determined by the World Health Organization (WHO) growth chart. 4. Must be ≥ 3.4 kg at the Screening and Day 1 visits. 5. Participants who take a prescription or nonprescription proton pump inhibitor (PPI), histamine2 receptor antagonists(H2RA), sucralfate, or antacids on a regular or as required basis must agree to discontinue use at Day 1 (except cimetidine, which must be discontinued 28 days prior to Day 1) or other acid suppression therapy, and agree to discontinue use throughout the study. 6. Must have endoscopically proven erosive esophagitis (EE), a history of EE, and/or 1 or more of the following underlying conditions that predispose the participant to chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and EE: moderate to severe neurologic impairment, repaired esophageal atresia, hiatal hernia, cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or endstage renal disease. 7. Except for participants with EE, a history of EE, or repaired esophageal atresia, participants have: Received prior PPI therapy or other acid suppression therapy for a minimum of 2 weeks during any time in the past with symptomatic response and have demonstrated a recurrence of symptoms following at least 1 attempted withdrawal of PPI therapy or other acid suppression therapy AND Have undergone esophageal pH monitoring in the recent past to document that their symptoms are due to acidmediated disease. 8. Must be able to ingest study medication granules sprinkled on 1 tablespoon of applesauce or pureed apples, or as a mixture of granules in water administered via an oral syringe. 9. Must be at least 7 days postsurgery by dosing on Day 1 and have no anticipated need for surgery during the study. 10. Screening laboratory samples must be collected Day 7 to Day 2) and the results must be within the range expected for this infant population (except gastrin results as those results will be available after Day 1). The laboratory results should indicate no clinically significant (CS) abnormality in chemistry (including electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), creatinine, glucose, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin), hematology (complete blood cell count, including differential), and urinalysis parameters (if standard of care). 1. Has evidence of cardiovascular, pulmonary, central nervous system, hepatic, hematopoietic, renal, metabolic, endocrine or gastrointestinal disease, or serious allergy, asthma, or allergic skin rash that suggests clinically significant, uncontrolled underlying disease or condition (other than the disease being studied and/or identified as the main criterion for inclusion), that may impact the ability of the participant to participate or potentially may confound the study results. 2.

Has creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL, ALT and/or AST &gt; 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), or total bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dL with AST/ALT elevated above the limits of normal values. 16.
