	<brief_title>Reducing Discomforts in Critically Ill Patients: the IPREA3 Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators conducted a cluster-randomized trial randomizing 34 ICUs. The program targeted staff members with 3 components : web-based systematic measurement of discomforts on the day of ICU discharge by institutional caregivers (nurses and assistant nurses of the participating ICU), immediate feedback through electronic reminder messages intended to caregivers, and targeted interventions in each ICU based on comparative discomfort scores monthly reported to local champions who were also responsible for staff education. The measurement of discomforts perceived by critically ill patients at the end of the ICU stay, related to the whole stay in the ICU, was performed by the bedside nurse using a specific questionnaire, the IPREA questionnaire whose construct validity, external validity, reliability, reproducibility and acceptability have been already demonstrated (Development and validation of a questionnaire for quantitative assessment of perceived discomforts in critically ill patients. Kalfon P et al, Intensive care Med 2010, 36:1751-58). The version of the IPREA questionnaire used in the study was a 18-item questionnaire : noise ; excessive light ; discomfort related to sleeping in a different bed from home ; sleep deprivation ; thirst ; hunger ; feeling of cold ; feeling of heat ; pain ; being tied down by perfusion lines, tubes or as a result of connections due to monitoring devices ; no respect for intimacy ; anxiety ; isolation ; limited visiting hours ; absence of phone ; lack of information ; shortness of breath ; and depression. The duration of the program is 6 months in each arm. Potential participants in the study were consecutive patients admitted in all the participating ICU that are divided in two groups of 17 ICUs. During October 2014, the IPREA questionnaire is administered to all potentially eligible patients hospitalized in the 34 participating ICUs without applying the program (period P1). The 17 ICUs of the group 1 do not apply the multicomponent program during 5 months (until March 2015), while the 17 ICUs of the group 2 apply the program (period P2). During April 2015, the questionnaire IPREA is administered again in both groups (period P3). From May 2015 until September 2015, the multicomponent program is only applied in the group 1 and no longer in the group 2 (period P4) in order to achieve the crossover of the intervention. During October 2015, the questionnaire IPREA is administered again in both groups (period P5). The overall score of discomfort and the scores for each item will be compared in the control arm and in the interventional arm. The control arm consists in the patients included in the group 2 during October 2014 and the patients included in the group 1 during April 2015, i.e. patients included during the month preceding the implementation of the multicomponent program. The interventional arm consists in the patients included in the group 2 during April 2015 and the patients included in the group 1 during October 2015, i.e. patients included during the last month of the period of application of the multicomponent program.</detailed_description>
