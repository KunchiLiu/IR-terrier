	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Study of KBP-5209 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter study of KBP-5209 administered orally once daily (QD) in 28-day treatment cycles to adult patients with advanced solid tumors which have progressed despite standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exists. This study is designed to determine the MTD or RP2D and to characterize the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of KBP-5209.</detailed_description>
