	<brief_title>Metabolic Effects of the Manipulation of Nutrient Sequence in the Main Meals in Type 2 Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An intervention group follows a modified diet over a period of two months in which the ingestion of protein and lipid happens before that of carbohydrates. A control group follows a standardized diet in which the ingestion of carbohydrates happens before that of protein and lipid. Both diets contain a reduced intake of high-glycemic index meals, saturated fatty acids, trans fatty acids and alcohol. On four days separated by one month each other (two before the beginning of the diet and two after 1 month and 2 months of diet) we measure clinical and metabolic parameters (weight, waist and hip circumferences, glucose, glycated hemoglobin, fructosamine, lipid profile) to compare the effects of the two diets.</detailed_description>
