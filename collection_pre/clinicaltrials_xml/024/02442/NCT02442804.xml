	<brief_title>Cognitive Impact of Pomegranate Polyphenols Following Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research suggests that antioxidants (substances that may slow or prevent cell damage) found in many fruits and vegetables may help improve brain functioning (for example, memory and attention) in healthy individuals and prevent cognitive decline in individuals who have suffered a stroke. The purpose of this research study is to examine whether dietary supplementation with an antioxidant extract can help promote healthy cognitive functioning as a component of recovery after stroke. The procedures include: Administering polyphenols via 2 POMx pills, each of which contains polyphenols derived from pomegranates equivalent to the content of approximately 8 ounces of pomegranate juice, or placebo pills (capsules containing no polyphenol ingredients), every day for one week to inpatients who are in the acute post-stroke phase. Neuropsychological testing pre- and post-treatment will determine whether cognitive functioning changes. Subjects will be randomized into either a placebo or polyphenol group.</detailed_description>
