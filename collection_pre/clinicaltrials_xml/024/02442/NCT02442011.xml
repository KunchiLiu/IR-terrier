	<brief_title>Hematology Biobank : Invitro Study of Blood Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There has been a marked increase in our knowledge of Blood Disorders in the last decade. Much of this knowledge comes from examining blood specimens from patients and subjecting these samples to red cell, plasma, serum or DNA analyses. We propose to set up a Hematology biobank, which will include patient histories, their medical progress and a linked but de-identified bank of blood samples. This will enable us to have a large database, which can be used to learn more about these diseases. The Hematology biobank will use whole blood, red blood cells, plasma, serum and/or DNA.</detailed_description>
