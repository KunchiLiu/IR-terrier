	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate biomarkers affecting the hemodynamic responses to propofol. Particularly, the investigators will assess the effects of polymorphisms in NOS3 and PRKCA genes on hemodynamic responses to propofol and the effects of these polymorphisms on biomarkers related to nitric oxide after propofol anesthesia. In addition, the investigators will evaluate the effects of propofol anesthesia on biomarkers related to nitric oxide in hypertensive patients chronically treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.</brief_summary>
