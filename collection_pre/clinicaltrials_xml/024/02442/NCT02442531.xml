	<criteria>1. At least 18 years old 2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0 or 1 3. Estimated life expectancy of at least 12 weeks 4. Ability and willingness to give written informed consent and to comply with the requirements of the study For Part 1: 5. Patients with pathologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced, recurrent and progressive solid tumours that are refractory to standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy exists and with measurable or evaluable disease according to RECIST 1.1. For Part 2: 6. Patients with pathologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced, recurrent and progressive cancer with measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1 of a histological type that are refractory to standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy exists and where treatment with a taxane is an appropriate treatment option. 1. Less than 4 weeks since the last treatment of chemotherapy, biological therapy, immunotherapy or systemic radiotherapy (except palliative radiation delivered to &lt;20% of bone marrow), and less than 6 weeks for nitrosoureas and mitomycin C prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. 2. Current or recent (within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1) treatment with another Investigational Product or participation in another investigational interventional study. 3. Symptomatic brain metastases. 4. Toxicities incurred as a result of previous anticancer therapy (radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or surgery) that have not resolved to ≤ grade 2 (as defined by CTCAE version 4.03). 5. Inadequate bone marrow function at screening as evidenced by any of the following: Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) &lt; 1.5 x 109/L. Platelet count &lt; 100 x 109/L. Haemoglobin &lt; 6.0 mmol/L (&lt; 9.6 g/dL). The patient should not have received a transfusion or growth factors for these abnormalities in the 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. 6. Serum (total) bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x the Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) for the institution if no liver metastases (&gt; 2 x ULN in patients with liver metastases). 7. AST or ALT &gt; 2.5 x ULN if no liver metastases (&gt; 5x ULN in patients with liver metastases). 8. Alkaline phosphatase levels &gt; 2.5 x ULN if no liver metastases (&gt; 5 x ULN in patients with liver metastases, or &gt; 10 x ULN in patients with bone metastases). 9. Increased plasma prothrombin time or International Normalized Ratio (INR), consequence of reduced hepatic production of Vitamin K. 10. Hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C positivity with abnormal liver function tests. 11. Medical history of: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody positive or use of antiretroviral therapy. Alcoholic and autoimmune hepatitis. Ischemic hepatitis, Cardiovascular dysfunction or impaired liver oxygenation, including hypotension or right heart failure. 12. Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 x ULN. 13. Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate of &lt; 50 mL/min/1.73m2 calculated by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula or creatinine clearance of &lt; 50 mL/min calculated by CockcroftGault. 14. Stroke within 6 months prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. 15. Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) within 6 months prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. 16. Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. 17. Unstable angina. 18. New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater Congestive Heart Failure at screening. 19. Serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication. 20. Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding. 21. Absence of effective means of contraception in female patients of childbearing potential (defined as &lt;2 years after last menstruation and not surgically sterile) or in male patients who are not surgically sterile and who have female partners of childbearing potential. 22. Major surgical procedure (including open biopsy and excluding central line intravenous catheter) within 28 days prior to the first study treatment, or anticipation of the need for major surgery during the course of the study treatment. 23. Grade ≥2 motor or sensory neuropathy symptoms (as defined by CTCAE version 4.03). 24. Known hypersensitivity to any of the Investigational Product's excipients or taxanes. 25. History of drug or alcohol abuse in the opinion of the investigator within 3 years before screening. 26. Evidence of any other medical conditions (such as psychiatric illness, infectious diseases, physical examination or laboratory findings) that may interfere with the planned treatment, affect patient compliance or place the patient at high risk for treatmentrelated complications.</criteria>
