	<brief_summary>This study will use an automated blood pressure monitor (Microlife WatchBP03) with an inbuilt algorithm to detect atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart rhythm) in patients with an implanted pacemaker who have previously documented paroxysmal (intermittent) atrial fibrillation. This study will compare the Microlife device detected atrial fibrillation episodes to the pacemaker detected atrial fibrillation episodes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Device-detected Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The modified Microlife blood pressure monitor is able to detect atrial fibrillation (AF) with high sensitivity (95%) and specificity (86%) and has a positive predictive value of 68% and negative predictive value of 98% for single readings. In addition, the modified device was also able to accurately classify the majority of the anomalous non-AF rhythms, although the specificity was highly variable, dependent upon the rhythm. However sinus rhythm was detected with a specificity of 97%. However, we do not currently know if the device would demonstrate a similar sensitivity in detecting AF in patients with paroxysmal AF. Therefore, the present study will assess the sensitivity and specificity of the automated oscillometric device using a new AF algorithm among pacemaker patients with fast AF and atrial high-rate episodes and evaluate the effect of the specific rhythm abnormalities on the specificity for AF.</detailed_description>
