	<brief_title>Comparison of Deferiprone Delayed Release Tablets and Deferiprone Oral Solution in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-center, open-label, randomized, 4-period crossover study of the pharmacokinetics of a new formulation of deferiprone, delayed release tablets in twenty healthy volunteers. In each study period, blood samples for pharmacokinetics assessment will be collected pre-dose and over 24 hours post-dose. Safety will be assessed throughout the study.</detailed_description>
