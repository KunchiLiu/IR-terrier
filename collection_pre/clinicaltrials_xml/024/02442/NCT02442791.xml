	<brief_summary>Experimental studies and previous clinical trials suggest neuroprotective effects of GLP-1 analogs in various degenerative neurological diseases, and in hypoxic brain injuries in experimental designs. This study is designed as a safety and feasibility study with patients randomized 1:1 to receive GLP-1 analogs immediately after hospital admission after out of hospital cardiac arrest.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GLP-1 Analogs for Neuroprotection After Cardiac Arrest</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In comatose patients resuscitated from out of hospital cardiac arrest, neurological injuries remain the leading cause of death. The in-hospital mortality is reported at 30-50%, and the total mortality, although improved substantially over the last decade, remain to be significant, in most countries up to 90%. The brain of a patient resuscitated after cardiac arrest (CA) may have suffered ischemia and when the spontaneous circulation is re-established, the subsequent reperfusion may cause further damage. Brain ischemia and the reperfusion injury lead to tissue degeneration and loss of neurological function, the extent dependent on duration and density of the insult. Temperature control and mild induced hypothermia (MIH) (33-36°C) mitigate this damage in the experimental setting and clinical trials have shown promising results in improving neurological function and survival. Recent large scale clinical trials however have investigated milder degree of hypothermia in this setting, which suggest a role for active neuroprotection outside of temperature management. Also recently, increased attention to the possible role of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) in neuroprotection has been raised, both in the context of ameliorating degenerative disease and in reducing inflammation on ischemic cerebral stroke. Several experimental studies have shown that GLP-1 analogs has a beneficial effect in the treatment of various degenerative neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. GLP-1 analogs have been shown to reduce brain infarct size in mice after focal brain ischemia as well as to reduce heart infarct size in swine in a model of myocardial infarction. Recent clinical testing in humans have demonstrated a benefit of GLP-1 infusion on myocardial infarct size and a larger salvage index in patients with myocardial infarction. The GLP-1 analogs were infused in acutely ill patients in many ways similar to cardiac arrest patients with no increased risk of adverse events. This study is a double blinded randomized study seeking to evaluate the potential neuroprotective effects of GLP-1 analogs infused in comatose patients after out of hospital cardiac arrest.</detailed_description>
