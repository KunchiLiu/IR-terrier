	<brief_summary>The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the use of diffuse correlation spectroscopy to non-invasively measure dynamic cerebral autoregulation in subjects with vascular risk factors. Optical cerebral blood flow measurements will be correlated with changes in arterial blood pressure to assess how CBF is maintained in response to changes in ABP, and will be compared to transcranial doppler reference measurements.</brief_summary>
