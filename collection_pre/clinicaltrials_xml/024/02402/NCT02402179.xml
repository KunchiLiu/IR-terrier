	<brief_title>Metabolic Availability of Tryptophan From White Maize</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our objective is to determine the metabolic availability of Tryptophan in white maize. Seven young, healthy, male adults will receive graded levels (13.2, 26.4, 39.7, 52.9) of tryptophan requirement of 3.78 mg/kg/d as a crystalline amino acid (AA) mixture and a porridge of white cornmeal protein respectively.</detailed_description>
