	<brief_summary>Mechanical ventilatory lung care is essential for postoperative care in liver transplantation recipients, for such patients are under massive fluid challenge and hemodynamic alterations perioperatively. Some of the recipients experience difficulty in weaning off from the mechanical ventilator due to various causes. This study is to investigate the relationship between the inflammatory gene polymorphism, known for acute lung injury, and the duration of mechanical ventilatory care for such liver transplantation recipients.</brief_summary>
