	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study designed to evaluate the safety, PK, and exploratory activity of topically-applied NS2 dermatologic cream administered once-daily (QD) to subjects with ichthyosis secondary to Sjögren- Larsson Syndrome (SLS). NS2 is expected to trap fatty aldehydes that are pathogenic in SLS patients, and thereby diminish the lipid-aldehyde adduct formation that likely results in ichthyosis associated with SLS, and potentially reduce the mild dermal inflammation characteristic of SLS.</brief_summary>
