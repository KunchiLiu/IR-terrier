	<brief_title>Comparison Between Conventional and Model-based Infusion Strategy of IV PCA in Patients Undergoing RALP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators compared postoperative analgesics requirements and complications between conventional and model-based infusion strategy of intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV PCA) in patients who undergoing robot assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) Group A: conventional IV PCA, Group B: model based IV PCA 1. Primary endpoint: comparison of postoperative analgesic requirements in patient undergoing robot assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) between conventional patient controlled analgesia (PCA) (Group A) and effective-compartment based dosing strategy of PCA (Group B) 2. Secondary endpoint: 1) VAS analysis between two groups, 2) postoperative nausea and vomiting analysis between two groups, 3) complication evaluation between two groups</detailed_description>
