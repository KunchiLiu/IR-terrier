	<brief_title>Comparison of a Plant Protein Diet to a Animal Protein Diet Emphasized in Type 2 Diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>2x20 patients with Diabetes mellitus type 2 are randomise by a blind computer assist for an equal allocation in both groups (animal protein vs. plant protein).
