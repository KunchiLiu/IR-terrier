	<brief_title>Novel Treatment to Enhance Smoking Cessation Before Cancer Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators are proposing a developmental interdisciplinary pilot study to determine the feasibility and efficacy of an intervention designed to increase rates of tobacco abstinence for cancer patients before their cancer surgery. This study (a follow up to smaller pilot studies) will serve as a means to further develop a treatment protocol and to generate an accurate effect size for a full scale trial. The present study will constitute a development clinical trial with a primary aim of developing an effect size for smoking cessation at the time of surgery (7-day point prevalence abstinence), and a secondary aim of creating an effect size for long-term abstinence at 3 months post-surgery.</detailed_description>
