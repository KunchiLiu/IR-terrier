	<brief_title>Lubricity Post-Wear - Competitive Lenses Pilot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this 3-treatment, 3-period, 6-sequence crossover study, each participant will wear all 3 products in randomized order, 1 product at a time, with a washout period of up to 7 days between treatment periods. Lenses will be collected for ex-vivo lubricity analysis. The ex-vivo lubricity analysis will be conducted under a separate non-clinical protocol.</detailed_description>
