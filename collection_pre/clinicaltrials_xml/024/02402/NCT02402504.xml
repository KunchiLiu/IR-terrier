	<brief_summary>The objectives are to test the acute effects of different extruded pulse snacks on: 1) post-prandial blood glucose, insulin and appetite for two hours, and 2) food intake two hours following consumption of pulse products. The investigators hypothesize that snack products containing pulse ingredients will lead to lower blood glucose, insulin, appetite and food intake responses compared to non-pulse snack products.</brief_summary>
