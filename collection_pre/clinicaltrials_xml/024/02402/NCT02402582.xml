	<detailed_description>The FCEM was designed in 2003 by Alhani for chronic patients in Iran and accordingly it was executed for 20 different chronic diseases. Few studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of FCEM on the quality of life, perceived stress, and anxiety of patients with Myocardial infarction (MI). Improving quality of life, perceived stress, and anxiety in patients with MI can be associated with decrease in prevalence of overt cardiovascular disease due to a large proportion of cardiovascular diseases' deaths are premature and preventable. The study was conducted to identify the effect of Family-centered Empowerment Model on the quality of life, perceived stress, and state and trait anxiety of patients with Myocardial infarction. A triple-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial design was used to conduct the study. A total of 70 patients and family members aged 45-85 years in coronary care unit were randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups. The patients in the intervention group received FCEM with four-step including perceived threat with group discussion method, self-efficacy with problem solving method, self-esteem with educational partnership and outcome and process evaluations. Pre and post intervention the patients' empowerment levels by FCEM questionnaires were measured. Data were collected over thirty two months from the beginning of June 2012 to the end of January 2015 in nine times during every three-month. Quality of life, perceived stress, and state and trait anxiety were assessed using the short form health survey (SF-36), the 14-item Perceived Stress, and the 20-item state and 20-item trait anxiety questionnaires, respectively.</detailed_description>
