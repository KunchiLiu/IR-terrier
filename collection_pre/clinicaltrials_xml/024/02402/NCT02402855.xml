	<brief_summary>This study aims to evaluate the impact of financial support on improving the management of prenatal care in pregnant women with low incomes. The judgment criterion is clinically pertinent: complications of pregnancy. This study also aims to evaluate attitudes to this approach through a qualitative survey. It is planned to include 4000 women distributed into two arms of 2000 each. One group will receive financial support (prepaid payment card credited for each consultation attended according to the scheduled follow-up as recommended by the Haute Autorité de Santé); the other group will not. The management of the pregnancy for both groups will not be modified.</brief_summary>
