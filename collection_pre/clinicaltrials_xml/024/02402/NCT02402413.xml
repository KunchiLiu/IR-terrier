	<brief_summary>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders occurring in women of reproductive age. PCOS is considered a syndrome of ovarian dysfunction that is characterized by the heterogeneous clinical manifestation of infrequent or absent menstrual cycles, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovarian morphology. An important ultrasound parameter is the ratio stroma/ovary, the ratio of the volume, evaluated in two-dimensional ultrasound, of the stroma, that secrete androgen, and the ovary. It has been shown that when this ratio is higher than a third the levels of circulating androgens and high. Aim of the present study is to assess whether this ratio, determined with three-dimensional ultrasound, is correlated to the increase of androgens.</brief_summary>
