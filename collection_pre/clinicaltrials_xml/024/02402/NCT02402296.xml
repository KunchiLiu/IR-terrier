	<brief_title>Host Modulatory Effects of β-glucan on Localized Aggressive Periodontitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim: To investigate the efficacy of β-glucan supplementation to non-surgical periodontal therapy in localized aggressive periodontitis (LAP) patients. Method: 30 subjects were randomly and equally assigned to receive scaling and root planing; either with placebo pills (Group I) or β-glucan (100 mg/once a day) (Group II), for 40 days. Subjects were clinically monitored on day 0 and day 91. Gingival samples were harvested from hopeless teeth sites to be investigated histologically and immunohistochemically using matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and 9 antibodies form each patient; at the same time intervals.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Except for periodontitis, patients were systemically healthy as evaluated by modified Cornell medical index. No more than two teeth other than first molars and incisors, with probing depth (PD) ≥ 5mm, bleeding on probing (BOP), and clinical attachment level (CAL) ≥ 5mm. Rapid rate of attachment loss and bone destruction. A radiographic examination revealing an evidence of moderate to severe vertical bone loss around permanent incisors and first molar teeth. Every patient should have at least 20 teeth excluding third (3rd) molars, and at least an extractionindicated tooth for a dentoperiodontal affection. Familial aggregation. Previous subgingival scaling and root planing, allergy to βglucan, smoking, former smoking, pregnancy, need of antibiotic coverage for routine dental therapy, antibiotic therapy in the previous 6 months and allergy to chlorhexidine.</criteria>
