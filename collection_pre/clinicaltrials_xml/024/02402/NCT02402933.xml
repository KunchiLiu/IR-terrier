History of significant hypersensitivity to glucagon, or any related products as well as severe hypersensitivity reactions (such as angioedema) to any drugs. Presence of cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, liver or kidney disease, or any other conditions which in the judgment of the investigator could interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs or could potentiate or predispose to undesired effects. Presence or history of pheochromocytoma (i.e. adrenal gland tumor) or insulinoma. Use of daily systemic betablockers, indomethacin, warfarin or anticholinergic drugs. Concomitant maintenance therapy with any drug that would influence the outcome of the trial, at the discretion of the Investigator and the Sponsor.
