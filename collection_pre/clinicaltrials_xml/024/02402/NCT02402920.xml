	<brief_title>Phase I Trial of MK-3475 and Concurrent Chemo/Radiation for the Elimination of Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a part and study group based on when you join this study. Up to 3 groups of 3 participants each will be enrolled in Part A and up to 80 participants will be enrolled in Part B. If you are enrolled in Part A or B, the dose of pembrolizumab you receive will depend on when you join this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of pembrolizumab. Each new group will receive a higher dose of pembrolizumab than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of pembrolizumab is found. All participants will receive pembrolizumab during radiation therapy. The radiation will be to the chest area. In addition to pembrolizumab, participants in Part A will also receive either cisplatin and etoposide or carboplatin and etoposide. Study Drug Administration: You will receive pembrolizumab by vein over about 30 minutes on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle. If you are in Group A, on Day 1 of Cycles 1-16, you will receive pembrolizumab by vein over 30 minutes. In addition, on Day 1 of Cycles 1-4, you will receive cisplatin by vein over about 2 hours and etoposide by vein over 4 hours on Days 1, 2, and 3. If you are unable to tolerate cisplatin, you will receive carboplatin by vein over 30 minutes and etoposide by vein over 4 hours on Days 1, 2, and 3. Study Visit: When you are not receiving radiation, you will have these every 3 weeks. - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) may be drawn for routine tests. Follow Up: Every 12 weeks after your last dose of pembrolizumab, you will have CT or PET scans to check the status of the disease. You will also have PFTs performed. If you are unable to make these visits, you will be contacted by phone to check your health. Length of Study: You may continue taking the study drug for up to 16 doses. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. This is an investigational study. Radiation therapy is delivered using FDA-approved and commercially available methods for local control of metastatic and primary tumors. Pembrolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma. It use in this study is investigational. Up to 80 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial 2. Be &gt;/= 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent 3. Have a performance status of 0 or 1 or 2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Scale 4. Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined here, all screening labs should be performed within 10 days of treatment initiation: Adequate Organ Function Laboratory Values * Hematological; Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;/=1,500 /mcL, Platelets &gt;/=100,000 / mcL, Hemoglobin &gt;/=9 g/dL or &gt;/=5.6 mmol/L * Renal; Serum creatinine or Measured or calculated creatinine clearance (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] can also be used in place of creatinine or creatinine clearance [CrCl]) &lt;/=1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) or &gt;/=60 mL/min for subject with creatinine levels &gt;1.5 X institutional ULN [Creatinine clearance should be calculated per institutional standard] *Hepatic; Serum total bilirubin &lt;/=1.5 X ULN or Direct bilirubin &lt;/=ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels &gt;1.5 ULN, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and 5. Inclusion #5 continued: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) serum glutamicpyruvic transaminase (SGPT) &lt;/=2.5 X ULN or &lt;/=5 X ULN for subjects with liver metastases *Coagulation; International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) &lt;/=1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants, Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) &lt;/=1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants 6. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. 7. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year. 8. Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy. 9. Histologic diagnosis of either limited state SCLC (LSSCLC), or Extensive stage SCLC (ESSCLC) or neuroendocrine tumor. 1. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent (except glutamine) or using an investigational device within 2 weeks of the first dose of treatment. 2. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment. With the exception of physiologic steroid replacement. 3. Has had a prior monoclonal antibody within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., &lt;/= Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. 4. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., &lt;/= Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent. Prior radiation does not require a washout period. *Note: Subjects with &lt;/= Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study. **Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy. 5.

Has an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Subjects with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule. Subjects that require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be excluded from the study. Subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or Sjorgen's syndrome will not be excluded from the study. 8.

Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial. 12.
