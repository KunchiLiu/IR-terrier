	<brief_summary>Adjudicated youth often have traumatic stress responses but rarely receive treatment for these problems. This study is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate two alternative implementation strategies for providing an evidence-based trauma treatment, Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT), to therapist who treat adjudicated youth in 18 residential treatment facilities (RTF) in New Hampshire, Vermont, and Connecticut: 1) web-based TF-CBT implementation strategy ("W"), consisting on only web-based training and consultation; versus 2) W plus live TF-CBT implementation strategy, consisting of W plus face-to face training and phone consultation with TF-CBT experts ("W+L").</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TF-CBT for Adjudicated Youth in Residential Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Therapists in each of 18 participating RTFprograms that serve adjudicated youth are randomized to receive either: 1. W TF-CBT implementation strategy, provided via the free distance learning resources TF-CBTWeb, (www.musc/edu/tfcbt) and TF-CBTConsult (www.musc.edu/tfcbtconsult); or 2. W+L implementation strategy, provided through W + 2 day TF-CBT training plus one year of twice monthly TF-CBT consultation calls with a TF-CBT expert trainer. All RTF staff receive one day training in trauma-informed care. All therapists in both conditions receive training in screening youth for trauma exposure and symptoms. Data are collected regarding primary outcomes of: 1) number of youth therapists in each condition screen for trauma symptoms, 2) number of youth consent to TF-CBT treatment; 3) number of youth complete TF-CBT, 4) TF-CBT fidelity during treatment. Secondary outcomes include 1)changes in therapist knowledge and satisfaction regarding TF-CBT treatment and 2) youth outcomes including PTSD symptoms, depression and satisfaction with treatment.</detailed_description>
