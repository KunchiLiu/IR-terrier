	<brief_summary>The Centre for Magnetic Resonance in Biology and Medicine (CRMBM, UMR-CNRS 7339 AMU) obtained funding for a whole body NMR imaging at 7. It is the only MRI at 7T installed in a hospital in France (only two 7T MRI in France) and therefore a unique opportunity to develop new diagnostic approaches. The purpose of this study is to develop, implement and validate new MRI quantitative parameters derived from ultra high field MRI in order to characterize non-invasively with an unprecedented resolution and sensitivity, anatomy as well as certain physiological, hemodynamic and metabolic function of brain, spinal cord, musculoskeletal system, and heart in healthy subjects</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The key is that the goal of our projects is not only producing images of better quality than using a 3T scanner but also making images differently, by highlighting new contrasts and features of theses organs in order to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of neurological, psychiatric, cardiovascular and rheumatologic diseases.</detailed_description>
