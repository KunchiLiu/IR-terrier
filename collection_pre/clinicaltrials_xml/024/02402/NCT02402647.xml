	<brief_summary>This project will utilize a novel behavioral intervention for hoarding disorder that takes into account age and neurocognitive factors. The goal of this project is to gain knowledge on how treatment components may or may not work for Veterans with hoarding disorder. Further, the investigators hope to increase understanding of functional and long term outcomes in response to hoarding treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cognitive Rehab and Exposure Treatment for Hoarding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing six months (26 sessions) of Cognitive Rehabilitation and Exposure/Sorting Therapy (CREST) treatment to a robust comparator, six months of Exposure Therapy alone, in 136 participants with HD. Research Design: Assessments will be administered at baseline, during treatment (sessions 7, 13, 21), post-treatment, and 3- and 6-month follow-up, thus, all participants will be enrolled for one year. Methodology: The primary objective is to evaluate whether CREST significantly reduces hoarding symptoms and improves functional capacity and quality of life when compared to exposure therapy alone. The investigators will also examine the impact of treatment mediators; treatment adherence, changes in executive functioning, avoidance, symptom severity on outcomes. Age and executive functioning will also be explored as potential moderators. Finally, by repeatedly measuring treatment targets, the investigators will examine time to maximum treatment effect in an effort to understand mechanisms of change. Clinical Relationships: By providing a treatment for many Veterans with HD, the investigators can alter the course of their symptom trajectory and negative consequences, resulting in both healthcare costs savings and improved quality of life for Veterans.</detailed_description>
