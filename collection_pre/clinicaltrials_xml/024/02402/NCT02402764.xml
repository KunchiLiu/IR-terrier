	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to see whether the combination of selinexor (KPT-330) can help people with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Researchers also want to study the safety and tolerability of Selinexor in TNBC patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), defined as negative immunohistochemical staining for estrogen and progesterone receptors (≤5% of nuclei positive by IHC) and receptor tyrosineprotein kinase erbB2 (HER2) negative (IHC 01+ or HER2neu negative according to American Society of Clinical Oncology; College of American Pathologists (ASCOCAP) HER2 Test Guideline Recommendations) Written informed consent in accordance with federal, local, and institutional guidelines Body surface area ≥1.4 m^2 Age ≥18 years Estimated life expectancy of &gt;3 months at study entry TNBC must be either locally recurrent or metastatic. Locally recurrent disease must not be amenable to surgical resection or radiation with curative intent. Measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 Documented disease progression at study entry Must have received at least 1 chemotherapy regimens in the setting of metastatic disease Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤2 Adequate hematological function: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1500/mm^3, platelets count &gt;100,000mm^3 Adequate hepatic function within 14 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1): total bilirubin &lt;2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) (except patients with Gilbert's syndrome who must have a total bilirubin of &lt; 3 times ULN) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2.5 x ULN. In the case of known (radiological and/or biopsy documented) liver metastasis, AST/ALT ≤5.0 times ULN is acceptable. Amylase and lipase ≤ 1.5 x ULN Adequate renal function within 14 days prior to C1D1: estimated creatinine clearance of ≥ 30 mL/min Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to use dual methods of contraception and have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening, and male participants must use an effective barrier method of contraception if sexually active with a female of childbearing potential. For both male and female participants, effective methods of contraception must be used throughout the study and for 3 months following the last dose. To be considered of nonchildbearing potential, postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months naturally (not in the setting of post chemotherapy) or participants must be surgically sterile. Must have received prior anthracycline and taxane therapy unless clinically contraindicated Significant medical illness that in the investigator's opinion cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy or would compromise the participant's ability to tolerate this therapy Women who are pregnant or lactating Radiation, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy or any other approved anticancer therapy ≤2 weeks prior to cycle 1 day 1 Major surgery within 4 weeks before Day 1 Unstable cardiovascular function: Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities requiring treatment, or congestive heart failure (CHF) of New York Hearth Association (NYHA) Class ≥3; myocardial infarction (MI) within 3 months Uncontrolled infection requiring parenteral antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals within one week prior to first dose. Potential participants with controlled infection or on prophylactic antibiotics are permitted in the study. Known history of HIV Known active hepatitis A, B, or C infection that requires treatment Any underlying condition that would significantly interfere with the absorption of an oral medication Grade &gt;2 peripheral neuropathy at baseline (within 14 days prior to cycle 1 day 1) Participation in an investigational anticancer study within 3 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 Coagulation problems and active major bleeding within 4 weeks prior to C1D1 (peptic ulcer, epistaxis, spontaneous bleeding) Active central nervous system (CNS) malignancy. Asymptomatic small lesions are not considered active. Treated lesions may be considered inactive if they are stable for at least 3 months. Radiation, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy or any other anticancer therapy ≤ 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 or radioimmunotherapy ≤ 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 Have not recovered to Grade ≤ 1 or to their baseline from clinically significant adverse effects</criteria>
