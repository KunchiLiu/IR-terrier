	<brief_title>Evaluation of Hypo-Safe Hypoglycaemia Alarm Device - the Pilot 2 Study - Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this pilot trial is to demonstrate the safety and the performance of the Hyposafe hypoglycaemia alarm device before conducting clinical trials in type 1 diabetes patients. 1.1.1 Safety The safety related objective of this study is to evaluate the incidence and severity of all adverse events. The primary safety parameter is the number of adverse events related to the device implantation and any other study related procedures from the time of device implantation until the end of the study (peri-operative complications including bleeding and infection, allergic reactions, occurrence of harm, tension or pressure on surrounding tissue etc.) 1.1.2 Performance To evaluate the technical stability of the Hyposafe hypoglycaemia alarm device during everyday activities. 1.1.3 Efficacy Since this is a study in healthy subjects no efficacy measures are recorded. Episodes of false alarms will be recorded in order to improve the algorithm for hypoglycaemia detection. 1.1.4 Usability The ability of the subjects to carry the device during every-day activities and sleep and the subject experience with respect to pain and discomfort will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
