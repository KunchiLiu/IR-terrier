	<brief_summary>- To evaluate the safety and efficacy of MiStent drug (sirolimus)-eluting stent system in the treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients with primary in situ CHD (de novo); - To evaluate operating performance of the MiStent drug (sirolimus)-eluting coronary stent system.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial on the Efficacy and Safety of Sirolimus-Eluting Stent (MiStent® System)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The study will enroll a total of 428 cases of primary in situ coronary artery disease patients (all patients enrolled with a maximum of two target lesions in different blood vessels and maximum of 2 stents per lesion. If more stents are needed for implantation, stents with the same brand are required, and mixing brands is not allowed for each patient except for salvage with implantation of other brand of stents.) - Lesions with reference diameter of 2.5mm-3.5mm (by visual measurement) and with length ≤40mm (by visual measurement) will be selected, subjects meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria and who agree to participate will be enrolled. - Prospective, single-blinded, multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial; - Patients with in situ primary CHD; - Clinical sites: up to 18; patients will be enrolled in a 1:1 ratio (i.e., 214 cases enrolled into each group, the MiStent stent group and TIVOLI stent group); - Clinical follow-up time points: 1 month, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months and yearly at 2-5 years post index procedure; - Angiographic follow-up at 9 months post index procedure; in-stent late lumen loss measured by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) will be used as the primary efficacy endpoint for product evaluation; - In this trial, the collection, collation, statistical analysis and adjudication of all relevant clinical and angiographic data will be conducted by an independent coronary angiography core laboratory (CCRF Medical Technology Co., Ltd.), data management and statistical center, clinical events committee and clinical audit agency. All patients will be followed up for 5 years (by telephone or outpatient form), and the incidence of adverse events will be recorded to allow a more accurate and reliable evaluation of the long-term safety of the MiStentTM drug (sirolimus) eluting coronary stent system.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Stable and unstable angina pectoris (AP), old myocardial infarction (OMI), or confirmed evidence of myocardial ischemia; Primary in situ coronary artery lesions (up to two target lesions and up to 2 stents per lesion); Visual target lesion length ≤40mm; Visual reference vessel diameter of 2.53.5mm; Visual diameter stenosis ≥70%; Patients with indications for coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG); Subjects participate voluntarily and signed an informed consent willing to accept angiographic and clinical followup. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) occurred within 7 days prior to the procedure; postMI complicated with elevated levels of cardiac enzymes (CKMB, cTNT / I); CTO (TIMI0) lesions, left main lesions, ostial lesions,bypass graft lesions, bifurcation lesions (lateral side branch reference vessel diameter≥2.5mm), restenosis instent and threevessel disease that need to be treated; Severe calcified lesions for which balloon predilation is expected to be unsuccessful; Tortuous lesions that render stent crossing difficult; NYHA class≥III or left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40%; Implantation of other stents in the past year; Pregnant or breastfeeding patients or patients planning to get pregnant within the following year; Subjects with bleeding tendency or coagulation disorder or PCI contraindications and / or anticoagulant therapy contraindications or who have not tolerated dual antiplatelet treatment within a year to date; Presence of other diseases (such as cancer, malignancies, congestive heart failure, organ transplantation or candidate for it) or history of substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, heroin, etc.), poor protocol compliance or life expectancy of less than 1 year; Allergic to one of following: aspirin, heparin, clopidogrel, sirolimus (rapamycin), PLGA polymers, contrast agents and metal; Severe liver and kidney dysfunction (ALT or AST level 3 times greater than the upper limit of normal; eGFR &lt;30ml/min); Patients participating in any other clinical trial and who have not completed followup to the primary endpoint; Study subjects with poor compliance judged by investigators, with poor possibility to complete study in accordance with requirements.</criteria>
