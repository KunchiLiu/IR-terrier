	<brief_title>Study of Modified Stem Cells (SB623) in Patients With Chronic Motor Deficit From Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind, sham-surgery controlled study of stereotactic, intracranial injection of SB623 cells in patients with fixed motor deficits from ischemic stroke. The study will be conducted at approximately 65 sites in the United States. Two cohorts, Group 1 (2.5 and 5 million SB623 cells combined) and Group 2 (sham placebo), will be included in this study. Subjects who are randomized into this study will receive either 2.5 million SB623 cells, 5 million SB623 cells or sham surgery at a 1:1:1 randomization ratio. Randomization will be performed via an interactive web/voice response system (IXRS), stratified by Screening mRS score (recorded in the IXRS at the clinical site).</detailed_description>

Agree that use of antiplatelet, anticoagulant, or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs to be determined by the local medical staff and in accordance with the ACCP 2012 guideline "Perioperative Management of Antithrombotic Therapy: Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th Edition: American College of Chest Physicians EvidenceBased Clinical Practice Guidelines", if applicable , provided that no antiplatelet, anticoagulant, or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are to be restarted postsurgery until after the Day 8 MRI is read and are determined to be safe to restart 10. Subjects must have had physical therapy prior to entry (and be willing to continue to the extent possible) 11. Must be willing to discontinue herbal or nontraditional medicines for 1 week before and 1 week after the surgical procedure and be willing to continue to the extent possible 12. Ability of patient or legal authorized representative to understand and sign an Informed Consent 1. History or presence of any other major neurological disease other than stroke 2. Cerebral infarct size &gt;150 cm3 measured by MRI 3. Primary intracerebral hemorrhage 4. Myocardial infarction within prior 6 mos. 5. Malignancy unless in remission &gt;5 yrs. 6. Clinically significant finding on MRI of brain not related to stroke 7. Any seizures in the 3 months prior to Screening 8. More than 5 degrees of contracture at shoulder, elbow, wrist, fingers, hip, knee and ankle 9. Other neurologic, neuromuscular or orthopedic disease that limits motor function 10. Uncontrolled systemic illness, including, but not limited to: hypertension; diabetes; renal, hepatic, or cardiac failure 11. Positive findings on tests for occult malignancy, unless a nonmalignant etiology is confirmed 12. Uncontrolled major psychiatric illness, including depression symptoms (CESD R Scale of ≥16 is exclusionary) 13. Total bilirubin &gt;1.9 mg/dL at Screening 14.

International Normalized Ratio of Prothrombin Time (INR) &gt;1.2 at Screening if the patient does not take anticoagulants; for patients on anticoagulants, INR must be confirmed to be ≤1.2 prior to surgery 22. Presence of craniectomy or other contraindication to stereotactic surgery 23. Participation in any other investigational trial within 4 weeks of initial screening and within 7 weeks of Baseline visit 24. Botulinum toxin injection, phenol injection, intrathecal baclofen, or any other interventional treatments for spasticity (except bracing and splinting) 16 weeks prior to the Baseline visit 25.

Any other condition or situation that the investigator believes may interfere with the safety of the subject or the intent and conduct of the study 30. Any prior SB623 cell implantation and/or any prior stem cell treatment for stroke or other reason regardless of mode of administration</criteria>
