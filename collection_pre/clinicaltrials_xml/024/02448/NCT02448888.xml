	<detailed_description>Design: Randomized controlled trial. Participants: Subjects (N_40 volunteers) experimental group (n_20) control group (n_20). All of the participants needs to be diagnosed with chronic back pain by a physician. Participants are going to be randomly assigned to two groups: a control group (CG), and experimental group (EG). Intervention: The experimental group is going to follow a home-exercise program designed specifically to compensate the overloads and strength necessities of the workplace, the patient enter the description of the workplace in a mobile application (APP) and the APP shows specific exercises that the patient needs to practice. The exercise program includes muscle strengthening, flexibility, and endurance training, during 2 months, 3 times/week and generla recommendations. The control group is going to receive only general recommendation (ACSM recommendations) with the same kind of mobile application to control the amount of exercise that each patient performs during the week. Data on pain intensity (BPI short form, Brief Pain Inventory), disability (Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire), functional assessment of the lumbar spine (EMG Flexion-relaxation test), amount of weekly physical activity (IPAQ), and number of sick leaves are going to be measured immediately before and after intervention and 3 months after the end of the intervention period.</detailed_description>
