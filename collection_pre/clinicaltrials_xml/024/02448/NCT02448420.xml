	<brief_summary>This is a phase II, prospective, open-label, multicentre, Simon's two-stage-design study of the combination of palbociclib plus trastuzumab, with or without letrozole, in post-menopausal patients with HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who have received chemotherapy and treatment with trastuzumab for their metastatic disease.The aim of the PATRICIA study is test the hypothesis that the addition of Palbociclib to standard therapy is well tolerated and can provide a benefit in progression-free survival in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer previously treated for their metastatic disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Palbociclib and Trastuzumab With or Without Letrozole in HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase II, prospective, open-label, multicentre, Simon's two-stage-design study of the combination of palbociclib plus trastuzumab, with or without letrozole, in post-menopausal patients with HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who have received chemotherapy and treatment with trastuzumab for their metastatic disease. All patients will have histologically-confirmed HER2-positive breast adenocarcinoma and must have received at least 2 (maximum 4) previous lines of regimens for locally advanced disease or MBC. Patients must have radiological evidence of progression with at least one line of treatment including trastuzumab for locally advanced disease or MBC. Three patient cohorts will be formed on the basis of their hormone receptor status and treatment assignation. Cohort A will include patients with ER negative, HER2 positive breast cancer, who will receive trastuzumab plus palbociclib. Cohort B1 will include patients with ER positive, HER2 positive breast cancer, who will receive trastuzumab plus palbociclib. Cohort B2 will include patients with ER positive, HER2 positive breast cancer, who will receive trastuzumab plus palbociclib plus letrozole. To avoid imbalance, assignation of ERpositive,HER2 positive patients to cohorts B1 and B2 will be randomised. The concomitant administration of trastuzumab plus palbociclib, or trastuzumab plus palbociclib plus letrozole have not been studied in a typical phase I clinical trial. For this reason, an initial safety phase will be conducted in each cohort. The first 6 patients included in each combination (3 patients in cohort A, 3 patients in cohort B1 and 6 patients in cohort B2, 12 patients in total) will undergo additional cardiac and haematological safety monitoring. The inclusion of these 12 patients will be done in cohorts of 3 for each of the two treatment combinations, analogous to the rate of patient inclusion in Phase I studies of classic design. If any unexpected toxicity is observed at the end of the second cycle of the third included patient, the inclusion in the safety run-in phase will continue up to 3 more patients in each treatment combination arm for a total of 12 patients. After this initial phase of safety, an independent monitoring data committee will meet in an extraordinary way to evaluate the safety data derived from observations of these 12 patients. If the evaluations are positive for safety regimes, the recruitment of the study will proceed until first stage inclusion completion, which is inclusion of 15 patients in each arm. The sample size was calculated according to Simon's optimal 2-stage design. The 3 cohorts will allow early stopping if the desired efficacy is not observed in stage 1. Accordingly, 15 patients must be included in each group during the first stage. If 5 patients or fewer show progression-free survival at 6 months, the trial will be stopped (interim efficacy analysis). When the results of the interim analysis are available, the Steering Committee (SC) will review the data and will ultimately recommend which groups or cohorts will go on to stage 2.The Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will evaluate the safety data in patients included in the initial safety phase in an interim safety analysis, and will give recommendations to the SC regarding the continuation of the study or otherwise, on the basis of the toxicity data. Inclusion of patients will continue until a total of 46 patients are included, in order to detect a difference of 20% or greater (that is equal or more than 50%) in PFS at 6 months. A treatment regimen will be considered effective if more than 18 patients of the total 46 show progression-free survival at 6 months (final analysis), reaching 80% power with an alpha of 0.05 level of significance. In summary, taking into account all possible scenarios for the 3 cohorts, the following total number of patients may be recruited: Minimum of 45 patients (early stopping of 3 cohorts). 76 (early stopping of 2 cohorts). 107 (early stopping of one cohort). Maximum 138 patients (the 3 cohorts go on to stage 2).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written informed consent for all study procedures in accordance with local regulatory requirements before protocolspecific procedures are started. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Invasive HER2 positive breast cancer Hormone receptor status known Locally advanced breast carcinoma or histologically confirmed MBC. 1. Patients with locally advanced disease must have recurrent or progressive disease that must not be suitable for resection with curative intent. Patients with accepted curative options cannot participate. 2. For patients with bilateral breast cancer, positive HER2 status must be demonstrated in both disease foci or in a biopsy of metastasis. At least 2 (maximum 4) previous systemic anticancer treatment lines for recurrent locally advanced disease or MBC, that must include trastuzumab or another antiHER2 treatment in combination with a taxane or capecitabine. Previous treatment may include hormone therapy, other targeted antiHER2 drugs (e.g., lapatinib, neratinib, pertuzumab, TDM1) or other chemotherapy agents. Tumour tissue available for biomarker analysis, obtained from metastatic lesions (preferably) or from the primary tumour.

Adequate organ function, determined by the following laboratory tests performed within 14 days before treatment allocation. Baseline Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) â‰¥50% Postmenopausal status Absence of any psychological, family, sociological or geographical circumstance that could potentially represent an obstacle to compliance with the study protocol and the followup schedule; these circumstances will be discussed with the patient before enrolment in the trial. Treatment with any investigational anticancer medicinal product in the 14 days prior the start of the study treatment. Patient has received more than 4 previous lines of treatment (antiHER2 drug in combination with chemotherapy) for advanced disease. Previous treatment with a cell cycle inhibitor. History of other malignant tumour disease in the last 5 years, with the exception of appropriately treated in situ cervical cancer, skin cancer other than melanoma, stage I uterine cancer, or other malignant tumour disease with an expected curative outcome. Brain metastases that are previously untreated, or progressive or which require any type of treatment (e.g. radiation, surgery or steroids) for controlling symptoms within 30 days before the first dose of study treatment. Radiation therapy for metastatic disease foci outside the brain, administered within 14 days before study enrolment and/or radiation of more than 30% of the bone marrow.
