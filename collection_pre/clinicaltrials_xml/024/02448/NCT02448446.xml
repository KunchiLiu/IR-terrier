	<brief_title>The Effect of Intravitreal Ranibizumab on Visual Acuity and Hard Exudate Resolution in the Treatment of Diabetic Macular Edema With Center Involved Edema and Lipid Exudates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, Phase I/II study of intravitreally administered 0.3mg ranibizumab in subjects with diabetic macular edema and lipid exudates in the central subfield. Consented, enrolled subjects will receive multiple open-label intravitreal injections on 0.3mg ranibizumab administered every 30 days for 12 months per the treatment algorithm. The patients will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups. Group 1: Treatment algorithm based on the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research (DRCR) protocol I 4:2:7 strategy based on the presence of macular edema. Group 2: Continue treatment until not only the macular edema is resolved but also until the lipid exudate is resolved. Sample size: 30 eyes Follow-up Schedule: Every 4 weeks throughout the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects will be eligible if the following criteria are met: Inclusion Criteria Ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study assessments for the full duration of the study Age ≥ 18 years Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes mellitus Best corrected ETDRS visual acuity (20/3220/320) or letter score 78 to 24 Diabetic macular edema on clinical examination involving the center of the macula assessed to be the main cause of visual loss Retinal thickness measured on spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). Zeiss Cirrus: ≥290μm in women and ≥305 μm in men in the central subfield. Heidelberg Spectralis: ≥305μm in women and ≥320 μm in men in the central subfield Lipid exudates involving the central subfield on spectral domain OCT. Exclusion Criteria Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from this study: Treatment for diabetic macular edema within the prior 4 months. Panretinal photocoagulation within the prior 4 months or anticipated need for panretinal photocoagulation within the next 6 months major ocular surgery within the prior 4 months myocardial infarction, other cardiac event requiring hospitalization, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, or treatment for acute congestive heart failure occurred within 4 months before randomization Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or lactation Premenopausal women not using adequate contraception. The following are considered effective means of contraception: surgical sterilization or use of oral contraceptives, barrier contraception with either a condom or diaphragm in conjunction with spermicidal gel, an intrauterine device (IUD), or contraceptive hormone implant or patch. Any other condition that the investigator believes would pose a significant hazard to the subject if the investigational therapy were initiated Participation in another simultaneous medical investigation or trial</criteria>
