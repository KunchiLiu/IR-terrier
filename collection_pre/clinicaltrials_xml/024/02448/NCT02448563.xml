	<brief_title>Reducing Obesity in Underserved Postpartum African American Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators proposal adapts The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) 16 session core curriculum to our 8 session model and in addition uses the cultural tailoring techniques of the DPP to address the needs of our AA population in several ways: 1) The reference materials and lesson handouts include information about the types of foods and cooking methods used by an AA culture (see Other Study Documents); 2) Topics are selected for group classes that are most appropriate for our participants such as Hip Hop or Salsa dancing for physical activity. Participants will be randomized during the early postpartum period to either usual care or intervention. Usual care participants will be offered the weight management standard of care which is one visit with a dietitian in the Nutrition and Weight Management Center. Intervention participants will be assigned a Birth Sister for the postpartum period. They will also attend 8 weekly sessions for the weight loss program. All participants will complete study assessment visits at 6 weeks postpartum and 15 weeks postpartum.</detailed_description>
