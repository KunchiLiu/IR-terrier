	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND: The physiopathology of the heart failure involves compensatory mechanisms as exacerbated neurohormonal activity, endothelial dysfunction and consequently the muscle disability and exercise intolerance. The interval exercise training has been proposed as one efficient method to heart failure patients. It seems that the main mechanism involved in the benefit of the interval exercise training is "shear stress". AIM: To study the interval exercise training versus the continuous exercise training in the sympathetic activity and in the peripheral muscle perfusion in heart failure patients. Moreover, we will evaluate the muscle apoptosis, microRNA in plasma and muscle biopsy, biomarkers levels of inflammation, quality of life and exercise capacity. METODOLOGY: Will be selected 40 patients (male and female) with age between 30 and 60 years, left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40% and functional class I, II and III. These patients will be randomized into three groups: Interval (AIT), continuous (MCT) and control (CG). All patients will be evaluated with microneurography, peripheral muscle perfusion, muscle biopsy, blood samples, accelerometer, cardiopulmonary exercise test and quality of life before and after end of the period of 03 (three) months.</brief_summary>
