	<brief_title>Local Application of Ozone Gas for Infected Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ozone gas has been used since World war I and is known for its wound healing properties by way of being a powerful oxidant that stimulates the antioxidant system, immunomodulation, microbicidal and perhaps other unknown mechanisms. It has largely been regarded as a complementary therapy form but with elucidation of it's biological actions and availability of reliable ozone generators it may form a novel treatment option for a range of medical conditions with ample literature available on wound healing. In this study it was used as an adjunct to conventional treatment i.e surgical procedures, antibiotics and wound care. It was locally applied as a gas though there are various other routes of administration such as major and minor autohematotherapy, intramuscular and intraarticular injections, rectal and vaginal insufflation.</detailed_description>
