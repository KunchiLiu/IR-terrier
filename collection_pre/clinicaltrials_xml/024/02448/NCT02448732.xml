	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy in prevention and control of ophthalmological neovascular diseases, in order to find a new strategy of treatment for ophthalmological neovascular diseases</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploratory Clinical Trials of ACM-1 in the Treatment of Ophthalmological Neovascular Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ophthalmological neovascular disease is one of the major causes of blindness in ocular diseases. Up to now, the major treatment strategies include: anti-VEGF therapy, laser therapy and surgery. Clinical treatment have revealed that intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF can effectively restrain neovascularization. Nevertheless, it requires repeated injections, may result in various complications, and may be ineffective in some patients. Therefore, it is necessary to find out other targets which causes retinal neovascularization, in order to find more effective treatments for patients who fail to respond to anti-VEGF therapy. Previous researches have shown that herb monomer (ACM-1) was effective in inhibiting leakage of retinal vessels and neovascularization. So in this study, patients with ophthalmological neovascular diseases will be treated with intravitreal injection of ACM-1, in order to investigate the role of intravitreal injection of ACM-1 therapy in prevention and control of ophthalmological neovascular diseases.</detailed_description>
