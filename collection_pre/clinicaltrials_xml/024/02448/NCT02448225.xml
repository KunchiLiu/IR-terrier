	<brief_summary>This clinical trial compares fluorine F 18 L-glutamate derivative BAY94-9392 (18F-FSPG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) to the standard of care fluorodeoxyglucose F-18 (18F-FDG) PET/CT in imaging patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer or indeterminate pulmonary nodules. PET/CT uses a radioactive glutamate (one of the common building blocks of protein) called 18F-FSPG which may be able to recognize differences between tumor and healthy tissue. Since tumor cells are growing, they need to make protein, and other building blocks, for cell growth that are made from glutamate and other molecules. PET/CT using a radioactive glutamate may be a more effective method of diagnosing lung cancer than the standard PET/CT using a radioactive glucose (sugar), such as 18F-FDG.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare the imaging characteristics of 18F-FSPG PET/CT with standard-of-care, 18F-FDG PET/CT. II. To compare the imaging characteristics of 18F-FSPG PET/CT to standard-of-care 18F-FDG PET/CT in patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer. III. To determine whether 18F-FSPG uptake in lung cancer can be predicted based on correlation with CD44 and amino acid transport system xc- (xC-) expression in surgical pathology specimens. OUTLINE: Patients undergo 18F-FDG PET/CT scan per standard of care. Within 15 working days, patients also undergo 18F-FSPG PET scan over 60 minutes followed by an 18F-FSPG PET/CT scan over 30 minutes. After completion of study, patients are followed up for 2 years if needed for diagnosis.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients at high risk for lung cancer as defined by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) eligibility criteria for lung cancer screening, with a newly discovered indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPN) (730 mm diameter) on CT (newly seen on medical imaging, without prior examinations to demonstrate that the lesion has been stable for two or more years), untreated USPSTF eligibility criteria: The patient is aged 40 to 80 years of age, AND Has a 30 or more packyear history of smoking, AND Currently smokes, or, if the patient has quit smoking, has quit within the last 15 years, or An adult patient with a newly diagnosed, untreated primary lung cancer, with a minimum diameter of 7 mm The patient must be able to give informed consent, which will include a layman's explanation of the estimated amount of additional radiation that the patient will receive from the investigational PET/CT scan using 18FFSPG Pregnant or lactating patients will be excluded, as will females of childbearing potential who refuse to undergo a serum or urinary betahuman chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) pregnancy test the day of either the 18FFSPG or the 18FFDG PET/CT scans Patients with a body weight of 400 pounds or more or a body habitus or disability that will not permit the imaging protocol to be performed The patient's inability to lie still for the entire imaging time (such as due to cough, severe arthritis), as assessed upon preenrollment screening, will not be enrolled A recognized active lung infection Previous systemic or radiation treatment for cancer of any type within 2 years Refusal to undergo a clinically indicated biopsy or a 24month period of followup, if needed, to resolve the etiology of their IPN (benign versus cancer) Nononcologic comorbidities suggesting a life span of less than two years if not treated, as determined by the potential subjects' treating physician</criteria>
