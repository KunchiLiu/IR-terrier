	<brief_summary>A cluster-randomized control trial will study the effect of insecticide-treated wall lining on malaria transmission in Bomi County, Liberia. Half of the villages enrolled in the study will receive insecticide-treated wall lining covering their walls and ceilings in addition to long-lasting insecticidal nets, while the other half will be protected by existing long-lasting insecticidal nets.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liberia Insecticide Treated Durable Wall Linings Study: Protocol for a Cluster Randomised Trial (DL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are the established vector control product for malaria control. In Bomi County Liberia, LLINs have been distributed but malaria prevalence in children under 5 remains high, with prevalence in study villages found to be 42% in April 2014. The major malaria vector species are resistant to pyrethroid insecticides approved for use in LLINs, and new control measures with non-pyrethroid active ingredients may protect the population.</detailed_description>
