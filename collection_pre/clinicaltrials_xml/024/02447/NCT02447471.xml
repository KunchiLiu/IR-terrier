	<brief_summary>Currently, BP is measured using an inflatable cuff wrapped around the patient's upper arm. This can be set to inflate every minute, but measurement may fail due to patient movement or shivering. Failed measurement occurs in up to 38% of patients. This study aims to determine how the Nexfin device - which measures BP using a cuff wrapped around a finger - compares to standard BP measurement.</brief_summary>
