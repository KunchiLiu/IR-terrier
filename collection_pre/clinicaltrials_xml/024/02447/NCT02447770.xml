	<brief_summary>Flavanols are plant-derived compounds commonly present in the human diet. Examples of flavanol-containing foods and beverages are apples, chocolate, tea, wine, berries, pomegranate and nuts. The consumption of flavanol-containing foods and beverages has been associated with improvements in cardiovascular health. In this study, the investigators hope to learn more about the effects of the consumption of increasing amounts of cocoa flavanols on blood pressure, platelet function and other metabolic parameters in healthy humans. This study was followed by a second study that aimed at investigating the effects of long term consumptions of cocoa flavanols on blood pressure, platelet function and other metabolic parameters in healthy humans.</brief_summary>
