	<brief_summary>This is a prospective randomized controlled study to evaluate feasibility and safety of early steroid withdrawal after 6mg/kg vs 4.5mg/kg Thymoglobulin induction therapy in kidney transplantation. Patients are enrolled from June, 2015 for 24 months. They are randomized to either 6mg/kg or 4.5mg/kg Thymoglobulin induction group. Steroid withdrawal is done within one week after kidney transplantation for all the patients. Maintenance immunosuppressants are Tacrolimus and Mycophenolate mofetil (or Myfortic). Primary outcome is a composite of biopsy-proven acute rejection, delayed graft function, graft loss or death within one year post transplant.</brief_summary>
