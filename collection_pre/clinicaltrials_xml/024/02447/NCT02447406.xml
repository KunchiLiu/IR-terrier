	<brief_summary>Phase Ib/II, single-arm study of AZD6094 (Volitinib) in combination with docetaxel, in advanced gastric adenocarcinoma patients with MET amplification as a second-line treatment. Phase Ib:Investigational product, dosage and mode of administration Volitinib is an orally available, potent, selective, small molecule c-MET inhibitor. Volitinib should be administered at least 200mg orally once a day in 21 days for achieving appropriate antitumor activity. Docetaxel 60 mg/m2 will be administered via intravenous access once every 3 weeks Phase II: Investigational product, dosage and mode of administration Volitinib is an orally available, potent, selective, small molecule c-MET inhibitor. Subjects will receive Volitinib once daily ( at the MTD determined from Phase Ib) for 21 days as one cycle. Docetaxel 60 mg/m2 will be administered via intravenous access once every 3 weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase Ib, Single-arm Study of AZD6094 (Volitinib) in Combination With Docetaxel, in Any Solid Cancer and Sequential Phase II, Single-arm Study of AZD6094 (Volitinib) in Combination With Docetaxel in Advanced Gastric Adenocarcinoma Patients With MET Amplification as a Second Line Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Volitinib is a potent and selective small molecule c-Met kinase inhibitor. Volitinib was found to inhibit c-Met kinase at the enzyme and cell levels with IC50s of 4 nM for both enzyme and Met phosphorylation in the cell. Consistent with its potent enzyme and cell activity, volitinib was found to inhibit cell growth in vitro against tumors with c-Met gene amplification in the absence of HGF stimulation with IC50s generally below 10 nM. It also potently inhibited HGF-stimulated cell proliferation against tumors with c-Met overexpression or carrying a HGF/c-Met autocrine loop. In a xenograft model Hs746T with c-Met gene amplification, suboptimal doses 0.6 mg/kg volitinib and 3 mg/kg docetaxel induced TGI(expand) of 55.8% and 80.8%, respectively, whereas combination resulted in a TGI by 101.1%, and statistical significance was seen between combination group and either of mono-therapy group. Plasma exposures of volitinib and docetaxel were determined after last dose at the end of study, and there was no significant difference between combination and single agent on exposures of either volitinib or docetaxel. More importantly, combination was well tolerant and no body weight loss was found in the animals. These results suggested that it would be worthwhile to study the combination use of volitinib and docetaxel in clinic.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Provision of fully informed consent prior to any study specific procedures. 2. Patients must be ≥20 years of age. 3. For Phase Ib: Have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of relapsed or refractory locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors for whom no alternative effective standard therapy is available or for whom standard therapy is considered unsuitable or intolerable. Although it is preferred to enroll patients with solid tumors harboring MET amplification, this will not be an enrollment requirement. For Phase II: Advanced gastric adenocarcinoma (including GEJ expand and maybe include in list of abbreviations) that has progressed during or after firstline therapy. The 1st line regimen must have contained doublet 5fluoropyrimidine and platinum based regimen. Relapse within 6 months of completion of adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy containing doublet 5fluoropyrimidine and platinumbased regimen could be considered as 1st line therapy. Patients with gastric adenocarcinoma harboring MET amplification by MET FISH. 4. Previous adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy is allowed, if completed more than 6 months prior to starting the 1st line therapy. 5. Provision or availability of biopsy sample for analysis; e.g mandatory pretreatment biopsy, or available diagnostic biopsy of sufficient quantity/quality 6.
