The 5th dose was given between the ages of 47 and 84 months. All 5 DTaP doses received were manufactured by GSK, depending on study objective (otherwise this criterion will not apply). Born in 1999 and later. Inclusion criteria for cases: • All individuals meeting above inclusion criteria who tested PCRpositive for pertussis and negative for parapertussis during the study period. Inclusion criteria for PCRnegative controls: • All individuals meeting above inclusion criteria who tested PCRnegative for both pertussis and parapertussis during the study period. Inclusion criteria for KPNCmatched controls: All individuals from the general KPNC population meeting above inclusion criteria who match a PCRpositive case on sex, age, race or ethnic group, and medical center. KPNC members on the day their matched case underwent the PCR test (anchor date). Individuals whose PCR test date (or anchor date) is less than 2 weeks after receiving their 5th DTaP dose. Individuals who were not KPNC members for greater than 3 months between their 5th DTaP dose and PCR test date (or anchor date). Individuals who received reduced antigen content pertussis vaccine (Tdap) or any pertussiscontaining vaccine after their 5th DTaP dose but before their PCR test date (or anchor date). Exclusion criteria for controls: • Individuals will be excluded from serving as a control once they test positive for pertussis.</criteria>
