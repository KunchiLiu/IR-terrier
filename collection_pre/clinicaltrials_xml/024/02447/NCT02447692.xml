	<brief_title>Proportional Assist Ventilation for Minimizing the Duration of Mechanical Ventilation: The PROMIZING Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with acute respiratory failure require mechanical ventilation to help them breathe until they recover from their acute illness. Although mechanical ventilation is necessary to sustain life in such situations, it can induce weakness of the respiratory muscles which may lead to prolonged dependence on the ventilator. Prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation is associated with increased mortality, morbidity and costs to the healthcare system. Thus, a main goal of assisted mechanical ventilation is to reduce the patient's respiratory distress while maintaining some respiratory muscle activity. To attain this goal, the amount of ventilator assistance should theoretically be adjusted to target normal or reasonable levels of respiratory effort. Modes of Mechanical Ventilation: Proportional assist ventilation with load-adjustable gain factors (PAV+) is a mode of mechanical ventilation which delivers assistance to breathe in proportion to the patient's effort. The proportional assistance, called the gain, can be adjusted by the clinician to maintain the patient's respiratory effort or workload within a reasonable range. This is the only mode of ventilation which allows for measurement and targeting of a specific range of respiratory muscle activity by the patient. Pressure support ventilation (PSV) is a mode of ventilation which is considered the current standard of care for assisting breathing of patients during the recovery phase of acute respiratory failure. Several studies have shown short term advantages of PAV over PSV, including improved patient-ventilator synchronization, improved adaptability to changes in patient effort, and improved sleep quality. Goal of this Randomized Controlled Trial: To demonstrate that for patients with acute respiratory failure, ventilation with PAV+, being more physiological, will result in a shorter duration of time spent on mechanical ventilation than ventilation with PSV.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A staged enrolment process will be used to identify patients eligible to be enrolled and randomized in the study. At each stage of enrolment, specific inclusion/exclusion criteria will apply. To progress to the next stage, patients must continue to meet the criteria from the prior stages. "Screening" Age 18 years or older Intubated and receiving any mode of invasive mechanical ventilation ≥ 24 hours "Consenting" Ability to trigger ventilator breaths On Assist/Control volumecycled ventilation: Plateau pressure ≤ 30 cm H2O with a tidal volume of 68 ml/kg of predicted body weight OR On Assist/Control pressurecontrolled ventilation: Pressure control plus Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) ≤ 30 cm H2O OR On Pressure Support ventilation: Pressure support plus PEEP ≤ 30 cm H2O Partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) ≥ 60 mmHg or arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) ≥ 90% on fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ≤ 0.60 and PEEP ≤ 15 cm H2O Metabolic disorders corrected: power of hydrogen (pH) ≥7.32 Stable hemodynamic status: stable or decreasing doses of vasopressors for for ≥6 hours Anticipate ongoing need for ventilation &gt;24 hours "Pressure Support Trial" Inclusion Criteria Patient/substitute decision maker (SDM) has provided consent Upon review of Screening and Consenting criteria the patient still passes. Patients will undergo specific tests to determine eligibility for randomization. The tests are the Pressure Support Trial (PST), and if applicable, the continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) trial and if applicable, the Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT). Patients will undergo the CPAP trial if they meet "Weaning Criteria" "Weaning Criteria" Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2)≥ 90% on FiO2 ≤0.40 and PEEP ≤8 centimeter of water (cmH2O) pH ≥7.32 Vasopressor requirements no higher than norepinephrine 0.1 ug/kg/min or equivalent "Randomization" Inclusion Criteria Upon review if the patient still passes and the patient has passed the PST.

Hemorrhage, stroke, tumour) causing elevated intracranial pressure, or impaired control of breathing, or requiring specific ventilator adjustments (i.e. To attain specific carbon dioxide (CO2) target) or requiring neurosurgical intervention Known or suspected severe neuropathy or myopathy or high spinal cord injury likely to result in prolonged or chronic ventilator dependence (eg.
