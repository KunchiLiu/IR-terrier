	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effect of oral doses of pilocarpine on salivary secretion in healthy male and female subjects. In addition, pharmacodynamic effect on static pupillometry will be evaluated as well as pharmacokinetics and safety and tolerability of oral doses of pilocarpine in healthy subjects.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject has a body mass index range of 18.5 to 30.0 kg/m2, inclusive. The subject weighs at least 50 kg. [screening] Female subject must either: Be of nonchildbearing potential: 1. Postmenopausal (defined as at least 1 year without any menses) prior to screening, or 2. Documented surgically sterile. Or, if of childbearing potential: 1.

And, if heterosexually active, agree to consistently use 2 forms of highly effective birth control (at least 1 of which must be a barrier method) starting at screening and throughout the clinical study period after the final study drug administration. Highly effective forms of birth control include: Consistent and correct usage of established oral contraception; Injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception; Established intrauterine device or intrauterine system; Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository. Female subject must agree not to breastfeed starting at screening and throughout the clinical study period, and for 28 days after the final study drug administration. Female subject must not donate ova starting at screening and throughout the clinical study period, and for 28 days after the final study drug administration. Male subject must not donate sperm starting at screening and throughout the clinical study period, and for 90 days after last study drug administration. Subject agrees not to participate in another interventional study while participation in the present clinical study, defined as signing the informed consent form until completion of the last study visit. Female subject who has been pregnant within 6 months prior to screening assessment or breastfeeding within 3 months prior to screening. Subject has a known or suspected hypersensitivity to pilocarpine or any components of the formulation used. Subject has clinically significant, uncontrolled cardiorenal disease, uncontrolled asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, current or previous peptic ulcer disease and/or any other chronic disease at risk for cholinergic agonists. Subject has a condition of the eye which could be affected by the intake of pilocarpine (e.g., acute iritis). Subject has any of the liver chemistry tests (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], gamma glutamyl transferase, total bilirubin [TBL]) above 1.5 Ã— the upper limit of normal (ULN). In such a case, the assessment may be repeated once, on day 1. Subject has any clinically significant history of allergic conditions (including drug allergies, asthma, eczema or anaphylactic reactions, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of dosing). Subject has any history or evidence of any clinically significant cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, endocrinologic, hematologic, hepatic, immunologic, metabolic, urologic, pulmonary, neurologic, dermatologic, psychiatric, renal and/or other major disease or malignancy. Subject has/had febrile illness or symptomatic, viral, bacterial (including upper respiratory infection) or fungal (noncutaneous) infection within 1 week prior to admission to the clinical unit (day 1). Subject has any clinically significant abnormality of the physical examination, ECG and clinical study protocoldefined clinical laboratory tests at screening or day 1. Subject has a mean pulse &lt; 50 or &gt; 90 bpm; mean systolic BP &gt; 140 mmHg; mean diastolic BP &gt; 90 mmHg (vital signs measurements taken in triplicate after subject has been resting in supine position for 5 minutes; pulse will be measured automatically) on admission to the clinical unit (day 1). If the mean BP exceeds the limits above, 1 additional triplicate can be taken. Subject has a mean corrected QT interval using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &gt; 430 ms (for male subjects) and &gt; 450 ms (for female subjects) at screening. If the mean QTcF exceeds the limits above, 1 additional triplicate ECG can be taken on day 1. Subject uses any prescribed or nonprescribed drugs (including Salagen tablets or pilocarpinecontaining eye drops in the month prior to first study drug administration / vitamins, natural and herbal remedies [e.g., St. John's wort] in the 2 weeks prior to first study drug administration) except for occasional use of paracetamol (up to 2 g/day) and except for use of contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy. Subject has a history of smoking within 1 month prior to first study drug administration (day 1). Subject has a history of drinking &gt; 21 units of alcohol/week for male subjects or &gt; 14 units of alcohol/week for female subjects (1 unit = 10 g pure alcohol = 250 mL of beer [5%] or 35 mL of spirits [35%] or 100 mL of wine [12%]) within 3 months prior to admission to the clinical unit (day 1). Subject has consumed grapefruit or Seville oranges or grapefruit / Seville orangecontaining products within 72 hours prior to admission to the clinical unit (day 1). Subject uses any inducer of metabolism (e.g., barbiturates, rifampin) within 1 month prior to admission to the clinical unit (day 1). Subject uses any drugs of abuse within 3 months prior to admission to the clinical unit (day 1). Subject had significant blood loss, donated 1 unit (500 mL) of blood or more, or received a transfusion of any blood or blood products within 60 days or donated plasma within 7 days prior to admission to the clinical unit (day 1). Subject has a positive serology test for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis A virus antibodies (immunoglobulin M), hepatitis C virus antibodies, or antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV1) and/or type 2 (HIV2) at screening. Subject participated in any clinical study or has been treated with any investigational drugs within 28 days prior to screening.
