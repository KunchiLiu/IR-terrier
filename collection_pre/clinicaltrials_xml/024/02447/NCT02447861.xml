	<brief_summary>The 3q29 deletion syndrome is caused by a deletion of a small part of human chromosome 3, and the duplication syndrome is caused by a duplication of this same small region. The purpose of this study is to understand the medical and behavioral consequences of these syndromes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characterization of 3q29 Deletion Syndrome and 3q29 Duplication Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People with 3q29 deletion syndrome are missing a small part of a region on human chromosome 3, and people with 3q29 duplication syndrome have an extra part of their chromosome 3. Sometimes babies are born with a deletion or duplication of part of human chromosome 3, even though their parents have an intact chromosome 3. This is called de novo (or new) abnormalities.</detailed_description>
