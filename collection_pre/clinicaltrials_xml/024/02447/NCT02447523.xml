	<brief_summary>Worldwide, the rising incidence of obesity has led to the identification of an obesity related syndrome, called metabolic. This syndrome is characterized by central obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance and altered lipid levels. Taking into consideration the rising incidence of obesity, anesthetists will more frequently encounter patients with metabolic syndrome, in their everyday practice. Moreover, the comorbidities that are related to the metabolic syndrome, increase the risk for perioperative complications. Therefore, strategies that will evaluate and modify the risk will be of great importance in the management of these patients, in order to maximize peri-anaesthetic and surgical safety. The aim of the study is to assess the incidence of metabolic syndrome and the impact of its presence on the outcome of patients undergoing elective laparotomy.</brief_summary>
