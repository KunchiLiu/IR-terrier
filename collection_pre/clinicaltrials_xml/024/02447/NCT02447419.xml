	<brief_summary>This study is a single-arm,phase II study of gefitinib in patient with epidermal growth factor receptor amplification Refractory solid tumors. Gefitinib 250 mg will be administered orally daily. To investigate the efficacy and safety of gefitinib in patient with epidermal growth factor receptor amplification Refractory solid tumors.</brief_summary>
