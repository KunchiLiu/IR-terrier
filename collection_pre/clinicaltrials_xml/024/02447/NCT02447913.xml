	<brief_summary>The proposed project will help in assessing the effectiveness of a demand-side financing project that provides family planning services bundled in a package of postnatal care and infant immunization services. This approach will use postnatal and infant health as a gateway to family planning - building confidence among the client and her influencers in the provider and repositioning family planning as part of a continuum of care to ensure the health of the mother and the infant. Vouchers will help in creating demand among poor women for the Family planning and child immunization. Also incentivizing providers against each voucher will help in improving their counselling skills as they will spend more time with voucher clients resulting is a satisfied client and better compliance with Family planning methods.</brief_summary>
