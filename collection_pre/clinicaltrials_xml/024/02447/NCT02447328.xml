	<brief_title>A Single Arm, Tolerability and Safety Phase IV Study of Fulvestrant(Faslodex® ) as 2nd Line and Later Therapy in Postmenopausal Women With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a Phase 4, single-arm, safety and tolerability study of fulvestrant (Faslodex®) as 2nd line therapy in postmenopausal women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. All of enrolled patients in this study will be injected fulvestrant (Faslodex®). This study will be performed for about 3 years and approximately 100 patients(actual target will be 80 treated patients) will be enrolled in about 10 investigational sites. After obtaining the written informed consent from the patients, the information of demographic and medical history will be collected and laboratory tests will be performed. Patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be injected the fulvestrant (Faslodex®) 500mg/month for about 6 months with an additional 500mg dose given 14 days after the initial dose injection. The information of adverse events will be collected after the 1st dose of IP injection. In case that the evaluation of tumor response might be performed in regular clinical practice, those data will also be collected as well. The quality of life will also be measured.</detailed_description>
