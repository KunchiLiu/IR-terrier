	<detailed_description>Scans with a TopQ score below the optimum cut-off should be considered to be poor or unacceptable quality, and scans with a TopQ score above the cut-off should be considered good or acceptable quality. The study will evaluate the predetermined cut-off values by investigating measurement variability of scans.</detailed_description>
