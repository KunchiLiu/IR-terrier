	<detailed_description>Proliferative diabetic retinopathy(PDR) is the leading cause of visual loss in diabetic patients. The operation indication includes non-absorbed vitreous haemorrhage, dense bleeding in front of the macular, proliferative vitreoretinopathy traction macular, tractional retinal detachment combined break, severe progressive fiber vascular proliferation and vitreous haemorrhage combined with early iris neovascularization. Due to VEGF levels rise in vitreous cavity of PDR patients, some inflammatory cytokines involved in, make easy bleeding during surgery and heavier inflammatory reaction postoperation,thus affecting the curative effect of the operation. Ranibizumab as angiogenesis inhibitors, has widely applied in the treatment of age-related macular degeneration, won the recognition of ophthalmologists. Some scholars try to expand the application in diabetic macular edema, also obtained the good curative effect.Some scholars also applied the angiogenesis inhibitors to the diabetes retinopathy before surgery in the hope to reduce the occurrence of intraoperative bleeding.Compared with bevacizumab, the short half-life of lucentis, and thus reduce the inhibition of VEGF system risk. In this project, the investigators will inject lucentis into vitreous cavity before surgery of PDR, and observe the effect and complications of the operation, compared with triamcinolone acetonide group(the control group); At the same time the cytokines level of VEGF, pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-beta), interleukin 6 (IL - 6) and interleukin 8 (IL - 8) will be detected before and after pretreatment with lucentis or triamcinolone acetonide, and the cytokines concentration change will be compared between two groups, the mechanism of PDR will be further clarified and theoretical basis for looking for treatment strategies will be a set.</detailed_description>
