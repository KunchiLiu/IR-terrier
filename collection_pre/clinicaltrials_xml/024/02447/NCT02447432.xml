	<brief_summary>The primary aim of the study is to demonstrate that an investigational 4-dose presentation of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine with preservative is non-inferior to the licensed presentation of Synflorix (preservative-free) in terms of immune responses to the 10 vaccine pneumococcal serotypes (primary objective) and to the vaccine-related pneumococcal serotype 19A (first secondary objective), after administration of a 3-dose primary vaccination course at 6, 10 and 18 weeks of age co-administered with the first 2 doses of DTPw-HBV/Hib vaccine given at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age (according to the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) schedule). In addition, the study will also assess the safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity and antibody persistence (approximately 7 months following primary vaccination) of the 4-dose presentation of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine given as primary vaccination schedule at 6, 10 and 18 weeks of age followed by a booster dose at 38 weeks. This study also aims at assessing the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the 4-dose presentation of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine when given as a booster dose at approximately 9 months of age.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects for whom, in the opinion of the investigator, the parent(s)/Legally Acceptable Representative(s) [LAR(s)] can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol (e.g., return for vaccination and followup visits). A male or female between, and including 610 weeks (4276 days) of age at the time of the first vaccination. Written or oral, signed or thumbprinted informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject. For all subjects, the consent form should be countersigned by a witness. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Born fullterm (i.e., after a gestation period from 37 to 42 weeks). Child in care. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs since birth. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed. Planned administration of longacting immunemodifying drugs at any time during the study period (e.g., infliximab). Administration or planned administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol administered during the period starting from 30 days before each dose of study vaccines and ending 30 days after with the following exceptions: Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational vaccine/product Previous vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, H. influenzae type b and/or S. pneumoniae. History of, or intercurrent diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, and H. influenzae type b disease. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccines. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required). Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness. History of any neurological disorders or seizures. Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment. Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C for oral, axillary or tympanic route, or ≥ 38.0°C on rectal route. The preferred route for recording temperature in this study will be axillary. Subjects with a minor illness without fever may, be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products since birth or planned administration during the study period (Hepatitis B immunoglobulins at birth are allowed). Any medical condition which might interfere with the assessment of the study objectives in the opinion of the investigator.</criteria>
