	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to develop a novel platform for allo-SCT in multiple myeloma (MM) with the idea of maximizing anti-myeloma effect with conditioning and minimizing GvHD (graft versus host disease). Specifically, the investigators will use the Flu/Mel (fludarabine and melphalan) regimen. For GvHD prophylaxis, the investigators use the Hopkins PT-Cy (post-transplant cyclophosphamide) platform with the novelty of adding tocilizumab as both an anti-myeloma therapy and as a method to reduce GvHD. IL-6 has an important role in promoting the growth of myeloma cells and progression of disease.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed diagnosis of myeloma. Between 18 and 70 years of age (inclusive). Karnofsky performance status ≥ 50% or ECOG performance score of ≤ 2 Completion of last antimyeloma therapy (if any) must occur at least 14 days before conditioning. Must have an HLAmatched sibling, HLAmatched unrelated donor, or a related haploidentical donor: Available HLAmatched sibling or unrelated donor must meet the following criteria: At least 18 years of age HLA donor/recipient match based on at least lowresolution typing per institutional standards (syngeneic donors [identical twins] are excluded) In the investigator's opinion, is in general good health, and medically able to tolerate leukapheresis required for harvesting stem cells No active hepatitis Negative for HTLV and HIV Not pregnant OR Available haploidentical donor must meet the following criteria: Bloodrelated family member (sibling (full or half), offspring, parent, cousin, niece or nephew, aunt or uncle, or grandparent) At least 18 years of age HLAhaploidentical donor/recipient match by at least lowresolution typing per institutional standards In the investigator's opinion, is in general good health, and medically able to tolerate leukapheresis required for harvesting stem cells No active hepatitis Negative for HTLV and HIV Not pregnant Normal bone marrow and organ function as defined below within 14 days prior to first study drug dose (conditioning regimen): Total bilirubin ≤ 2.5 mg/dl AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN Creatinine ≤ 2.0 x ULN OR estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 by CockcroftGault Formula (See Appendix C) Oxygen saturation ≥ 90% on room air LVEF ≥ 40% FEV1 and FVC ≥ 40% predicted, DLCOc ≥ 40% predicted Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry through Day +100 visit. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately. Able to understand and willing to sign an IRB approved written informed consent document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable). Receiving renal replacement therapy, hemodialysis, or peritoneal dialysis. Presence of another concurrent malignancy requiring treatment. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to melphalan, cyclophosphamide, or other agents used in the study. Presence of an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Previous treatment with tocilizumab (TCZ). Immunization with a live/attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to conditioning. Any history of recent serious bacterial, viral, fungal, or other opportunistic infections, precluding a stem cell transplant according to the treating physician. Serologic evidence of HIV Active infection with Hepatitis A, B, or C. Active infection is defined as serologic positivity and elevated liver function tests. History of tuberculosis Active infection with EBV as defined as EBV viral load ≥ 10,000 copies per mL of whole blood; EBV viral load testing is only required if the patient has clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of active EBV infection Active infection with CMV as defined as CMV viral load ≥ 10,000 copies per mL of whole blood; CMV viral load testing is only required if the patient has clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of active CMV infection History of complicated diverticulitis, including fistulae, abscess formation or gastrointestinal (GI) perforation. Preexisting CNS demyelination or seizure disorders Major surgery within preceding 8 weeks Body weight &gt;150kg History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to human, humanized, or murine monoclonal antibodies.</criteria>
