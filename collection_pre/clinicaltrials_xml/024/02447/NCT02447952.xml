	<brief_summary>Study 201283 is an exploratory, non-controlled, non-drug study in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) subjects. This study is being conducted as the first step for developing new meaningful measure(s) which might prove to be more effective than existing measures for monitoring clinical function and disease course in ALS. The objective of this study is to test novel measures of movement/physical activity, heart rate and speech and explore how they measure disease progression by evaluating their relationship to gold standard measures of function. This study will be conducted in two phases. A variable length Pilot Phase to test biotelemetry instruments and algorithms reliability and ease of use/acceptance. Approximately 5 subjects will have at least 1 clinic visit to perform a series of set reference tasks while wearing the accelerometer and electrode. Subjects will also continuously wear the accelerometer and electrode in their routine home-life setting for approximately 3 days after the clinic visit (i.e., home monitoring). Subjects in the Pilot Phase will continue in the study and participate in the Core Study Phase. A 48 week Core Study Phase will be conducted to evaluate how measures of movement/physical activity, speech and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) relate to ALS disease progression. During this phase, a maximum of 25 subjects will be enrolled. Subjects will attend 5 clinic visits to perform gold standard measures of function and perform a series of set reference tasks while wearing the accelerometer and electrode. In between clinic visits, every month subjects will attach the accelerometer and electrode and wear it for approximately 3 days in their home. A telephone contact with the subject will be made by the site at the end of each 3-day home monitoring period.

	<criteria>Between 18 and 80 years of age, inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Diagnosed with ALS by a neurologist with expertise in ALS. For subjects with bulbar onset there must be objective limb involvement of at least one limb. Diagnosed with ALS within 18 months of symptom onset. Subjects must be ambulatory (i.e., must not be confined to a wheelchair). Male and female subjects. Capable of giving signed (or verbal consent or assent where applicable) informed consent as described in Protocol which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and in protocol. Capable and willing to comply with the requirements of the protocol (either by themselves or with assistance). Neurological (other than the subject's ALS) or nonneurological comorbidities (e.g. joint disease, respiratory disease) which limit mobility. Clinically significant cognitive impairment in the opinion of the investigator. Regionally restricted forms of ALS, or other atypical variants: Isolated corticobulbar pattern of ALS with normal ambulation; Flail arm syndrome; Primary lateral sclerosis; Signs of chronic partial denervation restricted to a single limb; ALS parkinsonism dementia complex Subjects requiring mechanical ventilation (noninvasive ventilation for sleep apnoea is allowed). Historical or current evidence of clinically significant uncontrolled disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through participation or impact the study assessments or endpoints. Presence of an active implantable cardiac medical device (e.g., pacemaker or implantable cardioverterdefibrillator) or at a high risk for needing external defibrillation. History of skin hypersensitivity to adhesives. Current participation in a clinical trial which in the opinion of the investigator and GSK medical monitor might impact the objectives of this study.</criteria>
