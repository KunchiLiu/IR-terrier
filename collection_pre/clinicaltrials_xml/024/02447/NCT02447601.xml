	<brief_title>Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics of Simvastatin When Coadministered With PEX168 in Healthy Adult Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was an open-label, sequential, single-center study that evaluated the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin when coadministered with PEX168 in healthy adult subjects. The total duration of each subject's participation in the study was approximately 10 weeks, which included up to a 14-day Screening Period, a 34-day Treatment Period, and an approximately 4-week Follow-up Period. Center: This study was conducted at a single site in Shanghai Mental Health Center (SMHC)of China Treatment.All subjects receives a single 40-mg oral dose of simvastatin on Day 1 followed by 5 weekly 200μg doses of PEX168 injected subcutaneously beginning on Day 3 and a second single 40-mg oral dose of simvastatin on Day 33.</detailed_description>
