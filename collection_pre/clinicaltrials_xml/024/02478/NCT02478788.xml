	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to see the affects of the study medication called mixed amphetamine salts-extended release (MAS-XR) on brain function by taking brain pictures. The researchers also want to see if MAS-XR makes your child more or less likely to develop problems like acting out (i.e. periods of irritability, agitation, aggression). MAS-XR is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults, children and adolescents.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neuroimaging Study of Risk Factors for Adolescent Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A 12-week prospective study of two groups of adolescents (ages 13-17 years) with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); 1) ADHD adolescents with a parent with bipolar disorder ("high-risk") and 2) ADHD adolescents without any first or second degree-relatives with bipolar disorder ("low-risk"). Patients will be evaluated using diagnostic interviews and symptom ratings, will receive neuroimaging scans (fMRI, DTI, 1H MRS), and will then be assigned to treatment. Low-risk ADHD adolescents (n=60) will receive treatment with open-label mixed amphetamine salts-extended release (MAS-XR), which is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for the treatment of ADHD and is a commonly prescribed psychostimulant medication for adolescents with ADHD. High-risk ADHD adolescents will be randomized to double-blind treatment with MAS-XR (n=60) or placebo (n=60). Following initiation of treatment, the ADHD adolescents will have regularly scheduled visits during which symptom and tolerability ratings will be performed. Healthy subjects (n=60) will be recruited from the community and will not receive medication but will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at the same intervals to assess normal variability in imaging parameters between time points as well as to adjust and interpret comparisons within patients (i.e., whether patient values are changing toward or away from those of healthy adolescents). Neuroimaging (fMRI, DTI,1H MRS) evaluations will be performed at baseline and Week 12 (or termination).</detailed_description>
