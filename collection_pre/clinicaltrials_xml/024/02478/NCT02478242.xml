	<brief_title>Trial to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Nafamostat Mesilate During Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients were randomly assigned to the nafamostat mesilate (NM) group or the no anticoagulant (NA) group. In patients assigned to the NM group, NM (20mg/h) was used for maintenance anticoagulation. Whereas, in patients assigned to the NA group, normal saline (2mL/h) was infused for continuous renal replacement therapy.</detailed_description>
