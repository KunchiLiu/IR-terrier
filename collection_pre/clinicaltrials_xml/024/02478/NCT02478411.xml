	<brief_title>Early Cycloergometric Physiotherapy in Critically Ill Patients With Invasive Mechanical Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cycloergometric treatment is described to improve the functional and motor status of critically ill subjects. However, there are few studies comparing cycloergometric physiotherapy and conventional physiotherapy in intensive care subjects under mechanical ventilation. The most relevant of these studies conducted by Burtin et al showed beneficial effects of cycloergometric treatment. However, the duration of the physiotherapy sessions in this study differed between groups as cycloergometric group received a double daily dose of treatment. It is known that the intensity of physiotherapy also affects the functional and motor status. For this reason, the investigators designed a randomized controlled study with early cycloergometric or conventional treatment, with the same intensity between groups to analyze objective functional and motor endpoints.</detailed_description>
