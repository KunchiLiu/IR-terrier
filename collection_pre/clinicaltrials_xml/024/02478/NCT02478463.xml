	<brief_summary>Cabotegravir (CAB) long-acting (LA) is a promising candidate for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pre exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) due to its potent antiretroviral activity and infrequent dosing requirements. Currently, the CAB concentrations achieved in the anatomical sites associated with sexual HIV transmission following the proposed 600 milligram (mg) intramuscular (IM) PrEP dose are unknown. These data will enhance our understanding of CAB distribution to the anatomical mucosal tissue believed to be relevant to sexual HIV-1 transmission and supplement the data to support future PrEP clinical trial development. The primary objective is to determine the PK concentrations of CAB following LA administration in plasma and in vaginal tissue (VT), cervical tissue (CT), and cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) in healthy women and in rectal tissue (RT) and rectal fluid (RF) in healthy men and women following a single 600 mg IM dose. This will be a Phase 1, open label study in healthy subjects to assess the pharmacokinetics of CAB LA in the plasma and mucosal locations associated with sexual HIV-1 transmission: vaginal tissue, cervical tissue, cervicovaginal fluid, rectal tissue, and rectal fluid. The study will consist of a screening period, a 28-day oral lead-in phase at a dose of 30 mg per day followed by a 14-21 day washout period, and a single dose of CAB LA 600 mg as an IM (intragluteal) injection with compartmental pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling for up to 12 weeks. Subjects will return for safety assessments and plasma PK sampling at Week 24 and Week 36 post-injection and undergo a follow-up/withdrawal visit at Week 52 post-injection</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Healthy as determined by the investigator or medically qualified designee based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s) which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the investigator in consultation with the medical monitor agree and document that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. A single repeat of a procedure or lab parameter is allowed to determine eligibility. Body weight &gt;= 40 kilogram (kg) and body mass index (BMI) within the range 18.5 to 35 kg /meter square (inclusive). Male or female A female subject is eligible to participate if she is premenopausal, has an intact uterus and cervix, AND is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative human chorionic gonadotrophin [hCG] test), not lactating, and at least one of the following conditions applies: a) Nonreproductive potential defined as: Premenopausal females with one of the following: Documented tubal ligation, Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with followup confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion, Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy. b)Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the options listed below in the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Modified List of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of Reproductive Potential (FRP) requirements from 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication and until at least five terminal halflives OR until any continuing pharmacologic effect has ended, whichever is longer (can be up to 62 weeks on study) after the last dose of study medication and completion of the followup visit. Female subjects desiring pregnancy or foresee that they might wish to become pregnant within 52 weeks of receiving a CAB LA injection must be excluded. All subjects participating in the study must be counseled on safe sexual practices including the use of effective barrier methods to minimize risk of HIV transmission. Capable of giving signed informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and in this protocol. Liver Function: alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase &gt; upper limit of normal (ULN) Total bilirubin &gt;ULN (isolated total bilirubin &gt;ULN is acceptable if total bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%) Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones). Corrected QT (QTc) Interval: QTc &gt; 450 milliseconds (msec): NOTES: The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Bazette's formula (QTcB), machineread or manually overread. QTcB will be used to determine eligibility for an individual subject. Exclusion criteria for screening electrocardiogram (ECG) (a single repeat is allowed for eligibility determination): Heart rate (&lt;45 and &gt;100 beats per minute (bpm) for males and &lt;50 and &gt;100 bpm for females; QRS duration: &gt;120 msec; QTc interval: &gt;450 msec for males and females The subject's systolic blood pressure is outside the range of 90140 millimetre (mm) mercury (Hg), or diastolic blood pressure is outside the range of 4590 mmHg.
