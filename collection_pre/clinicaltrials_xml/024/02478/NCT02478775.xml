	<brief_summary>Excess maternal weight, especially obesity, influences almost every aspect of fertility, from conception to problems during pregnancy. The investigators will use novel statistical methods to clarify the hormonal changes behind reproductive health conditions. A better understanding of reproductive hormonal changes in obese women may offer a way to identify new treatments.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dysregulation of FSH in Obesity: Functional and Statistical Analysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis. Insufficient FSH (Follicle-stimulating hormone) pulsatility, as seen in obesity, results in inadequate folliculogenesis and reduced ovarian steroid and protein production. AIM: To test the hypothesis that insufficient FSH pulsatility, as seen in obesity, results in inadequate folliculogenesis and reduced ovarian steroid and protein production. The investigators will determine if exogenous FSH administered in a pulsatile fashion results in a significant increase of ovarian hormones in obese women. Serial inhibin B and E2 levels will be measured in obese and normal weight women undergoing frequent blood sampling studies before and after GnRH (Gonadotropin-releasing hormone) antagonist blockade.</detailed_description>
