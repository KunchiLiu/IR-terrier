	<brief_summary>Aims: Prospective evaluation of patients with a suspicion or diagnosis of Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to evaluate osophageal motility before and during therapy Material and methods: The investigators prospectively perform manometry in patients with or with symptoms consistent with IBD. The investigators evaluate esophageal motility with high resolution manometry before, during and after IBD therapy. Clinical data are also collected to find possible correlations. The study do not modify the planned IBD therapy, but observe motility findings.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Esophageal Motility Disease Screening in Patient With Suspicion or Diagnosis of IBD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oesophageal motility is measured with the high resolution manometry in order to detect pathologic peristaltic amplitude values among patient before and after therapy (mesalazine, steroids, biologicals) compared to the standard values detected among the normal population. Diagnosic intervention like oesophagoduodenoscopy, colonoscopy and stenosis ballon dilation are allowed as are part of the IBD therapy and follow up. No other interventions are administered to participants during this study.</detailed_description>
