	<brief_summary>The patients were allocated randomly to receive remote preconditioning group (RIPC group, R) or not (Control group, C) using sealed envelopes with the options inside the sealed envelope of R and C before anaesthesia induction. The registered nurse who did not participate in patient care and was blind to the study performed the all randomization process. All medical staffs who involved the patient care were blind to the study. All data were collected by trained observers who were blind to the study and did not participate in patient care</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Remote Ischemic Preconditioning on Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction in Total Knee Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RIPC was performed just after anesthesia induction and before the tourniquet application for the operation site. The tourniquet was applied at the opposite site of thigh in the both groups. The thigh was covered with blanket to conceal the tourniquet inflation and deflation. For R group, 3 cycles of tourniquet inflation for 5 minutes with 2 Ã— systemic systolic arterial blood pressure of arrival at operation room and deflation were performed. For C group, the tourniquet was applied with same manner for R group except inflation pressure of 0 mmHg. The tourniquet pressure according to the randomization was set by the registered nurse who participated in the patients' allocation. The monitor of tourniquet pressure was sealed for blindness.</detailed_description>
