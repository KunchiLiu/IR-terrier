	<detailed_description>Patients undergoing surgery for esophageal cancer have a high risk for postoperative deterioration of lung function and pulmonal complications. This may be partly due to one-lung ventilation during the thoracic part of the operation. This often encounters for prolonged periods of reconvalescence and reduced quality of life, apart from socioeconomic disadvantages. Physical preconditioning has become a crucial leverage to optimize fitness and lung function in patients scheduled for esophagectomy, in particular during the interval of neoadjuvant therapy.</detailed_description>
