	<brief_summary>Schizophrenia is associated with a wide range of symptoms impacting a number of different domains, including cognitive impairment. Given the array of cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia and their relationship to daily functioning, numerous research groups have examined the impact of cognitive remediation on many aspects of cognition. However, it is currently unclear as to which domains of cognition should be targeted to produce the most widespread and durable benefits for schizophrenia patients. It may be the case that targeting lower-level cognitive processes that are important for higher-level and more complex aspects of cognition may produce the most widespread benefits in cognition and everyday functioning. Relatively few studies have examined the effects of working memory or processing speed training on individuals with schizophrenia, as most studies examine broad-based remediation programs. Thus, there is a need for targeted working memory and processing speed training studies to better understand the mechanisms of cognitive enhancement through training in patients. This study will aim to: 1) investigate near-transfer gains associated with working memory and processing speed training in schizophrenia patients, 2) investigate far-transfer gains associated with working memory and processing speed training (i.e., gains in other neurocognitive domains and social cognition), and 3) investigate real-world gains associated with training (i.e., gains in daily functioning). Towards this aim, 81 schizophrenia patients will be recruited and randomly assigned to a working memory training group, a processing speed training group, or a no training control group. Training will be completed at home for 30 minutes per day, 5 days per week, for a total of 10 weeks. Neurocognitive, social cognitive, and daily functioning measures will be administered both pre- and post-training to detect training-related gains.</brief_summary>
