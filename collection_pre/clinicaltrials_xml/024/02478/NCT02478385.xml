	<detailed_description>In the last decade, there has been an increased interest in exploring the impact of the birth environment on midwifery practice and the women's birth experiences. Results from these studies show that a home-like birth environment has positive effects on both midwifery practice and the birth experience. The hormone oxytocin that causes contractions during labour may play an important role in this context. The hormone is released when being in a safe, secure and confident environment. Therefore, it is a reasonable assumption that the birth environment also has an impact on birth outcomes. To investigate this assumption one traditional labour room was transformed to an experimental labour room. The design of the room is inspired by knowledge from evidence-based healthcare design, which describes bringing nature into the room. Furthermore, it is possible for the parents to design their own birth setting by choosing atmosphere through sound, light and nature scenes.</detailed_description>
