	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of MK-3641 (short ragweed [Ambrosia artemisiifolia] extract, MK-3641, SCH 039641, RAGWITEK™) sublingual immunotherapy tablets in children aged 5 to 17 years with ragweed-induced allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis with or without asthma. The primary hypothesis of this study is that administration of MK-3641 sublingual immunotherapy tablets to children 5 to 17 years of age, compared with placebo, will result in a significant reduction in rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms and medication use over the peak ragweed season (RS).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Is between the ages of 4 and 17 years (inclusive) at enrollment in this study and is at least 5 years old at randomization Has a clinical history of significant ragweed polleninduced allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis of ≥1 year (at least 1 season for ages 4 to 6 years) or ≥2 years (at least 2 seasons for ages 7 to 17 years) duration diagnosed by a physician (with or without asthma) and have received treatment for the condition during the previous ragweed season If female, agrees to remain abstinent or use (or have their partner use) an acceptable method of birth control within the projected duration of the study. Has a clinical history of symptomatic seasonal allergic rhinitis (and/or asthma) due to another allergen, which has required regular medication during, or potentially overlapping, the ragweed season Has a clinical history of significant symptomatic perennial allergic rhinitis and/or asthma due to an allergen to which the subject is regularly exposed during the ragweed season which would interfere with assessment of the treatment effect Has any nasal condition that could confound the efficacy or safety assessments (e.g., nasal polyposis). Has asthma requiring high daily doses of inhaled corticosteroids within the 6 months prior to the Screening Visit Has severe, unstable, or uncontrolled asthma, as judged by the clinical investigator, or has experienced a lifethreatening asthma attack or an occurrence of any clinical deterioration of asthma that resulted in emergency treatment, hospitalization due to asthma, or treatment with systemic corticosteroids (but allowing shortacting beta agonists) at any time within the last 3 months prior to the Screening or Randomization Visits Has a history of anaphylaxis with cardiorespiratory symptoms with prior immunotherapy, unknown cause, or inhalant allergen Has a diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis Has a history of chronic urticaria and/or chronic angioedema Has a clinical history of chronic sinusitis during the 2 years prior to the Screening or Randomization Visits Has current severe atopic dermatitis Has a history of allergy, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to the ingredients of the study drug (except for Ambrosia artemisiifolia), rescue medications, or selfinjectable epinephrine Has previously received MK3641 Has previously been randomized into this study Is participating in any other clinical study or plans to participate in another clinical study during the duration of this study</criteria>
