	<brief_summary>In a previous study, the investigators established the dosage of foetal glycated hemoglobin (FGH). It represents the mean of blood sugar 4-6 before the delivery. The investigators also compared the FGH of newborn of women with and without gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and determined that newborn of women with GDM had significantly higher FGH that newborn of women without GDM. In this study, the investigators want to compare the FGH of newborn of GDM women randomized to a group reaching the Canadian Diabetes Association recommended blood glucose objectives treatment (fasting: 5.3 mmol/L and 2-hour after meals: 6.7 mmol/L) to a group reaching lower blood glucose objectives (fasting: 4.8 mmol/L and 2-hour after meals: 5.9 mmol/L)</brief_summary>
