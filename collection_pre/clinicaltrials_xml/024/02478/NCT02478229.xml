	<brief_summary>The study is a single centre, single arm, open-label, proof of concept study enrolling 20 adult primary liver transplant recipients with genotype 1 HCV infection. Subjects will receive Sofosbuvir (SOF) and Ledipasvir (LDV) starting at time of liver transplantation (OLT) and continues for 12 weeks. Subjects will be receive 24 week post-treatment follow up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Treatment With Sofosbuvir (SOF) and Ledipasvir (LDV) to Prevent HCV Recurrence After Liver Transplantation (OLT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C viral infection (HCV) leading to end-stage liver disease is the leading indication for liver transplant worldwide. HCV recurrence following liver transplantation is universal, associated with 100-fold increase in viremia levels, and runs at an accelerated course, leading to graft cirrhosis in up to 30% of patients within 5 years. Successful eradication of HCV post transplant normalizes the long term survival of HCV positive liver transplant recipients. This study aims to treat HCV infection starting at the time of transplant. The study is a single centre, single arm, open-label,proof of concept study enrolling 20 adult primary liver transplant recipients with genotype 1 HCV infection. Subjects will receive Sofosbuvir (SOF) 400 mg and Ledipasvir (LDV) 90 mg as a fixed dose combination (FDC) tablet starting at time of liver transplantation (OLT) and continues for 12 weeks. Subjects will receive 24 week post-treatment follow up. The study will investigate if the patient has achieved sustained virological response (SVR) 12 weeks after cessation of treatment (SVR12). Furthermore, safety and efficacy of this treatment regimen beginning at the time of transplant will be investigated.</detailed_description>
