	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to Assess Radial Artery Compression and Arterial Perfusion While TR Band is Applied</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, the diameter of each subjects' radial artery will be measured using MRI imagery at varying degrees of radial artery compression by adjusting the amount of air injected into a Terumo TR Band. In addition, using pulse oxymetry, the perfusion waveform will be measured and recorded also while the subjects have a TR Band in place on their wrists.</detailed_description>
