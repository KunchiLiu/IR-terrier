	<brief_summary>Many patients receiving opioid based analgesia after gynecologic laparoscopic surgery experience postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) despite prophylaxis and treatment with HT3 receptor antagonists. Although a high dose of ramosetron can cause adverse effects such as headache or dizziness, the minimal effective dose of ramosetron in a high-risk patients is unknown. The aim of this study is to determine the effective dose of ramosetron for prophylaxis of PONV in a high-risk patients receiving intravenous opioid-based patient-controlled analgesia after gynecological laparoscopic surgery.</brief_summary>
