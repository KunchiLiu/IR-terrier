	<brief_title>Comparison Between Thoracoscopic Left Atrial Appendage Excision and Warfarin for the Secondary Prevention of Stroke in Patients With AF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Brief Summary: This cohort study aims to compare thoracoscopic left atrial appendage excision with warfarin for secondary prevention of stroke and non-central nervous systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation and thromboembolism. Detailed Description: BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common cardiac arrhythmias and has been shown to be an important cause of stroke. AF is responsible for 15% of all strokes. Most strokes in AF are caused by cardioembolism. The left atrial appendage (LAA) is the dominant source of cardioembolism. The greatest priority in treating AF is stroke prevention. There are now 3 main approaches for prevention: (1) oral anticoagulation (OAC), (2) eradication of AF, and (3) exclusion of the LAA from the systemic circulation. OAC therapy, including warfarin and novel oral anti-coagulants, effectively reduces the risk of stroke in AF and is currently the first line of treatment in patients with AF and one or more risk factors. Despite the advancements in medical therapy, the risk of stroke in patients with AF who undergo optimal anticoagulation therapy still remains between 2% and 5% per year, regardless of the agent used. The limitations of OAC include (1) patient unsuitability for OAC, (2) increased risk of bleeding, (3) need for monitoring optimal international normalized ratio (INR) levels (with warfarin), and (4) patient noncompliance. Percutaneous methods of ablation are widely used to attempt to eliminate AF. Approximately 20% of patients who underwent ablation had AF recurrence. It is because of this well-demonstrated occurrence that the guidelines do not recommend discontinuation of warfarin or equivalent therapies after ablation. Since at least 90% of all left atrial thrombi are found within the LAA, it is plausible that its occlusion will lead to a decreased risk of stroke in patients with AF. However, the evidence for surgical ligation is extremely limited. AIM OF THE STUDY: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether thoracoscopic LAA excision for the purpose of prevention of thromboembolism in pts with AF and thromboembolism is superior to warfarin for reducing the composite endpoint of stroke, TIA and systemic embolism. The primary efficacy endpoint is defined as the composite of all stroke (including ischemic and hemorrhagic), documented TIA, and systemic embolism. The secondary endpoint is cardiovascular death, hospitalization due to cardiovascular or cerebral diseases, major and fatal bleeding events, and minor bleeding complication. STUDY DESIGN: This is a single-center prospective cohort study. Adult patients with non-valvular AF and a previous history of stroke are eligible for inclusion of this study. Approximately 300 patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF and stroke will receive warfarin treatment with a targeted INR between 2.0 and 3.0 or surgical LAA excision. Follow-up for these patients includes visits at 3 m, 6 m, 9 m, 12 m.</detailed_description>
