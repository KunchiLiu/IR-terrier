	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if ilorasertib (ABT-348) can help to control CDKN2A-deficient cancer. CDKN2A deficiency is a type of mutation (a genetic change). The safety of this drug will also be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Ilorasertib (ABT348) in Patients With CDKN2A Deficient Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: Each study cycle is 28 days. You will take ABT-348 by mouth 2 times each day on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle. The first dose you take on these days is called Dose 1, and the second dose you take each day is called Dose 2. You will take Dose 1 (the earlier dose) of ABT-348 with 4 ounces (about Â½ cup) of water. You should fast (not eat or drink anything except water) for 8 hours before taking this dose. You need to fast before this dose because eating food may affect the levels of the study drug that is able to enter your system. You will be allowed to have a light snack 2 hours after Dose 1, and then you may eat anything you like 4 hours after the dose. You should take Dose 2 (the later dose) as close as possible to 6 hours after the first dose, but not less than 6 hours after the first dose. You do not need to fast before Dose 2. You may eat and drink normally around this dose. Study Visits: On Day 1 of each cycle, and on Days 8 and 15 of Cycles 1 and 2: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - You will have an EKG (Day 1 of Cycle 2 only). For Cycle 3 and after, you will have these EKGs repeated every 3 cycles (Cycles 6, 9, 12, and so on). On Day 1 of all cycles, urine will be collected for routine tests. On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond, if you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a pregnancy test. Every 8 weeks, you will have a chest x-ray, bone scan, MRI/CT or PET/CT to check the status of the disease. You may be able to have some of these tests/procedures performed at a local lab, clinic, or doctor's office that is closer to your home. The results of these tests will be sent to the study doctor for review. The study doctor or research staff will discuss this option with you in more detail. Length of Study Drug Administration: You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. You participation on this study will be over after your last dose of study drug. This is an investigational study. ABT-348 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work. Up to 65 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Patients with histologically confirmed, advanced or metastatic cancer for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective. 2. Patients must have CDKN2Adeficient tumor (deletion or mutation). Definition of CDKN2A deficient tumor: #1. CDKN2A deletion or mutation by any CLIAcertified sequencing OR #2. &gt;/= 30% of tumor cells with (at least) hemizygous deletion by FISH. Status will be determined from archived tissue. 3. Patients must have measurable disease by RECIST 1.1. 4. Patients must be &gt;/=18 years of age. 5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 02. 6. Subject has adequate renal function as demonstrated by serum creatinine value of &lt;/= 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and either an estimated creatinine clearance value of &gt;/= 50 mL/min as determined by the CockcroftGault formula or a creatinine clearance value of &gt;/= 50 mL/min based on a 24 hour urine collection. 7. Subject has adequate liver function as demonstrated by serum bilirubin &lt;/= 2 x ULN and AST and ALT &lt;/= 2.5 x ULN. For subjects with liver metastasis, adequate liver function is demonstrated by serum bilirubin &lt;/= 2 x ULN and AST/ALT &lt;/= 5.0 x ULN. 8. Subject has adequate bone marrow as demonstrated by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;/= 1,500/mm3 (1.5 x 10^9/L); Platelets &gt;/= 100,000/mm2 (100 x 10^9/L); Hemoglobin &gt;/= 9.0 g/dL (1.4 mmol/L). 9. Subject has QTc interval &lt; 500 msec on baseline electrocardiogram. 10. The subject has a documented Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction &gt; 50%. 11. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (one of the following listed below) prior to the study entry, for the duration of study participation and up to 3 months following completion of therapy. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to initiation of treatment and/or post menopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of nonchildbearing potential.
