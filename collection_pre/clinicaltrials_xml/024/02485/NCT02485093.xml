	<brief_summary>Optimal pacing strategy for patients with SND is still unknown, although several publications in the past years demonstrated a deleterious effect of ventricular pacing. However, pacing has always been apical in these trials, and to which extent this absence of pacing is beneficial for patients with very long PR intervals is still to be found. The aim of this study is to compare ventricular septal pacing to no pacing in patients with SND.</brief_summary>
