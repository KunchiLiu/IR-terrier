	<brief_title>SAFEWALKER Contribution to the Rehabilitation of Older People After a Post-fall Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The post-fall syndrome is an acute functional complications of falls that affects nearly one in five elderly fallers. It combines phobia of the previous vacuum, axial and hypertension astasia abasia. Unrecognized and untreated, it progresses to a major regressive syndrome, severe physical, psychological and social implications. Only an early rehabilitation for an early resumption of walking, prevents such a development. The main element is to support and encourage the subject to walking. In practice, it was found that the physiotherapist can not be present daily and the duration of its intervention is often short-lived. This study will examine the contribution of a medical device of a walking aid (SAFEWALKER the robot) in the rehabilitation and empowerment of seniors with a post-fall syndrome. The SAFEWALKER, which is a walking aid device (http://www.safewalker.com), completes the support action exercised by a third person, by reducing support and securing travel. It allows the subject to move alone at will and is a continuity in relation to the management of the physiotherapist, a potential source of motivation. The hypothesis is that the SAFEWALKER device can be complementary to the walking rehabilitation in post-fall syndrome.</detailed_description>
