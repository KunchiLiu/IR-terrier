	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study (a small scale study testing procedures so that the investigators can apply this to a larger scale study). This study will test the accuracy of a new brain scan (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) technique in predicting the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) in patients where there is uncertainty about the diagnosis. For patients where there is a suspicion (but not definite) diagnosis of MS, an additional MRI brain scan will be offered. There will be no other research tests and the patient is followed up to see what the eventual diagnosis is. The investigators will then review the original brain scan to see if this predicted the diagnosis of MS or not.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Test to ARrive at MS Diagnosis. Using a Single MRI Brain Scan to Help Diagnose Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is no single, simple test to differentiate MS from conditions that mimic it. Apart from the patient's symptoms, doctors use Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain to see if there are abnormalities which are consistent with MS. In patients without typical symptoms or a typical MRI appearance, a firm diagnosis cannot be made as other neurological illnesses can mimic symptoms of MS and the MRI scans can look very similar. Further tests are often required such as lumbar punctures, resulting in delays, discomfort for the patient and additional healthcare costs. With time the diagnosis can become clearer as patients may develop other symptoms of MS but this may take months or years. The most common errors are from misinterpretation of the brain abnormalities or 'lesions' seen on the MRI scan. Subsequently if a patient is misdiagnosed with MS they may receive treatment they do not need. Furthermore a delay in a firm diagnosis delays treatment for another condition. With the rapid increase of new medications in the last few years, accurate and rapid diagnosis is paramount. Pathologically (when looking at lesions using a microscope) MS lesions usually have a vein running through the centre, whereas in lesions arising from other conditions, the investigators hypothesize that no central vein is seen. The investigators can therefore distinguish between patients with MS and patients without it. The researchers therefore want to test the value of a clinical 3-Tesla MRI brain scan in accurately distinguishing between MS and other conditions, with MRI sequences that have been refined over the last few years. Patients will only have one research MRI brain scan and then be followed up by their neurologist, who will confirm the final diagnosis. The investigators shall then look back at the original scans to see if those with MS had veins within their lesions and if those without MS had lesions without veins</detailed_description>
