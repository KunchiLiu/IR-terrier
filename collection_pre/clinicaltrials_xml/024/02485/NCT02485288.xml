	<brief_title>PaTH Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN) Atrial Fibrillation (AF) Clinician-Patient Partnership Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to create the PaTH Network AF Clinician-Patient Partnership Cohort, which will allow the conduct of patient-centered observational studies on AF across the multiple institutions of the PaTH network. Creating the AF Clinician-Patient Partnership Cohort will involve: 1. Recruiting patients with AF to participate in the PaTH Network AF Clinician-Patient Partnership Cohort 2. Administering surveys to the AF Clinician-Patient Partnership Cohort approximately every 6 months to collect patient reported outcomes (PROs) 3. Collecting individual patient health record data into the AF Clinician-Patient Partnership Cohort database 4. Tracking whether the patient participant has biospecimens in a PaTH site biorepository and prepare for possible sharing of biospecimens in future studies. 5. Identifying potential participants for future research studies. The secondary objectives are to use the PaTH Network AF Clinician-Patient Partnership Cohort to answer patient-centered research questions including: 1. What is the incidence of complications requiring re-hospitalization after an ablation procedure for AF? 2. What are the predictors of major bleeding and stroke among patients that receive each anticoagulant class (vit K antagonist, direct factor X inhibitor, direct thrombin inhibitor)? 3. Is the longitudinal change in applied cognition-executive function score in AF patients associated with the choice of rate versus rhythm control and anticoagulation strategy?</detailed_description>
