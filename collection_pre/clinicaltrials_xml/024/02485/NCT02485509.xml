	<brief_summary>A combined Phase Ib and IIa randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of VM-1500 in healthy subjects and in patients with HIV-1 infection that are antiretroviral therapy naïve.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Safety and Pharmacokinetics in Healthy Volunteers and Safety, Tolerability and Antiviral Activity of VM-1500 in Patients With Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be split into two parts: Part I: A randomized, placebo-controlled, single dose, double-blind study in healthy volunteers with 20 mg followed by 40 mg after DSMB approval. Healthy group: one dose with 1 PK day 12 health volunteers (total): 6 subjects will randomized (4:2) to VM-1500 20 mg or placebo. After DSMB approval, 6 subjects will be randomized (4:2) to VM-1500 40 mg or placebo Part II: A randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple dose, double-blind study for 7 days in patients with HIV infection who are antiretroviral therapy-naïve. After positive DMSB review the dose will be escalated from 20 mg to 40 mg once daily. Patient group: 2 PK days (in-house) at day 1 and day 7 16 patients (total): 8 subjects will be randomized (7:1) to VM-1500 20 mg or placebo once daily for 7 days. After DSMB approval, 8 subjects will be randomized (7:1) to VM-1500 40 mg or placebo once daily for 7 days.</detailed_description>
