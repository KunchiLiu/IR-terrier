	<detailed_description>Occlusive portal vein thrombosis may be a negative prognostic marker of variceal bleeding in liver cirrhosis. Compared with conventional endoscopic and pharmacological therapy, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt may further improve the outcomes of occlusive portal vein thrombosis in liver cirrhosis with variceal bleeding. However, the safety of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt remains uncertain in patients with occlusive portal vein thrombosis.</detailed_description>
