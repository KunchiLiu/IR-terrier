	<brief_title>Efficacy of Extracorporeal Biofeedback Device for Post-prostatectomy Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Post prostatectomy urinary incontinence (PPI) was common complication after radical prostatectomy among prostate cancer patients. - The prevalence of post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence was reported at 87%. - The pelvic floor muscle therapy (PFMT) using Kegel exercise was first methods to prevent PPI after prostatectomy. - However, there was no standardized protocol of the PFMT and it was necessary of biofeedback to PFMT. - Therefore, we hypothesis the efficacy of personalized device of PFMT with biofeedback among patients who underwent radical prostatectomy - In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of postoperative pelvic floor muscle training using personalized extracorporeal biofeedback device among patients with post-prostatectomy incontinence.</detailed_description>
