	<brief_summary>Sulfonylurea are known to be associated with a risk of hypoglycaemia. However, little is known about the real frequency of asymptomatic or unreported hypoglycemia and their impact on glycemic control and quality of life among patients using sulfonylureas (SUs). The frequency of hypoglycemia is probably underestimated since self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) fail to identify asymptomatic episodes, especially among patients with higher risk of hypoglycemia unawareness (longer diabetes duration, elderly, recurrent hypoglycemia, etc.). No previous studies have reported total hypoglycemia as measured by continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) in a large group of Canadians, therefore underestimating the true incidence of these events. As with age hypoglycemia perception is reduced and consequences can be increased due to frailty, elderly could be especially sensitive to the risk of hypoglycemia. Documentation of the total number of hypoglycemia is a relevant objective to really appreciate the potential impact of SUs in the Canadian context. The investigators propose a multicenter observational prospective study in order to study the incidence of hypoglycaemia measured by CGMS among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) newly prescribed a SU. The investigators propose to perform a baseline testing (pre-initiation of the SU), at initiation (first week after the first dose of the SU) and after a 3 months follow-up of treatment, including medical history measures, quality of life and diabetes treatment satisfaction. In patients with T2DM not at goal (A1c &gt;7.0 mmol/L), and newly prescribed a SU, the objectives and hypotheses of the study are to estimate the incidence rate of hypoglycaemia as measured by continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) over a total of 3 weeks period following the initiation of the SU.</brief_summary>
