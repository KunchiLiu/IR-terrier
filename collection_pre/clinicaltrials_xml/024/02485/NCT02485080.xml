	<brief_summary>The goal of this pilot study is to examine both efficacy and tolerability in patients with HCV genotype 1 and mild decompensation with Child-Pugh-Turcott score of 6 or lower. The CPT score is used to assess the prognosis of chronic liver diseases, as well as the required strength and treatment and necessity of liver transplantation. A higher CPT score denotes higher necessity of liver transplantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of 24 Weeks Simeprevir+Sofosbuvir for Chronic Hepatitis C Genotype 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Key objectives of this study include: 1. To describe efficacy (SVR) in a special population of patients with chronic hepatitis C who are not willing or not candidates for IFN-based therapy. 2. To describe safety, tolerability, and treatment persistency in this patient population with advanced liver disease.</detailed_description>
