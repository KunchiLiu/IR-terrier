	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of HM61713 in patients with T790M-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after treatment with an epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial of HM61713 for the Treatment of ≥2nd Line T790M Mutation Positive Adenocarcinoma of the Lung</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-arm, open-label, Phase 2 study to assess the anti-tumor efficacy of oral single agent HM61713 administered to patients with T790M-positive NSCLC after treatment with an EGFR-TKI as measured by objective response rate (ORR).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age: at least 20 years of age Cytologically or histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC which is not amenable to curative surgery or radiotherapy Radiologically confirmed disease progression after at least one line of treatment with an EGFRTKI At least one documented EGFR mutation which is known to be related with susceptibility to EGFRTKIs (including G719X, exon 19 deletion, L858R, and L861Q) World Health Organization (WHO) performance score of 0 to 1 with life expectancy of at least 3 months Centrally confirmed T790M mutation positive tumor status from a tumor sample taken after confirmation of disease progression on the most recent anticancer treatment regimen At least one lesion (excluding the brain), not previously irradiated that can be accurately measured per RECIST version 1.1 Adequate hematological and biological function Females of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception and for 3 months after the last dose of study drug Male patients should be documented to be sterile or agree to use barrier contraception Recovery to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline of any toxicities, except for stable sensory neuropathy ≤ Grade 2 and alopecia Known history of hypersensitivity to active or inactive excipients of HM61713 or drugs with a similar chemical structure of HM61713 Previous treatment with anticancer therapies, EGFRTKI, HM61713, or other drugs that target T790Mpositive mutant EGFR with sparing of wildtype, investigational agent(s) within 28 days prior to the first administration of study drug, radiotherapy Any nonstudy related significant surgical procedures within the past 28 days prior to the first administration of study drug Spinal cord compression, leptomeningeal carcinomatosis or active symptomatic brain metastases History of any other malignancy Clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s) Active or chronic pancreatitis Anyone with cardiac abnormalities or history Presence or history of ILD, druginduced ILD, or presence of radiation pneumonitis Pregnant or breast feeding In the opinion of the investigator, the patient is an unsuitable candidate to receive HM61713</criteria>
