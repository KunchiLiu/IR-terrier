	<brief_summary>Changes in volumetric hemodynamic parameters and fluid overload (Cardiac Index,Stroke Volume, Thoracic Fluid Content, Systemic Vascular Resistance) were measured using a impedance cardiography (ICG) (CardioScreen 1000 - Haemodynamic Measurement System, Medis. GmbH Ilmenau) beginning 15 min prior to midweek dialysis session and continuous measurement thereafter, with a 15-min period after the termination of hemodialysis. Fluid overload were measured by BCM Monitor Fresenius before hemodialysis.</brief_summary>
