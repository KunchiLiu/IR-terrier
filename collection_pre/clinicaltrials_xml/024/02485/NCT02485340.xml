	<brief_summary>To develop a pragmatic migraine model the investigators will induce headache in healthy volunteers and in patients with migraine without aura with a long lasting Nitrogen Oxide (NO) donor. If the headache responds to sumatriptan, the model can be used to test new drug candidates.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Sumatriptan and Placebo on Isosorbide-5-mononitrate Induced Headache</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There remains a great need for more effective anti-migraine drugs with fewer side effects. Human experimental models are valuable in early phase development of new anti-migraine drugs but useful models have not yet been developed. The investigators' group has shown that Isosorbide-5-mononitrate (5-ISMN), a long lasting NO-donor, induce headache/migraine in both healthy volunteers and in patients with migraine without aura (MO). To validate this model, the headache must respond to specific migraine treatment with sumatriptan. Hypothesis: 5-ISMN induces a migraine-like headache in both healthy subjects and in MO-patients and induced headache responds to a specific anti migraine drug; sumatriptan. Aim: Developing a pragmatic and valid model for the testing of new anti-migraine drugs</detailed_description>
