	<detailed_description>The natural history of AD includes an asymptomatic or preclinical phase characterized by pathological cerebral alterations without any evident symptoms of the disease. The beginning of the preclinical phase can be detected using a series of biological and neuroimaging markers that indicate the presence of AÎ² deposition in the brain. A variety of factors such as inflammation, genetic load (e.g., APOE4), diet, cardiovascular risk, sleep disorders and cognitive reserve, produced by endogenous or exogenous factors, vary among individuals and may determine the beginning and evolution of the preclinical phase of the disease. It is possible to identify subclinical, biological, cognitive and neuroimaging changes, in the AD preclinical phase. The longitudinal study of intra-individual changes will be more sensitive than cross-sectional inter-individual studies to detect the cognitive evolution during the AD preclinical phase. Similarly, it would be possible to identify factors in subjects at the preclinical phase that will influence their evolution to the clinical stage of the disease. The study will start with a screening of 3.000 recruited volunteers (NCT01835717) complying as much as possible with study selection criteria and perfectly aware of the study needs. The selected 400 participants fulfilling the inclusion criteria will undergo detailed phenotyping consisting in: clinical history, AD family history, full cognitive evaluation, cognitive reserve determination, CSF sample collection, blood and urine sample collection, neuroimaging (MRI), quality of life and habits of life questionnaires (physical activity, diet, sleeping habits, social activity, toxics habits, pollution exposure). The longitudinal study will consist in a every 3-year follow-up visit in which the participant will undergo a review of the clinical history data, a full cognitive evaluation, neuroimaging (MRI), samples collection (blood, urine, CSF) and update of the life habits changes.</detailed_description>
