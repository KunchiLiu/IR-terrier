	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. Healthy female subjects of non childbearing potential and/or male subjects who, at the time of screening, are between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive. 2. Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs). 3. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study. 4. Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures. 1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at the time of dosing). 2. Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy). 3. A positive urine drug screen. 4. History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 7 drinks/week for females or 14 drinks/week for males (1 drink = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of beer or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of hard liquor) within 6 months of Screening. 5. Smokers must not exceed the equivalent of 5 cigarettes per day. 6. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local requirement) or 5 half lives preceding the first dose of investigational product (whichever is longer). 7. Screening supine blood pressure100 mm Hg (systolic) or 50 mm Hg (diastolic); or 140 mm Hg (systolic) or 90 mm Hg (diastolic) following at least 5 minutes of supine rest. If blood pressure (BP) is 40 mm Hg (systolic) or 90 mm Hg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated two more times and the average of the three BP values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility. 8. Screening pulse or heart rate (HR) &gt;100 bpm after at least 5 minutes of rest. If the pulse/HR is &gt;100 bpm, the pulse/HR should be repeated two more times (separated by at least 2 minutes) and the average of the three pulse/HR values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility. 9. Screening 12 lead ECG demonstrating QTc &gt;450 msec or a QRS interval &gt;120 msec. If QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated two more times and the average of the three QTc or QRS values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility. 10. Clinically significant abnormality on chest X ray performed at screening or within 3 months of screening date. 11. History of tuberculosis or active or latent or inadequately treated infection, positive Quantiferon TB test 12. History of hepatitis or HIV, positive testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen (HepBsAg), hepatitis B core antibodies (HepBcAb) or hepatitis C antibodies (HCVAb).</criteria>
