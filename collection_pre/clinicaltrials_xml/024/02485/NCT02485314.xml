	<brief_summary>The Participation and Environment Measure for Children and Youth (PEM-CY) is the first instrument that combines parental assessment of children's participation in home, school, and community activities with qualities of each environment that are perceived to support or hinder participation. This combined format may help to clarify the relative impact of environmental factors (including the natural and built environment), compared to personal factors, on children's participation in specific settings. The aim of this study was to examine reliability and validity of Turkish version of the Participation and Environment Measure for Children and Youth (PEM-CY).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reliability and Validity of Turkish Version of PEM-CY</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health-Child and Youth Version (ICF-CY; WHO 2007) is designed to guide assessment and intervention efforts to minimize disparities in children's participation. Participation is defined in the ICF-CY as ''involvement in life situations'' and is further conceptualized as a multidimensional construct with both objective (e.g., frequency) and subjective (e.g., satisfaction) dimensions. Participation is linked to contextual factors, including: 1) personal factors (child personal factors such as child's age, gender, and functional abilities; family demographic factors); and 2) features of environments (physical (natural and built), social, attitudinal, and institutional factors, and availability and adequacy of resources). Since its adoption in the ICF-CY, an increasing number of participation measures have been developed. Among these measures, the Participation and Environment Measure for Children and Youth (PEM-CY) is the first instrument that combines parental assessment of children's participation in home, school, and community activities with qualities of each environment that are perceived to support or hinder participation. This combined format may help to clarify the relative impact of environmental factors (including the natural and built environment), compared to personal factors, on children's participation in specific settings.</detailed_description>
