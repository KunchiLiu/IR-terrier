	<brief_title>A Study of Whether 3 New Oral Formulations of a Strong Pain Killer Release the Same Amount of Drug Into the Body as the Marketed Medication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Comparisons will be made between three new oral formulations and an existing marketed reference capsule formulation to determine whether the release rates of the products are similar or equivalent in a fed or fasted state. Determination is by measurement of drug concentrations in the blood at serial collection time points pre-dose until 72 hours post-dose, following an administration of a single oral dose. Pharmacokinetics parameters of AUC and Cmax are the primary endpoints</detailed_description>

The subject's primary care physician has confirmed within the last 12 months of first dosing that there is nothing in their medical history that would preclude their enrolment into a clinical study 1.

Participation in a clinical drug study during the 90 days preceding the initial dose in this study. 8. Subjects must not participate in both the pilot phase and the definitive phase of the study, or in more than one Cohort. 9. Any significant illness during the 4 weeks preceding entry into this study. 10. Use of any medication including vitamins, herbal and/or mineral supplements during the 7 days preceding the initial dose or during the course of this study (with the exception of the continued use of HRT and contraceptives). 11. Refusal to abstain from food 8 hours preceding and 4 hours following study drug administration, to abstain from foods containing poppy seeds 48 hours preceding and entirely during each confinement, and to abstain from caffeine or xanthine containing food or beverages and grapefruit juice within 48 hours before IMP administration and for the duration of study confinement until after the last study PK sample has been taken in each study period. 12. Weekly alcohol intake exceeding the equivalent of 14 units/week for females and 21 units/week for males. (1 unit = ½ pint beer, 25 mL of 40% spirit or a 125 mL glass of wine). 13. Consumption of alcoholic beverages within 48 hours before study drug administration, and refusal to abstain from alcohol for the duration of the study confinement and for at least 48 hours after the last naltrexone dose in each study period. 14. History of smoking within 45 days of study drug administration and refusal to abstain from smoking during the study. 15. Blood or blood products donated within 90 days prior to study drug administration or any time during the study, except as required by this protocol. 16.
