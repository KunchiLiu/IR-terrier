	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, randomized, single dose, two-sequence two-period crossover study, separated by 7 days washout interval from the first Study Drug Administration. This study is conducted to determine the bioequivalence of cefadroxil from DURICEF™ film coated tablets manufactured by Smithkline Beecham Egypt, LLC affiliated co. to GalaxoSmithKline (GSK) and cefadroxil from BIODROXIL™ film coated tablets manufactured by Kahira Pharm &amp;amp;Chem .Ind. Co . for Novartis Pharma (NP) after a single oral dose administration of each to healthy adult subjects under fasting conditions. In Period 1, subjects will be randomized to receive cefadroxil tablet manufactured by either GSK or NP. Following a washout of at least 7 days, subjects will be crossed over in Period 2 to receive the cefadroxil tablet that they did not receive in Period 1. DURICEF is a trademark of the GSK group of companies. BIODROXIL is a trademark of Sandoz.</brief_summary>
