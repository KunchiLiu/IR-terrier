	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the performance of the EnLightTM and LightPathTM Imaging Systems in detecting tumour lesions in patients with gastric, pancreas, bile duct or duodenal cancer. EnLightTM will be used to detect positron emission and the LightPathTM system to detect Cerenkov Luminescence. Both are emitted by the Positron Emission Tomography (PET) agent. The study will also evaluate the patient safety and radiation safety of the EnLightTM, and the safety for the device operators and surgical staff of the LightPathTM Imaging System.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of the EnLightTM and LightPathTM Imaging Systems in Gastrointestinal Tumour Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a pilot study that is prospective, open-label, single-centre in nature in patients with gastric, pancreas, bile duct or duodenal cancer in whom tumour excision surgery is indicated. Patients who give written informed consent will be screened for the study (Visit 1). Patients will undergo a positron emission tomography (PET) whole body scan. Screening assessments, including the PET scan, must be performed no less than 60 days before surgery and may be performed on the day of surgery. On the day of surgery (Visit 2), subject's blood glucose level will be measured. Subjects with a blood glucose level &lt; 12 mmol/l will receive an intravenous injection of 2-5 Mega Becquerel/kg (MBq/kg), up to a maximum 300 MBq of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) prior to surgery. During surgery and not less than 120 minutes after injection of FDG, the primary lesion will be imaged using the EnLightTM system to determine margin status. Gastrointestinal tumour excision surgery will then be performed according to standard of care. The surgical cavity and the lymph nodes will be imaged by the EnLightTM system to establish whether other radioactive tissue remain. These results will not influence any surgical or clinical decision-making, which will remain as standard of care. The resected tumour excision specimen will be imaged by the LightPathTM Imaging System. The resected tumour excision specimen will, in addition, be analysed according to standard of care pathology. The surgeon and surgical staff will be monitored for external exposure to ionizing radiation by means of dosimeters, and position sensors during surgery. Patients will be followed-up (Visit 3) within a 2 - 14 day window after the end of surgery for adverse events (AEs). Those related to the use of the investigational devices, or the PET imaging agent will be identified as such.</detailed_description>
