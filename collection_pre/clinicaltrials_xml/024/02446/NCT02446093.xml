	<brief_summary>The study will investigate if the addition of GMCI to neoadjuvant mFOLFIRINOX + chemoradiation is safe and improves the clinical outcome of borderline resectable and unresectable locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, as measured by resection rate, progression-free survival and overall survival.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant GMCI Plus mFOLFIRINOX and Chemoradiation for Non-Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current protocol is designed to delivery multiple courses of GMCI timed with a series of neoadjuvant debulking therapies- modified FOLFIRINOX (mFX) chemotherapy followed by gemcitabine-radiation (GR) followed by surgery- to capitalize on the synergies with the different treatment modalities. This protocol includes two phases: Phase 1b followed by Phase 2. The Phase 1b evaluates the safety and feasibility of mFX+GR+surgery in combination with GMCI. Patients will be enrolled on the Phase 1b based on the definition of dose limiting toxicity (DLT), waiting periods and stopping rules described in the protocol. The Phase 2 is a randomized study comparing a test group receiving GMCI added to mFX+GR+surgery to a control arm receiving mFX+GR followed by surgery.</detailed_description>
