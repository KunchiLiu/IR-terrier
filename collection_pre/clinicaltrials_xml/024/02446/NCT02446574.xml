	<brief_title>Postoperative Chemoradiation in Patients With Node-positive Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although preoperative chemoradiation therapy followed by surgery is the most common approach for patients with resectable esophageal cancer, the considerable number of esophageal cancer patients received operation as the first treatment modality. Accordingly, postoperative treatments have been playing an important role because of the poor survival rates of the patients with pathologically positive lymph nodes who have been treated with resection alone. The investigators have proved the value of prophylactic radiation therapy after radical esophagectomy for esophageal carcinoma with positive lymph node metastases under the conventional 2-dimensional radiotherapy methods in subset analysis of prospective randomized clinical trial. For patients with positive lymph nodes, 5 year survival after surgery alone was 28.4%, median overall survival was 24 months, recurrence occurred 34.6% in mediastinal lymph nodes，13.3% in supraclavicular lymph nodes，10% in abdominal lymph nodes. Distant metastases occurred in 21% patients. Adjuvant radiotherapy significantly reduced the recurrence in mediastinal lymph nodes(13.4%), supraclavicular lymph nodes (6.1%). However distant metastases rate increased to 30.7%. Chemotherapy may be vital for these patients. Chen reported that the 5 year overall survival rates for the chemoradiotherapy group and radiotherapy group were 47.4% and 38.6% (P=0.03). Based on the investigators' studies, treatment failure occurred in 8% patients because of celiac metastases. Small radiation field by omitting celiac axis lymph node basin may ensure 5-6 cycles of concurrent chemotherapy for lower toxicity.</detailed_description>
