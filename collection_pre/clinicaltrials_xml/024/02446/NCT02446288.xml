	<brief_title>TMJ NextGen Pilot Study to Treat Subjects With Bruxism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be conducted at multiple study centers in the U.S. Subjects will be enrolled in the trial for a period of 44 days. The study will consist of a screening period lasting up to 30 days, a device fitting period of 14 days, and a treatment period lasting 30 days. Subjects will visit the clinic three times during the screening period, followed by visits at Day 1, Day 14, and Day 44 of the study. Subjects will visit the sleep center once during the screening period (Day -1) and once during the treatment period (Day 43).</detailed_description>

Subject has an average of ≥ 1.25 bruxism episodes per hour of sleep based on the singlenight screening sleep PSG evaluations. 1. Subjects with any physical or behavioral disorder, which, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, may interfere with the use of the device or compliance with the study protocol; 2. Subject has a significant respiratory disease that actively requires treatment; 3. Subject is taking antidepressant medication; 4.

Subjects diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, osteoarthrosis, or another connective tissue disorder of the head/neck region; 7. Subjects who have had direct trauma to the jaw; 8. Subjects who have used an occlusal appliance to treat a TMD within the previous six months; 9. Subjects who have had prior TMJ or ear surgery; 10. Subjects who have a narrow ear canal or impression of the ear canal, which is prolapsed due to an anatomical shift or failure of the ear canal wall structure, or a canal that does not allow for the ear canal second turn to be identified; 11. Subjects with visible or congenital ear deformity as observed on targeted physical exam that does not allow for fitting of the study device; 12. Subjects who have taken a narcotic pain medication in the last seven days prior to Day 1 of the study; 13. Subjects who have a history of chronic ear pain unrelated to TMJ; 14. Subjects who have a history of ear drainage in the past six months; 15. Subjects who have active ear drainage, swelling, or redness as observed on targeted physical exam; 16.
