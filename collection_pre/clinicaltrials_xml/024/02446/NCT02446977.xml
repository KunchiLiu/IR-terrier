	<brief_title>Administration of CBG000592 (Riboflavin/Vitamin B2) in Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators hypothesis focuses on the effect of riboflavin given for the first three hours of ischemic stroke, as a reducing agent of cerebral glutamate concentration. This administration would produce a reduction of excitotoxic damage and consequently generate clinical improvement, while a lower income and a better functional outcome of patients at three months.</detailed_description>
