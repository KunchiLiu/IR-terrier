	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating Safety and Efficacy of BIOD 531 Compared to Humalog® Mix 75/25 in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BIOD-531 is a formulation of recombinant human insulin with a biphasic absorption profile characterized by rapid absorption (to prevent meal-time rises in blood glucose) and a secondary longer (basal) phase. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate glucose control and safety of BIOD-531 compared to a pre-mixed insulin which is commonly used to provide both meal-time and long acting insulin.</detailed_description>
