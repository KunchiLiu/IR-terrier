	<brief_summary>This study is a prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing the sinus tarsi approach to the extensile lateral approach for surgical fixation of calcaneus fractures. It is hypothesized that open reduction and internal fixation of intra-articular calcaneus fractures using a sinus tarsi approach will provide equivalent fracture reduction and stable fixation with significantly decreased wound complication rates in comparison to an extensile lateral approach.</brief_summary>
