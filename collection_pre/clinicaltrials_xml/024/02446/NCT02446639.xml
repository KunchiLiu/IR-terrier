	<brief_summary>"Troponin T (TnT) is a component of the contractile apparatus of the striated musculature. Although the function of TnT is the same in all striated muscles found in the heart to form a TNT (cardiac TnT) differing significantly TnT of the skeletal muscles. Because of its high tissue specificity, cardiac TnT is a specific marker and highly sensitive of myocardial injury. Asymptomatic elevations of troponins is frequently found in patients with chronic renal failure in stage V, which present no clinical signs of acute or electrical myocardial injury. Many studies have been conducted in recent years to explain the origin and clinical significance of this elevation, but the results are controversial: cardiac dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy or chronic inflammation. Besides the effect of the dialysis session was evaluated on this biological parameter in different studies which together do not find Impact hemodialysis session on the value of troponin Achieving dosages rate hypersensitive serum troponin T in a dialysis population, will: - to determine the evolution of TnT in time and what are the characteristics of the patients for whom this rate varies - to know what its evolution during the session, - to identify if possible the criteria that are responsible for the variation in the direction of increasing and / or its reduction - and to characterize patients whose base rate is higher than the 99 percentile in the absence of clinical symptoms which could lead to establish reference population for this specific normal values. The Purpose of this study is to evaluate the serum troponin T in a hypersensitive dialysis population and verify what is the influence of the hemodialysis session, the session parameters and intradialytic events on changes in serum troponin T hypersensitive after a hemodialysis session.

	<brief_title>Assessment the Dosage of Troponin T Hypersensitive Dosage in a Patient Population Hemodialysis and Peritoneal Dialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current care study, single-center, uncontrolled, no randomised, open and prospective. Two hundred fifty patients on hemodialysis and / or peritoneal dialysis for more than 3 months may be included in the study for a total period of 7 months. Hemodialysis patients will be informed at the weekly routine visits. Regarding peritoneal dialysis patients, a meeting can be organized with the physician. And the oral agreement of the patient will be collected during a second visit or meeting. The protocol provides four follow-up visits: at baseline, 4 weeks, 12 and 24 weeks. During these visits, the patient will have a clinical examination and a measure of the serum troponin T. Blood samples are realized in the usual conditions of the center - for hemodialysis patients: midweek as instructed by the usual protocol of the center. - for peritoneal dialysis patients: when the monthly routine consultation.</detailed_description>
