	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial studies olaparib or cediranib maleate and olaparib to see how well they work compared with standard platinum-based chemotherapy in treating patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that has come back. Olaparib and cediranib maleate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Cediranib maleate may stop the growth of ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer by blocking the growth of new blood vessels necessary for tumor growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, paclitaxel, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known whether olaparib or cediranib maleate and olaparib is more effective than standard platinum-based chemotherapy in treating patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Olaparib or Cediranib Maleate and Olaparib Compared With Standard Platinum-Based Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Recurrent Platinum-Sensitive Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the efficacy of either single agent olaparib or the combination of cediranib (cediranib maleate) and olaparib, as measured by progression free survival (PFS), as compared to standard platinum-based chemotherapy in the setting of recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the efficacy of single agent olaparib or the combination of cediranib and olaparib, as measured by response rate and overall survival as compared to standard platinum-based chemotherapy in the setting of recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. II. Assess the efficacy of single agent olaparib or the combination of cediranib and olaparib, as measured by PFS, in women with or without deleterious germline breast cancer (BRCA) mutations (gBRCAmt) in the setting of recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. III. Assess the effect on disease-related symptoms (DRS) as measured by the 9-item DRS-P subscale of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network-Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (NCCN-FACT) Ovarian Symptom Index-18 (NFOSI-18), of single agent olaparib or cediranib and olaparib, compared to standard platinum-based chemotherapy, in the setting of recurrent platinum sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. IV. Assess the efficacy of single agent olaparib or the combination of cediranib and olaparib, as measured by PFS, in women with or without homologous repair deficiencies as measured by BROCA in the setting of recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. V. To assess changes in the number of circulating endothelial cells (CECs) following three days of treatment with olaparib, combination olaparib/cediranib, or standard platinum-based chemotherapy in women with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. VI. To assess whether change in the number of circulating endothelial cells (CECs) following three days of treatment with olaparib, combination olaparib/cediranib, or standard platinum-based chemotherapy in women with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer is prognostic for PFS. VII. To develop a profile from a panel of angiogenic biomarkers in women with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer which is associated with PFS, and then validate the predictive value of this biomarker profile. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the time from randomization to the first non-study, anti-cancer therapy, surgery or death (TFST) for single-agent olaparib or combination cediranib and olaparib relative to standard platinum-based chemotherapy in the setting of recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. II. To assess the time from randomization to the second non-study, anti-cancer therapy, surgery or death (TSST) for single-agent olaparib or combination cediranib and olaparib relative to standard platinum-based chemotherapy in the setting of recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. III. Assess the effect on secondary measures of quality of life, as assessed by the treatment side effects (TSE) and function / well-being (F/WB) subscales of the NFOSI-18, sensory neuropathy as measured by the FACT/GOG-Ntx-4, and health utility as measured by the Euro Quality of Life-5 Dimension (EQ-5D), of single agent olaparib or cediranib and olaparib, compared to standard platinum-based chemotherapy, in the setting of recurrent platinum sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients may be treated with one of the three regimens per investigator discretion. REGIMEN I: Patients receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. REGIMEN II: Patients receive carboplatin IV on day 1 and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 for at least 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. REGIMEN III: Patients receive carboplatin IV and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM III: Patients receive olaparib PO BID and cediranib maleate PO once daily (QD). Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>
