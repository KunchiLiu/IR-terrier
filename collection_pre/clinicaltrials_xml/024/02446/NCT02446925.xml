	<brief_summary>The Surefire Infusion System is a novel catheter initially developed to prevent reflux of embolic material into non-target vascular territories. Further research has demonstrated improved penetration and distribution of embolic material into treated arterial territories. The purpose of this study is to compare Y-90 glass microsphere distribution and penetration into cancerous tissue within the liver between a standard endhole catheter and the Surefire Infusion System.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surefire Catheter Versus Standard End-hole Microcatheter: A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Yttrium-90 (Y-90) radioembolization is a minimally invasive trans-arterial treatment for primary and secondary hepatic malignancies that relies on tumor hypervascularity for concentration of radioactive microspheres. The Surefire® Infusion System (SIS) (Westminster, CO) was developed to reduce non-target embolization which can result in morbid complications, especially those involving radioembolic or drug eluting microspheres. Prior to its introduction, radioembolization and other trans-arterial therapies have been performed with standard end-hole catheters. In addition to providing protection against non-target embolization, studies have demonstrated improved penetration of embolic material (tantalum microspheres and Tc-99M labeled MAA) with the use of the SIS when compared to conventional end-hole catheters. To date, no study has demonstrated improved distribution and penetration of yttrium-90 glass microspheres with the use of the Surefire catheter versus a standard end-hole catheter. Y-90 distribution can be evaluated with the use of immediate post-delivery PET/CT imaging as it creates its own pair production and can be imaged in the immediate post delivery period. PET/CT will demonstrate distribution and the dose to tumors can be calculated. The investigators propose a pilot study comparing yttrium-90 tumor distribution and concentration in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with the use of the SIS versus a standard end-hole catheter.</detailed_description>
