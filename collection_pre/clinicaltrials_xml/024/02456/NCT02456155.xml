	<brief_summary>The investigators assessed the utility of ultrasonography in confirming the position of nasal jejunal tube after bedside placement when compared with endoscopic placement in patients with severe acute pancreatitis. Primary endpoint: Success rate. Secondary Endpoint: Adverse effects, Change of intra-abdominal pressure (1h before, 1h after and 3 days after placement), Tolerance of enteral nutrition, Time to approach the target calories.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial of Bedside Placement of Nasal Jejunal Tube Confirmed by Ultrasound Compared to Placement by Endoscope in Patients With SAP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We set this randomised trial to assess the safety and utility of ultrasonography in confirming the position of nasal jejunal tube after bedside placement when compared with endoscopic placement in patients with severe acute pancreatitis. Primary endpoint: Success rate. Secondary Endpoint: Adverse effects, Change of intra-abdominal pressure (1h before, 1h after and 3 days after placement), Tolerance of enteral nutrition, Time to approach the target calories.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>acute pancreatitis patients who need enteral nutrition; patients in acute phase of pancreatitis (within 2 weeks from onset); the severity of pancreatitis is equal to or above moderate (according to the revised classification of pancreatitis). diagnosed with IAH(Intraabdominal pressure) IV grade, abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS); patients who have circulatory failure; patients who have gastrointestinal bleeding; patients who have specific diseases such as chronic digestive diseases and autoimmune diseases; patients in pregnancy.</criteria>
