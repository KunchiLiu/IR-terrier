	<brief_summary>The number of patients undergoing Minimally Invasive Cardiac Surgery (MICS) is increasing each year. MICS procedures on atrioventricular valves are usually performed without conventional sternotomy, an alternative approach is from right anterolateral minithoracotomy. This surgical approach has essential impact both on anesthesia techniques and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) settings. Specific anesthesiological procedure is an insertion of neck venous cannula of CPB through the right internal jugular vein into the superior vena cava both for partial and total bypass. The size of neck cannula is between 15 and 21 French depending on the type of surgical procedure and patient's weight. Central venous catheter and eventually sheath are also inserted into the right internal jugular vein. Thus, there is a relevant question regarding postoperative patency of right internal jugular vein in patients undergoing MICS procedures requiring an insertion of neck cannula of CPB. The investigators hypothesize, there is no significant difference in postoperative patency of internal jugular vein assessed by ultrasound in patient undergoing cardiac surgery with and without neck cannula of CPB</brief_summary>
