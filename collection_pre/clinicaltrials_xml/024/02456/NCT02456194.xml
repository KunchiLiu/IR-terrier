	<brief_summary>This is a prospective clinical trial of tibial plateau fractures treated with internal fixation and a calcium sulfate graft which can be mixed with antibiotics and molded into various bead sizes for implantation into bone defects. The graft material chosen for this study is STIMULAN Rapid Cure (Biocomposites, UK), which is approved for use as a bone void filler and may be mixed with a variety of antibiotics. The combination of STIMULAN + antibiotic in bead form is the "study device". Our primary study aim is to look at resorption and remodeling of the study device into bone. Another important aim of the study is to look at subsidence, or collapse, of the joint surface.</brief_summary>
