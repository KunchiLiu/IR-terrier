	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate how sensory information processing affects balance ability in children with cerebral palsy (CP). An additional goal is to determine if a subsensory electrical stimulation called Stochastic Resonance (SR) Stimulation, can improve balance in children with CP. Children with CP and children with typical development will participate and complete a series of clinical and balance assessments. They will also be tested in a sensor fusion paradigm to investigate potential deficits in the dynamic integration of visual, vestibular and proprioceptive information during upright stance. SR stimulation will then be used to potentially improve these deficits and subsequently their balance ability.</brief_summary>
