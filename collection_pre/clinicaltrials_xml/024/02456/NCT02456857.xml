	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if receiving 4 cycles of experimental chemotherapy before surgery can help to shrink the size of tumors in the breast and/or lymph nodes before they are removed through surgery. The safety of this combination will also be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Women's Triple-Negative First-Line Study: Liposomal Doxorubicin, Bevacizumab and Everolimus (DAE) in Patients With Localized Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) With Tumors Predicted Insensitive to Standard Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: If you are found eligible to take part in this study, you will have 4 cycles of chemotherapy before surgery. Each cycle is 21 days. On Day 1 of each cycle, you will receive liposomal doxorubicin by vein over about 3 hours, and bevacizumab by vein over about 90 minutes (about 4Â½ hours total). You will also be given a 21-day supply of everolimus which you will take by mouth at about the same time every day during the cycle. To reduce the possibility of side effects from surgery, you will not receive bevacizumab during the 4th cycle. Do not skip any doses unless your study doctor tells you to do so. If you throw up after taking everolimus, you should NOT take another tablet that day. Let your study doctor know that you vomited. If you forget to take everolimus one day, do not take any extra doses the next day. Call your study doctor and ask for advice. If you have side effects, the study doctor may decide to lower your study drug dose or have you stop taking the drug. If this happens, the study doctor and staff will let you know when it is safe to restart the study drug later at the same or a lower dose. The study doctor will discuss this with you. If study drug is stopped for a while, you may have extra clinic visits for safety tests. Study Visits: On Day 1 of each cycle: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. After you have received 4 cycles of chemotherapy, or at any time that the disease appears to get worse, you will have imaging scans similar to the ones you had at screening to check the status of the disease. If the disease gets worse, you may come off study and might have either more chemotherapy or surgery. You may then have surgery to remove the disease. You will be given a surgery consent form that describes the procedure and its risks. Length of Treatment: You may receive up to 4 cycles of chemotherapy. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visit. Follow-Up: About 2-3 weeks after surgery, you will have a follow-up visit in which you are asked about how you are doing. The following test will be preformed: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. - If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an ultrasound, MRI, or CT scan of your chest to check the status of the disease. This is an investigational study. Liposomal doxorubicin is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of breast cancer. Bevacizumab and everolimus have both been FDA approved for other conditions and types of cancer. However, neither bevacizumab nor everolimus are FDA-approved for triple-negative breast cancer. They are currently being used for research purposes only in this setting as triple-negative breast cancer treatment before surgery. The study doctor can explain how these study drugs are designed to work. Up to 37 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
