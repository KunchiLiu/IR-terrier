	<brief_summary>This pilot study will explore the prevalence of expression of four immune checkpoint biomarkers on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from men with metastatic prostate cancer that are captured by EpCAM via the CellSearch method, and specifically defined as co expressing DAPI and cytokeratin, and lacking CD45 expression.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following criteria apply: 1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Small cell or neuroendocrine tumors of the prostate are also permitted. 2. Clinical or radiographic evidence of progressive metastatic disease, with progression defined as a rising PSA, new metastatic lesions (bone or soft tissue), or radiographic evidence of tumor growth on CT or MRI. 3. Age &gt; 18 years. 4. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. In addition to meeting all of the above criteria, patients must meet all of the criteria for one of the following groups: A) mCRPC starting abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide and concurrent sipuleucelT (Provenge) 1. For patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate (not applicable for patients with small cell or neuroendocrine tumors of the prostate): Castrate levels of testosterone (&lt;50 ng/dl) 2. Patient planning to start abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide and concurrent sipuleucelT (within six months of initiation of abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide). 3. Enrollment prior to the initiation of abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide and sipuleucelT. B) mCRPC with visceral or high risk disease preabiraterone/enzalutamide 1. For patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate (not applicable for patients with small cell or neuroendocrine tumors of the prostate): Castrate levels of testosterone (&lt;50 ng/dl) 2. Visceral OR high risk disease must meet one of the following categories: Visceral disease: Radiographic evidence of liver, adrenal, pulmonary, or brain metastases High risk disease: Presence of at least 2 of the following factors: Bone pain requiring opioids Anemia (Hgb &lt;13 g/dL) Bone scan progression at baseline &gt;2 sites of metastatic disease Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) 70 PSA doubling time &lt;3 months 3. Patient planning to start abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide. 4. Enrollment prior to the initiation of abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide. C) High volume metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) starting hormonal therapy and docetaxel chemotherapy or declining docetaxel chemotherapy 1. Testosterone &gt; 50 ng/dL 2. High volume metastatic disease: visceral metastases and/or 4 bone metastases, at least one of which is outside the axial (spine or pelvic bones) skeleton 3. Enrollment within 4 months of initiation of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). 4. Patient planning to start docetaxel in addition to ADT or patient eligible for docetaxel but declines chemotherapy. 5. Enrollment prior to the initiation of docetaxel chemotherapy. D) Enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate resistant mCRPC 1. For patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate (not applicable for patients with small cell or neuroendocrine tumors of the prostate): Castrate levels of testosterone (&lt;50 ng/dl) 2. Evidence of disease progression on or following enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate, as defined by one of the following: Radiographic evidence of disease progression as defined by new bone scan lesions or growth of existing soft tissue/visceral/lymph node/bone metastases as determined by the investigator Clinical progression of disease with cutaneous lesions or palpable lesions in absence of radiographic progression 1. History of intercurrent or past medical or psychiatric illness that would make participation in a blood drawing protocol difficult or not feasible at the discretion of the principal investigator or coinvestigator(s). 2. Treatment with an anthracycline (including mitoxantrone) within 1 week of CTC collection, as anthracyclines cause autofluorescence of cells.</criteria>
