	<brief_summary>Autologous T cells engineered to express an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) with a safety switch will be infused back to patients with B cell malignancies, including lymphoma and leukemia. The patients will be monitored after infusion of anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cells for adverse events, persistence of anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cells and treatment efficacy. Objectives: To evaluate the safety and the efficacy of anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cell therapy for patients with B cell malignancies. Eligibility: Patients between 1 and 85 years of age, who have relapsed or refractory CD19-expressing B-cell malignancies (leukemia or lymphoma) that have not responded to standard treatments. Patients with a history of allogeneic stem cell transplant who meet all eligibility criteria are eligible to participate. Patients must have adequate organ functions. Design: - Peripheral blood from patients will be collected for isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which will be transduced with a lentiviral or retroviral vector encoding anti-CD19 CAR containing a CD28 and a CD3 zeta as costimulatory domains as well as a safety switch. - Patients will receive a lymphodepleting preconditioning regimen to prepare their immune system to accept modified T cells. - Patients will receive an infusion of their own modified T cells. They will remain in the hospital to be monitored for adverse events until they have recovered from the treatment. - Patients will have frequent follow-up visits to monitor the persistence of modified T cells and efficacy of the treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anti-CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-Transduced T Cell Therapy for Patients With B Cell Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite progress has been made to date in the treatment of patients with B cell malignancies, including leukemia and lymphoma, many patients with relapsed or refractory diseases do not respond to the standard treatments. It has been shown that anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cells may be an effective approach to treat the relapsed or refractory diseases. The procedure involves collecting PBMCs from the patients and modifying the T cells to attack the malignant B cells. In this trial, autologous T cells engineered to express an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) containing the signaling domains of CD28 and CD3-zeta, and a safety switch will be infused back to patients with B cell malignancies, including lymphoma and leukemia. The patients will be pretreated with a lymphodepleting preconditioning regimen before the infusion of anti-CD19 CAR T cells, and will be monitored for adverse events, persistence of anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cells and the treatment efficacy. OBJECTIVES: - Primary objectives - To determine the safety and feasibility of the administration of anti-CD19 CAR transduced T cells in patients with CD19+ B-cell malignancies. - Secondary objectives: - To determine if the treatment regimen can result in clinical regression of B-cell malignancies in the patients as described above. - To determine the in vivo persistency of the anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cells.</detailed_description>
