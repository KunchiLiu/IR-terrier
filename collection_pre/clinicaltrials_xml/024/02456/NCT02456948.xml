	<brief_title>Adjunct Minocyline in Treatment-resistant Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter proof-of-principle trial of adjunctive minocycline for patients with unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD). The study tests the antidepressant efficacy of minocycline as an adjunct to an antidepressant standard treatment with es-/citalopram, venlafaxine or mirtazapine monotherapy (AD-ST), for patients with unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD). The respective AD, for which non-response has been documented, must be on a stable regimen for at least 14 days prior to inclusion. AD-ST will then be continued throughout the trial. Trial medication is adjunct oral minocycline 200 mg/day or placebo. Response to treatment will be measured via the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). The total study duration for each patient will be 6 weeks.</detailed_description>
