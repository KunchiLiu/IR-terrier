	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, multi-center, parallel-group study to evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) after a single subcutaneous (SC) injection of 150 mg/mL or 300 mg/2 mL Depo-Provera CI in the abdomen of women of reproductive age with a confirmed ovulatory baseline cycle.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, multi-center, parallel-group study with a primary objective to evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) after a single subcutaneous (SC) injection of 150mg/mL or 300mg/2mL Depo-Provera CI in the abdomen of women of reproductive age with a confirmed ovulatory baseline cycle. Secondary study objectives are: - To evaluate and compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of MPA after a single SC injection of 150mg/mL or 300mg/2mL of Depo-Provera CI to two injections of Depo-subQ 104 administered 3 months apart - To evaluate the relationship between serum MPA concentration and suppression of ovulation - To evaluate and compare the safety, tolerability and acceptability of a SC injection of DMPA of different frequencies, doses and volumes</detailed_description>
