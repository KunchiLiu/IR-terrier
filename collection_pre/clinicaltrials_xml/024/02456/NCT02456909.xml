	<brief_title>Patient Controlled Analgesia Pump Cues on Patient Satisfaction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-operative pain is primarily managed via Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA). The newest PCA pumps can be programmed so that the button is backlit with a green light at the end of the lockout period, and the green light flashes when the medication is being dispensed. No studies have examined whether this type of visual cue would influence satisfaction or other patient outcomes (such as opioid consumption, PCA safety and patient anxiety) in children and adolescents, and no studies have examined whether pediatric patients' perspectives would be similar to those of adults.</detailed_description>
