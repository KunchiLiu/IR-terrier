	<brief_summary>The purpose of the PaTH Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN) Study of Healthy Lifestyles, Body Weight and Health Care is to use clinical data from electronic health records (EHR) and patient reported outcomes (PRO) to answer questions of clinical importance to patients, providers, and other stakeholders.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PaTH Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN) Study of Healthy Lifestyles and Health Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to create the PaTH Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN) Study of Healthy Lifestyles, Body Weight and Health Care, which will allow the conduct of patient-centered observational studies on weight across the multiple institutions of the PaTH network. Creating the PaTH Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN) Study of Healthy Lifestyles, Body Weight and Health Care will involve: 1. Recruiting patients with longitudinal weight data in the EHR to participate in the PaTH Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN) Study of Healthy Lifestyles, Body Weight and Health Care 2. Administering surveys to the PaTH Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN) Study of Healthy Lifestyles, Body Weight and Health Care approximately every 6 months to collect patient reported outcomes (PROs) 3. Collecting individual patient health record data into the PaTH Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN) Study of Healthy Lifestyles, Body Weight and Health Care database 4. Identifying potential participants for future research studies. 5. Tracking whether the patient participant has biospecimens in a PaTH site biorepository and prepare for possible sharing of biospecimens in future studies. The secondary objectives are to use the PaTH Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN) Study of Healthy Lifestyles, Body Weight and Health Care to answer patient-centered research questions including: (1) How do survey response rates, sample demographics and survey responses differ by recruitment technique? (2) What are patients' weight management strategies? How much are health care providers contributing to their weight management approaches? Do these relationships vary by weight status, region, age, sex, or race; (3) What are patients' reasons for seeking bariatric surgery and expectations in terms of weight change?; (4) Among patients seeking bariatric surgery, what proportion with high risk for sleep apnea by survey responses have been evaluated for or diagnosed with this health problem? (5) How does physical activity vary with patients co-morbidity status?</detailed_description>
