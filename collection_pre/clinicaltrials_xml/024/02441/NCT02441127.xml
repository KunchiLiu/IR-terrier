	<brief_summary>Aims: The aim of present randomized controlled clinical study was to evaluate whether the additional use of diode laser would facilitate the donor surgery, improve the palatal wound healing and reduce post-operative morbidity after the coronally advanced flap (CAF) with connective tissue (CTG) grafts. Methods: Fifty-two patients with isolated recessions were treated. The CTG resulted from the de-epithelialization of a free gingival graft (FGG) with blade (control group) or diode laser (DL) (test group). The DL was used to de-epithelialize the outer part of the FGG and photo-biostimulate the palatal wound area. Post-operative morbidity was evaluated by using Oral health related Quality of life (QoL), smile related QoL and visual analogue scale-discomfort (VAS). Root coverage outcomes were also evaluated 6 months after operation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The procedure of connective tissue harvesting from the palate is often characterized by the challenge of obtaining the largest volume of tissue possible on one side while minimizing post-operative pain and reducing the risk of complications on the other.The present clinical study evaluated whether the additional use of diode laser would facilitate the donor surgery, improve the palatal wound healing and reduce post-operative morbidity after the bilaminar periodontal plastic surgery procedure for the treatment of isolated single gingival recession defects with no loss of interdental clinical attachment. In the test sites, an aluminum, gallium, and arsenide diode laser (wavelength 810 nm and power of 1W) was applied in continuous mode. In the control group,a free (epithelialized) gingival graft was harvested by two horizontal and two vertical incisions defining the area. The post operative course of the patients were evaluated by visual analogical scale and the oral health impact profile</detailed_description>
