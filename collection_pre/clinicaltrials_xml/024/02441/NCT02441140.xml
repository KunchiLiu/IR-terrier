	<brief_title>Detection of Tumor Associated Cell-free DNA in Peritoneal Fluid Obtained by Culdocentesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study is a Feasibility Study, to try to evaluate whether or not culdocentesis can detect tumor associated cell free DNA. Although this is the first time investigators are using this type of procedure to detect cell free DNA, culdocentesis is not a new procedure. It used to be done routinely in the past to examine pelvic fluid. The investigator's goal is to develop a test to detect ovarian cancer in women before they develop any signs or symptoms of the disease. Currently, there is no screening test for ovarian cancer. This study uses a technique called "culdocentesis" to detect DNA released by ovarian cancer cells into pelvic fluid. During culdocentesis, a small needle is inserted through the vagina into an empty space between the uterus and the rectum called the "cul-de-sac." Fluid is withdrawn from this space and sent for analysis. Culdocentesis is a technique that has been used for many years to examine pelvic fluid and determine its composition, but it has not previously been studied as a technique for examining cell-free DNA to detect ovarian cancer. The investigators suspect that this may be a useful way to detect cell-free DNA from ovarian cancer cells because the ovaries are very close to the cul-de-sac space. In this study, the investigators will compare our ability to detect cell-free DNA in fluid from the cul-de-sac with our ability to detect cell-free DNA from a vaginal swab (similar to a Pap smear), a blood test, and in the tissue specimens collected at the time of surgery. The investigators are hoping to learn from this study whether developing a cell-free DNA test to screen for ovarian cancer involving culdocentesis would be an effective strategy.</detailed_description>
