	<brief_summary>The optimal choice of carbohydrate in infant formula needs to be assessed in more detail. Lactose has conventionally been used in most milk-based infant formulas, but more recently lactose-free formulas based on corn syrup solids/maltodextrins have gained in popularity. However, the metabolic consequences have not been examined. In a pilot study, the investigators will assess the postprandial metabolic response to a meal of formula with either lactose or maltodextrins. A breastfed reference group is also included.</brief_summary>
