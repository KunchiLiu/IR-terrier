	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to detect Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS) in an early stage using the outcome parameters generated by Functional Respiratory Imaging (FRI). Robust and automated segmentation algorithms will be developed for these parameters, focusing on quantitative computed tomography (CT) image analyses to provide the physician a more sensitive diagnostics tool. The evolution of BOS over time will be monitored using nmon-rigid image registration methods.</brief_summary>
