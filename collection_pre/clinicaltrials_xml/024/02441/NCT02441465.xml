	<brief_summary>This study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single intravenous (IV) infusion of ^14 C-labeled vemurafenib administered shortly after an oral dose of vemurafenib and following multiple oral doses of vemurafenib twice daily (BID) at steady state as well as to estimate the absolute bioavailability of multiple oral doses of vemurafenib BID at steady state in participants with BRAF^V600 mutation-positive malignancies.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participants with either unresectable or metastatic melanoma positive for the BRAF^V600 mutation or other malignant tumor type that harbors a V600activating mutation of BRAF, and for whom vemurafenib is an accepted standard of care or where there is no other generally accepted standard of care Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2 Life expectancy &gt; or = 12 weeks Full recovery from the effects of any major surgery or significant traumatic injury within 14 days from the first dose of study drug Adequate hematologic and end organ function as defined by laboratory results obtained within 2 weeks prior to administration of study drug on Day 1 Female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with partners of childbearing potential must agree to use two effective methods of contraception during the study and at least 6 months after completion of the study drug Negative serum pregnancy test results within 7 days prior to Day 1 in women of childbearing potential Absence of any psychological, familial, or sociological condition, or geographical constraints that could potentially hamper compliance with the study protocol and followup schedule Prior anticancer therapy before the administration of study drug on Day 1 Invasive malignancy other than BRAF mutant melanoma or other qualifying malignant tumor with BRAF^V600 mutation within the past 5 years History of clinically significant cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction Active central nervous system lesions Current, severe, uncontrolled systemic disease Inability or unwillingness to swallow tablets History of malabsorption, stomach or intestinal surgery/resection, or other condition that would potentially alter absorption and/or excretion of orally administered drugs History of clinically significant liver disease Active autoimmune disease Uncontrolled ascites requiring weekly largevolume paracentesis for 3 consecutive weeks prior to enrollment Pregnancy, lactation, or breastfeeding Need to take a concomitant medication, dietary supplement, or food that is prohibited during the study Known allergy or sensitivity to components of the vemurafenib formulation Active, uncontrolled or chronic infection requiring chronic suppressive antibiotics Use of any prescription medications/products, that are known to be strong cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 inhibitors or inducers within 2 weeks prior to Day 1 Participation in any other investigational drug study in which receipt of an investigational study drug occurred within 30 days prior to Day 1 or within 5 times the elimination halflife of the respective drug (whichever is shorter) Participation in a trial involving administration of ^14 Cradiolabeled compound(s) within 6 months prior to Day 1 Poor peripheral venous access Any other acute or chronic condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, could limit the patient's ability to complete and/or participate in this clinical study</criteria>
