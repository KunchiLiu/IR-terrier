	<brief_summary>QT interval changes is measured during all phases of the operation. The protocol is focusing at intraoperative bleeding events and is also observing QT interval changes during anesthetic and operative procedures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraoperative Volume Management and QT Interval</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prolongation of the QT interval is associated with functional torsade de points, re-entry, and sudden death (see reference). Variations of QT-interval caused by changes in the volume status of the patient during an operation remained unclear. QT interval changes will be monitored during the surgery with the focus of the influence of sudden blood loss, volume substitution by crystalloids, blood and blood products. The effect of surgical procedures on the QT-intervall (e.g. clamping of kidney artery) will be observed as well as the association of intra-operative QT-interval alterations with postoperative complications.</detailed_description>
