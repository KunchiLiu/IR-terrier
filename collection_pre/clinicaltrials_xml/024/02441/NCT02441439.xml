	<brief_title>To Compare the Efficacy of I.V 200 mg Iron Sucrose and 500 mg Iron Sucrose to Treat Anemia in Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anemia is common during pregnancy. It is associated with maternal and neonatal complications. It is acceptable to prescribe oral iron supplements. However, gastrointestinal side effects are very common and those lead to patient's intolerance as well as low patient's compliance. In those cases, as well as in severe anemia it is recommended to give iron sucrose. This drug is administered intravenously is effective to treat iron deficiency anemia with a minimal adverse effect profile. The two methods of giving iron sucrose is (1) to give I.V 200 mg iron sucrose 2-3 times/week or (2) to give I.V 500 mg iron sucrose once a week In the present study we aim to compare between the efficacy of those 2 protocols.</detailed_description>
