	<brief_summary>This is a Bayesian designed multi-arm, multi-centre, open label phase II study. The target sample size of 40 patients will be recruited from up to 8 EU countries, but this may be revised in light of the interim analysis. Patients with relapsed or metastatic osteosarcoma will be divided into three treatment groups. They will all either have surgery or a biopsy before and after six weeks exposure to either Mifamurtide alone, Ifosfamide alone, or Mifamurtide combined with Ifosfamide. They will then receive further treatment to a maximum of 42 or 36 weeks in total (depending on Arm), with all patients being able to receive 36 weeks of Mifamurtide treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Eurosarc Study of Mifamurtide in Advanced Osteosarcoma (MEMOS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary tumour arising from bones. There is currently no approved treatment other than surgery for metastatic or recurrent osteosarcoma refractory to chemotherapy. Patients deemed unresectable normally receive chemotherapy prior to attempted resection. The addition of chemotherapy to surgery for metastatic or recurrent osteosarcoma may improve response rates. MEPACT (Mifamurtide, MTP-PE) is licensed for use in the adjuvant osteosarcoma setting; indicated in children, adolescents and young adults for the treatment of high-grade resectable non-metastatic osteosarcoma after macroscopically complete surgical resection. It is used in combination with post-operative multi-agent chemotherapy. This is a Bayesian designed multi-arm, multi-centre open-label phase II study in patients with metastatic and/or recurrent osteosarcoma, which will investigate why some patients with osteosarcoma may respond better than others to mifamurtide given alone or in combination with ifosfamide. Patients with relapsed or metastatic osteosarcoma will be divided into three treatment groups (Arms). Depending on their current disease status, patients may be either Registered to Arm A (resectable group), to receive Mifamurtide alone; or Randomised to Arm B/C (non-resectable group), to receive mifamurtide in combination with ifosfamide. Arm A - Mifamurtide alone; Arm B - Ifosfamide alone for 6 weeks then Ifosfamide + mifamurtide for 6 weeks, then mifamurtide alone for 30 weeks; Arm C - Ifosfamide + mifamurtide for 12 weeks then mifamurtide alone for 24 weeks. All participants will receive 36 weeks or more of mifamurtide. Biopsies (or resected tumour samples) will be obtained before and after 6 weeks of therapy interval in order to determine the pharmacodynamic endpoints. The target sample size is 40 patients. An interim analysis will be performed for the primary efficacy endpoint.</detailed_description>

Previous treatment with mifamurtide or a mifamurtidelike drug* in a clinical trial setting for the treatment of metastatic and/or recurrent osteosarcoma in the six months prior to registration. 3.

Concurrent use of ciclosporin or other calcineurin inhibitors. 11. Any psychological, social or medical condition, physical examination finding or a laboratory abnormality that the Investigator considers would make the patient a poor trial candidate or could interfere with protocol compliance or the interpretation of trial results. 12.
