	<brief_title>Application of Monitoring and Intervention Technologies in Suboptimal Health Status</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Suboptimal health status questionnaire (SHSQ-25) is used to evaluate the suboptimal health status. The SHSQ-25 includes 25 questions. The score of the SHSQ-25 is from 0 to 100. Suboptimal health status is defined as the SHSQ-25 score above than 35. The higher scores of the SHSQ-25 one gets, the more severity of suboptimal health status he/she has. All participants are asked to fill in the SHSQ-25 before and after the intervention. If the score decreases after the intervention, it means that the suboptimal health status has been improved. A monitoring device is used to monitor a person's blood pressure, blood glucose, oxygen saturation, body weight, and energy consumption by Bluetooth Wireless technology. Intervention technologies include a health information push technology and a field-effect meridian therapy instrument.</detailed_description>
