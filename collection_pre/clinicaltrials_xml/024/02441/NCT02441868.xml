	<brief_title>Feasibility Testing of a Hospice Family Caregiver Intervention to Improve Patient Dyspnea Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Shortness of breath is a prevalent symptom causing distress among patients at the end of life. In home hospice care family caregivers are expected to assist their family member with symptom management. This is often accomplished with little or no training. The investigators have developed a bundle of training materials targeted for family caregivers of home hospice patients at risk for shortness of breath. The investigators will pilot test the intervention in this clinical trial. A future randomized clinical trial is planned and the evidence from this pilot will enhance the planning of that future trial.</detailed_description>
