	<brief_summary>Periodontitis is a highly prevalent chronic inflammatory disease that is characterized by loss of the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone, and is a major cause of tooth loss. Results from clinical and epidemiological studies have suggested that periodontitis and tooth loss are more prevalent in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). There is evidence to suggest that periodontitis could indeed be a causal factor in the initiation and maintenance of the autoimmune inflammatory response that occurs in RA. If so, chronic periodontitis might represent an important modifiable risk factor for RA. However, to date longitudinal studies on the effect of periodontitis on disease progression in RA are lacking. The aim of the present study is to assess the periodontal status of patients enrolled in an established longitudinal cohort of RA patients. These data will then be analysed to evaluate whether or not periodontal inflammation is related to parameters of rheumatoid arthritis.</brief_summary>
