	<brief_summary>Epilepsy is a frequent neurological disorder with about a third of patients having seizures despite treatment. At least some of these seizures can be linked to a low compliance and therapy adherence of patients. Compliance is defined as "the extent to which a person's behavior (in terms of taking medication, following diets, or executing life style changes) coincides with medical or health advice". Therapy adherence of patients suffering from epilepsy is low with reported rates between 30 and 50%, although adherence to anticonvulsive drug therapy is critical for effective disease management and low therapy adherence is associated to higher mortality in epilepsy. The reasons for low therapy adherence are still a matter of research. Some known factors influencing compliance in epilepsy are related to its chronic nature, but others seem to lie in a complex interaction between psychiatric comorbidity and an impairment of neural systems underlying behavior. Furthermore, therapy adherence rests a variable difficult to measure, especially in epileptic patients where classical tools such as questionnaires and electronic monitoring devices have been shown to be imprecise. It has been argued that the term 'compliance' should be replaced by 'co-operative behavior' and non-compliance can therefore be interpreted as troubled co-operative behavior. This behavioral approach offers the potential of using tools and methods of the latest developments in behavioral neuroscience. Neuroeconomics, a scientific field on the border of psychology, economics and neuroscience, has used economic game paradigms in order to operationalize cooperative behavior and to identify several brain areas by functional brain imaging that have been linked to social co-operative behavior. The majority of these brain areas are located in the frontal cortex [ventromedial frontal/orbitofrontal cortex, and rostral anterior cingulate cortex. Epilepsies originating in the frontal lobe are subsumed under the term "frontal lobe epilepsy" (FLE) and represent 20-30% of all partial seizures and 25% of all refractory focal epilepsies referred to epilepsy surgery. The investigator's project plans to study compliance and cooperative behavior of patients suffering from frontal lobe epilepsies through a neuroeconomic approach by (1) comparing the behavior of these patients in the prisoners' dilemma game to the behavior of age-, gender-, and education-matched healthy controls, (2) correlation of game behavior to brain activation measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging in both patients and healthy controls and (3) studying the link between cooperative behavior to compliance captured by pill counts and questionnaires.</brief_summary>
