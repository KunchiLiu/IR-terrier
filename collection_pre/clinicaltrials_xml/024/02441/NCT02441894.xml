	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To assess the tolerability of cabazitaxel 25 mg per body surface area (m^2) with primary prophylactic polyethylene glycol-granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (PEG-G-CSF) in terms of the incidence rate of febrile neutropenia (FN) (defined: absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt;1000 per volume [mm^3] and a single temperature of &gt;38.3 degree or a sustained temperature of ≥38 degree Celsius for more than one hour) during Cycle 1. Secondary Objective: To assess overall rate of FN and grade ≥3 neutropenia and diarrhea; frequencies of dose delay due to adverse events (AEs); dose reduction due to AEs; relative dose intensity; incidences of FN-related hospitalization and use of intravenous (IV) anti-infectives; tolerability according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v4.0; prostate specific antigen (PSA) response (50% decrease); tumor response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 if available.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Patients with metastatic castrationresistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) previously treated with chemotherapy including docetaxel. Male patients. Patients must have either measurable or nonmeasurable disease, or documented rising PSA levels. Patients signed informed consent. Exclusion criteria: Age &lt;20 at registration. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) ≥2. Inadequate organ and bone marrow function at registration as evidenced by: Hemoglobin &lt;10.0 g/dL. ANC &lt;5 x 10^9/L. Platelet count &lt;100 x 10^9/L. Aspartate transaminase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). Total bilirubin &gt;1.0 x ULN. Serum creatinine &gt;1.5 x ULN. Serum creatinine is 1.01.5 x ULN and creatinine clearance is under 60 mL/min (calculated according to Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration [CKDEP]). Prior isotope therapy or radiotherapy to ≥30% of bone marrow. At the first study drug administration day, patient has not elapsed 8 weeks (12 weeks for strontium89) from the day prior isotope therapy finished. Prior surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or other anticancer therapy within 4 weeks prior to enrollment in the study. Symptomatic peripheral neuropathy grade ≥2 (NCI CTCAE v.4.0). History of severe hypersensitivity reaction (grade ≥3) to polysorbate 80 containing drugs. Prior and other concurrent malignancy, excepted cases are as follows; basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of skin, or superficial (pTis, pTa, and pT1) bladder cancer (including immunotherapy) treated adequately, any other cancer completed the chemotherapy more than 5 years ago and been more than 5 years as disease free duration. Uncontrolled severe illness or medical condition (including uncontrolled diabetes mellitus). Known lesion at brain or leptomeninx. Known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDSrelated illnesses) or known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease requiring antiretroviral treatment. Active varicella zoster infection, antihepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodypositive (excluding patients negative for HCV virus in blood test or nonactive seropositive patients with no hepatic abnormalities [AST, ALT, etc.]), or hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigenpositive. Concurrent or planned treatment with strong inhibitors or strong inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 or 5 (washout period for a one week is necessary for patients who are already on these treatments or a twoweek washout period is necessary for patients who are already on these treatments). Contraindication to be used corticosteroid. Patients with reproductive potential who do not agree to use an accepted and effective method of contraception during the study treatment period. The definition of "effective method of contraception" will be based on the Investigator's judgment. Participation in another clinical trial and any concurrent treatment with any investigational drug within 30 days prior to registration. Prior history of severe hypersensitivity reaction (≥grade 3) or intolerance to prednisolone, PEGGCSF or GCSF. Known hypersensitivity to the component of PEGGCSF and/or GCSF. Myelogenous leukemia insufficient decrease of the number of blast in bone marrow, or found myeloblast in peripheral blood. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
