	<brief_summary>Laryngeal mask airway is seldom used for control ventilation in America, while it is popular in China. The question is whether the incidence of gastroesophageal reflux in control ventilation is really higher than in spontaneous ventilation. So the investigators combine the third generation laryngeal mask and catheter-based Digitrapper ph-Z monitor system to evaluate the exact incidence of gastroesophageal reflux in these two groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gastroesophageal Reflux During LMA in Control Ventilation (LMA, Laryngeal Mask Airway)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients scheduled for LMA ventilation are divided into two groups randomly, control ventilation group and spontaneous ventilation group. After the third generation laryngeal mask is inserted, catheter-based Digitrapper ph-Z monitor system is applied to measure the exact incidence of gastroesophageal reflux in these two groups.</detailed_description>
