	<brief_title>Validation of the 1-minute Sit-to-stand Test in Patients With COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exercise capacity is a strong predictor for mortality, exacerbations and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The 1-minute sit-to-stand test (1-min STS test) is a promising exercise capacity test that is simple to conduct and requires few resources. This study will provide an in-depth validation of the 1-min STS test, specifically evaluating the tests reliability, validity, responsiveness to change and minimal clinically important difference. The study will also assess the predictive properties of the 1-min STS test with regards to detecting exacerbations, as well as identify patterns of physical activity and patient-reported symptoms of exacerbations.</detailed_description>
