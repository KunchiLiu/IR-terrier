	<brief_summary>Up to 15 subjects will be enrolled and randomized. Randomized subjects will receive one single-side Ulthera® treatment in the pre-auricular region on the face. At each subject's scheduled facelift procedure, resected tissue will be obtained for analysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gene Expression Following Ultherapy® Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multi-center, pilot clinical trial to evaluate the molecular changes following an Ultherapy® treatment. Subjects will be randomized to one of five treatment groups and, based on study group assignment, will receive one single-side Ultherapy® treatment at varying timepoints prior to an already planned facelift procedure. Treatment will be delivered to the pre-auricular region on one side of the face; the contralateral side will serve as control. During an already planned facelift procedure, treated and non-treated resected tissue will be obtained for analysis.</detailed_description>
