	<brief_summary>There are some treatments after Stroke. Among these, use forced therapy (FUT), which is based on overcoming learned disuse by reintroduction of the paretic upper limb in the performance of daily activities. There are different protocols FUT to the daily time constraint, the number of days and even the type of constriction. Researchers have developed a protocol using four weeks constriction, daily constriction 24 hours and with the free end of the weekends. Because it is a restrictive therapy, which requires the use of one of the arms and on the other hand, this mode of treatment is open to criticism, however, despite the efficacy of the protocol, patients do not have good adhesion to the protocol for the constriction severe over time. The objective of this work is to verify the safety of the developed protocol and analyze the feasibility of reducing the daily time of constriction 12 hours, with a new protocol movement constriction, easier to perform and more patient acceptance. Participate in this study 82 individuals hemiparetic post Stroke, which will be recruited to Neurovascular Diseases Clinic and will be registered at the Rehabilitation Center of Integrated State Hospital. Participants will be randomly divided into three groups: the FUT24 (non-paretic upper limb constriction 24 hours a day, five days a week for 4 weeks), the FUT 12 (non-paretic upper limb constriction for 12 hours a day, five days a week for 4 weeks) and CK (Classic Kinesiotherapy, at least 2 times a week for 4 weeks). Will be held weekly and after the end of the monthly monitoring reviews protocols. For the rating scales are use: National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, the Ashworth Scale, the Wolf Motor Function Test, the Motor Activity Log, Fugl-Meyer Assesment, dynamometry handgrip and surface electromyography (flexor and extensor muscles wrist). The researchers hope that this protocol does not bring damage to the upper limb in constriction and it is established a new protocol FUT easier to perform and more acceptable to patients, allowing the use of this technique by health professionals.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The constriction of the non-paretic upper limb will be conducted through a tubular mesh with UL positioned in adduction and shoulder internal rotation and elbow flexion greater than 90ยบ in FUT 24 and FUT 12 groups. Daily, the mesh is withdrawn by the investigators made hygienic, and the new constraint is accomplished using a new tubular mesh.The Classic Kinesiotherapy Group,which will receive as a treatment only kinesiotherapy.</detailed_description>
