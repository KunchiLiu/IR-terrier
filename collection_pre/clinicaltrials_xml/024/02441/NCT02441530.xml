	<detailed_description>An excessive uterine production of prostaglandins is the pathogenic trigger of dysmenorrhoea. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the currently accepted drugs for the management of this disorder. The capacity for synthesizing vitamin D and the presence of vitamin D receptor in human cycling endometrium have also been demonstrated. Because vitamin D reduces the synthesis of prostaglandins, a beneficial effect of vitamin D for the uterus is possible.Vitamin E inhibits the release of arachidonic acid and the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin via an action on the enzymes phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase.</detailed_description>
