	<brief_summary>ROHHAD (rapid onset obesity, hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysregulation) syndrome is a rare pediatric disorder associated with a cancer called neuroblastoma and presumed to be driven by an attack of the immune system on specific area in the brain. Patients develop severe symptoms and often succumb to this disease. Based on the researchers' experience the investigators conduct a clinical trial to study intensive immunosuppression with high-dose cyclophosphamide in these patients. In addition to describing the symptomatic improvement, the investigators' trial seeks to define objective markers of disease activity.</brief_summary>
