	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of a single oral dose of eleclazine and its metabolite, GS-623134, in participants with normal and impaired renal function. Participants in the healthy control group will be matched to participants with impaired renal function by age (± 5 years), gender, and body mass index (± 10%).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All Individuals: Be a nonsmoker or consume &lt; 20 cigarettes per day Have a calculated body mass index (BMI) from 18 to 36 kg/m^2, inclusive, at study screening Have either a normal 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) or one with abnormalities that are considered clinically insignificant by the investigator Screening labs within defined thresholds Individuals with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment must also meet the following additional inclusion criteria to be eligible for participation in this study: Must have diagnosis of chronic (&gt; 6 months), stable renal impairment with no clinically significant changes within 3 months (90 days) prior to study drug administration (Day 1) Individuals with severe renal impairment, creatinine clearance (CLcr) must be 1529 mL/min, inclusive (using the CockcroftGault method) based on serum creatinine and actual body weight as measured at the screening evaluation. If an individual's score changes during the course of the study, the score at screening will be used for classification. Individuals with moderate renal impairment, CLcr must be 3059 mL/min, inclusive (using the CockcroftGault method) based on serum creatinine and actual body weight as measured at the screening evaluation. If an individual's score changes during the course of the study, the score at screening will be used for classification. Individuals with mild renal impairment , CLcr must be 6089, inclusive mL/min (using the CockcroftGault method) based on serum creatinine and actual body weight as measured at the screening evaluation. If an individual's score changes during the course of the study, the score at screening will be used for classification. Individuals with normal renal function must also meet the following additional inclusion criteria to be eligible for participation in this study: Must, in the opinion of the Investigator, be in good health based upon medical history, physical examination, vital signs, and screening laboratory evaluations Must have an CLcr of ≥ 90 mL/min (using the CockcroftGault method) based on serum creatinine and actual body weight as measured at the screening evaluation. History of meningitis or encephalitis, epilepsy, seizures, migraines, tremors, myoclonic jerks, narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea, anxiety, syncope, head injuries or a family history of seizures Presence or history of cardiovascular disease (including history of myocardial infarction based on ECG and/or clinical history, any history of ventricular tachycardia, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, or left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 40%), cardiac conduction abnormalities, a family history of Long QT Syndrome, or unexplained death in an otherwise healthy individual between the ages of 1 and 30 years Syncope, palpitations, or unexplained dizziness Implanted defibrillator or pacemaker Medical history of renal carcinoma or hepatorenal syndrome. Individuals receiving or anticipating use of hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or any other renal replacement therapy or other medical procedure that serves as a surrogate for renal function during the study. Individuals with fluctuating or rapidly deteriorating renal function. Assessment of the stability of the individual's renal function will be determined by the investigator. Renal allograft recipients Experienced hypertensive crisis, required the addition of ≥1 antihypertensive drug, or required more intensive antihypertensive therapy (eg, addition of a new drug class) in the last 3 months</criteria>
