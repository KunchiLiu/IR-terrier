	<brief_summary>Regional lymph node metastasis is a major determinant of local recurrence and overall survival rates in patients with colorectal cancer. Because of the poor prognosis associated with the presence of lymph node metastasis, stage III colorectal cancer patients should receive adjuvant treatment with chemo and / or radiation therapy according to the site of tumor. Several authors have investigated the use of revealing solutions for lymph node clearance in colorectal cancer. Most studies comparing conventional histopathological specimen examination to any lymph node clearing technique showed that the use of revealing solutions increases the mean number of lymph nodes harvested, usually in a statistically significant manner. It is still controversial the impact of the use of revealing solutions for upstaging of lymph node status and consequently for the indication for adjuvant therapy. Therefore will be conducted a randomized clinical trial to compares the performance of GEWF and Carnoy solutions for the histopathological examination of patients with colorectal cancer. The aim of this study is to determine the lymph node revealing solution with the best performance (increase in the mean number of lymph node harvested and lymph node upstaging) in patients with colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
