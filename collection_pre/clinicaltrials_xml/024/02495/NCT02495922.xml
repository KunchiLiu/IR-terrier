	<brief_summary>Trial in patients with newly diagnosed myeloma to evaluate the effect of elotuzumab in induction and consolidation therapy with bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone and in lenalidomide maintenance treatment</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase III Trial on the Effect of Elotuzumab in VRD Induction /Consolidation and Lenalidomide Maintenance in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective, multicentre, randomised, parallel group, open, phase III clinical trial, for patients with confirmed diagnosis of untreated multiple myeloma requiring systemic therapy . Investigational Medicinal Products:Elotuzumab, lenalidomide Patients are randomized in one of 4 study arms (A1, A2, B1, B2). Patients randomized in arm A1 or A2 will receive 4 cycles VRD (Bortezomib (Velcade®), Lenalidomide (Revlimid®), Dexamethasone). Patients in arm B1 or B2 will additionally receive the monoclonal antibody Elotuzumab in the 4 cycles VRD. After induction therapy patients undergo intensifying therapy according to GMMG standard (usually mobilization therapy followed by stem cell collection and autologous stem cell transplantation). After intensification a consolidation therapy will be performed with two cycles VRD (A1 und B1) or VRD+ Elotuzumab (A2 und B2), followed by Lenalidomide maintenance therapy with (arm A2 and B2) or without (arm A1 and B1) additional Elotuzumab. Maintenance therapy will be performed for 2 years. Primary objective is the determination of the best of four treatment strategies regarding progression-free survival (PFS), defined as time from randomisation to progression or death from any cause whichever occurs first. The duration of the trial for each patients is expected to be 36-39 months (induction and intensification treatment: 7-10 months, 3 months rest between intensification and start of consolidation, consolidation 2 months, maintenance phase 24 months).</detailed_description>
