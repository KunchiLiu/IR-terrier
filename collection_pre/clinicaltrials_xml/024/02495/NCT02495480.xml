	<brief_summary>A novel disposable sheathed gastroscope system has been shown to be safe and more efficient in clinical practice during gastroscopy. This novel disposable sheathed endoscope system could effectively prevent cross-infection by simply taking off the contaminated sheath after examination of a patient and placing a new sheath on the endoscope. In this way, investigators can save the endoscopic reprocessing time and also decrease the need for endoscopic cleaning and disinfecting equipment. Participants may think that placing a new sheath on the endoscope can decrease the success rate of cecal intubation in patients undergoing screening colonoscopy. With a new sheath on the endoscope during scope insertion can probably increases distension of the colonic lumen and loop formation. The probable adhesion may increase the discomfort of investigators and participants. But a previous clinical study by investigators' team showed that the participants' feeling were no significant difference (Z = -1.783, P = 0.075) between sheathed and conventional groups. No significant differences were observed in optical clarity, or pathology detection rate. There were no complications, and no microbial contamination was detected. Based on this study, investigators hypothesize that compared with conventional group, placing a new sheath on the endoscope does not significantly reduce the success rate of cecal intubation in average patients. The aim of the study is to compare the outcome of colonoscopy placing a new sheath on the endoscope versus the conventional method in average participants. The primary outcome is cecal intubation success rate. The secondary outcomes include cecal intubation time, maximum pain score during colonoscopy, overall pain score after colonoscopy and adenoma detection rate.</brief_summary>
