	<brief_summary>During transplant surgery, there is a period of time when a donated kidney is removed from a donor's body and stored until the time of the transplant surgery. The storage procedure results in buildup of various proteins within the kidney that can injure the donated kidney after it is transplanted. One of these proteins is tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether taking infliximab, which blocks TNF-alpha, just prior to transplant surgery along with usual transplant medicines will protect the donated kidney from damage caused by TNF-alpha and help keep the transplanted kidney healthy for a longer period of time.</brief_summary>
