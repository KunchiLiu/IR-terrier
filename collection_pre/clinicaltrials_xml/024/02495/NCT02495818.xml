	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of suprascapular nerve block guided by ultrasound combined with home exercises compared with placebo. Pain intensity, function, pressure pain threshold and goniometry were designed to be assessed in all patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Suprascapular Nerve Block Guided by Ultrasound</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial is being carried out in the Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation of the University of São Paulo since June 2013. The investigators are including patients with clinical diagnosis of supraspinatus tendinitis based on the Lateral Jobe Test. The patients are being randomized in two arms: Active (2% 5ml lidocaine for suprascapular nerve block and home exercises) and placebo control (saline solution as the nerve block and home exercises). The randomization is being performed in blocks of 4 and 6. The investigator, the raters, the MD who makes the procedure and the patients are blind to treatment. 4 visits are being performed. Screening and initial evaluation visit, procedure visit, follow up 1 week after intervention and follow up 12 weeks after intervention. The sample size was estimated to be 54 in each arm.</detailed_description>
