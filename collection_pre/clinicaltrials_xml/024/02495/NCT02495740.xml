	<brief_summary>The effects of active commuting with an e-bike, as compared with a "classic" bike, on cardiorespiratory fitness and vascular health are largely unknown. To assess whether active commuting with an e-bike or a classic bike increases peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) in untrained and overweight individuals.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>E-Bike Versus Classic Bike Intervention Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Riding an electrically assisted bicycle (e-bike) is thought to be suitable to increase physical activity in daily life, to promote health, and to increase cardiorespiratory fitness in normal-weight individuals. The positive effect of commuting to work by a normal bike on cardiorespiratory fitness has been shown to be an important predictor of cardiovascular mortality in previous studies. We thought to improve maximal oxygen uptake by commuting to work by e-bike vs. classic bike. Besides cardiorespiratory fitness we assessed arterial stiffness as brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity as an independent predictor of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>body mass index 2535 kg/m2, and willingness to commute to work by ebike or by normal bike at least 3 times per week with a oneway distance of â‰¥ 6 km. cycling as a leisuretime activity, active commuting to work or exercise training more than once per week within 4 weeks before the start of the study, uncontrolled cardiovascular diseases limiting cardiorespiratory fitness, stage II arterial hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt; 160 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure &gt; 95 mmHg), renal diseases, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (HbA1c &gt; 6.5%), or active malignancy or chemotherapy during the past 6 months.</criteria>
