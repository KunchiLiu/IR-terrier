	<brief_title>Ultrasound-guided Continuous Proximal Adductor Canal vs Continuous Femoral Nerve Block for Postoperative Pain Control and Rehabilitation Following Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients meeting the criteria: American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I and II, that are scheduled for elective total knee arthroplasty, will be recruited into the study. Subjects will be randomized into 2 groups: those who will receive a continuous proximal adductor canal block (ACB) and those who will receive a continuous femoral nerve block (FNB).</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Pain, Postoperative</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System (ASA) score of 1 or 2 that are healthy without systemic disease or have mild systemic disease, respectively. The patient will need to be able to have decisionmaking capacity and ability to consent for the study. Patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System (ASA) score greater than 2. Patients unable to have decisionmaking capacity and ability to consent for the study.</criteria>
