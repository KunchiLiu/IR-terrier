	<brief_summary>The investigators here compare lung function parameters (RV, RV/TLC and FEF75) with the results of the Lung Clearance index (LCI) . Further this study evaluates bronchial inflammatory markers in 20 patients with bronchiolitis obliterans at the age of 6 to 28 years compared with an age- and sex-matched control group. The investigators will perform a pulmonary function test (body plethysmography with DLCO) and compare the results with the LCI. Further we will measure the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and draw a blood sample to determine the level of systemic inflammation. Finally induced sputum is collected and a cell count is performed, and cells and supernatants are analyzed for inflammatory markers. This study will set baseline markers for future interventional studies.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to compare lung function values with the Lung clearance index of 20 Patients with Bronchiolitis obliterans aged between 6 up to 28 years. Further we aim to compare the bronchial Inflammation between the patients and a reference group with similar age conditions to determine possible outcome-parameters for following interventional studies. The sputum samples will be processed and quantitatively analyzed to get a profile of the cytological composition. (Sputum and serum samples are analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (qRT-PCR) and by cytometric bead assay (CBA).) Methods and Work Programme: - Measurement of nitric oxide in expired air (FeNO) - Lung function testing with spirometry and body plethysmography - Lung clearance index (LCI) - Bronchodilation - Blood test: blood count, CRP, RAST, serum inflammatory mediators, (genetic markers of the non-specific pulmonary defense system) - Induced sputum for inflammatory mediators and microbiological investigations</detailed_description>
