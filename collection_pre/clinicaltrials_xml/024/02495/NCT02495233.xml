	<brief_summary>The purpose of the Phase 1b part of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ASP2215 in combination with erlotinib and determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ASP2215. The purpose of the Phase 2 part of the study is to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of the RP2D of ASP2215 in combination with erlotinib.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject has histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or locally advanced, unresectable nonsmallcell lung cancer (NSCLC). Subject has a documented exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R EGFR activating mutation. Subject has received prior treatment with any EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor Subject has Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of less than or equal to 2 at screening. Subject has adequate organ function. Female subject must either: Be of nonchildbearing potential: Or, if of childbearing potential, 1. Agree not to try to become pregnant during the study and for 45 days after the final study drug administration 2. And have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening 3. And, if heterosexually active, agree to consistently use 2 forms of highly effective birth control Male subject and their female spouse/partners who are of childbearing potential must be using highly effective contraception consisting of 2 forms of birth control Phase 1b Subjects only: Subject is not expected to show a therapeutic response to existing available treatment. Intervening anticancer treatment subsequent to the EGFR TKI is allowed (but not required). Additional inclusion criteria for phase 2 Subjects only: Subject has a NSCLC tissue sample obtained after subject developed resistance to EGFR TKI therapy that is available for central testing. Subject's baseline tumor specimen (obtained after subject developed resistance to EGFR TKI therapy) is T790M negative. Subject received an EGFR TKI for at least 6 months and progressed on this therapy within the past 28 days. Subject has not had any intervening anticancer treatment subsequent to the EGFR TKI with the exception of radiotherapy which is allowed if it occurred at least 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Subject has at least 1 measureable lesion (not including any lesion that was irradiated) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Subject has an ongoing toxicity greater than or equal to grade 3 (NCI CTCAE version 4.03) attributable to prior NSCLC treatment at the time of screening. Subject has received any agent with antitumor activity (other than an EGFR inhibitor, including a T790M inhibitor) including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug (palliative radiotherapy is allowed). Subject has received ASP2215 previously. Subject has received blood transfusions or hematopoietic growth factor therapy within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Subject has had a major surgical procedure (other than studyrelated biopsy) within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug, or a major surgical procedure is planned to occur during the study. Subject has active hepatitis B or C or other active hepatic disorder. Subject is known to have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Subject has symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastasis. Subjects with asymptomatic, untreated CNS metastases are allowed. Subjects with previously treated and currently asymptomatic CNS metastases are eligible provided they meet the following: Any whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) was completed at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. Any stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) was completed at least 1 week prior to the first dose of study drug. Subject does not require steroids or does not require escalating doses of steroids for at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. Subject has evidence of active infection requiring systemic therapy within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Subject has uncontrolled hypertension. Subject has severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases or active bleeding diatheses. Subject has history of druginduced interstitial lung disease or any evidence of active interstitial lung disease. Subject has ongoing cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial fibrillation) that is grade â‰¥ 2. Subject currently has Class 3 or 4 New York Heart Association congestive heart failure. Subject has history of severe/unstable angina, myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident within 6 months prior to the first dose of study drug. Subject has history of gastrointestinal ulcer within 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Subject has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding within 90 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Subject has concurrent corneal disorder or any ophthalmologic condition which makes the subject unsuitable for study participation . Subject has any condition which makes the subject unsuitable for study participation. Subject has hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia at screening. Subject has QTcF interval &gt; 450 ms on 12lead ECG at screening. Subject is known to have long QT syndrome. Subject is taking medication known to prolong the QT interval.</criteria>
