	<brief_title>Comparison of Double Lumen Tube Placement Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to compare three different standard of care methods of double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) placement in patients who are scheduled to have thoracic surgery in which lung isolation is required. The investigators want to evaluate the technique of placement of the double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) using an included stylet that has been radically bent (ZU-bend) as compared to a commercial GlideRite stylet with the GlideScope and direct laryngoscopy using the Macintosh laryngoscope. A double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) is a breathing tube utilized to manage the airway when lung separation is needed for a surgical procedure. The investigator wants to evaluate how long it takes for successful placement of the double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) and assess the difficulty of the procedure experienced by the physician performing the intubation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male and female patients requiring a doublelumen endobronchial tube placement for surgery at Emory University Hospital or Emory University Hospital Midtown 2. Patients willing and able to provide written informed consent 1. Patients in whom a previously difficult airway manipulation was recorded on an anesthetic record 2. Lung transplantation procedures, as underlying pulmonary disorder that will confound the SpO2 (peripheral capillary oxygen saturation) metric 3. Any patient who is receiving anticoagulants in excess of a daily aspirin, patients with an International Normalized Ratio or INR &gt;1 4. Patients in whom one lung ventilation or placement of a doublelumen endobronchial tube is contraindicated 5. Patients who require a rapidsequence intubation 6. Patients undergoing emergency procedures</criteria>
