	<brief_title>Vaginal Cleansing Before Cesarean Delivery to Reduce Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cesarean delivery is the most common surgical procedure performed on women in the US; nearly 1.3 million are performed each year. Postoperative infectious morbidity is the most common complication of cesarean delivery. Post-cesarean infectious morbidity is often the result of indigenous vaginal flora that ascend into the uterus at the time of surgery. Thus, reducing vaginal microbial load may reduce post-cesarean infection. However, results from studies assessing the role of vaginal cleansing prior to cesarean have been mixed. The investigators will perform a randomized controlled clinical trial to test the hypothesis that vaginal cleansing with povidone-iodine solution immediately prior to cesarean delivery reduces postcesarean infectious morbidity.</detailed_description>
