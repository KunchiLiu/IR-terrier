	<brief_title>Postpartum Uterotonic Administration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators are studying the effects of the timing of intramuscular oxytocin administration in the third stage of labour. The investigators are measuring the postpartum blood loss: quantitatively in the postpartum 1st hour and indirectly by the decrease in the hemoglobin-haematocrit levels in the postpartum 24th hour. The investigators are monitoring the length of the third stage of labour, and the need for extra uterotonics and/or surgical interventions.</detailed_description>
