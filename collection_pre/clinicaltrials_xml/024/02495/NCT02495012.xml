	<detailed_description>Anfibatide is a snake venom, and we have investigated it in humans for many years with phase 1&amp;2a studies. A Phase IIb clinical trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of antiplatelet thrombolysin injection for patients with ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) before receiving PCI therapy, in order to provide evidence for Phase III design.</detailed_description>
