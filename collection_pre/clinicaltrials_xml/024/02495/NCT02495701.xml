	<brief_summary>Arthroscopic hip surgery is performed with traction on the leg to allow the surgeon to perform the surgical procedure. A retrospective study has described neuropraxia, ankle joint pain and a skin burn after surgery (1). Moreover, it has been described that surgeons performing the procedure have a learning curve related to the number of complications described postoperatively. At the investigators' institution, hip arthroscopies have been performed since 2010 and the 3 surgeons have 4-12 years of experience. During the past years, changes have been made to secure the best possible comfort for the patient during the arthroscopic procedure. Hence, there is a rationale for investigating complications after hip arthroscopy in a setting that is less affected by the surgeon's learning curve and with the patient comfort in focus.</brief_summary>
