	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators would like to evaluate how prelabor analgesic plan and actual labor analgesia effects the labor satisfaction, breastfeeding success, and whether or not it reduces postpartum depression. Although postpartum depression has been researched and reviewed, there is little information on how satisfaction during labor affects postpartum outcomes. The relationship between epidural analgesia is also complex, and there has yet to be found a valid correlation between the two parameters. In addition although an attempt has been made to evaluate relationship between breastfeeding and epidural analgesia, results are unclear and further research is needed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Correlation Between Prelabor Analgesic Plan and Actual Labor Analgesia With Satisfaction, Postpartum Depression, and Breast Feeding Success</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, single center study, which will be conducted at the Rabin Medical Center (Beilinson Campus), Petach Tikva, Israel, a tertiary university hospital. All women undergoing vaginal delivery on the first day postpartum will be enrolled after filling out an informed consent. They will be given out a labor satisfaction questionnaire detailing initial desire for epidural analgesia, final desire for epidural analgesia, adequacy of pain relief during labor and satisfaction with labor. (see appendix 1). The investigators will evaluate breastfeeding success according to the latch scoring system in the first day postpartum which is routinely administered by nurses/ lactation consultants in the maternity ward. According to their initial desire verses final analgesic choice they will be divided into four groups: 1. Women who initially didn't want and didn't receive one. 2. Initially didn't want and did receive one. 3. Initially wanted an epidural and didn't received one 4. Initially wanted an epidural and did receive one. On the third day postoperatively the parturients will be called and assessed for mood and signs of postpartum depression using Edinborough Postnatal Depression scale validated into Hebrew (10) , and the investigators will assess whether or not they are breastfeeding. At 6 weeks the investigators will follow-up to assess breastfeeding duration ,and postpartum depression using the Edinborough Postnatal Depression scale. The investigators' comparison will include average pain scores, breast feeding success, and postpartum depression assessment.</detailed_description>
