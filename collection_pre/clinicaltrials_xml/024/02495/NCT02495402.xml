	<brief_title>Substance Abuse Treatment to HIV Care (SAT2HIV)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Substance Abuse Treatment to HIV care (SAT2HIV) project, a Type 2 Effectiveness-Implementation Hybrid Trial, seeks to address this gap in services by providing new knowledge regarding the effectiveness of brief intervention (BI) for substance use within community-based HIV/AIDS service settings, as well as new knowledge regarding how to address the well-documented underutilization of evidence-based practices in real-world settings. The specific aims of this project are: Aim 1: To experimentally test the effectiveness of a motivational interviewing-based BI for substance use within community-based HIV/AIDS service organizations, relative to usual care (UC). Aim 2: To experimentally test the effectiveness of adding an organizational-level implementation intervention called Implementation &amp; Sustainment Facilitation (ISF) to enhance the effectiveness of the implementation strategy currently used by SAMHSA-funded Addiction Technology Treatment Centers (ATTCs; i.e., online introductory training, 2-day training workshop, ongoing feedback and coaching).</detailed_description>
