	<brief_summary>The aim of volume replacement is to compensate a reduction in the intravascular volume e.g. during surgery and to counteract hypovolemia in order to maintain hemodynamics and vital functions. So far, there is only few data on the safety and efficacy of the products under investigation in children. The primary aim of this non-interventional observational study (NIS) is to collect further data of gelatine solutions in a large pediatric population during routine clinical practice.</brief_summary>
