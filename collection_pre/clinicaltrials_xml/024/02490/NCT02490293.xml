	<detailed_description>Primary outcome of this study is the confirmation of safety in the cases of acute cholecystitis without postoperative antibiotics usage after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. For this purpose, the investigators compare the surgical infectious outcomes including the wound infection or abdominal infections according to the usage of postoperative antibiotics after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Secondary outcome of this study is the confirmation of efficacy according to skip the use of postoperative antibiotics after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The investigators estimate the efficacy using the comparing the outcomes such as duration of hospitalization according to the use of postoperative antibiotics or not.</detailed_description>
