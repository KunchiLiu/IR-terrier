	<criteria>They were systematic reviews based on randomized controlled trials (rcts). They were phase II rcts comparing chemotherapy with other systemic therapy agents or with no further treatment for recurrent, metastatic, or persistent cervical cancer. they reported at least one of these outcomes: complete or partial response rate, overall or progressionfree survival rate, adverse effects, or healthrelated quality of life (rcts reporting on heterogeneous populations—for example, women at a range of disease stages—were included if results were given separately for patients with recurrent, metastatic, or persistent cervical cancer). studies evaluating the role of radiotherapy administered with chemotherapy, or second or subsequentline therapy options.</criteria>
