	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II study aims to investigate whether the addition of bevacizumab to standard corticosteroid therapy results in greater improvement in symptoms and less treatment-induced symptoms compared with standard corticosteroid therapy for patients with symptomatic brain radionecrosis following radiosurgery. It is hypothesized that the addition of bevacizumab to standard care corticosteroids will reduce treatment-induced toxicities and improve neurologic impairments in patients with brain radionecrosis following radiosurgery for brain metastases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Corticosteroids + Bevacizumab vs. Corticosteroids + Placebo (BEST) for Radionecrosis After Radiosurgery for Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized double-blinded phase II study of corticosteroids with bevacizumab vs. corticosteroids with placebo for brain radionecrosis following radiosurgery for brain metastases. This is a two-arm clinical trial with parallel group design for longitudinal quality of life endpoint. Patients will be stratified according to age (≤ 65 years vs. &gt; 65 years), pathological confirmation of necrosis (yes vs. no), MDASI-BT mean global score (symptom + interference scores) ( &lt; 4.0 vs. &gt; 4.0) and prior whole brain radiotherapy (yes vs. no). The primary and secondary objectives are detailed below. Primary Objective: To investigate whether the addition of bevacizumab to standard corticosteroid therapy results in greater improvement in symptoms (clinical and patient-reported symptom improvement associated with radionecrosis and less radionecrosis treatment-induced symptoms) compared with standard corticosteroid therapy. Secondary Objectives: 1. To evaluate the toxicity profile associated with bevacizumab and corticosteroid therapy. 2. To compare self-reported health related quality of life (HRQOL) using LASA, Dexamethasone Symptoms Questionnaire-Chronic (DSQ-C), and MDASI-BT symptom and interference score between treatment arms. 3. To compare intracranial progression-free survival and time to maximum radiographic response between treatment arms. 4. To compare the dose and duration of corticosteroids required between treatment arms and correlate steroid requirement with DSQ-C and MDASI-BT scores. Patient event monitoring will occur every 2 months after treatment up to 6 months. Then event monitoring will occur up to one year.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PreRegistration Eligibility Criteria: 1. Patients who present with symptomatic brain radionecrosis after they have received radiosurgery for brain metastases from primary solid tumor including but not limited to lung, breast, colorectal cancer but excluding melanoma, choriocarcinoma, renal cell carcinoma or gliomas 2. Patients at institutions that elect to utilize central imaging review to confirm eligibility must be preregistered prior to submission of these images; images should be submitted as soon as possible after the preregistration magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is obtained; turnaround time for this review will be =&lt; 72 business hours after receipt of images by the Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core (IROC) 3. Patients at institutions that elect to confirm eligibility locally may be preregistered at the same time as they are randomized Registration/Randomization Eligibility Criteria: 1. A diagnosis of radionecrosis will be based on a clinical onset of symptoms and radiological findings of radionecrosis at 324 months following radiosurgery, with or without pathological confirmation. 1.1 'Symptomatic' brain radionecrosis to at least one lesion following radiosurgery treatment for brain metastases where 'symptomatic' is defined as: 1.1.1 New or increasing headache associated with mass effect, sensory or motor abnormality, cognitive changes, speech difficulty, balance or coordination difficulty, cranial nerve deficits 1.1.2 Symptoms are persistent or worsening despite administration of at least dexamethasone 4 mg daily for 1 week 1.2 Clinical eligibility supported by central imaging realtime review. The presence of at least the following conventional MR image characteristic: 1.2.1 Conventional MR Lesion quotient of &lt; 0.3, where lesion quotient is defined as the proportional value of the maximum axial crosssectional area of the T2weighted defined lesion over the maximum axial crosssectional area of the contrastenhancing lesion on the T1weighted postgadolinium sequence on a comparable axial slice. If the conventional MR findings are not seen, the following dynamic susceptibilitycontrast (DSC) MR characteristics may be used to meet eligibility for this study. 1.2.2 DSC MR The cutoffs below will be based on GRE EPI DSC perfusion images, acquired without using a gadolinium preload: 1.2.2.1 Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) &lt;1.5 in the enhancing lesion relative to normalappearing white matter (NAWM) 1.2.2.2. Percentage of signal recovery (PSR) &gt; 76%, where PSR is determined by comparing the lower signal intensity during passage of the contrast bolus with the postcontrast signal intensity on the signal intensitytime curve 1.2.3 Centers that standardly use PET or MRS to determine a diagnosis of radionecrosis are permitted to use these modalities to assist in their patient selection; however the criteria described for conventional MR and/or DSC should also be met for study eligibility. Both PET and MRS are not mandatory for study eligibility. 2. Prior to start of treatment 2.1 Must have been taking a stable dose of corticosteroids for symptom management for at least 1 week before baseline MRI. 2.2 No systemic therapy within 2 weeks prior to registration or plan for systemic therapy within the first 8 weeks after study registration. The protocol provides a list of 'approved systemic' therapies that are allowed for concurrent use with bevacizumab. 2.3 No bevacizumab ≤ 3 months of study registration. 2.4 Central imaging realtime review (72 hour turn around) to confirm eligibility. 3. Not pregnant and not nursing, because this study involves an investigational agent whose genotoxic, mutagenic and teratogenic effects on the developing fetus and newborn are unknown. Therefore, for women of childbearing potential only, a negative urine or serum pregnancy test done ≤ 14 days prior to registration and confirmation they are not nursing is required. 4. Age ≥ 18 years 5. Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 60% 6. Required Initial Laboratory Values ≤14 days of registration: 6.1 Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm^3 6.2 Platelet Count ≥ 100,000/mm3 6.3 Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL* 6.3.1 allowing transfusion or other intervention to achieve this minimum hemoglobin 6.4 BUN &lt; 30 mg/dL 6.5 Creatinine &lt; 1.7 mg/dL 6.6 Bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL 6.7 ALT ≤ 3.0 x upper limits of normal (ULN) 6.8 AST ≤ 3.0 x ULN 6.9 INR &lt;1.5 x ULN** 6.9.1 unless patients are receiving anticoagulation therapy. Patients receiving anticoagulation therapy with an agent such warfarin or heparin are allowed to participate if INR ≤ 3.0.** 6.10 UPC Ratio &lt;0.5 or if ≥ 0.5 6.10.1 24hour urine protein must be &lt;1000 mg 7.

Assistance by research personnel is acceptable if participant has disabilities that make reading or writing difficult. 8. No evidence of recent hemorrhage at preregistration MRI of the brain, however the following are permitted: presence of hemosiderin, resolving hemorrhagic changes related to surgery, and presence of punctate hemorrhage in the tumor. 9.
