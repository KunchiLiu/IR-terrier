	<brief_summary>The investigators wish to establish a robust estimate of the incidence of inflammation inside the eye (uveitis) in children age 0-16 years in the UK, which hospitals children present to, where they are referred to, which treatment they receive during the first year after diagnosis, and how well they can see at the end of the first year.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators therefore propose to run a high quality surveillance study, together with the British Ophthalmological Surveillance Unit (BOSU) at the Royal College of Ophthalmologists and with the Scottish Ophthalmological Surveillance Unit (SOSU). BOSU and SOSU operate a monthly reporting card scheme. All UK consultant ophthalmologists and associate specialists receive a monthly 'report card' with a list of conditions being surveyed. Reporting clinicians will tick a box if they have seen a case of childhood uveitis in the preceding month, and return the card to BOSU/SOSU, who will inform us, the study investigators. Following reporting of a new case, the investigators will directly contact reporting clinicians and send them a clinical proforma to collect clinical details about the case. At 12 months, a follow up questionnaire will be sent. The investigators will use only information available from patient case notes, with no direct patient contact. The investigators principal aim is to determine incidence of childhood uveitis in the UK. Secondary aims are to identify presentation patterns, referral pathways, associated medical conditions, management, and outcomes.</detailed_description>
