	<brief_summary>This study will determine whether a complex, data-driven protocol for assessing patient needs and providing "nudges" (reminders to be compliant with medication prescriptions) improves compliance with cardiovascular medications. This will be accomplished by performing a 12-month clinical trial of patients with an indication for statin therapy. Participants will be randomized to either an intervention or standard-of-care arm and will be followed via passive electronic means to determine if they are compliant with medication prescriptions.</brief_summary>
