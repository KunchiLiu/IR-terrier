	<brief_summary>There is accumulating evidence that inappropriate analgesia is asssociated with increasing risk of perioperative complications. The aim of the study is to compare intraoperative analgesia guided according to different methods of intraoperative analgesia monitoring, ANI and SPI respectively.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ANI and SPI Guided Intraoperative Analgesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Surgical Pleth Index (SPI) and ANI (Analgesia Nociception Index) has been developed for monitoring of adequacy of analgesia during surgery. The investigators want to compare anesthesiologist guided intraoperative analgesia with intraoperative analgesia guieded by ANI or SPI. The following hypotheses have been made: 1. Anesthesiologist guided analgesia will result in lower surgical stress 2. Anesthesiologist guided analgesia will result in more hemodynamic stability and faster recovery of the patient after anesthesia</detailed_description>
