	<brief_summary>The inhaled Iloprost, approved for pulmonary hypertension, caused increase in oxygenation, and increase exercise tolerance in ARDS or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Inhaled iloprost has been researched in animal study, but not yet in human during one-lung ventilation. The investigators will enroll patients who diagnosed moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, preoperative pulse oximetry (SpO2) of below 95% at room air or PaO2 /FiO2 ratio&lt; 150 mmHg after initiating one-lung ventilation. The primary outcome is pulmonary oxygenation expressed by PaO2 /FiO2 ratio. And secondary outcome is assessment of cardiac function including Tei-index during nebulizing iloprost. The investigators hypothesized inhaled iloprost will improve oxygenation and decrease the FiO2 in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease during one-lung ventilation.</brief_summary>
