	<brief_summary>Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone that regulates plasma glucose, and GLP-1 analogues were recently introduced for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. The investigators planned to evaluate the effects of liraglutide on haemodynamic parameters in patients with heart failure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Glucagon Like Peptide-1 on Haemodynamic Parameters</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure (HF) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality world wide. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone that regulates plasma glucose, and has direct effects on the cardiovascular system. In our previous study, the GLP-1 analogue liraglutide could improve left ventricular function in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. However, the effects of GLP-1 on HF patients remain unclear. Pulse indicator continuous cardiac output (PiCCO) technology is a combination of transpulmonary thermodilution and pulse contour analysis, which measures hemodynamic variables (left ventricular ejection fraction, volumes, and mass) in a fast and feasible way. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of liraglutide on hemodynamic variables in HF patients using the PiCCO system.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with HF were eligible for the study. Diagnosis of HF was based on an impaired ejection fraction (&lt;50%). Patients were also excluded for the following reasons: unconscious at presentation; valvular heart disease, cardiogenic shock, hypoglycaemia, or diabetic ketoacidosis; or renal insufficiency.</criteria>
