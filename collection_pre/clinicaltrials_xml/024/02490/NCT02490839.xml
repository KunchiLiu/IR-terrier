	<brief_summary>Up to now, there is few randomized, large scale study prospectively and simultaneously comparing the efficacy, adverse effects and patient adherence of high-dose dual therapy (HDDT) and bismuth-containing quadruple therapy (BQT) as rescue regimens for H. pylori eradication. The aims of this study are: 1. to compare the efficacy of HDDT, and BQT as rescue regimen in H. pylori eradication; 2. to compare the patient adherence and adverse effects of these treatment regimens; 3. to investigate factors that may influence H. pylori eradication by these treatment regimens.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of High-dose Dual Therapy vs Bismuth-containing Quadruple Therapy for Rescue Treatment of Hp Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants, aged â‰¥ 20, having H. pylori-positive chronic gastritis with/without peptic ulcers (duodenal or gastric ulcers) will be recruited. All undergo endoscopy with biopsy for rapid urease teat, histology, and bacterial culture before treatment. Four to eight weeks after termination of treatment, H. pylori infection status will be examined by the 13C-urea breath test. The CYP2C19 genotype of each participant will be analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymerase (PCR-RFLP) method. A computed generated random numbers sequence will be blocked into two subgroups, say A, and B. If the patients failed anti-H. pylori therapy previously, they will be invited to enter this study for evaluating the efficacy of these rescue regimens. Participant who meet the inclusion criteria and do not have any one of the exclusion criteria will be randomized to receive one of the following regimens: group A- HDDT (rabeprazole 20 mg qid + amoxicillin 750 mg qid for 14 days); group B- BQT ( rabeprazole 20 mg qid + tripotassium dicitrate bismuthate 300 mg qid + metronidazole 250 mg qid + tetracycline 500 mg qid for 10 days); All participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire and to record symptoms and drug consumption daily during the treatment period. Post-treatment, the participants will be followed up at the Outpatients Clinic to investigate patient adherence and adverse effect of treatment.</detailed_description>
