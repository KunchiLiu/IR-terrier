	<brief_title>Comparative Study of the Hypoxia Measured in FAZA and F-miso PET/CT Scan in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to compare the biodistribution of the two tracers specific for hypoxia in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Two PET scans will be performed with FAZA and F-Miso tracers. The time between these twi PET scans will be 24 hours. another 24 hours after the late PET scan, the surgery will be done and a piece of tumor will be collected. Piece of tumor will be analysed by immunohistochemistry for hypoxia markers. The results of immunohistochemistry will be correlated with the biodistribution of the two tracers.</detailed_description>
