	<brief_summary>Catheter ablation is now routinely used in the management of heart rhythm disorders. One of the problems with the approach is that it has not been possible to determine whether the ablation catheter is in direct contact with the heart tissue or not. This is important because too much contact has safety implications and too little means that the therapy will be ineffective. Recently two different technologies have been developed to determine contact. Currently it is not know if one is superior to the other, and the objective of this trial is to determine whether there is a difference when treating a rhythm called atrial flutter.</brief_summary>
