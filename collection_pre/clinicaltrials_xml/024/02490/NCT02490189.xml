	<brief_title>Mindfulness-based Intervention Versus CBT for Social Anxiety Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main aim of this comparative trial is to determine if the MBI-SAD will be noninferior to CBGT in improving core symptoms of social anxiety disorder, depressive symptoms, self, esteem, disability and quality of life. A secondary aim is to examine whether treatment gains are maintained over a 6-month period. Exploratory aims of the study are to: 1) determine if the MBI-SAD enhances self-compassion and mindfulness relative to CBGT; 2) determine if changes in self-compassion and mindfulness mediate the clinical response to the MBI-SAD; and 3) explore moderators of treatment response.</detailed_description>
