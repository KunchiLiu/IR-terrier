	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to measure tumoral angiogenesis modifications by RGD-K5 PET/CT before and after 2 cycles of chemotherapy in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and a large tumoral mass</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Angiogenesis by PET/CT in Patients With Diffuse Large B Cells Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After inclusion PET scans with FDG tracer and with a specific tracer of angiogenesis will be performed on patient with diffuse large B cell lymphoma. After two cycles of chemotherapy PET scans with the same tracers will be performed. Overall survival and disease free survival will be monitored during 18 months.</detailed_description>
