	<detailed_description>Registry of an interventional Study-proved Strategy (BIC-8) using Copeptin and Troponin for the Early Rule-Out of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) in Patients with Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) and a low-to intermediate risk profile. Primary objective: To monitor the safety of the early rule-out strategy using combined testing of copeptin and troponin at admission of patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of ACS and a low- to intermediate risk profile, who are discharged or moved to another hospital after testing copeptin and troponin negative (defined as copeptin below 10 pmol/l and cardiac troponin below 99th percentile URL). Secondary objectives: - To monitor routine application of the early rule-out strategy, patient characteristics, risk profile of all patients tested for copeptin and troponin at admission, irrespective of their biomarker test result - To monitor diagnoses, clinical course and outcome of all patients tested for copeptin and troponin at admission</detailed_description>
