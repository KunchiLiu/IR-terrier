	<brief_summary>The ELISABET STUDY is across sectional Survey on a representative sample of two urban area conduct on a representative sample. The main objective of the project is to compare the prevalence of the obstructive ventilatory disorders (OVD) in the Urban Community of Dunkirk touched by the industrial pollution in relation to the one recovered in the Urban Community of Lille (CUDL) less industrialized.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epidemiological Study on the Relationship Between Respiratory Health and Air Pollution From Industrial Sources</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Airflow obstruction include Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstruction and asthma. Identification of Airflow obstruction is through Functional Tests Lung. In the 1950s, high pollution levels were associated with increased mortality. Despite a reduction of air pollution, it has been established that pollution peaks have short-term effects on acute respiratory episodes. The Urban Community of Dunkirk (CUD) focuses many large pollutant emitters. The long term effects of industrial pollution on TVO are unknown. The main objective of the project is to compare the prevalence of Airflow obstruction in the Urban Community of Dunkirk affected by industrial pollution compared to that found in the Urban Community of Lille (CUDL) less industrialized. Secondary objectives are: 1) To assess the relationship between air pollution from industrial and biological markers, particularly the plasma concentrations of heavy metals 2) To assess the prevalence of TVO general population in French populations 3) Establish a baseline epidemiological and biological bank.</detailed_description>
