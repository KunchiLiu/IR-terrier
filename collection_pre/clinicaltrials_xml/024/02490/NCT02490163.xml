	<brief_summary>In a study performed in 2012, the investigators demonstrated that in ECP setting , the new automated device (Spectra Optia-MNC) released by Terumo BCT for MNCs collection based on intermittent flow is safe and ensures high-quality MNC collection and yield.(5, 6) More recently (in 2013), Terumo BCT released another automated system that allows to collect stem cells and MNCs basing on a continuous collection flow.(7, 8) The aim of this cross-over study is to compare yield (i.e. collection efficiency, CE) and quality (i.e. purity and contamination) of MNCs collected from patients undergoing ECP with two different automated systems: MNC and CMNC (Terumo BCT) processing 1.5 blood volumes during every collection procedure.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Two-sequences-in-four-periods cross-over, with the same patients randomized to both devices within each ECP cycle in two consecutive cycles, open-label. Cycle 1 Cycle 1 Cycle 2 Cycle 2 Day 1 Day 2 Day 1 Day 2 Sequence A CMNC MNC MNC CMNC Sequence B MNC CMNC CMNC MNC There might be some carry over effect between procedure 1 and 2 within each cycle, because during the procedure the patient is administered fluids, and therefore cell counts/ml in the second day might be lower than in the first day; this it is intrinsic to the clinical procedure and can not be modified, but will be taken into account in statistical analyses. Carry over effect between first and second cycle is not expected, since they are performed at least 7 days apart; this allow the patient's cell blood count to be restored to baseline values; however, this will also be considered in statistical analyses.</detailed_description>
