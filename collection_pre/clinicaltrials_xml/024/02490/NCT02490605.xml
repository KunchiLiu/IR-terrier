	<brief_summary>The possible relationship between posture and instability of the masticatory muscles related to occlusion thus becomes the reason, the objective of this study. In this way, it will be possible to evaluate both postural alignment and postural balance in patients with signs and symptoms of temporomandibular joint disorder before and after the use of an occlusal plate. Our research will take place at the School of Odontology of the University of São Paulo in the clinics of the Occlusion and TMJ Services (SOA) and of the Envelhecer Sorrindo program, and the data will be collected in the Biophysics Laboratory of the School of Physical Education and Sports of the University of São Paulo. The population studies will be made up of 120 patients, 60 being part of the sample and the other 60 in the control group. All the patients in this study are over 20 years of age and are of both genders; the research criteria will be diagnosed by way of filling out the questionnaire of the RDC-TMD and complemented by way of diagnostic imaging via MRI of the temporomandibular joint. The study will be a clinical, randomized, controlled, prospective study and intervention. After the subjects' alignment is evaluated by way of photographs and their postural balance by way of a force platform, the group will the randomized; the sample group will receive an occlusal plate with criteria for occlusal stability (simultaneous, bilateral contacts with an absence of interference in the canine and anterior guides). The occlusal plate will be made from "Vacuum Form" acetate with a thickness of 1.5 mm; the simultaneous, bilateral, occlusal contacts and the canine and anterior guides will be obtained by way of autopolymerizable, acrylic resin with the mandible in a centric relationship. The occlusal plate will be controlled weekly. The control group will only receive orientation to do physiotherapeutic exercises seeking to correctly position the mandible in the resting position (maxillar teeth should be approximately 2 mm away from the mandibular teeth) while the tip of the tongue is positioned and accommodated on the roof of the mouth over the incisive papilla on the hard palate (without touching the teeth). The exercise will consist of repeatedly opening the mouth with the tongue cleaving to the roof of the mouth, 3 times per day, each period consisting of 3 sets with 15 repetitions. After 3 months, the two groups will be re-evaluated in terms of postural alignment and balance.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The data will undergo the pertinent statistical treatment. The supposition is that those who undergo re-education of their neuromuscular system will see improvement in their coordination and understanding in relationship to TMJ, re-establishing the function by way of the occlusal stability.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients who are more than 20 years old, Both genders, Patients who present signs and symptoms of TMD identified by way of filling out the questionnaire of the RDCTMD (Diagnostic Research Criteria) complemented by way of diagnostic imaging via an MRI of the temporomandibular joint. Patients who have their natural teeth, allowing for the use of partial, removable, ClassIII Kennedy prostheses with small and medium spaces (up to 3 elements), having as a criteria posterior control (patients with partial, removable prostheses without presenting any type of compression marks or lesions under the structure, points of trauma indicated by redness of the mucosa, and verification of simultaneous, bilateral contacts) (Stegun; Costa, 2000). Patients who undergo the MRI of the temporomandibular joint at the time of the evaluation. Patients entirely without unimaxillar and bimaxillar teeth, Patients with a dislocated disc without reduction, Patients with a history of cervical macrotraumas, Patients who continually use analgesics and antiinflammatories, and/or medications that might effect their balance, Patients with compromised vision without corrections, Patients with neurological alterations, Patients with a history of falls, Patients with diabetes accompanied by sensitive neuropathies, Patients who complain of labyrinthitis.</criteria>
