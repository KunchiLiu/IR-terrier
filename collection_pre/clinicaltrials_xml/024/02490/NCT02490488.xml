	<brief_title>Masitinib in Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Masitinib Mesylate is a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor that mainly targets c-Kit and PDGF receptors. C-KIT and platelet-derived growth factor and its receptor (PDGF-PDGFR), which promote tumour cell growth and angiogenesis are found to be over-expressed in 70% of ovarian cancers. Masitinib exhibits anti-tumoral immunotherapy activity in vivo with a potential to extend overall survival.</detailed_description>
