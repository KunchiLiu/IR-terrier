	<criteria>Matchedcontrol cases must be recruited from sites participating in the CMX001304 study and meet all of the following criteria, as applicable, to be eligible for data abstraction in this noninterventional retrospective study: Age at time of transplant: ≥ 2 months Eligible matchedcontrol subjects must meet the disease conditions of one or both of the two cohorts listed below on or after Jan 1, 2004 and prior to Mar 12, 2014. If subjects had more than one studyqualifying episode of these disease conditions on or after Jan 1, 2004 and prior to Mar 12, 2014, only the most recent qualifying episode should be included: Cohort A: allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients who were at risk of progression to disseminated AdV disease, defined as documented evidence of 1) asymptomatic AdV viremia ≥ 1,000 copies/mL, increasing, OR 2) localized AdV infection Cohort B: allogeneic HCT recipients with disseminated AdV disease Prior use of BCV</criteria>
