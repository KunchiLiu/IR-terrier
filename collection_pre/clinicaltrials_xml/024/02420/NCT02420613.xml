	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn the highest tolerable dose of temsirolimus that can be combined with a stable dose of vorinostat and/or radiation therapy and given to patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). The safety of this treatment combination will also be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid (SAHA) With Temsirolimus in Children With Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups: If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will be in 1 of 2 study groups based on when participant was diagnosed with DIPG: - If participant is newly diagnosed with DIPG, participant will be in Group 1. Participant will receive radiation therapy and vorinostat, then the combination of vorinostat and temsirolimus. - If participant has been diagnosed with DIPG before and the disease has gotten worse since, participant will be in Group 2. Participant will receive the combination of vorinostat and temsirolimus without receiving radiation therapy. Study Drug Administration: Participant will be assigned to a dose level of temsirolimus based on when participant joined this study. Up to 2 dose levels of temsirolimus will be tested. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. The second group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. All participants will receive the same dose level of vorinostat, though the dose may be lowered if there are intolerable side effects. Vorinostat should be taken with food. Participant should be careful not to open or break the capsules of vorinostat. If a capsule breaks, participant should try to clean it up carefully without breathing in any of the powder. Participant should wash the spill area at least 3 times with ethyl alcohol, and then rinse it 1 time with water. If the powder comes in contact with participant's skin, participant should wash the affected area thoroughly with soap and water. If participant has trouble swallowing, participant may receive vorinostat in liquid form. The dose amount will be based on participant's body surface area. The MD Anderson pharmacy will give participant the drug in liquid form. Participant should store the liquid form of the drug at room temperature, away from excessive heat or humidity. The liquid form of the drug should be taken with food. Participant should avoid spilling the powder from the capsules or the liquid form of the drug on participant's skin. If contact occurs, participant should wash the area thoroughly with water. Group 1: Participant will receive 30 treatments of radiation therapy over 6-7 weeks. Participant will sign a separate consent form for this treatment that will explain the procedure, as well as its risks and benefits. Participant will take capsules of vorinostat with food, every morning that participant has a radiation treatment (Monday - Friday) at least 1-2 hours before radiation. After participant has finished radiation therapy, participant will rest for 4 weeks in which participant does not receive radiation therapy or study drug. After this, participant will start receiving the chemotherapy combination of vorinostat and temsirolimus in 28-day study cycles: - Participant will take capsules of vorinostat with food 1 time every day on Days 1-8 of each cycle. - Participant will receive temsirolimus by vein over about 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of each cycle. Group 2: Participant will receive the chemotherapy combination of vorinostat and temsirolimus in 28-day study cycles: - Participant will take capsules of vorinostat with food 1 time every day on Days 1-8 of each cycle. - Participant will receive temsirolimus by vein over about 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of each cycle. Study Visits for Group 1 during Radiation Therapy: Every week: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests. Study Visits for All Participants during Chemotherapy: Every week: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2-6 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. Every week during Cycle 1, then at the beginning of every cycle after that, urine will be collected for routine tests. At the beginning of every odd-numbered cycle (1, 3, 5, and so on), participant will have an MRI of the brain to check the status of the disease. If the doctor thinks it is needed, this will also include an MRI of the spine. If participant is in Group 2, this will not need to be performed at Cycle 1 since participant's screening scans were recently performed. Length of Study: If participant is in Group 1, participant will receive radiation therapy and chemotherapy for up to 7 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of rest, followed by up to 10 cycles of chemotherapy alone. If participant isin Group 2, participant will receive up to 12 cycles of chemotherapy. Participant will no longer be able to receive the study treatment if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to follow study directions. Participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits. End-of-Dosing Visi:t After participant has finished receiving chemotherapy, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests. Follow-Up: Participant will have follow-up visits 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after participants' finishes receiving chemotherapy. The following tests and procedures will be performed: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Participant will have an MRI of the brain and spine to check the status of the disease. - Blood (about 1 teaspoon) and urine will be collected for routine tests (Month 3 follow-up visit only). This is an investigational study. Vorinostat is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Temsirolimus is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of kidney cancer. The use of these drugs in combination is investigational. The radiation therapy is delivered using FDA-approved and commercially available methods. The study doctor can explain how the study drug(s) are designed to work. Up to 18 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
