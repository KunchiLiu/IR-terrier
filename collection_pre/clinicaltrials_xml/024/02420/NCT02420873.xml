	<brief_title>An Open-label Phase II Study of Lorvotuzumab Mertansine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Treatment: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive lorvotuzumab by vein on Days 1 and 8 (+/- 2 days) of each cycle. It may take a few minutes or several hours to receive the study drug. Your doctor will discuss this with you. All treatments with IMGN901 must be administered at MD Anderson. Each cycle is 21 days (+/-6 days). However, they may be longer or shorter depending on if/how the disease responds to the treatment, how your bone marrow reacts to treatment, and what the doctor thinks is in your best interest. Your dose of lorvotuzumab may be raised, lowered, and/or delayed if the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. Study Visits: On Day 1 of each cycle, you will have a physical exam. One (1) time each week during the first 4 cycles, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. After Cycle 4, you will have these blood draws 1 time every 2-4 weeks. If your doctor thinks it is needed, more blood may need to be drawn. The study doctor or study staff will discuss this with you if more blood is needed. During the first cycle, all the laboratory evaluations will be done at MD Anderson. After Cycle 1, you may be able to have these blood draws performed at a local lab or clinic that is closer to your home, and the results reported to the research nurse of the study at MD Anderson. The study doctor or study staff will discuss this option with you. The results of these blood draws will be sent to the study doctor for review. On Day 21 of Cycle 1 (+/- 7 days), then every 1-3 cycles after that, you will have a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy to check the status of the disease. If the doctor thinks it is needed, these may be done more or less often, depending on your response to the study drug. You will have blood draws and/or bone marrow aspirations at any time that the doctor thinks it is needed while you are on study. If you stay on study for more than 6 months and you are not having side effects, you may have some of the above tests more or less frequently. For example, you may only have a bone marrow aspiration 1 time every 6-12 months and blood draws 1 time each cycle. The study doctor will discuss this with you. Length of Study: You may take up to 12 cycles of lorvotuzumab. If the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you may be able to continue receiving the study drug beyond Cycle 12. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your participation on the study will be over after follow-up. End-of-Study Visit: If you leave the study before the end of Cycle 12, within 30 days (+/- 7 days) after the last dose of study drug: - Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy to check the status of the disease. Long Term Follow-Up: If the disease appears to get better and you are responding well to the study drug, you will return to MD Anderson every 3-6 months for up to 5 years after your last dose of study drug for the study staff to check how you are doing. If you cannot return to MD Anderson for these visits, you may be called by a member of the study staff. The call should last about 10 minutes. This is an investigational study. Lorvotuzumab is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the drug is designed to work. Up to 60 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with CD56 expressing hematological malignancy, as follows: Cohort 1: CD56 expressing hematological malignancies including but not limited to AML, highrisk MDS, naturalkiller leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, accelerated and blastphase CML who have failed prior therapy or for which no standard therapy exists.Cohort 2: Patients with MF (either primary MF, postpolycythemia MF, or postessential thrombocythemia MF) and CD56 expression who have been on ruxolitinib or JAKinhibitor therapy for at least 12 weeks and deemed refractory or suboptimal responders in the opinion of the treating physician.Cohort 3: Patients with pathological diagnosis of BPDCN with CD56 expression (frontline and relapsed/refractory). 2. Any level of CD56 expression will be considered sufficient for enrollment on this study. 3. Prior therapy with hydroxyurea, chemotherapy, biological or targeted therapy (e.g. FLT3 inhibitors, other kinase inhibitors), or hematopoietic growth factors is allowed. 4. Age &gt;/=18 years 5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status &lt;/= 2 6. Adequate organ function: total bilirubin &lt;/= 2 times upper limit of normal (x ULN) (&lt;/=3 x ULN if considered to be due to leukemic involvement or Gilbert's syndrome); aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;/= 2.5 x ULN (&lt;/= 5.0 x ULN if considered to be due to leukemic involvement); serum creatinine &lt;/= 2 x ULN, amylase and lipase &lt;/=2 x ULN . 7. In the absence of rapidly progressing disease and after discussion with the Principal Investigator (PI), the interval from prior treatment to time of IMGN901 administration will be at least 2 weeks or at least 5 halflives for cytotoxic/noncytotoxic agents. The halflife be based on published pharmacokinetic literature (abstracts, manuscripts, investigator brochure's, or drugadministration manuals) and will be documented in the protocol eligibility document. 8. continuation from criteria #7: For prior monoclonal antibody therapy the interval from prior monoclonal antibody treatment to time of IMGN901 administration will be at least 2 weeks. The use of chemotherapeutic or antileukemic agents other than hydroxyurea (as defined in the protocol) is not permitted during the study with the exception of intrathecal (IT) therapy for patients with controlled CNS leukemia at the discretion of the PI. Hydroxyurea is allowed prior to the initiation of IMGN901 and during the first 3 cycles, either prior to or concomitantly with IMGN901 administration initially to control Leukocytosis. 9. Women of childbearing potential must practice contraception. Females of childbearing potential: Recommendation is for 2 effective contraceptive methods during the study. Adequate forms of contraception are double barrier methods (condoms with spermicidal jelly or foam and diaphragm with spermicidal jelly or foam), oral, depo provera, or injectable contraceptives, intrauterine devices, and tubal ligation. Male patients with female partners who are of childbearing potential: Recommendation is for male and partner to use at least 2 effective contraceptive methods, as described above, during the study. 10. Females must be surgically or biologically sterile or postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 months) or if of childbearing potential, must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours before the start of the treatment 11. Patients must provide written informed consent. 12. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception during the study and until 3 months after the last treatment. Males must be surgically or biologically sterile or agree to use an adequate method of contraception during the study until 3 months after the last treatment. Adequate methods of contraception include: Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.
