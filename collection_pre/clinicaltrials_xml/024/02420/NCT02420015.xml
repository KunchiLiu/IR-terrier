	<brief_title>Mobile Health Technology to Enhance Abstinence in Smokers With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this 2-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to evaluate the efficacy of Multi-Component Mobile-enhanced Treatment for Smoking Cessation (iCOMMIT) in helping individuals with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders stop smoking. Eligible participants will be randomized to receive iCOMMIT, which includes smoking cessation counseling, pharmacotherapy, and mobile technology components, or a control intervention that includes smoking cessation counseling and pharmacotherapy, but no mobile technology components. The control condition represents an intensive standard of care and helps control for monitoring, counselor, time, and attention effects. The primary outcome for the study will be self-reported and bio-verified prolonged smoking abstinence at the 6-month follow-up. Self-reported prolonged abstinence will be verified by saliva cotinine assay. Secondary outcomes will include 7- and 30-day point prevalence abstinence at each assessment, where abstinence is defined as no tobacco use in the prior 7 or 30 days.</detailed_description>
