	<brief_title>Safety Study of Eteplirsen to Treat Early Stage Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Safety, including adverse event monitoring and routine laboratory assessments, will be followed on an ongoing basis for all patients. Clinical efficacy, including functional tests and MRI, will be assessed at regularly scheduled study visits. Patients will undergo one baseline and one follow-up muscle biopsy. Population and serial PK will be collected.</detailed_description>
