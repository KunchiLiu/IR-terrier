	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether assessing color doppler of corpus luteum and uterine artery is useful in predicting patients who will complete pregnancy. The investigators will add to this the usefulness of serum progesterone and CA125 in prediction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Corpus Luteum and Uterine Artery Doppler With Serum P and CA125 in Threatened Abortion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The introduction of Doppler ultrasound in obstetrics has allowed evaluating hemodynamic characteristics from the first trimester of pregnancy. For example, Kurjak et al.,in one of the first studies using transvaginal pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasound in early pregnancies, identified the uterine arteries in 100% of the patients. The flow blood of the corpus luteum was identified in 75% patients. The measures obtained by Doppler ultrasonography that may have prognostic value to the evolution of pregnancy include uteroplacental blood flow, also known as trophoblastic flow. Jaffe et al. reported that abnormal Doppler findings were associated with a significantly higher prevalence of complicated pregnancies, among women with abnormal Doppler findings, 43% ended in miscarriage, whereas among women with normal findings only 1.4% of women miscarried.Progesterone plays a crucial role in the maintenance of pregnancy. In the presence of sufficient progesterone levels during pregnancy, lymphocytes synthesize a mediator called progesterone induced blocking factor (PIBF), which is anti-abortive in mice . Besides inducing secretary changes in the endometrium and supporting early pregnancy, it modulates the maternal immune response to prevent fetal rejection and relaxes the uterine smooth muscles .CA-125, well-known as a tumor marker for epithelial ovarian cancer , is a high molecular weight glycoprotein that is produced not only by ovarian cancer, but also by nonovarian tumors, normal epithelia of the peritoneum, the endometrium, the fallopian tube, and the ovary. Because CA-125 is also produced by the endometrium, some authors suggest that CA-125 can be used as a marker for endometrial receptivity in patients undergoing IVF . Its role as a predictor for pregnancy outcome is controversial .</detailed_description>
