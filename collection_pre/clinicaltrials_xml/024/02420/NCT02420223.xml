	<brief_title>Pilot Study Using Propranolol to Decrease Gene Expression of Stress-Mediated Beta-Adrenergic Pathways in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized controlled pilot study designed to evaluate whether a drug designed to block the physiologic effects of stress is effective at blocking stress-related gene expression in people receiving autologous stem cell transplants (their own cells) for multiple myeloma. Such stress-related gene expression is one way that the body is programmed to make specific proteins under conditions of stress. These proteins are believed to contribute to worse health outcomes. By using the drug propranolol, we aim to see whether we might block these negative health effects of stress as occur in the cancer setting and during the transplant process. We hypothesize that individuals taking propranolol will have more favorable gene expression. We will enroll 40 individuals, randomizing half to receive propranolol and half to serve as the control group not on the study drug. Study participants will start propranolol three weeks prior to their transplant and continue it until 30 days after the transplant. We will explore the effect of socioeconomic status, depression, and anxiety on individuals' gene expression response to propranolol with the idea that the more impoverished, anxious, or depressed individuals will display an even greater change in their gene expression. Part of the purpose of this study is also be to assess whether it is feasible to give this drug to individuals with cancer. Results of this study may inform larger trials assessing the effects of propranolol on cancer progression.</detailed_description>
