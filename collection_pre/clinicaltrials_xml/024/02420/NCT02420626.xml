	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Short and Long Term Performance and Clinical Outcomes of the Crux Vena Cava Filter System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Crux VCF Registry is a non-randomized clinical study, sponsored by Volcano Corporation, to evaluate the short and long term performance and clinical outcomes of the Crux VCF System. The registry includes consecutive patients treated with the Crux VCF in a post-market (commercial) setting with data collection at the implant procedure through 2 years post implant or to filter retrieval, whichever comes first. Patients may also be enrolled (roll-in) from a previous Crux VCF implant within the previous 6 months. Follow up assessment will be performed at 6, 12 and 24 months post-implant and at the time of retrieval, if performed.</detailed_description>
