	<brief_summary>70 subjects received BCG intradermally at Study Day -42, then at Study Day 0 were randomized to receive AERAS-404 50 mcg H4/500 nmol IC31 intramuscularly as a 3-dose (N=30) or 2-dose (N=30) regimen, or placebo (N=10). Subjects were vaccinated on Study Days 0, 56, and 231, and followed through Study Day 259.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study for Safety and Immunogenicity of BCG and AERAS-404 in HIV-Negative, TB-Negative, BCG-Naive Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 70 subjects who had received BCG at Study Day -42 were randomized on Study Day 0 to receive 3 doses of placebo (N=10); 1 dose of placebo followed by 2 doses of AERAS-404 (N=30; AERAS-404 2 dose regimen); or 3 doses of AERAS-404 (N=30; AERAS-404 3 dose regimen). A total of 69 (98.6%) subjects completed the study; the remaining subject, in the AERAS-404 2 dose regimen, withdrew consent. All 70 subjects received the first and second vaccinations with placebo or AERAS-404 on Study Days 0 and 56, and 67 (95.7%) subjects received the third vaccination on Study Day 231. Three subjects did not receive the Study Day 231 vaccination (2 in the AERAS-404 2 dose regimen, 1 due to withdrawal of consent and 1 due to pregnancy [the subject delivered a healthy boy without complications and was followed to study completion]; and 1 in the AERAS-404 3 dose regimen, due to inability to discontinue daily isotretinoin started after the second vaccination [the subject was followed to study completion]).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Had completed the written informed consent process. 2. Was male or female. 3. Was age ≥ 18 years and ≤ 50 years. 4. Agreed to stay in contact with the study site for the duration of the study, provide updated contact information as necessary, and had no current plans to move from the study area for the duration of the study. 5. Agreed to avoid elective surgery for the duration of the study. 6. Had completed simultaneous enrollment in Aeras Vaccine Development Registry protocol. 7. For female subjects: agreed to avoid pregnancy from 28 days prior to Study Day 0 through the duration of the study. 8. Had general good health, confirmed by medical history and physical examination. 9. Had body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 33 (weight/height2) by nomogram. 1. Oral temperature ≥37.5°C. 2. Abnormal CBC laboratory values (per local laboratory parameters) from blood collected at screening (&gt;5% above ULN or &gt;5% below LLN). 3. Abnormally elevated laboratory values (per local laboratory parameters) from blood collected at screening for ALT, AST, GGT, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, prothrombin time (PT), or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) (&gt;10% above ULN). 4. Abnormal urinalysis that, in the opinion of the investigator, was clinically significant. 5. Positive screening urine test for illicit drugs (opiates, cocaine, amphetamines). 6. History or evidence of active or latent tuberculosis infection, including a positive QuantiFERONTB test, a history of a positive TST, or abnormal chest Xray findings that in the opinion of the investigator were evidence of tuberculosis. 7. Residence longer than 6 months in a highburden country (per WHO 2010 TB Report). 8. Shared a residence within 1 year prior to Study Day 42 with an individual on antituberculosis treatment or with culture or smearpositive pulmonary tuberculosis. 9. Previous treatment for active or latent tuberculosis infection. 10. History or evidence of autoimmune disease. 11. History or evidence of any past, present, or future possible immunodeficiency state, including laboratory evidence of HIV 1 infection. 12. History or evidence of chronic hepatitis, including hepatitis B core antibody or hepatitis C antibody. 13. Received a TST within 90 days prior to Study Day 42. 14. Received a systemic antibiotic with 14 days prior to Study Day 42. 15. Received BCG vaccination or BCG immunotherapy prior to Study Day 42. 16. Received investigational Mtb vaccine. 17. Participation in any other investigational study during the study period. 18. Current household contact with an individual with known significant immunosuppression. 19. Occupational exposure that would have put an immunocompromised individual at risk, unless measures could be taken to reduce this risk to an acceptable level (e.g., plaster on the injection site). 20. Received immunoglobulin or blood products within 90 days prior to Study Day 42. 21. Received any investigational drug therapy or investigational vaccine within 180 days prior to Study Day 42. 22. Received any licensed vaccine within 45 days prior to Study Day 42 (note: the use of licensed vaccines medically indicated during the study was permitted at any time). 23. Received immunosuppressive medications other than inhaled or topical immunosuppressants within 45 days prior to Study Day 42. 24. Inability to discontinue daily medications other than the following during the study: oral contraceptives, vitamins, nonprescription nutritional supplements, aspirin, antihistamines, antihypertensives, antidepressants. 25. All female subjects: currently pregnant or lactating/nursing; positive screening urine pregnancy test; or positive urine pregnancy test on the day of any study vaccination. 26. History or evidence of allergic disease or reaction that, in the opinion of the investigator, may have compromised the safety of the subject. 27. History or evidence of dermatologic disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, may have interfered with the assessment of injection site reactions. 28. History or evidence of any other acute or chronic disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, may have interfered with the evaluation of the safety or immunogenicity of the vaccine or compromise the safety of the subject. 29. Medical, psychiatric, occupational, or substance abuse problems that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make it unlikely that the subject would comply with the protocol.</criteria>
