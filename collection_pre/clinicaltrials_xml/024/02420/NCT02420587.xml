	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will take capsules of AMG208 by mouth 1 time every day while they are on study. Participant should fast (not have anything except water) for 2 hours before and 1 hour after they take the AMG208 capsules. Participant will be asked to keep a diary to help them keep track of when they take each dose of the study drug. Participant should record any missed or vomited doses in the diary. If participant vomits their dose, they should not re-take their dose. Participant should wait until their next scheduled dose. Participant should bring the diary with them to each visit. Every 6 weeks is considered a cycle. Participant should return all unused study drug and/or empty pill bottles at the end of each cycle. Study Visits: On Day 1 of Cycle 1 (+/ - 3 days): - Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing. - Participant will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to check the status of the disease and for biomarker testing. To collect a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy, an area of the hip is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow and bone is withdrawn through a large needle. Biomarkers are found in the blood/tissue and may be related to participant's reaction to the study drug. On Day 22 of Cycle 1: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Participant will have an EKG. Participant will have 2 more EKGs if the study doctor thinks it is needed. - Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. This blood will also be used to check participant's PSA level, to measure CTCs, and for biomarker testing. - Participant will fill out the questionnaire about pain. On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and every 6 weeks after that: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. This blood will also be used to check participant's PSA and testosterone levels. - Participant will fill out the questionnaire about pain. On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and 3, and every 12 weeks after that: - Participant will have a bone scan and a CT or MRI scan of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and any other area the study doctor thinks is needed to check the status of the disease. - Participant will have an EKG. Participant will have 2 more EKGs if the study doctor thinks it is needed. - Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn to check participant's thyroid function, and for CTC and biomarker testing. - Participant will have either an ECHO or a MUGA scan. (Cycles 2 and 5 only and every 12 weeks after that) On Day 1 of Cycle 2 participant will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to check the status of the disease. On Day 22 of Cycle 2: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. This blood will also be used to check participant's PSA level. - Participant will fill out the questionnaire about pain. On Day 1 of Cycle 5, participant will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of the disease. Length of Study: Participant may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in their best interest. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if they are unable to follow study directions. Patient's participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visit. End-of-Study Visit: If they have not been done within the last week, within 5 days after participant's last dose of study drug, the following tests and procedures will be performed: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. This blood will also be used to check participant's PSA levels, thyroid function, for biomarker testing, and to measure CTCs. - Participant will have a bone scan and a CT or MRI scan of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and any other area the study doctor thinks is needed to check the status of the disease. - Participant will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to check the status of the disease. - Participant will fill out the questionnaire about pain. Follow-Up Visit: About 30 days after participant stops taking the study drug, the following procedures will be performed: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. This blood will also be used to check participant's PSA levels. This is an investigational study. AMG208 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work. Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate. 2. Presence of metastatic disease to the bone. 3. Patients must have a castrate level of testosterone (&lt;/= 50 ng/dL) at the screening visit, medical or surgically induced. For patients who are medically castrated, gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist or analog must continue to maintain testicular suppression. 4. Evidence of progressive disease prior to enrolment based on AT LEAST one of the following criteria: a) Rising PSA: PSA progression defined by a minimum of two rising PSA levels with an interval of &gt;/= 1 week between each determination. The PSA value at the Screening visit should be &gt;/= 2 ng/mL; b) Nonmeasurable (evaluable) disease: 2 (two) or more new metastatic bone lesions by radionuclide bone scan or plain bone films (xrays); c) Measurable disease (RECIST 1.1) by transaxial imaging: patients must show evidence of new or progressive disease on CT or MRI scans. 5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 02. 6. For patients who received combined androgen blockade (a GnRH antagonist, analog or orchiectomy in combination with continuous antiandrogen not including enzalutamide), disease progression must have been determined after antiandrogen discontinuation as defined below: a) For patients receiving flutamide: at least one of the PSA values must be obtained 4 weeks or more after flutamide discontinuation.; b) For patients receiving bicalutamide or nilutamide: at least one of the PSA values must be obtained 6 weeks or more after antiandrogen discontinuation.; However, in patients who did not respond to combined androgen blockade or who showed a decline in PSA for 3 months or less after an antiandrogen was administered as a secondline or later intervention, no withdrawal response will be expected and therefore disease progression will be determined provided at least one rising PSA value is obtained 2 weeks or more after antiandrogen discontinuation. 7. Patients who received any other hormonal therapy, including megestrol acetate, finasteride, ketoconazole, abiraterone, enzalutamide, diethylstilbestrol or any systemic corticosteroids, must have discontinued such agent for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment. Progressive disease must be documented after discontinuation of such therapy. Low dose maintenance steroids (prednisone &lt;/=10 mg/d or hydrocortisone &lt;/= 30 mg/d equivalents) are permitted. 8.

Agree to use a doublebarrier method of contraception, which involves the use of a condom in combination with one of the following: contraceptive sponge, diaphragm, or cervical ring with spermicidal gel or foam, if having sex with a woman of childbearing potential during the length of the study and for at least one month after AMG 208 is discontinued. 14. Signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the patient (or legally acceptable representative) has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the trial prior to enrollment. 1.
