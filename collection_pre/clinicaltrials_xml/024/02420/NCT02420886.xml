	<brief_summary>Assessment of the embryological benefit of in vitro adding of Cytokines (LIF 5ng/ml, HB-EGF 5ng/ml and GM-CSF 2n/ml) to the culture media and closely monitor its effect on embryogenesis and implantation outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adding Cytokine to In Vitro Human Culture Media to Improve Embryogenesis and Implantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The IVF culture media design and upgrade underwent many ideas during the last 3 decades, we suppose that adding the Cytokines (LIF 5ng/ml, HB-EGF 5ng/ml and GM-CSF 2ng/ml) as a growth factor that have multi-ways to might improve embryo development in vitro so we decide to design a trial to compare the embryogenesis by sibling Oocytes of the same patient between two arm of the same culture media and the same culture condition. One arm with Cytokines and the other is traditional one and closely monitor the outcome within the 2 arms and record the results.</detailed_description>
