	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research project is to compare two different techniques for performing an injection of the sacroiliac joint. Although both techniques are safe and accurate, the goal of the study is to determine if one technique is better than the other with respect to improvement in a patient's pain, function, and his or her satisfaction. Additionally, the investigators want to determine if one technique is quicker and more efficient than the other.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing the Effects of Ultrasound Versus Fluoroscopy for Sacroiliac Joint Injections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sacroiliac joint dysfunction is a source of low back pain that causes significant pain and disability. Injection of the sacroiliac joint with a local anesthetic/corticosteroid mixture has shown efficacy in treating this condition, when conservative therapy fails. The use of fluoroscopic guidance and anatomic landmarks are traditional methods for performing this injection; however, ultrasound imaging has recently been utilized for performing this procedure. Although studies exist that describe and validate the ultrasound technique, no studies exist that compare the techniques with respect to short-term and long-term outcomes. In this study, the primary objective is to determine if a difference exists between a fluoroscopic-guided technique and ultrasound-guided technique with respect to pain and function. A secondary objective is to compare the two techniques with respect to procedural characteristics.</detailed_description>
