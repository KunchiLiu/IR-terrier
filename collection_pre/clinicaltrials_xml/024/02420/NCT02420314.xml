	<brief_summary>This clinical trial evaluates adding high-dose ascorbate (vitamin C) to standard of care treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adults. All subjects will receive high-dose ascorbate in addition to the standard treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacological Ascorbate for Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) involves a combined therapy of paclitaxel and carboplatin. These drugs are administered once every 21 days. This study adds high dose ascorbic acid (75g per infusion) twice per week for up to 4 cycles of therapy. Participants will: - receive high doses of intravenous (IV) ascorbate two times a week during each 3 week chemotherapy. - have blood samples drawn to measure blood ascorbate levels once every 21 days The active therapy portion of this study lasts for 4 months. After that is completed, participants will go back to standard therapy for their cancer. Participants will continue to have life-long follow-up for this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>newly diagnosed stage IIIB or IV non small cell lung cancer. The potential participant must not have received firstline cytotoxic therapy. First line EGFR inhibitors or ALK inhibitors are allowed if there was progression on therapy. CNS metastasis is allowed if the metastasis is treated and there are no signs of progression following treatment. The potential participant must be off steroids for at least 3 days and be stable. ECOG performance status of at least 2 absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of at least 1500 cells per mm³ platelet count of at least 100,000 cells per mm³ hemoglobin of at least 8 g/dL creatinine within 1.5 times the upper limit of normal total bilirubin within 1.5 times the upper limit of normal ALT within 3 times the institutional upper limit of normal AST within 3 times the institutional upper limit of normal the participant must tolerate a 15g ascorbate test infusion (screening dose) patients who received prior treatment with curative intent must have experienced a treatmentfree interval of at least 6 months since the last treatment the participant must not be pregnant, be willing to have a pregnancy test done if deemed necessary, and be willing to use adequate birth control during the study known sensitizing EGFR mutations or ALK gene rearrangements if the participant has not yet tried EGFR or ALK inhibitor therapies 50% or greater PDL1 expression receiving warfarin therapy and cannot tolerate drug substitution active hemoptysis within 1 week of screening (more than 1/2 teaspoon of blood per day) actively receiving insulin at the time of ascorbate infusion G6PD deficiency leptomeningeal disease potential participants cannot be on the following drugs: flecainide, methadone, amphetamines, quinidine, or chlorpropamide. known active invasive malignancy other than the lung cancer under therapy (nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or bladder are exempted) potential participants may not enroll in, or be actively receiving treatment from, a therapeutic clinical trial. Observational studies (including imaging studies) are acceptable. uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness / social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements known HIV positive individuals cannot be enrolled in this trial because highdose ascorbate is a known CYP450 3A4 inducer, which results in lower serum levels of antiretroviral agents</criteria>
