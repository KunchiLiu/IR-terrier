	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to test whether the attention-enhancing effects of low-dose nicotine can be enhanced by the drug galantamine, FDA-approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. This proof-of-principle study is performed in healthy non-smokers and involves two single exposures to a nicotine patch (7 mg/24 hrs) and two single exposures to galantamine (4 mg). The dose of galantamine is substantially lower than the clinical dose range of 16-24 mg/day. The hypothesis is that performance-enhancing effects of nicotine are greater in the presence of this low dose of galantamine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-Dose Galantamine to Potentiate the Attention-Enhancing Effects of Low-Dose Nicotine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy non-smokers will be screened for study eligibility and receive training on three different attention tasks. Over four test session, participants will then perform these tasks after receiving (1) a placebo patch and a placebo capsule, (2) a nicotine patch (7 mg/24 hrs) and a placebo capsule, (3) a placebo patch and a galantamine capsule, and (4) a nicotine patch and a galantamine capsule. The four test session are performed on separate days and take approximately 7 hours each. During the first 5 hours, the participant may read or watch TV while nicotine and/or galantamine are being absorbed. During the last two hours, the participant will perform the attention tasks on a computer. The investigators hypothesize that performance-enhancing effects of nicotine, which were documented in previous research, will be larger in the presence than in the absence of galantamine. This proof-of-concept would have implications for the development of drugs for the treatment of conditions such as Alzheimer's disease or schizophrenia.</detailed_description>
