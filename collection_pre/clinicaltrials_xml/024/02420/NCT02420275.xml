	<brief_summary>After a brain injury (BI) , patients complain in particular about sequel fatigue. This symptom affects about 50 % of the patients; it is severe, with a repercussion on quality of life, reeducation and occupational reintegration, and persists often at a distance of the accident. The investigators' hypothesis is that patients who presented a severe BI could benefit from a treatment by withe blue enriched bright light in order to improve fatigue and quality of life.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After a BI , patients complain in particular about sequel fatigue. This symptom affects about 50 % of the patients; it is severe, with a repercussion on quality of life, reeducation and occupational reintegration, and persists often at a distance of the accident. The investigators' hypothesis is that patients who presented a severe BI could benefit from a treatment by blue enriched withe bright light in order to improve fatigue and quality of life. The main objective is to decrease fatigue and the secondary objectives are to improve quality of life,decrease daytime sleepiness and increase vigilance. This is a randomized clinical trial with 2 groups blue enriched withe bright light versus nothing) including 20 patients.The treatment will take 8 weeks with 30 minutes exposition at awakening to withe blue enriched bright light (Luminette, Belgium). The investigators willl estimate the fatigue severity scale score , the quality of life the score (SF12), the sleepiness Epworth score, and the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) The investigators will included patient with severe BI more than six months after the BI.</detailed_description>
