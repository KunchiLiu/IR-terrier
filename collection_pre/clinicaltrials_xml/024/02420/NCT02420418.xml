	<brief_title>The Effect of N- Acetylcysteine on Inflammatory and Oxidative Stress Biomarkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tobacco use disorder and bipolar disorders are top of the causes of disability and mortality worldwide. The aim of this study was to evaluate N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) as an adjunctive treatment in patients with Tobacco use disorder with comorbid bipolar disorder ( (N=72 NAC/placebo ) recruited from outpatients smoking cessation unit at Londrina State University, Brazil. The design was a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial of 12 weeks of adjunctive treatment with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), 1800mg/day. Participants will be patients with bipolar disorders with and without TUD, they will allocated to one of two groups at random to receive NAC or placebo For the evaluation of oxidative stress biomarkers will be assess among others malondialdehyde (MDA), lipid hydroperoxide,nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), antioxidant potential total plasma (TRAP), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, the total glutathione (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG), paraoxonase (PON 1) activity thiol group (SH-group).For the evaluation of inflammation biomarkers will be analyze : BDNF, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-10, IL-12 (p70), IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, IL-1RA, IL-2, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6,IL-6R, IL-7, IL-8, Leptin, TNF-α, TNF-RI, TNF-RII, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), erythrocytes sedimentation rate (ESR), homocysteine, haptoglobin, albumin , uric acid and fibrinogen.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To be included in this study participants must be motivated smokers to stop tobacco use Age greater than or equal to 18 and less than 65 years Both sexes All races Capacity to consent to the study and carefully follow the guidelines and procedures and sign the term of free and informed consent . Will be included with comorbid bipolar, depressive and anxiety disorder with tobacco use by more than 20 cigarettes per day, and a control group without these mood disorders and without tobacco use disorder. We excluded any subjects with: abnormal blood values on the following laboratory tests: *hemogram, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), urea and creatinine other actual and lifetime axisI diagnoses (including schizophrenia, psychoorganic syndromes, delirium, dementia, amnestic, and other cognitive disorders) medical illness, including HIV and hepatitis B and C, (auto)immune disorders immune modulatory drugs, e.g. glucocorticoids and use of antioxidants. These situations can affect an inflammatory and / or immune process.</criteria>
