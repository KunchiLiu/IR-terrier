Patient must reside outside a skilled nursing facility or dementia care facility at the time of screening, and admission to such a facility is not planned. Residence in an assisted living facility is allowed. 8. Ability to ambulate independently or with assistance defined as the ability to take at least 5 steps with a walker (guarding is allowed provided there is no contact) or the ability to take at least 5 steps without a walker or cane with the assistance of another person who can only have contact with one upper extremity. 9. Stable on other chronic medications for at least 30 days prior to screening. 10. Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) and sexually active fertile men with partners who are WOCBP must use highly effective birth control. Exclusion Criteria 1. Presence of other significant neurological or psychiatric disorders. 2. History of or screening brain MRI scan indicative of significant abnormality. 3. History of cancer within 5 years of screening with the exception of fully excised nonmelanoma skin cancers or nonmetastatic prostate cancer that has been stable for at least 6 months. 4. History of clinically significant hematological, endocrine, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, or neurological disease. 5. Inability to be venipunctured and/or tolerate venous access. 6. Contraindication to undergoing an LP. 7. Recent drug or alcohol abuse as defined in DSM IV. 8. Treatment with any investigational drugs (including placebo) or devices within 90 days prior to screening. 9. Contraindication to the MRI examination for any reason 10. History of a clinically significant medical condition that would interfere with the patient's ability to comply with study instructions, would place the patient at increased risk, or might confound the interpretation of the study results. 11. History of allergy, hypersensitivity, or serious adverse reaction to monoclonal antibodies or related compounds or allergy to any of the components of the study drug</criteria>
