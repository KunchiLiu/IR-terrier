	<brief_summary>The single greatest health behavior change that could improve cardiovascular morbidity and associated mortality is to assist people living with HIV/AIDS who smoke to quit. The investigators will use a factorial design to evaluate the most promising behavioral and pharmacologic treatments aimed at achieving maximal efficacy for smoking cessation among people living with HIV/AIDS who smoke. Results of this study will provide crucial, real world evidence of the best way for healthcare providers to help smokers living with HIV/AIDS quit smoking.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimizing Smoking Cessation for People With HIV/AIDS Who Smoke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose a factorial design strategy to evaluate the effects, individually and in combination, of the most promising pharmaco- and behavioral cessation therapies available for PLWH according to our review of the extant literature for HIV-infected and general population smokers. The sizable cohort and prospective design will also permit us to evaluate the effects of tobacco use, treatment, and cessation on a panel of soluble biomarkers of inflammation that are likely contributors to cardiac morbidity and mortality in people living with HIV/AIDS. The specific aims of our proposal are: Primary Aim 1: Compare varenicline to placebo on rates of 7-day point prevalence abstinence (PPA) at 24 weeks in smokers with HIV/AIDS. We hypothesize that rates of smoking abstinence at week 24 will be higher in those treated with varenicline compared to placebo. Primary Aim 2: Compare Positively Smoke Free to low intensity, brief counseling on rates of 7-day PPA at 24 weeks in smokers with HIV/AIDS. We hypothesize that rates of smoking abstinence at week 24 will be higher in those treated with Positively Smoke Free compared to brief counseling. Primary Aim 3: Compare Positively Smoke Free + varenicline to the other two study conditions outlined above on rates of 7-day PPA in smokers with HIV/AIDS at 24 weeks. We hypothesize the effect of PSF with varenicline is greater than the effect of PSF or varenicline alone. Secondary Aim: Explore the effect of successful cessation/smoking abstinence on levels of cardiac specific biomarkers, nicotine biomarkers, generalized markers of inflammation, lipids, coagulation and monocyte/macrophage activation. We hypothesize that smoking cessation will be associated with significant reductions in levels of these biomarkers and monocyte/macrophage activation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Study 1. Confirmed chart diagnosis of a HIV and receiving HIV treatment at the participating HIV clinic. 2. Age 1865 years. 3. Currently selfreport smoking 10+ cigarettes per day OR score &gt; 5 on the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine (FTND) . The FTND is a 6item measure of behaviors related to nicotine dependence, has good reliability and validity. Rationale: These indicators establish participants as regular smokers or smokers with at least moderate nicotine dependence. 4. Motivation to quit within the next 6 months (score 68 on the Abrams and Briener Readiness to Quit Ladder); 5. Do not meet criteria for current DSM 5 substance use disorder with higher than mild severity (23 criteria met) (other than for nicotine) as established by the SCID for DSM 5. The SCID will assess psychiatric and substance use diagnoses. Rationale: Patients living with HIV/AIDS in realworld treatment settings use other substances in addition to tobacco and will often have some problems associated with that use. To limit this study to those who smoke tobacco only means tailoring the intervention to a small group that is not truly representative of the larger population of PLWH. In addition, those with more severe substance use disorders require interventions that address issues related to the particular substance and would not be addressed by use of varenicline or found in a psychosocial intervention for smoking cessation. 6. Able to read and speak English 7. Willingness and ability to provide informed consent to participate. Study The exclusion criteria are designed to maximize safety by minimizing drug interactions or worsening preexisting comorbid psychiatric or medical conditions: 1. Current suicidal thoughts or ideation (past week); recent suicidal thoughts or ideation (past 6 months) or recent suicide attempt (past 6 months) as assessed by the ColumbiaSuicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS). 2. Symptoms of significant current depression as measured by a score &gt; 14 on the PHQ9. The PHQ9 assesses depressive symptoms and has good reliability and construct validity. 3. Recent use of varenicline (past 3 months). 4. Previous allergic reaction or hypersensitivity to varenicline (ever in lifetime). 5. Pregnant, nursing, or becoming pregnant during the study. 6. Current use of any medication that would interfere with the protocol in the opinion of Medically Accountable Physician including use of bupropion targeting nicotine dependence. 7. Moderate to severe renal impairment (&lt; 50 mL/min) as this is a contraindication to varenicline. 8. Unstable cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction within past year, uncontrolled arrhythmia, uncontrolled angina, uncontrolled congestive heart failure, electrocardiogram abnormality with QTC &gt; 500 msec, cerebrovascular event within past year). 9. Meets criteria for dementia by scoring below 10 on the Hopkins HIV Dementia Scale. This criterion is included to ensure the sample consists of participants who are cognitively able to engage in the study procedures.</criteria>
