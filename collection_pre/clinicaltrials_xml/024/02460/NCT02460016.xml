	<criteria>Male or female subjects of any race or ethnicity with an age adjusted for any prematurity of ≥1 month and ≤24 months. Diagnosis of RSV infection by virological. Subject must weigh &gt;3 kg at screening. Must have provided written informed consent for the subject to participate. For patients aged &lt;12 months, and occipitofrontal head circumference (OFHC) within the normal range for age and gender. The subject has taken, is currently taking or requires any restricted medications. Subject is known to be HIVpositive (or the mother, if the potential subject is a child aged &lt;6 months). Participation in an investigational drug or device study within 30 days prior to the date of screening. Requires vasopressors or inotropic support at the time of enrollment. Concurrent gastrointestinal conditions that could, in the opinion of the investigator, prejudice absorption of the Investigational Medicinal Product (e.g. protracted vomiting, malabsorption syndrome, a history of necrotising enterocolitis with consequent short gut syndrome). Bronchopulmonary dysplasia or chronic lung disease requiring assisted ventilation at the time of enrollment. Diminished ventilatory reserve at risk for hypercapnia (e.g. pulmonary hypoplasia, sequestration syndromes, cystadenomatoid malformation, a history of surgery for diaphragmatic hernia). Left to right shunt meriting corrective therapy.</criteria>
