	<brief_summary>This study has compared quadrant scaling and root planing (Q-SRP) versus intensive treatment performed within 24 hours (FM-SRP) in terms of acute phase responses following treatment of periodontal disease. The primary aim was to compare the differences in CRP acute increase following FM-SRP versus Q-SRP therapy (24 hours after therapy). Secondary outcomes included changes in a broad array of inflammatory and endothelial injury markers between groups. Patients were randomly assigned to either FM-SRP and Q-SRP. Data indicated that non-surgical periodontal therapy performed within 24 hours induced greater perturbations of systemic inflammation compared to conventional treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim. A moderate acute-phase response occurs 24 hours following full-mouth non-surgical treatment (FM-SRP). Aim of this study will be to compare quadrant scaling (Q-SRP) versus FM-SRP in terms of systemic acute (24 hours) and medium-term (3 months) inflammation. Material &amp; Methods. 38 periodontitis-affected subjects will be randomly allocated to FM-SRP or Q-SRP after a baseline visit. Periodontal and anthropometric parameters, such as systolic and diastolic bood pressure, BMI and temperature, will be collected at baseline and 3 months. Serum samples will be drawn at baseline, 1, 7 and 90 days after treatment. High sensitivity assays for a broad array of inflammatory (PCR, IL-6, TNF-alpha) and endothelial assays will be performed.</detailed_description>
