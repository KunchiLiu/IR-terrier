	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the feasibility of HPV self-testing as a potential cervical cancer screening strategy and obtain preliminary efficacy data of culturally appropriate materials on self-test use. OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Participants receive a study kit that includes culturally appropriate instructions for using and returning the HPV self-test device and a photo story information sheet about HPV and HPV self-testing. Participants are asked to complete the HPV self-test and return the test for HPV testing. ARM II: Participants receive a study kit that includes standard instructions for using and returning the HPV self-test device and a standard information sheet about HPV and cervical cancer. Participants are asked to complete the HPV self-test and return the test for HPV testing. Participants are followed up at 4 weeks for return of their HPV self-test device and then for 2 months after notification letters are sent.</detailed_description>
