	<brief_summary>Left Ventricular Assist Devices are commonly used to assist failing hearts as a bridge to transplantation or for long-term support. The purpose of the MESenchymal stem cell therapy and Left Ventricular Assist Device program is to improve heart function with stem cell therapy and attempt to wean patients from HeartMate Left Ventricular Assist Device.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bone Marrow-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) Administration in Weaning From Left Ventricular Assist Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently Left Ventricular Assist Device-only patients are being implanted and followed. Feasibility of autologous mesenchymal stem cell grafting in patients receiving heart mate will be assessed in a 4 patient pilot trial. Mesenchymal stem cell are delivered during Left Ventricular Assist Device surgery by intramyocardial infusions. Recovery of contractile function of the heart is assessed during attempts to wean patients from Left Ventricular Assist Device</detailed_description>
