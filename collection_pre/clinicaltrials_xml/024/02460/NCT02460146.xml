	<brief_title>PK and PD of Sequential Multiple Ascending, Repeat Doses of Oral CXA-10 in Healthy Obese Male Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Complexa has developed an oral formulation of CXA-10. The main purpose of this trial is to demonstrate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of CXA-10 and its metabolite(s) administered as multiple ascending oral doses over 14 days to healthy obese male volunteers. The pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of CXA-10 on serum biomarkers, some of which are elevated in the obese population, will also be investigated.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Body mass index (BMI) &gt;27 and ≤40 kg/m2 In good general health as determined by a thorough medical history and physical examination, ECG, vital signs, and clinical laboratory evaluation Results of clinical laboratory tests must be without clinically significant abnormalities for this population and may exceed the limits of the reference ranges, including hematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis except as noted below Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) &lt;7% Average blood pressure &lt;160/100 mmHg at screening QTcF interval (Fredericia's correction factor) must be ≤430 msec at screening and predose Any clinically relevant abnormality for this population identified on the screening history, physical or laboratory examinations, or any other medical condition or circumstance making the volunteer unsuitable for participation in the study Any clinical history of cardiovascular events, arrhythmias, fainting, palpitations, personal or family history of congenital prolonged QT syndromes or sudden unexpected death due to a cardiac reason History of any primary malignancy, including a history of melanoma or suspicious undiagnosed skin lesions, with the exception of basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin or cervical carcinoma in situ or other malignancies curatively treated and with no evidence of disease for at least 5 years History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 21 units/week (one unit = 125 mL of wine or 284 mL of beer or a single 25 mL measure of spirits) within 6 months of screening Treatment with any prescription or nonprescription drugs (including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements) within 7 days or 5 halflives, whichever is longer, prior to dosing and until collection of the final PK sample. Use of any drug including aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) must be avoided within 7 days prior to the first dose and during this study as it may interfere with the pharmacology of CXA10. Use of high energy supplements or drinks (especially, those containing caffeine, protein supplements, and weight loss drugs) History of smoking, including ecigarettes, or use of nicotinecontaining products within 1 month of screening Resting heart rate ≥100 BPM after 5 minutes rest (as above) at the screening visit Subjects with any other clinically relevant ECG parameter abnormality (e.g., PR interval, QRS deviation) or any clinically significant ECG abnormality will be excluded from the study Any clinically significant murmurs evident on auscultation of the heart (including evidence of mitral valve prolapse)</criteria>
