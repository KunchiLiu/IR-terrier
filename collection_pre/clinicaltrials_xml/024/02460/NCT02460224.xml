	<brief_summary>This study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and anti-tumor activity of LAG525 as a single agent and in combination with PDR001 to adult patients with solid tumors. The study consists of a dose escalation phase (I) to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for LAG525 as a single agent and in combination with PDR001, and a dose expansion phase (II) which will characterize treatment of LAG525 as a single agent and in combination with PDR001 at the MTD or RP2D.</brief_summary>
