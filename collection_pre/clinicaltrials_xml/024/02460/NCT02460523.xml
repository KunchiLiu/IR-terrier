	<brief_summary>Evaluation of the best line of treatment of borderline CBD stones associated with gallbladder stones whether by conservative treatment or endoscopic stone extraction as regard complete clearance rate of the CBD stones followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The secondary outcomes are overall complications related to each approach, technical difficulties and conversion rate during laparoscopic cholecystectomy and cost benefit relationship of each line of treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Enrolled patients in the study will be randomized to either conservative treatment or ERCP and stone extraction. The randomization process will be done using closed envelop method and will be withdrawn by a nurse in the outpatient clinic. 1. Patients in conservative treatment group will receive medical treatment in the form of antibiotics, analgesics and antispasmodics for 3 days. These patients will be followed up for improvement on the ground of clinical symptoms and serum bilirubin level and abdominal US for CBD stones. 1. Improvement: If the stone spontaneously passes to the duodenum and CBD is clear completely from the stones proved by US, the patient will undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) within 3 days. 2. No improvement: the patient will undergo ERCP and then LC. 2. Patients in ERCP group will undergo ERCP and wide papillotomy and stone extraction directly then laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) within 3 days.</detailed_description>
