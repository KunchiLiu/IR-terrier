	<brief_summary>Attention biases in threat processing have been assigned a prominent role in the etiology and maintenance of anxiety disorders. Attention Bias Modification Treatment (ABMT) utilizes computer-based protocols to implicitly modify biased attentional patterns in anxious patients. This is a double-blind randomized controlled trial of ABMT for clinically anxious 10-18 year-olds. Participants will be assessed using clinical interviews and parent- and self-rated questionnaires before, in the middle and after twelve sessions of ABMT or control groups, and again at ten-week follow-up. Outcome measures will be anxiety symptoms and depression as measured by gold standard questionnaires as well as structured clinical interviews with youth and their parents. Attentional threat bias, Attentional control and interpretation of ambiguous information will also be measured to explore potential mediators of ABMT's effect on anxiety. The investigators expect the findings to inform pathways to treatments for anxious children and to provide initial information on mechanisms of ABMT efficacy.</brief_summary>
