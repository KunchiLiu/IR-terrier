	<brief_summary>Cash transfer, aims to strengthen food security for vulnerable households by giving families enough purchasing power to consume an adequate and balanced diet, maintain a good standard of hygiene, access health services, and invest in their own means of food production in addition to their children's growth and development. While cash transfer to vulnerable households has shown a long-term positive impact on growth and on malnutrition-related mortality in children aged 0-5 years, there is little conclusive evidence their effectiveness in Sub-Saharan Africa that cash transfer has a direct effect on the Community-based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM). Here, the investigators will perform a cluster-randomized trial to investigate during 6 months the effects of unconditional cash transfers on the management of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in children from 6 to 59 months according to the national protocol in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</brief_summary>
