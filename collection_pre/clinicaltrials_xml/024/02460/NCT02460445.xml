	<brief_summary>AIMS To study the effects of the decrease in iron tissue depots after scheduled bloodletting on insulin sensitivity, carbohydrate metabolism, classic and non-classic cardiovascular risk factors in patients with functional hyperandrogenism (polycystic ovary syndrome &amp; idiopathic hyperandrogenism) on standard treatment with combined oral contraceptives (COC) according to usual clinical practice. METHODOLOGY Open label, controlled, parallel, prospective study of 12 months of duration, with 2 randomized arms of follow-up: i) Intervention Group: Patients with functional hyperandrogenism on standard COC treatment randomly allocated to perform scheduled phlebotomies from the third month of treatment to the end of the study (3 times with a 3-month interval between them). ii) Control Group: Patients with functional hyperandrogenism on standard COC treatment randomly allocated to follow-up without bloodletting. The whole group of patients will undergo a comprehensive anthropometric and hormonal assessment, evaluation of classic cardiovascular risk factors (insulin sensitivity and carbohydrate metabolism after a standard oral glucose test- 75 g), lipid profile, ambulatory and office blood pressure monitoring, proinflammatory profile, oxidative stress status, autonomic function assessment, and iron-related metabolism parameters at baseline, after 3-month COC treatment and after reduction of iron tissue depots plus OC in the Intervention Group of patients, and throughout follow-up under treatment with COC in the Control Group of patients. If a significant relationship between circulating hepcidin levels and elevated ferritin concentrations is observed, a study of the potential influence of mutations/polymorphic variants of hepcidin gene on ferritin values will be performed as well.</brief_summary>
