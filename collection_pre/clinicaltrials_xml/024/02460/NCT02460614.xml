	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the immediate effects of retrograde rhinopharyngeal clearance with nasopharyngeal aspiration in children admitted with acute viral bronchiolitis. The investigators selected children, up to 12 months old, admitted for acute viral bronchiolitis. Patients were divided in aspiration group (AG), submitted to nasopharyngeal aspiration, and clearance group (CG), submitted to retrograde rhinopharyngeal clearance with physiological solution (0.9%) instillation (RRC) technique. In both groups children were evaluated three times in the same day in order to verify cardiorespiratory parameters, clinical score of respiratory dysfunction and adverse effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Rhinopharyngeal Retrograde Clearance in Children With Acute Viral Bronchiolitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children up to 12 months old, admitted for acute viral acute viral bronchiolitis were selected. All children participating in the study should be in the first 48 hours of hospitalization. Patients were divided in aspiration group (AG), submitted to nasopharyngeal aspiration, and clearance group (CG), submitted to retrograde rhinopharyngeal clearance (RRC) technique with physiological solution (0.9%) instillation. In both groups children were evaluated three times in the same day (data collection 1 (C1) - performed early in the morning; data collecting 2 (C2) - performed in the early afternoon; and data collecting 3 (C3) - performed in the evening). In each data collection, cardiorespiratory parameters and clinical score of respiratory dysfunction were evaluated before procedures (T0), 10 minutes after (T1) and 30 minutes after (T2). Adverse effects were evaluated during the whole day of the study.</detailed_description>
