	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, multicenter study that will be conducted at up to 40 centers in the United States and Outside United States (OUS). Participants in the study will be randomly assigned to receive either ONCO-DOX or sorafenib treatment. This study will evaluate the study participants' outcomes (medical condition) after being treated with ONCO-DOX and compare it to those treated with sorafenib alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of ONCO-DOX in Locally Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, two-arm, stratified then randomized (1:1), open label, controlled, multicenter Phase III trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ONCOZENE™ Microspheres loaded with doxorubicin (ONCO-DOX) in comparison with orally administered sorafenib in patients with unresectable, locally-advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients will be stratified by ECOG Performance Status 0 versus 1, portal vein invasion (yes vs. no), and alpha feto protein &lt;400 versus ≥400. They will then be randomized at each site within each stratum. The study will be conducted at up to 40 centers in the United States, Europe &amp; Asia. Enrolled patients will be randomized with equal allocation by study site. Patients will be followed for two years after the onset of treatment. The study will assess prospectively the efficacy and safety of DEB-TACE (ONCO-DOX) in patients with unresectable, locally-advanced HCC. The primary objective of this study is to compare the overall survival between DEB-TACE (ONCO-DOX) and sorafenib treatment groups.</detailed_description>
