	<brief_summary>More than half of the patients suffer from intensive pain 1-2 days after arthroscopy in the knee. Walking function and physical activities are affected by this intensive pain although local anaesthetic is given in the joint and soft tissue. The patients are often discharged on the same day as the arthroscopy takes place depending on their ability to walk with or without assistive technology. It is a well-known fact that the patient is given a dose of morphine, analgesics or an ice pack on a painful knee to reduce pain intensity. The aim of the project is to study whether pain intensity and analgesics can be additionally reduced by giving local anaesthetic by means of an adhesive tape placed on the skin instead of giving morphine, analgesics or ice pack on a painful knee. The researchers plan to include a cohort of 180 patients: 60 patients having a meniscus sutured, 60 patients having meniscus tissue removed surgically, 60 patients having mucous fold removed surgically. This study is planned to be a pilot study in order to complete a future large medical science study.</brief_summary>
