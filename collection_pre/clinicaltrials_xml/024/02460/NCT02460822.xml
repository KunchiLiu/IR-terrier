	<brief_summary>This research project addresses critical gaps in cancer symptom management through the creation of a mobile chemotherapy symptom management application. This application will assess for the presence and severity of common chemotherapy side-effects and provide personally tailored symptom-related video and narratives to enhance self-management of cancer and treatment-related symptoms. This study will examine patient acceptance and use of this mHealth application (called MyChemoCare) in a prospective trial of cancer patients (n=60) who are receiving chemotherapy for colorectal cancer at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center.</brief_summary>
