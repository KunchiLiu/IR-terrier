	<detailed_description>Von Willebrand Disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder, characterized by a quantitative and/or qualitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (VWF), that plays a major role in early phases of haemostasis. VWD type 3 (VWD3) is due to virtually complete deficiency of VWF and, for this reason, has been also described as "severe VWD". VWD3 is inherited as a recessive trait and heterozygous relatives have mild or no bleeding symptoms. Even if the prevalence of VWD3 is very low, the highest rate is found in Iran and the lowest in southern Europe. However, the actual prevalence of VWD3 is still unknown in most countries, due to the lack of retrospective or prospective studies. Although rare, VWD3 is of major interest because of its severe clinical presentation, the need for replacement therapy with VWF concentrates and the risk of occurrence of anti-VWF inhibitors after the infusion of VWF concentrates, for which risk factors have not been systematically determined. The major objectives of the study are: to create an international network among European and Iranian Centers (ratio 1:1), the prospective enrollment of 250 VWD3 patients using a common database online, the collection of detailed information about previous bleedings and exposure to VWF concentrates, the use of bleeding severity score of VWD3 calculated with a common questionnaire, the evaluation of the presence of VWF gene defects with VWF phenotype and risk of anti-VWF inhibitors, the evaluation of anti-VWF antibody titre through common methods, the VWD3 gene analysis, the observation of frequency and sites of bleeding in VWD3 followed-up for 2 years, and the efficacy assessment of the VWF concentrates used to treat VWD3 using the most objective criteria for efficacy. To these purposes, a cohort of 250 patients with diagnosis of Type 3 von Willebrand Disease will be enrolled using homogenous and standardized criteria. The work planned to achieve the objectives of the project will be divided in three parts: - the first part deals with standardized criteria for enrolment and collection of retrospective clinical and laboratory data, to be confirmed by centralized laboratories; - the second part involves a further characterization of clinical and laboratory parameters, collected in the retrospective phase, including prevalence of anti-VWF inhibitors, advanced laboratory tests to further identify VWD3, mutations analyses of the VWF gene; - the third part of the study for the first time deals with the prospective clinical observation in a large cohort of VWD3 patients all previously well characterized by an international panel of experts.</detailed_description>
