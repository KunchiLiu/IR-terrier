	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Potentiating Effect of tDCS on Opioid Analgesia of Pain Threshold in Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain is a prevalent symptom in medicine and the role of various opioids is valuable in the treatment of moderate to severe pain. Several technologies of brain stimulation , including transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS) are emerging as therapeutic options for many pain conditions. The effect of tDCS was demonstrated in sensory perception , decreasing the threshold for acute pain in healthy volunteers and in various chronic pain conditions . There is evidence about the use of tDCS with the participation through many mechanisms in cortical modulation , including the regulation of neurotransmitters, including opioids. In the context of neurostimulation, opioidergic system and cortical pain modulation, emerge the hypothesis of a possible potentiating effect of tDCS on clinical application of opioid analgesia.</detailed_description>
