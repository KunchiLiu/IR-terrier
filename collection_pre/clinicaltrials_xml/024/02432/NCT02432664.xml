	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate to what extent this new study drug is tolerated in humans. The study is divided into 3 parts (Part III is optional and may go ahead depending on the results of Parts I and II). The volunteers will only be enrolled to one part of the study. In parts I and II the volunteer will receive active study drug or placebo. In part I the volunteers will receive a single dose of one of the eight planned escalating dose levels. In part II volunteers will receive 4 planned dose levels based on the results obtained in Part 1 of the study, with the option to include an additional dosing group. In optional part III the volunteer will receive ODM-108 and an already registered drug so that interactions with other drugs can be studied. It will be investigated how quickly and to what extent the study drug is absorbed and eliminated from the body (this is called pharmacokinetics). In addition, in parts I and II the effect of the compound on the sensation of pain and on cognition (activities of thinking, understanding, learning, and remembering) will be investigated (this is called pharmacodynamics).</brief_summary>
