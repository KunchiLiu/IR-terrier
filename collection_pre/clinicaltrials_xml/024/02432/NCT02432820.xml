	<brief_summary>SPECIFIC STUDY AIMS 1. To evaluate congruence between pelvic anatomical structures segmented on MRI and/or CT scans co-registered with transperineal US scans acquired with an optically and/or electromagnetically tracked matrix array ultrasound transducer. 2. To estimate the achievable accuracy of anatomy tracking based on 3D US matrix-array transducer imaging and grey-level based image registration algorithms.</brief_summary>
