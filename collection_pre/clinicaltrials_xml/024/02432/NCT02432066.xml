	<brief_summary>Attempts to quit cigarette smoking are often accompanied by negative mood and problems in attention and memory. These effects, in turn, may contribute to smoking relapse. This exploratory/developmental project examines the effects of a novel medication, GTS-21, on individuals interested in smoking cessation. It is hypothesized that GTS-21 will reduce negative affect, improve cognition and/or reduce smoking relapse in healthy adult men and women who are chronic cigarette smokers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of GTS-21 on Smoking Behavior and Neurocognitive Functions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The project is a clinical trial assessing the effects of GTS-21 (an Î±7 nicotinic receptor partial agonist) on smoking, mood, neurocognition, and neurophysiology, in a small sample of chronic smokers who are currently healthy and interested in smoking cessation. Using a double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group design, 54 (27 women) community smokers who have demonstrated a readiness to quit will participate over a 7 week active trial. Subjects will be randomly assigned to active drug or placebo groups. Across the study period, participants will undergo repeated neurobehavioral testing, laboratory assessments of cardiovascular and liver function, and provide weekly updates regarding smoking behavior, mood state and side-effects.</detailed_description>
