	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to learn if and in what amount a compound from hops, called xanthohumol (ZAN-tho-HUE-mol), prevents damage to DNA and oxidative stress. The human body is constantly exposed to oxidative stress from environmental compounds (e.g. air pollution) which may cause damage to DNA. The human body can repair some DNA damage, but too much DNA damage is harmful and may lead to cancer. Research done at OSU and around the world has shown that xanthohumol can stop or slow processes that lead to cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this research study is to learn if and in what amount a compound from hops, called xanthohumol (ZAN-tho-HUE-mol), prevents damage to DNA and oxidative stress. The human body is constantly exposed to oxidative stress from environmental compounds (e.g. air pollution) which may cause damage to DNA. The human body can repair some DNA damage, but too much DNA damage is harmful and may lead to cancer. Research done at OSU and around the world has shown that xanthohumol can stop or slow processes that lead to cancer. Participants will consume a non-alcoholic beverage containing xanthohumol with breakfast, lunch and dinner for 3 weeks. Then they will go through a washout period of 3 weeks. And then they will consume the same beverage without the xanthohumol compound (placebo) for another 3 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned into groups and will vary whether they will consume the xanthohumol product during the first or second 3-week period. Xanthohumol doses will be 0, 6, 12 or 24 mg/day. The study includes donation of blood and urine samples and one-month food frequency questionnaires.</detailed_description>
