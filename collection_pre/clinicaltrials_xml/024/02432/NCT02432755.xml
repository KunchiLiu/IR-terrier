	<brief_summary>The specific aims of this study will be: 1. To compare the immediate and retention treatment effects of the patients receiving home-based mirror therapy combined with task-oriented training (MTOT) with a hospital-based MTOT group and a hospital conventional rehabilitation group on different aspects of outcomes. 2. To examine the feasibility, satisfaction, and safety of this novel home-based MTOT program. 3. To investigate the factors that may affect the efficacy of home-based stroke rehabilitation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Home-based Mirror Therapy Combined With Task-oriented Training for Patients With Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this 3-year study project, we will design a single-blind randomized controlled trial (1) to compare the treatment effects of home-based MTOT with a hospital-based MTOT group and a hospital conventional rehabilitation group, (2) to investigate the feasibility, satisfaction, and safety of this home-based program, and (3) to identify the factors that might influence treatment outcomes. An estimated total of 90 patients with stroke will be recruited in this study. All participants will be randomly assigned to receive home-based MTOT or hospital-based rehabilitation for a 4-week training period (a total of 12 sessions). Before the first treatment session, a client-centered questionnaire will be administered to each patient for identifying individual needs and goals. Feasibility evaluation and caregiver's wellbeing will be also assessed. Outcome measures will be conducted at baseline, immediately after treatment, and 3 months follow-up.</detailed_description>
