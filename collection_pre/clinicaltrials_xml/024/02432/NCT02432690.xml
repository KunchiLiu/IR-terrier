	<mesh_term>Ovarian Neoplasms</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Key inclusion criteria: 1. Histological or cytological confirmation of epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian cancer from any previous time point. 2. Recurrent or relapsed after completion of initial therapy of epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian cancer from any previous time point (includes completion of surgery with or without postoperative chemotherapy, including maintenance chemotherapy) 3. Elevation of CA125 according to the following definitions: Patients with an elevated CA125 before chemotherapy and normalization of CA125 with/after chemotherapy must show evidence of CA125 greater than or equal to 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) on 2 occasions at least 1 week apart Patients with an elevated CA125 before cancer chemotherapy, which never normalizes, must show evidence of CA125 greater than or equal to 2 times the nadir value on 2 occasions at least 1 week apart Patients with CA125 in the normal range before cancer chemotherapy must show evidence of CA125 greater than or equal to 2 times the ULN on 2 occasions at least 1 week apart For patients who have received subsequent treatment for recurrent cancer, "chemotherapy" in the above criteria refers to the most recent round of chemotherapy. 4. Patients with a history of ovarian cancer who are asymptomatic and who do not have documented previous CA125 levels may enroll if the CA125 is greater than three times the ULN on two occasions, at least one week apart 5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) of 0 Key exclusion criteria: 1. Symptoms (other than ≤ grade 1 fatigue, anxiety, depression, or other psychological symptoms) that, in the opinion of the treating oncologist, are a direct result of cancer recurrence. (Examples of symptoms that would preclude enrollment include unintentional weight loss, ≥ grade 2 fatigue, and new abdominal pain unrelated to operative procedures for the ovarian malignancy.) 2. Receiving any other investigational agent that would be considered a treatment for the primary neoplasm. Anticancer chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or investigational agents ≤14 days of first dose of study drug 3. Major surgery ≤28 days before start of treatment 4. History of another primary malignancy with an associated diseasefree interval of less than 5 years, except for curatively treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ cancer of the cervix.</criteria>
