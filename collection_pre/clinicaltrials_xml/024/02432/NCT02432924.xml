	<brief_title>Using Combined Instantaneous and Multidimensional Feedback to Support a Change in Physical Activity Behaviour</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advancements in monitoring technology not only permit the accurate capture of sophisticated physical activity information but also enable the provision of bespoke multidimensional feedback. Personalised feedback, self-monitoring and goal-setting are techniques that have been shown to be very effective in supporting a change in behaviour through improved motivation and awareness. To date the feedback provided in physical activity interventions invariably focuses on just one aspect of the behaviour and has had mixed results. Pedometers for example with a sole focus on the number of steps one takes has been shown to be a reasonably effective form of instant feedback in the short-term but its effects are rarely sustained after the device is removed. Tailored information about the achievement of 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity activity is also only partially effective. One of the reasons might be that in focusing on just one aspect becomes prescriptive and doesn't allow individuals to explore the other important aspects that might be more aligned to their interests, needs and preferences. Having such narrow focused goals and information would likely frustrate rather than support an individual's needs for autonomy and competence, which is thought to be crucial in the adoption and maintenance of a new behaviour. In this research, we want to find out whether the provision of both instantaneous and multidimensional personalised feedback about the different health-harnessing aspects of physical activity is effective in supporting adults in making a meaningful change to their physical activity behaviour. The study will take a mixed methods approach which will involve two phases. Phase 1 will involve a 2 group randomised control trial that will examine the use of combined instantaneous and multidimensional feedback over a 6-week period with a further follow-up outcome assessment a further 6-weeks after the intervention has finished. The second phase will involve a short one-to-one semi structured interview with each intervention participant that will be designed to qualitatively explore the preferred features of the intervention that were most effective for motivating and supporting a change in behaviour and/or to understand why it wasn't effective if applicable. The qualitative interviews will take place after the 6-week follow-up assessments have been completed so not to influence the results of any outcome measures.</detailed_description>
