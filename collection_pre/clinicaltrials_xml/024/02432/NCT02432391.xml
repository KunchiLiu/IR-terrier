	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if a lifestyle modification program (GEM) that focuses on reducing after-meal blood glucose elevations can improve blood glucose control in people with type 2 diabetes. Half of the participants will continue their routine medical care, and half will receive five sessions of GEM in addition to their routine care. The two groups will be assessed using diabetes-relevant medical, behavioral and psychological measures.</brief_summary>
