	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies the use of the radiofrequency-guided localization in patients with abnormal breast tissue undergoing lumpectomy (a type of breast-sparing surgery). The radiofrequency identification localization system consists of an implantable radiofrequency identification tag and a hand-held radiofrequency reader to mark abnormal breast tissue before surgery and later surgically retrieve them. Radiofrequency-guided localization may make it easier to find and remove abnormal breast tissue during lumpectomy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To obtain human clinical data in order to demonstrate that the Radiofrequency Identification (RFID) Localization System performs as intended as a localization device for marking and retrieving a surgical target in the breast. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To solicit feedback from the radiologists and surgeons regarding the process and use of the RFID system. OUTLINE: Patients undergo radiofrequency-guided localization comprising RFID tag placement before lumpectomy and interactive detection of tag using RFID reader during lumpectomy.</detailed_description>
