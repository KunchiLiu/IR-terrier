	<brief_title>Oral Carbohydrate in DM Patients Undergoing Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Carbohydrate-rich drink has been proved to neither delay gastric emptying nor affect gastric acidity and is therefore considered safe to use in elective surgical patients without risk factors for pulmonary aspiration. It reduced postoperative nausea and vomiting and improved sense of well-being after surgery. Moreover, carbohydrate-rich drink was not found to be affected by delayed gastric emptying in patients with uncomplicated type 2 diabetes. Therefore, carbohydrate drink may be safely administered 3 h before anesthesia without risk of hyperglycemia or aspiration.</detailed_description>
