Tacrolimus may reduce the clearance of steroid based contraceptives leading to increased hormone exposure; particular care should be exercised when deciding upon contraceptive measures. Patients should be capable of understanding the purpose and risks of the study, and should provide written informed consent to participate in the study. Inclusion Criteria (specifically for kidney transplant patients): Patients with end stage kidney disease and who are a suitable candidate for primary kidney transplantation.

Inclusion Criteria (specifically for liver transplant patients): Patients with end stage liver disease and who are a suitable candidate for primary liver transplantation. Patients scheduled to receive a liver transplant from a cadaveric or living donor between 5 and 65 years of age with compatible ABO blood type. Exclusion Criteria (common to kidney and liver transplant patients): Previously received or are scheduled to receive an organ transplant other than kidney or liver Undergoing retransplant from either a cadaveric or living donor Contraindication to the use of tacrolimus or corticosteroids.

Systemic infection requiring treatment. Transplantation of kidney or liver from nonheart beating donor. Severe diarrhea, active peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal disorder that may affect the absorption of tacrolimus.

Patients or respective donors known to be positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Unlikely to comply with the visits scheduled in the protocol. Exclusion criteria (Specifically for kidney transplant patients) Cold ischemia time of the donor kidney &gt; 30 hours. High immunological risk, defined as a positive cross match or PRA grade 50% in the previous 6 months. Liver cirrhosis. Significant liver disease, defined as having either elevated serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase / alanine aminotransferase(SGPT / ALT) (at least 2.5 times the upper value of the normal range at the investigational site) or elevated serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase/ aspartate transaminase (SGOT/AST) (at least 2.5 times the upper value of the normal range at the investigational site) or elevated total bilirubin levels (at least 2.5 times the upper value of the normal range at the investigational site) or all of them during the 28 days prior to entry into the study. Patients or respective donors known to be positive for hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Exclusion Criteria (specifically for liver transplant patients): Transplanted for hepatocellular carcinoma with a single nodule greater than 5.0 cm in diameter or more than 3 nodules or metastases or vascular tumoral invasion.
