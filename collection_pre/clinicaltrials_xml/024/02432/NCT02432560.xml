	<brief_title>Safety and Durability of Sirolimus for Treatment of LAM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is an uncommon disease affecting women. It is associated with cystic lung destruction and progressive respiratory failure. The Multicenter International LAM Efficacy of Sirolimus (MILES) Trial, led by the investigators' research team, demonstrated that mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibition with sirolimus was an effective therapy that stabilized decline in FEV1 (forced expiratory volume). However, lung function decline resumed when the drug was stopped at the one year point in MILES, suggesting that therapy is suppressive rather than remission-inducing, and may need to be lifelong. The investigators therefore need to know whether long-term therapy with sirolimus is safe and effective. To accomplish this goal, the investigators will conduct the Multicenter International Durability and Safety of Sirolimus in LAM Trial (MIDAS). This is an observational "registry" trial. The investigators propose to enroll 300 LAM patients who are on, have previously failed or been intolerant of or are considering taking sirolimus or everolimus for clinical reasons in a longitudinal observational study. This registry will follow lung function tests and adverse events over periods of at least 2 years. The mTOR inhibitor therapy will be initiated and managed by the participant's clinician. The study is planned to use the collected data from standard of care. This study will help us to refine treatment for patients with LAM and determine if long term suppressive therapy with sirolimus can prevent progression to later stages of disease. This research will be accomplished as part of the Rare Lung Disease Clinical Network Consortium, with data stored and analyzed by the Database Management Coordinating Center (DMCC) as part of the NIH-supported Rare Disease Consortium.</detailed_description>
