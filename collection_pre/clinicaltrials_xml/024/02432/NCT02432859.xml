	<brief_title>Electrical Stimulation and Expression of VEGF, VEGFR-2, HIF and NO in the Diabetic Foot Ulcer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>30 type 2 diabetic patients with ischemic foot ulceration were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to electrical stimulation (ES, n=15) or sham ES (placebo, n=15) groups. ES group received cathodal direct current for 1 h/day, 3 days/week, for 4 weeks (12 sessions). Wound fluid sample was collected for VEGF, VEGFR-2, HIF-1α and NO measurement in the first and last treatment sessions before and after intervention. Wound surface area (WSA) was measured at 1st, 6th, and 12th session.</detailed_description>
