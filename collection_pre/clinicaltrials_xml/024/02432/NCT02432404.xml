	<brief_title>Effects of a Vaginal Contraceptive Ring on Vaginal Microbiota and Local Immunity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators objective is to study effects of a contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR) containing estrogen and progesterone (NuvaRing) on vaginal bacteria (the vaginal microbiome), local immunity, and lower genital tract infection in women. Emerging data suggest a favorable effect of this CVR on vaginal bacteria, specifically hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli (LB), which are supported when the vagina is under the influence of estrogen. These lactobacilli are critical for defense against infection with HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI). Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is characterized by loss of these LB and instead, overgrowth of a mix of anaerobic bacteria. BV significantly increases risk of STI/HIV, including genital herpes caused by HSV2. BV is characterized by declines in protective immunologic mediators (certain defensins, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI)) and increases in inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, alteration of cervical immune cell populations and activation of local immune cells, including T cells. Whether local delivery of hormones through a product like the CVR restores the lactobacilli and the protection they provide from BV and STI/HIV is unknown. In contrast, the contraceptive systemic depot progesterone—commonly used worldwide—may independently increase risk of HIV acquisition and transmission. The investigators overarching hypothesis is that NuvaRing contributes to reduction in BV, healthy markers of cervicovaginal immune response and decreased rates of HSV2 shedding. Long-acting vaginal delivery of hormonal contraception as the foundation of "multicomponent prevention" - for example, delivery systems that can combine activity against unintended pregnancy, HIV, and other STI—has become a major focus for scientists, advocates, and funders alike, but effects on the vaginal environment need careful definition before broad implementation. The need for contraceptive options has taken on urgency with evidence indicating that systemic hormonal contraception (primarily injectable, long-acting progestin) may increase women's risk of HIV acquisition and transmission to male sex partners. Lack of other contraceptive options is a critical barrier to progress towards optimizing women's reproductive health. Moreover, BV remains a major problem for women, causing symptomatic vaginitis and conferring increased risk for adverse outcomes of pregnancy and STI/HIV acquisition. The investigators propose to explore the hypothesis—supported by limited data—that a contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR) that is commonly used in the U.S., the NuvaRing, will enhance women's genital and reproductive health. The investigators propose that this CVR will increase the bacteria that help the vaginal environment protect against infection by HIV and other STIs, reduce rates of BV, and that in women who already have HSV2, use of the CVR will lower HSV2 shedding in the female genital tract. Importantly, CVR acceptability in general is excellent. Moreover, the format of drug delivery through the form of a vaginal ring is also being intensely explored with the use of antiretroviral agents (dapivirine, tenofovir) as a means of topical, female-controlled HIV prevention, and formulation work with several antiretroviral drugs for sustained delivery with the NuvaRing format is underway. The investigators believe the NuvaRing specifically will enhance vaginal health because they hypothesize that it will promote the growth of the Lactobacillus bacteria that protect women from infection with HIV and other STI. These bacteria, called L. crispatus and L. jensenii, are promoted by adequate levels of vaginal estrogen. These bacteria maintain low vaginal pH (&lt;4.7) by producing lactic acid. BV occurs when these vaginal lactobacilli are replaced by overgrowth of other vaginal bacteria (primarily anaerobes, or bacteria that live in low-oxygen conditions). BV is the most common cause of vaginal complaints in reproductive-aged women. In pregnant women, BV is strongly associated with increased risk of preterm births and pregnancy-associated infections. In non-pregnant women, BV increases the risk of pelvic infections, and acquisition of multiple STI, including HSV2 and HIV. BV may elevate these risks in several ways, including activation of local immune cells. Finally, recent data indicate that onset of menstruation triggers key shifts in local vaginal bacteria, and in many women, may actually precipitate BV. Continuous use of the NuvaRing (use for four weeks, then replace) suppresses menstruation, and is increasingly used by many women with excellent reports of acceptability and safety. Whether this suppression of menstruation could suppress BV recurrence is not known. Although short-term antibiotic therapy improves symptoms and restores Lactobacillus predominance in most women with BV, up to 20% of women fail routine therapy. In addition, BV recurrence after successful therapy is the rule. Recurrence is likely caused by failure to recolonize the vagina with desirable lactobacilli, which requires adequate vaginal estrogenization. In one study, women who used the NuvaRing for 3 consecutive 28-day cycles had higher quantities of desirable vaginal lactobacilli relative to women who used oral contraceptive pills containing 20 μg ethinyl estradiol and 100 μg levonorgestrel.15 The NuvaRing releases 120 mcg/day of ENG (the active metabolite of desogestrel, a progesterone) and 15 mcg/day of ethinyl estradiol (the estrogen component). While generally well tolerated, incidence of local complaints (increased vaginal discharge or discomfort) with continuous CVR use is higher than those reported by OC users; thus, the risk: benefit ratio of this approach needs careful assessment. Pregnancy is also an independent risk for HIV acquisition and transmission, when acquisition confers high rates of perinatal transmission. However, systemic depot progesterone, commonly used worldwide, may independently increase risk of HIV acquisition and transmission. Increased HIV risk related to hormonal contraceptive use would be of global public health importance, given the large number of women using such methods. In a recent technical report, the World Health Organization noted that "expansion of contraceptive method mix and further research on the relationship between hormonal contraception and HIV infection is essential." For all of these reasons, then, a careful study of the microbiological, clinical, and immunologic benefits of the CVR is a high scientific and public health priority.</detailed_description>
