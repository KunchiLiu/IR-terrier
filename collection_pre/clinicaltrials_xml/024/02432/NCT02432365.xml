	<brief_summary>The purpose was to establish a quick (7-day) cycle schedule of paclitaxel (60 mg/m2) combining with cisplatin (40 mg/m2) NAC regimen could be tolerated without interfering the following surgical treatment and a favorable overall survival rate for stages IB2 and IIA2 cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Weekly Paclitaxel and Cisplatin in FIGO IB2 and IIA2 Cervical Cancer Followed by Radical Hysterectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, open-label, Simon's 2-stage, phase II study of paclitaxel and cisplatin as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with FIGO IB2 or IIA2, squamous cell cervical carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Primary Objectives: â€¢ Overall survival Secondary Objectives: - Safety - Progression-free survival - Response rate - Postoperative RT/CRT rate - To assess Quality-of-life An estimate of 64 evaluable patients will be enrolled in this phase II investigation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Women with previously ultreated, histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix 2. HPV16positive aged 3570 years or HPV16negative age &lt;55 years, (for those age between 5570, eligibility has to be confirmed after HPV genotype results is known. Therefore, informed consent has to be signed earlier than 2 weeks for HPV genotyping) 3. FIGO stage IB2 or bulky IIA, with tumor extending to the vagina within the upper one third of the vaginal wall. Bulky tumor is defined as (a) a visible cervical tumor with the largest diameter &gt;4 cm or (b) a cervix expanded to &gt; 4 cm as a result of tumor infiltration by pelvic examination (b) verified by magnetic resonance image (MRI) or 3dimensional (D) computed tomography (CT) 4. no suspicious extrapelvic metastasis detected by MRI or 3D CT 5. adequate marrow, liver and renal functions 6. adequate cardiopulmonary function that tolerates the administration of study regimen and radical hysterectomy 7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1 8. had written informed consent to participate in the study 9. Appropriate organ and marrow function 10. a negative urinary pregnancy test in a patient with childbearing potential 1. Patients will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria: concurrent or history of malignant tumor(s) other than treated nonmelanoma skin cancer 2. had received surgical procedure other than cervical biopsy or cytotoxic procedure including chemotherapy, radiotherapy or therapy with biologic response modifier(s) for the cervical tumor 3. enlarged pelvic lymph node with positive aspiration cytologic or histologic study 4. participate in investigational treatment or another clinical trial for cervical cancer 5. history of allergic reaction to platinum or paclitaxel 6. uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements 7. pregnant or breast feeding women</criteria>
