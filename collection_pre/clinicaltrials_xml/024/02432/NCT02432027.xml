	<brief_title>Trial to Evaluate Topical C-82 in a Psoriasis Plaque Test</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate antipsoriatic efficacy of the C-82 topical gel compared with vehicle by measurement of the thickness of the Echo Lucent Band (ELB) of the psoriatic infiltrate using 20 MHz sonography. To gain additional information about possible efficacy the change of the test fields compared to untreated plaque will be clinically assessed by visual scoring.</detailed_description>
