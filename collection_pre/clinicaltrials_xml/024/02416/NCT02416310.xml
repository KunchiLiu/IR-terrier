	<brief_title>Transcutaneous Electrical Acupoint Stimulation on Gastrointestinal Function After Cesarean Section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medical technique that involves the insertion of needles at acupoints to treat diseases.Clinical evidence supports the efficacy of acupuncture treatment in many applications. Some previous studies reported that stimulation at some acupoint exerted good effects on the digestive system.Compared with acupuncture, transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation(TEAS) is a non-invasive technique that has similar effects to acupuncture.We hypothesize that TEAS before anesthesia and during surgery would decrease the morbidity and mortality of postoperative complications in 30 days after Cesarean section.</detailed_description>
