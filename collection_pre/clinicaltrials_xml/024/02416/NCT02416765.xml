	<brief_summary>Postprandial meal glucose control with closed-loop systems (CLS) still needs some improvements. In the postprandial period, sensor delay in detecting blood glucose rise after a meal together with delays in insulin absorption expose patients to early risk of hyperglycemia and then to late-postprandial hypoglycemia. Glucagon infusion in dual-hormone CLS has the potential to improve post-meal control as compared to single-hormone CLS allowing a better glucose excursion related to a more aggressive insulin infusion while minimizing hypoglycemic risk. Several approaches have been tested for the determination of prandial boluses during closed-loop operation. The objective of this study is to test in outpatient unrestricted settings whether, in the context of closed-loop strategy, conventional meal carbohydrate counting could be reduced to a simplified qualitative meal size estimation without a significant degradation in overall glycemic control in adult patients with type 1 diabetes. The investigators hypothesize that in outpatient free-living conditions: 1) Dual-hormone CLS with partial boluses is equivalent to dual-hormone CLS with full boluses in terms of mean glucose; 2) Single-hormone CLS with partial boluses is equivalent to single-hormone CLS with full boluses in terms of mean glucose. Secondary hypothesis are: 3) Dual-hormone CLS with partial boluses will decrease time in hypoglycemia compared to single-hormone CLS with partial boluses; 4) Dual-hormone CLS with partial boluses is better than sensor-augmented pump therapy in terms of mean glucose; 5) Single-hormone CLS with partial boluses is better than sensor-augmented pump therapy in terms of mean glucose.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Males and females ≥ 18 years old. 2. Clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes for at least one year. 3. The subject will have been on insulin pump therapy for at least 3 months and currently using a fast actin insulin analog (Lispro, Aspart or Guilisine). 4. Last (less than 3 months) HbA1c ≤ 10%. 5. Currently using carbohydrate counting as the meal insulin dose strategy. 1. Clinically significant microvascular complications: nephropathy (estimated glomerular filtration rate below 40 ml/min), neuropathy (especially diagnosed gastroparesis) or severe proliferative retinopathy as judged by the investigator. 2. Recent (&lt; 3 months) acute macrovascular event e.g. acute coronary syndrome or cardiac surgery. 3. Ongoing pregnancy. 4. Severe hypoglycemic episode within 1 month of screening. 5. Agents affecting gastric emptying (Motilium®, Prandase®, Victoza®, Byetta® and Symlin®) as well as oral antidiabetic agents (Metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP4 inhibitors) if not at a stable dose for 3 months. Otherwise, these medications are acceptable and will be kept stable during the entire protocol. 6. Oral steroids unless patients present a low stable dose (e.g. 10 mg or less of prednisone per day or physiological doses, less than 35 mg/day, of hydrocortisone Cortef®). Inhale steroids at stable dose in the last month are acceptable. 7. Other serious medical illness likely to interfere with study participation or with the ability to complete the trial by the judgment of the investigator (e.g. unstable psychiatric condition). 8. Failure to comply with team's recommendations (e.g. not willing to change pump parameters, follow algorithm's suggestions, etc). 9. Living or planned travel outside Montreal (&gt; 1h of driving) area during closedloop procedures.</criteria>
