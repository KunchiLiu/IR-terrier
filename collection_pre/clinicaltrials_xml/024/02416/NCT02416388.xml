	<brief_summary>This open label, multicenter phase III study with multiple randomization phases at differents stages of AML treatment (induction, consolidation and HSCT where applicable) is designed to improve OS in younger (18 to 60 year-old) patients, with AML risk-adapted patient strategies. Within the intermediate risk AML group, optimal GvHD prophylaxis following allogeneic SCT in first CR, after either myeloablative (MAC) or reduced intensity (RIC) conditioning, will also be evaluated. With an adaptative design, this clinical trial can test up to 3 molecules if new AML agents of interest were to come out in the near future.</brief_summary>
