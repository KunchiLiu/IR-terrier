	<brief_summary>This is a proof of concept, open label protocol to evaluate the effect of losartan on cigarette smoke-induced lung injury in smokers, ex-smokers with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), giving 50 mg and subsequently 100 mg losartan for 4 weeks Aim: To test that inhibition of T-cell growth factor (TGF-ß) with losartan in ex-smokers with COPD and active and passive smokers without COPD will lead to an increase chloride conductance through calcium-activated chloride channel (CACC), as measured by nasal potential difference (NPD). Study design: The Investigators will assess the consequences of active and passive smoking and the treatment with losartan on CaCC-mediated chloride conductance in human beings using NPD measurements. NPD is a direct measure of ion transport. It measures CaCC-mediated Cl- secretion and thus serves as an indirect measure of voltage-dependent potassium (BK) channels function. In addition, improvement of NPD measured ion transport was indirectly linked to lung function improvements and clearance in trials with cystic fibrosis patients. Therefore, NPD lends itself as a good surrogate for Mucociliary clearance (MCC), in a proof of concept clinical trial. The investigators will also measure TGF-ß levels in nasal secretions and cells to correlate these with the level of CaCC-mediated Cl- conductance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Losartan on Airway Mucociliary Dysfunction in Patients With COPD and Chronic Bronchitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigator's preliminary data show that TGF-ß1 and cigarette smoke exposure decrease BK activity and cause airway surface liquid (ASL) volume depletion and losartan partially rescues BK channel function leading to increased ASL volume and ciliary beat frequency (CBF) in airway epithelial cells exposed to smoke. Therefore the investigators propose that smoke exposure, via TGF-ß1 production, leads to apical BK channel dysfunction to cause ASL volume depletion and mucociliary dysfunction in smokers and ex-smokers with COPD. Clinically used Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) are known to inhibit TGF-ß signaling and present a "low-hanging-fruit" approach (medication already in clinical use) for intervention in COPD. In a murine model, losartan has previously been shown to attenuate cigarette smoke-induced lung injury and to rescue lung architecture. The long-term goal of this study is evaluate the effect of currently available and clinically useful TGF-ß1 signaling inhibitors (ARBs) on mucociliary function in individuals with smoke-associated airway diseases, such as chronic bronchitis and COPD. To test that hypothesis, subjects with COPD will be given four weeks of 50 mg of losartan daily and consequently an additional four weeks of 100 mg of losartan (divided in two doses of 50 mg twice daily).</detailed_description>
