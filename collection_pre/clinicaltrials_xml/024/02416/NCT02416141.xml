	<brief_title>Fast-release Orodispersible Tramadol as Analgesia in Termination of Pregnancy by Vacuum Aspiration.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients were administered either 50 mg of fast-release orodispersible tramadol (Meda Pharma, Brussels, Belgium) or placebo 30 min before the procedure. Both, patient and gynecologist were blinded. Patients underwent the following procedure: a sterile bivalve speculum was introduced into the vagina, then cervix and vagina were washed with an antiseptic solution. The cervix was grasped with a tenaculum and straigthened. A paracervical block was achieved using a 27-gauge spinal needle. Lidocaine was injected and distributed equally around the cervicovaginal junction at 1, 5, 7 and 11 o'clock. The suction curettage was accomplished through the following steps: the cervix was dilated, in function of the gestation, to Hagar number 5 to 11 (Aesculap, Ag and Co. KG, Tuttlingen, Germany); The uterine depth was measured using a hysterometry; suction curettage was performed by using plastic canula (Luneau Sas, France) and a classic suction pump (AMEDA Egnell SA, Switserland). The patients were observed for 2 hours after the curettage procedure. Patients were asked to rate the pain during different steps of the procedure.</detailed_description>
