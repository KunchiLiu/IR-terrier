	<brief_title>Preventing Weight Gain in African American Reproductive-Aged Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Weight gain is an important health concern, and disparities in the prevalence of obesity between African American and White women increase throughout the reproductive period. This study is a randomized, controlled trial testing the feasibility and acceptability of a peer-coach-administered, Facebook-delivered intervention to prevent weight gain in overweight and obese African American women. Study visits lasting approximately 1 hour will occur at baseline, post-intervention, and 1-month follow-up, to assess effectiveness and acceptability. The core intervention will occur over a 4-week period. Educational content in both the weight-gain prevention program and women's health program will be delivered via Facebook, with new content posted each weekday related to that week's topics. The peer coaches may contact participants via private messaging, when needed, to provide support and encourage engagement. If successful, this intervention could be easily disseminated to populations in under-served and community settings.</detailed_description>
