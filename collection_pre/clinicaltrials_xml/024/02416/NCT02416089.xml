	<brief_title>Tampostat for Management of Postpartum Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a 2-year study having two parts. Part A will be a Proof of Concept (POC) study that will be conducted at the Obstetrical Ward of Shaheed Suhrawardi Medical College Hospital (ShSMCH) and Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH). There is no sample size estimation of this POC study that will assess safety, feasibility and applicability of using Tampostat on 5 consenting women with PPH for each hospital. Part B of the study will be an open label, randomized clinical trial that will be conducted at the Obstetrical Ward of Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH). In this part, 344 consenting women with primary PPH will be enrolled, and allocated to either Tampostat or the control intervention in equal numbers per randomization (172 patients in each arm). In both these parts, Tampostat will be used only when Active Management of Third Stage of Labour (AMTSL) has failed to prevent PPH within 24 hours after delivery. All the doctors involved in the provision of care and treatment to PPH patients will be trained on the WHO's standard of care; they will also receive training on appropriate use of the devices to be used in this trial. An expert committee constituted of OBGYN professionals, clinical trial specialists, and statisticians will oversee the technical management of patients, data collection and their procedures, and ethical issues in this trial.</detailed_description>
