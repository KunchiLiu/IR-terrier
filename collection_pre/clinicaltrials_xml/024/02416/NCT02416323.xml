	<brief_title>Effectiveness and Implementation of a Mental Health Intervention for ASD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized controlled effectiveness trial of AIM HI ("An Individualized Mental Health Intervention for ASD"), an intervention designed specifically for implementation in community mental health clinics, to reduce problem behavior among school-age children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Although the individual components of AIM HI are well-established evidence-based practice strategies and pilot study data indicate that child behavior problems decrease when their community mental health therapists deliver AIM HI, the effectiveness of the protocol has not been established. Therefore, the primary aims are to test the impact of training community therapists in AIM HI on child and family outcomes and determine how child/ family characteristics and level of therapist fidelity moderate treatment effects. The secondary aim is to collect initial data on implementation outcomes and conduct exploratory analyses to identify barriers and facilitators of AIM HI implementation (e.g., intervention, organization, provider characteristics). This study has the potential to make a significant impact by building local capacity to serve school-age children with ASD in routine service settings, and advancing the science on the effectiveness of packaging evidence-based practices (EBPs) for specific services settings. It will also produce generalizable knowledge about implementation that can be applied for this population/ setting.</detailed_description>
