	<brief_summary>Healthy aging is associated with a decline in multiple cognitive domains, as well as motor control function. The long-term consequences of cognitive and functional impairment resulting from age-related cognitive decline are well documented in the scientific and clinical literature, with significant evidence of related problems with independent functional abilities. This study aims to understand how the experimental computer program can affect cognition and attention in participants with age-related cognitive decline.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Following consent, participants will engage in an assessment process to determine eligibility. Once eligibility is confirmed, participants will be scheduled for another assessment session to determine current level of cognitive function. This process consists of paper-pencil surveys and computerized tests. Following the assessment process, participants will engage in an Internet browser-delivered training sessions conducted on any internet-accessible computer. The computerized training sessions can be done up to 7 times a week (once a day) or at the participant's convenience (the recommended time commitment is 5 times a week). Following the completion of training, the participant's cognitive function will be re-assessed. Participation is voluntary and participants may withdraw from the study at any time.</detailed_description>
