	<brief_title>A Study to Assess Safety Tolerability and Immunogenicity of Three Prime-boost Regimens of the Candidate Prophylactic Vaccines for Ebola in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, Phase 2 study evaluating the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of 3 heterologous prime-boost regimens using Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo administered to healthy adults participants in Europe. The study consists of a screening period of up to 12 weeks, a vaccination period in which participants will be vaccinated at baseline (Day 1), followed by a boost vaccination on Days 29, 57 or 85, and a post-vaccination phase until 6 month post-boost visit (Days 209, 237 or 265). After unblinding, only participants who received Ad26.ZEBOV or MVA-BN-Filo will continue the study until the Day 365 visit to assess long-term safety and immunogenicity. Participants will enroll into 3 cohorts: that is, Cohort 1(Participants will receive Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo in an open-label fashion), Cohort 2 (Participants will be randomized to receive the prime-boost vaccination with either Ad26.ZEBOV followed by MVA-BN-Filo, or placebo in a 14:1 ratio) and Cohort 3 (Participants will be randomized to receive the prime-boost vaccination with either Ad26.ZEBOV followed by MVA-BN-Filo, or placebo in a 10:3 ratio). In Cohorts 2 and 3, core immunogenicity assessments (humoral and cellular assays) will be performed. In Cohort 2, additional immunogenicity assessments will be done. In Cohort 1, plasma blast response kinetics will be evaluated. Safety will be monitored during the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must be healthy in the Investigator's clinical judgment on the basis of medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) and vital signs performed at Screening Must be healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at Screening. If the results of the laboratory screening tests are outside the normal reference ranges, the participant may be included only if the Investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant or to be appropriate and reasonable for the population under study Before randomization, a woman must be either of childbearing potential and practicing (or intending to practice) a highly effective method of birth control consistent with local regulations regarding the use of birth control methods for participants participating in clinical studies, beginning at least 28 days prior to vaccination OR not of childbearing potential: postmenopausal (greater than [&gt;] 45 years of age with amenorrhea for at least 2 years or any age with amenorrhea for at least 6 months, and a serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt;40 international unit per milliliter [IU/L]); permanently sterilized (for example, bilateral tubal occlusion [which includes tubal ligation procedures as consistent with local regulations], hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy); or otherwise be incapable of pregnancy Woman of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (betahuman chorionic gonadotropin [betahCG]) at Screening and a negative urine betahCG pregnancy test immediately prior to each study vaccine administration Man who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential and has not had a vasectomy performed more than 1 year prior to screening must be willing to use condoms for sexual intercourse beginning prior to enrollment Having received any candidate Ebola vaccine Diagnosed with Ebola virus disease, or prior exposure to Ebola virus, including travel to West Africa less than 1 month prior to screening. West Africa includes but is not limited to the countries of Guinea, Liberia, Mali, and Sierra Leone Having received any experimental candidate adenovirus serotype 26 (vector: Ad26) or Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) based vaccine in the past Known allergy or history of anaphylaxis or other serious adverse reactions to vaccines or vaccine products (including any of the constituents of the study vaccines including known allergy to egg, egg products and aminoglycosides Presence of acute illness or temperature greater than or equal to 38.0 C on Day 1</criteria>
