	<brief_summary>High-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) as part of the up-front treatment of patients with multiple myeloma has been associated with improved disease-free and overall survival in multiple large randomized controlled trials. Following 3-6 cycles of standard induction therapy with biologic agents, consolidation with high dose Melphalan and ASCT has become the standard-of-care approach for fit myeloma patients up to 70 years of age. Single-agent high-dose Melphalan (200mg/m2) is currently the standard-of-care preparative regimen prior to autologous transplant in Myeloma. Historical studies utilizing Busulfan- or Total Body Irradiation-based preparative regimens have yielded similar results to single-agent Melphalan with higher toxicity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Dose Chemotherapy Using BeEAM for Autologous Transplant in Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myeloma patients, following up-front induction therapy, will receive an ASCT following a high-dose bendamustine-based preparative regimen (BeEAM). The primary endpoint of this trial will be the rate of CR at day 100 post-transplant. Experience from the literature, as well as results from our institution, suggests that following ASCT for the upfront treatment of myeloma, the rate of CR at day 100 post-transplant is approximately 45%. It is hoped that under this protocol, this rate will be at least 65%. Thus we statistically formalize this study by testing the null hypothesis that p, the CR rate is 0.65 or more versus the alternative hypothesis that p is less than 0.45. A sample size of 65 pts gives 90% power with an alpha=0.05, using the formula for a one sample binomial (two-sided) test of a proportion.</detailed_description>
