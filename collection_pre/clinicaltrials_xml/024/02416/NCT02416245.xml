	<brief_title>Impact of Beverage Powder With Micronutrients and Brahmi Extract on Cognitive Variables in Indian School Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bacopa monnieri (Brahmi) from Scrophulariaceae family has been traditionally used in India as 'memory tonic'. Brahmi's use as a cognitive enhancer has led to recent research to investigate a broad spectrum of cognitive domains. Additionally, micronutrient deficiency in children can impair cognitive functions, and micronutrient supplementation can help reduce/prevent deficiencies in those at risk. Several studies have been conducted so far which establish the cognition enahncing abilities of Brahmi, with no major side effects. The aim of the current study is to investigate the beneficial impact of 4 month consumption of a beverage powder fortified with Brahmi extract and multiple vitamins and minerals on short term memory as assessed using standardised cognitive test battery.</detailed_description>
