	<brief_title>Effects of Smoking Environment on Craving and Smoking</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adult smokers (n=25) will complete 4 visits and a 6 month follow-up phone call. Participants will complete a Delay to Smoking Task following 6 hours smoking abstinence. The task involves viewing pictures of smoking and non-smoking locations and participants will have the choice to smoke a cigarette at any time during the session. A monetary reinforcer will be provided for each 6-minute period that a participant resists smoking. Once participants stop the task they can choose to smoke as much or a little as they want for the next 30 minutes. Participants will be provided with a smoking tab. Each cigarette they light will cost them from their tab. Measurements of tobacco craving, emotion ratings, and nicotine withdrawal will be assessed.</detailed_description>
