	<brief_title>Exercise Genes: Genomic Association With Exercise Reinforcement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators propose that an individual's genetics are one factor that may be associated with the motivating aspect or attractiveness of exercise and therefore the choice to exercise rather than be sedentary. They propose to study the association of the genomic signatures with the reinforcing (motivating) value of different types of exercise. This has never been investigated and may uncover underlying mechanisms that would help to understand individual differences in exercise motivation. The ultimate impact of this work is a greater number of Americans being physically active, meeting the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) dietary guidelines for physical activity, and maintaining a healthy body weight. This study will be funded and undertaken at the Grand Forks Human Nutrition Research Center (GFHNRC). The purpose will be to assess genetic underpinnings of the motivating value of resistance and aerobic exercise, and to determine whether the motivating value of aerobic and resistance exercise are associated with usual participation in these modes of exercise.</detailed_description>
