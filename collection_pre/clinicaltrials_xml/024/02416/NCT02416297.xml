	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to assess the clinical effectiveness of a minimally invasive alveolar microperforation procedure to achieve accelerated tooth movement in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment for orthognathic surgery. "Accelerated tooth movement" means that Microperforation technique may help complete orthodontic treatment sooner than would be expected in conventional orthodontic treatment</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Three- Dimensional Evaluation of Accelerated Tooth Movement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SAMPLE: For this retrospective study, 50 individuals will be selected, with skeletal discrepancies randomly divided into two groups: 1 - accelerated tooth movement technique (ATMT) and 2 - Control . METHODS: MATERIAL - Orthodontic records done in two times, initial and preoperative; Plaster models of dental extracted jaw every 28 days; Cone Beam Computed tomography done in two times, initial and in the end of extraction space closure. METHODS: Orthodontic Treatment: to activate extraction space closure, light orthodontic traction will be made in anterior teeth, to maintain therapeutic osteopenia until contact point between the canine the second pre -molar. Cortical perforations - ATMT Group: Flapless cortical perforations will be made after dental extraction. Surgical protocol will be flapless to preserve periodontal health. After local anesthesia, minimum cortical perforations will be done with manual instrument, between 4-6 mm apical to the contour of free gum between the canine and second pre-molar. Two perforations near each tooth adjacent to the extraction area. Results: On plaster models - shortest distance between two adjacent teeth to the extraction space will be measure with caliper. Cone-Beam Computed Tomography: after image acquisition , data will be previously converted to DICOM , to converted to GIPL in ITK-SNAP 3.2 software. In Imagine software voxels will be converted to size 0.5 mm for further construction of virtual three-dimensional models, through segmentation of anatomical structures again in ITK-SNAP 3.2 software. This segmentation will be made by the full selection of all maxilla and mandible anatomically and individually, with the limit all skeletal outline available, including teeth. After 3D models generation, specific control targeting to fill all narrow spaces, so that they are not excluded from the virtual model and the external cortical displacements are the only ones to be computed in the comparative evaluation between later time. Then regional overlay 3D models will be done using Imagine software. For overlapping structures: In mandible will use along the edge of the mandibular symphysis; maxilla, posterior nasal spine. Overlap is automatic because software compares voxels grayscale to reference region to overlap spatially. Displacement evaluation will be done with Mirit software through colorful maps generated by calculating the distances between points of two representatives surfaces. These maps differentiate the movements between surfaces. For quantification metric, specific online tool is used to measure the displacement in millimeters. We will evaluate quantitative displacement for space closure, closing speed, the possible changes throughout the maxillomandibular complex and compared between groups. Ossification area volume will be compared using Hounsfield scale. After collecting data, the results will be statistically analyzed.</detailed_description>
