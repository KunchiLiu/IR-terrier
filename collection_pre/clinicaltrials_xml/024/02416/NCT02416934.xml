	<brief_title>Dysphagia Following Anterior Cervical Spine Surgery; Steroid vs Saline</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This investigation is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial testing peri-operative steroids versus saline and the effect on swallowing after anterior cervical spine surgery. Swallowing symptoms will be measured using the patient reported Bazaz scale and the Dysphagia Short Questionnaire. Swallowing data will be obtained pre-operatively, one day and two days post-operatively and then one week, two weeks, four weeks, three months, six months, and one year post-operatively. Other data to be collected for analysis includes patient comorbidities, levels and type of surgery, intra-operative fluids, estimated blood loss, type of retractors, type of brace if any, length of stay, and other surgically related complications. Patient clinical outcomes will be captured using web-based progress reports. Patients will complete the QoL-12, Neck Disability Index, and Visual Analog Scale questionnaires electronically pre-operatively and at one year post-operatively. This outcome data will help us analyze the swallowing function or symptoms with the overall clinical course of the patients enrolled in this study.</detailed_description>
