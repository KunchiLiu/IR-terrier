	<brief_summary>PTSD Coach is a mobile application (app) that aims to teach individuals self-management strategies for symptoms of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a major public health concern. Although effective treatments exist, affected individuals face many barriers to receiving traditional care. As smartphones are now carried by more than half of the U.S. population, they have the potential to overcome many of these barriers by delivering self-help interventions on apps. Despite PTSD Coach's use of evidence-based cognitive behavioral strategies there is still a need to test the effectiveness of the app in managing PTSD symptoms. This controlled, two-arm, randomized (1:1) trial will evaluate the efficacy, feasibility and acceptability of PTSD Coach to reduce PTSD symptoms in a community sample of trauma survivors with PTSD symptoms. After completing an eligibility phone screen or online screen, individuals who score a 35 or above on the PTSD Checklist (PCL) and consent will complete a baseline assessment and then be randomized to the PTSD Coach app condition or a waitlist control group. Additionally, those assigned to the PTSD Coach intervention will be instructed to download a research version of the app, called PTSD Explorer, that enables passive and objective monitoring of app use. Each individual will be reassessed at post-intervention (3 months) and follow-up (3 months later, or 6 months after completing baseline). The investigators predict that those using the PTSD Coach app will demonstrate a significant and sustained reduction in PTSD symptoms and increase in patient coping self-efficacy compared to the waitlist control group. The investigators will explore if there is a relationship between levels of engagement and PTSD symptom change.</brief_summary>
