	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators introduce a new "capsule-reserved" cataract surgical procedure in which anterior lens capsule is reserved and attached onto posterior lens capsule in the purpose of preventing posterior capsule opacification (PCO). A prospective randomized controlled study is reported to compare the new "capsule-reserved" surgical procedure with conventional one on the effectiveness to prevent posterior capsule opacification in age-related cataract patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Two Different Cataract Surgical Procedures to Prevent Posterior Capsule Opacification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective, randomized controlled study of 240 eligible patients will been enrolled. Two eyes of each patient were assigned randomly to two groups respectively: Group I; anterior lens capsule is conventionally not reserved after continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis, while in Group II, anterior lens capsule is innovatively reserved and attached onto posterior lens capsule. This novel adjusted surgical procedure, featured by using the reserved anterior lens capsule to protect the peri-capsule microenvironment and prevent PCO, is conceptual different from the traditional cataract surgical procedure. Clinical examinations including posterior capsule opacification grading score, central posterior capsule thickness, central posterior capsule density, best corrected visual acuity, contrast sensitivity were carried out preoperatively and at each postoperative visit.</detailed_description>
