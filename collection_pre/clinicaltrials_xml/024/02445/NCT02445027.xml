	<brief_title>Pilot Study for Imaging of the Esophagus Using a Tethered Capsule OCT Endomicroscopy in the Primary Care Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>20 healthy volunteers scheduled for a routine primary care visit will be recruited and asked to swallow the OCT capsule while being awake and unsedated. The capsule is attached to a tether which allows the operator to control as well as navigate the capsule as it progresses down the esophagus using natural propulsive force called peristalsis. As the capsule progresses through the esophagus, multiple images of the esophagus are acquired and later analyzed.</detailed_description>
