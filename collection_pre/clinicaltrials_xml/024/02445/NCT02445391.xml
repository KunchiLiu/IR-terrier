	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial studies how well cisplatin or carboplatin (platinum based chemotherapy) works compared to capecitabine in treating patients with remaining (residual) basal-like triple-negative breast cancer following chemotherapy after surgery (neoadjuvant). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, carboplatin and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known whether cisplatin or carboplatin is more effective than capecitabine in treating patients with residual triple negative basal-like breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Platinum Based Chemotherapy or Capecitabine in Treating Patients With Residual Triple-Negative Basal-Like Breast Cancer Following Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare the invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients with residual basal-like disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy who are randomized to post-preoperative platinum based chemotherapy with those who are randomized to capecitabine. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate overall survival (OS) and response-free survival (RFS) in the two arms in patients with TNBC with residual basal-like disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. II. To characterize the side effects and tolerability of each platinum agent (cisplatin and carboplatin) as well as capecitabine in patients with TNBC with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. III. To identify the rate of basal-like gene expression using prediction analysis of microarray 50 (PAM50) analysis by digital messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) quantitation amongst drug-resistant residual TNBC after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. IV. To compare the IDFS in TNBC patients with residual non-basal-like disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy who are randomized to post-preoperative platinum based chemotherapy with those who are randomized to capecitabine (exploratory analysis). OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. ARM A (closed to accrual 05/16/2016): Patients undergo observation. ARM B: Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) or carboplatin IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM C: Patients receive capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 10 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SCREENING AND MOLECULAR PROFILING (STEP 0) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1 within 2 weeks prior to screening Female and male patients must have histologically confirmed triple negative (estrogen receptor negative [ER]/progesterone receptor negative [PR]/human epidermal growth factor receptor2 negative [HER2]) invasive breast cancer, clinical stage IIIII at diagnosis (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] 7th edition) based on initial evaluation by clinical examination and/or breast imaging ER and PR should meet one of the following criteria: =&lt; 10% cells stain positive, with weak intensity score (Allred score =&lt; 2) =&lt; 1% cells stain positive, with weak or intermediate intensity score (Allred score =&lt; 2) HER2 negative (not eligible for antiHER2 therapy) will be defined as: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) 0, 1+ without in situ hybridization (ISH) HER2/neu chromosome 17 ratio OR IHC 2+ and ISH HER2/neu chromosome 17 ratio nonamplified with ratio less than 2.0 and if reported average HER2 copy number &lt; 6 signals/cells OR ISH HER2/neu chromosome 17 ratio nonamplified with ratio less than 2.0 and if reported average HER2 copy number &lt; 6 signals/cells without IHC NOTE: Patients that originally present with synchronous bilateral tumors are eligible provided both tumors are TNBC, and at least one of them fulfills the remainder eligibility criteria of the protocol Patients must have completed neoadjuvant taxane +/ anthracycline; patients must NOT have received cisplatin or carboplatin or capecitabine as part of their neoadjuvant therapy regimen NOTE: Patients who received preoperative therapy as part of a clinical trial may enroll Must have completed definitive resection of primary tumor Negative margins for both invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) are desirable, however patients with positive margins may enroll if the treatment team believes no further surgery is possible and patient has received radiotherapy; patients with margins positive for lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) are eligible Either mastectomy or breast conserving surgery (including lumpectomy or partial mastectomy) is acceptable Sentinel node biopsy post neoadjuvant chemotherapy (i.e. at the time of definitive surgery) is allowed; axillary dissection is encouraged in patients with lymph node involvement, but is not mandatory Post neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients must be found to have residual invasive cancer in the breast at the time of definitive surgery; residual cancer is defined as a contiguous focus of residual invasive cancer, in the breast, measuring &gt;= 1 cm in diameter, and with more than minimal cellularity, as per local pathologist determination NOTE: The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) without invasion does not qualify as residual invasive disease in the breast Postmastectomy radiotherapy is required for all patients with the following: Primary tumor &gt;= 5 cm (prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy [clinically] or at the time of definitive surgery) or involvement of 4 or more lymph nodes at the time of definitive surgery For patients with primary tumors &lt; 5 cm or with &lt; 4 involved lymph nodes prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and at the time of definitive surgery, provision of postmastectomy radiotherapy is at the discretion of the treating physician NOTE: Radiation of regional nodal basins is at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist; patients enrolled in clinical trials addressing local therapy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy are allowed to enroll Breast radiotherapy (whole breast or partial) is required for patients who underwent breastconserving therapy, including lumpectomy or partial mastectomy Laboratory values must be obtained within 8 weeks prior to screening for protocol therapy Hemoglobin (Hgb) &gt;
