	<brief_summary>The investigators would like to know if different imaging devices can improve the quality of images and visualization of imaged tissues. Also, the investigators would like to find out whether these changes are useful in the diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases. Using images of previous participants will allow us to demonstrate the advancement of different technologies, as well be used to allow comparisons between current technologies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measuring Geographic Atrophy in AMD Patients Using the Nidek MP-3 Microperimetry Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To test the quality of images from the Nidek MP-3 device and to measure Geographic Atrophy (GA) in patients with Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Normal, healthy participants and patients with AMD 1. Those suffering from head, neck or other injury which makes them unable to position themselves in head restraint for imaging 2. Participants who are unable to maintain retinal fixation on a specified target 3. Participants unable to achieve sufficient pupil dilation and alignment stability for imaging to take place 4. Patients with media opacity which preclude high quality imaging will be excluded. 5. Exclusion criteria include vulnerable patientsÍ¾ patients under 18, pregnant, economically and educationally disadvantaged, decision impaired, or homeless people. We exclude pregnant women because pregnancy often can alter eye anatomy.</criteria>
