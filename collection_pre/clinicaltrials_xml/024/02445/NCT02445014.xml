	<brief_summary>The goal of this research is to test the feasibility and tolerability of the modified, larger diameter, tethered Spectrally Encoded Confocal Microscopy (SECM) capsule in healthy subjects, subjects with Barrett's Esophagus (BE), and subjects with Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This information will be used to assess optimal imaging technique, imaging quality, and subject tolerability.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study to Image the Esophagus Using a SECM Tethered Endoscopic Capsule</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>36 subjects including 12 healthy volunteers, 12 patients with Barrett's Esophagus and 12 with Gastroesophageal reflux disease will be enrolled and asked to swallow the SECM HITEC Capsule. The subjects will be awake and unsedated. The capsule is attached to a string like tether which allows the operator to control as well as navigate the capsule as it progresses down the esophagus using natural propulsive force called peristalsis. As the capsule progresses through the esophagus, multiple images of the esophagus are acquired in real time to be analyzed later.</detailed_description>
