	<brief_title>Efficacy of Wound Care and Reduction of Wound Complications by Use of AQUACEL® Ag Surgical Dressing in MIS TKA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traditional adhesive dressing (Mepore®; Mölnlycke Health Care) for low limb arthroplasty wounds had blistering up to 26%. The jubilee dressing, which consisted of a highly absorbent Hydrofiber inner layer and (Aquacel; ConvaTec Inc.) and a viscoelastic hydrocolloid outer layer (DuoDERM Extra Thin; ConvaTec Inc.), was introduced for lower limb arthroplasty wounds with lower blistering rate (2% vs. 18%) and lower surgical site infection (1% vs. 3%) compared to traditional adhesive dressing. A new modern dressing regime (Aquacel Ag Surgical dressing; ConvaTec Inc.) also reported longer wear time, less dressing change and less blistering. In our institution, the standard wound care after TKA was an antimicrobial dressing (Sofra-Tulle®; Royal Chem. &amp; Pharm. Co., Kaohsiung, Taiwan) in the inner layer and gauzes in the outer layer. The investigators hypothesized that AQUACEL® Ag Surgical dressing would have a significant improvement in the efficacy of wound care and wound complications compared with traditional Sofra-Tulle® dressings after MIS-TKA.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Two hundred and eighty five patients who were scheduled for primary unilateral MISTKA were enrolled in the study period. Patients with condition/comorbidity that could compromise wound healing, including varicose eczema, peripheral vascular disease, receiving immunosuppressive medications, corticosteroid abuse, chronic skin disease around the knee (e.g. psoriasis and chronic eczema) and having prior knee replacement, osteotomy or fracture of the ipsilateral knee.</criteria>
