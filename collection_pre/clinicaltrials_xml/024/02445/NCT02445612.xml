	<brief_title>Long Term Follow Up of Sub-retinal Transplantation of hESC Derived RPE Cells in Stargardt Macular Dystrophy Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a long term, non interventional follow up to the phase I/II, open-label, non randomized, sequential, multi-center trial (referred to as the core protocol) in which a maximum of 13 SMD patients were treated. Ten poor vision subjects(20/400) were transplanted with sequential doses of hESC-RPE cells, starting at a dose of 50,000 hESC-RPE cells transplanted (three subjects), 100,000 hESC-RPE cells transplanted (three subjects), 150,000 hESC-RPE cells transplanted (three subjects) and increasing to a maximum dose of 200,000 hESC-RPE cells transplanted(one subject). Three better vision subjects(20/100) were transplanted with a dose of 100,000 hESC-RPE cells. Eligible patients will be those who sign a consent form for the extension study, and who fulfill all inclusion/exclusion criteria. The first visit of this extension protocol will correspond to the last visit of the core protocol, and will take place at 12 months post cell implantation. During the first 2 years after completion of the core protocol, i.e. from Year 1 to Year 2 and from Year 2 to Year 3 post transplantation, the patients will be evaluated at approximately 3 month intervals; during years three thru five patients will be evaluated at approximately six month intervals. During years 6-15, patients will either be required to return to the study center or provide the name of an ophthalmologist in their locality who would provide an evaluation of the patient's vision and any abnormal findings and report these results to the study site annually. Follow up will include obtaining information about visual acuity, ophthalmological findings and adverse events (AEs), specifically including cancer, neurological, autoimmune or hematological disorders that developed or worsened since the last visit.</detailed_description>
