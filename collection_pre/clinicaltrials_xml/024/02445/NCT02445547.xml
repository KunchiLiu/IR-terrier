	<brief_summary>Stem cell transplantation has emerged as a relatively popular treatment that can help to regulate immunity, repair injury, and control inflammation. Several studies have used autologous stem cells or adipose-derived stem cells to treat Crohn's disease and its associated complications, and have achieved good efficacy. Thus far, the use of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) to treat Crohn's disease has rarely been reported. In this study, UC-MSCs were used to treat patients with hormone-controlled Crohn's disease. We observed the disease control conditions, corticosteroid dosage changes, and treatment-related adverse reactions.</brief_summary>
