	<brief_summary>It recommends that the CHOP regimen in the primary T-cell lymphoma therapies currently used but did not get satisfactory effect of therapy (progression-free survival 40%), primarily to consider the clinical trial at NCCN guideline.But why the CHOP regimen is widely used because physicians are accustomed to use. Fractionated ICED therapy is a therapy by adjusting the Original ICE regimen.This is how the capacity of Ifosfamide divided into three days. (Fractionated ifosfamide).Original ICE therapy has been widely used as a salvage therapy of patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma for a long time, it has been recommended as part of primary therapy of T-cell lymphoma.But Fractionated ICED is added to dexamethasone therapy in order to improve the effectiveness as a primary therapy.The recurrent lymphoma in 75 patients with treatment after Fractionated ICE when the self-stem cell transplantation, showed a more than 40% progression-free survival.Thus treatment of Fractionated ICED targeting previously untreated patients, and if a combination of high-dose dexamethasone to expect to be able to induce a progression-free survival of 60% or more.</brief_summary>
