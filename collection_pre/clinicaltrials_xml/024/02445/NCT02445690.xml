	<brief_summary>One hundred and fifty patients with Crohn's disease involving the terminal ileum or the colon, in clinical remission, with or without endoscopic activity will be included. Thrombin generation will be measured and correlated with the simplified endoscopic activity score. The patients will be evaluated for development of deep vein thrombosis after one-year of follow-up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thrombin Generation in Crohn's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One hundred and fifty patients with Crohn's disease involving the terminal ileum or the colon, in clinical remission defined by the Crohn's Disease Activity Index below 150 and Harvey-Bradshaw Index below 5, with or without endoscopic activity defined by simplified endoscopic activity score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD) will be included in this study (75 patients with a complete mucosal healing defined by SES-CD below 3 and 75 with endoscopic activity defined by SES-CD above 6) in multiple centers specializing in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases in Brazil; Study data will be collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at the Clinical Hospital of University of S達o Paulo. REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web-based application designed to support data capture for research studies. All thrombin generation tests will be performed at the Clinical Hospital of University of S達o Paulo, S達o Paulo, SP through automatically calibrated Thrombogram (CAT- Calibrated Automated Thrombogram速, Maastricht, The Netherlands), with and without thrombomodulin. Those patients will be followed for at least one year after the colonoscopy with measurement of the D-dimer and clinical evaluation every 3 months to verify the developing of deep vein thrombosis.</detailed_description>
