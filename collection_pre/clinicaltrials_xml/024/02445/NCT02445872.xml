	<brief_summary>Aprepitant is an oral neurokinin-1(NK-1) antagonist which is used for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). This phase II clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of aprepitant in the prevention of CINV with lung cancer patients receiving 3-day cisplatin-based chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Aprepitant for CINV in Patients With Lung Cancer Receiving Multiple-day Cisplatin Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients pathologic diagnosed of advanced non-small cell lung cancer, according to NCCN non-small cell lung cancer guide line(2015 V1).The patient should receive a 3-day cisplatin-based chemotherapy, are randomized divided into two groups, aprepitant group and placebo group. In aprepitant group, patients would receive aprepitant(125 mg po at day1, 80 mg at day2-3) combination with palonosetron and dexamethasone(5mg iv at day1-3, 3.75mg po at day4-5). In placebo group patients would receive palonosetron and dexamethasone(5mg iv at day1-3, 7.5mg po at day4-5).During the treatment, any grade of nausea and vomiting should be recorded in order to evaluate the complete response rate of CINV, other side-effects should be recorded.</detailed_description>
