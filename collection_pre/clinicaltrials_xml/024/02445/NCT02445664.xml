	<brief_summary>Osteoporosis is a highly prevalent disease in which non-adherence is a well-recognized problem. Non-adherence may be due to patients´ lack of knowledge, understanding, and involvement. In this study the investigators aimed to determine the effect of an educational video displayed on a tablet-device. The investigators hypothesized that an educational video would increase patients´ knowledge on osteoporosis and treatment at a two week follow up.</brief_summary>
