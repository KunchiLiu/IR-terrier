	<brief_title>On-Line Intervention For Promoting Healthy Habits And Weight Loss In Hypertensive Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence of overweight and obesity is on the rise worldwide with severe physical and psychosocial consequences. Hypertension is one of the comorbidities associated with obesity. Changes in lifestyles through eating behavior and physical activity level are the critical components in the prevention and treatment for hypertension and obesity. Data from several studies indicate that the usual procedures to promote these healthy habits in health services are inadequate. ICTs has been demonstrated as an effective tool for implementation of psychological interventions focused on this type of population. This study aims to describe a totally self-applied online program (¨Vivir Mejor¨) to promote healthy lifestyles (eating behavior and physical activity) for obese participants with hypertension. Participants (BMI=25-35) will be recruited from users of a hypertension unit of a public hospital and will be randomized into two groups: experimental group "Vivir Mejor" and control group (treatment as usual). "Vivir Mejor" program is composed by 9 modules aimed for promoting healthy eating habits and increase physical activity. Modules will be sent via Internet periodically. After 6 months, a follow-up testing phase and a tracking module will be set. The outcomes variables will include anthropometric data, changes in eating behavior and physical performance and cardiovascular variables.</detailed_description>
