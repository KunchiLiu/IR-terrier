	<brief_summary>Per Health Authorities guidelines for gene therapy medicinal products that utilize integrating vectors (e.g. lentiviral vectors), long term safety and efficacy follow up of treated patients is required. The purpose of this study is to monitor all patients exposed to CD19 directed CAR T-cells (CD19 CART) for 15 years following last CD19 CART (e.g. CTL019) infusion to assess the risk of delayed adverse events (AEs), monitor for replication competent lentivirus (RCL) and assess long-term efficacy, including vector persistence.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CD19 CART Long Term Follow Up (LTFU) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are enrolled following completion or early discontinuation from a Novartis sponsored or supported study of CD19 directed CAR T-Cell treatment and will be followed for 15 years post treatment from the last CD19 directed CAR T-Cell treatment. Patients will be monitored for safety and efficacy within the primary treatment protocols for the protocol defined duration. While every effort will be made to keep patients in follow-up within the respective treatment protocol itself, patients can drop off treatment protocols at any time. Patients discontinuing from the primary treatment protocols for any reason will be enrolled in this long term follow up (LTFU). This will allow collecting data on long term safety and efficacy (as applicable) as mandated by the health authorities of all patients treated with CD19 CART therapy within the concept of a single protocol. Collection of such long term effects of CD19 CART cell therapy will help to further define the risk-benefit profile of CD19 CART.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All patients who have received antiCD19 directed CART therapy and completed or discontinued early from a Novartis sponsored treatment protocol that utilized CD19directed CART cells or from any CD19 CART trial sponsored by the University of Pennsylvania with which Novartis has a contractual agreement to codevelop the CAR technology. Patients who have provided informed consent for the long term follow up study prior to their study participation . There are no specific exclusion criteria for this study.</criteria>
