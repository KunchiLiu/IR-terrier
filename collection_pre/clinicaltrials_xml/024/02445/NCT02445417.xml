	<brief_title>Brain Activity During Birth for Prediction of Newborns at Risk for Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a need for a reliable detector of birth asphyxia so that newborns with birth asphyxia can have timely and accurate diagnosis to receive therapeutic hypothermia within 6 hrs of life, which has been shown to significantly reduce deaths and improve long term developmental outcomes. This study is designed to record EEG during birth transition through the first 10 minutes of life.</detailed_description>
