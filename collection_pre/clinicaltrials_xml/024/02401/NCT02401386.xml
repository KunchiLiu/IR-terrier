	<brief_title>Lu Eight Brocades for Treating Patients With Fibromyalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Lu Eight Brocades(LEB) is a set of Qigong exercises that originated in China and date back thousands of years. It is a mind-body practice that combines meditation with slow, gentle, graceful movements, as well as deep breathing and relaxation, to move vital energy (or qi) throughout the body and is practiced as a rehabilitation exercise for various kinds of diseases. It is considered a complex, multicomponent intervention that integrates physical, psychosocial, emotional, spiritual, and behavioral elements. Fibromyalgia(FM)is a common and complex clinical syndrome characterized by chronic and widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and physical and psychological impairment. Evidence-based guidelines suggest that exercise is beneficial for FM and has been advocated as a core component of its treatment. Because of LEB's mind-body attributes and it is easy to learn, we assume that it could be well suited for the treatment of FM. Patients enrolled in this trial will be randomly allocated into one of two groups: LEB group and control group (waiting-list group). Patients will be evaluated at baseline, at 4 weeks, at 8 weeks, at 12 weeks, and a more 12-weeks follow-up. Evaluation will be based on quality of life, symptoms, standard scales of pain, degree of fatigue, depression, stress and sleep quality.All the participants will receive a half-day training, including recognizing fibromyalgia, managing chronic pain, dealing with sleep disorder and improving physical and mental health.</detailed_description>
