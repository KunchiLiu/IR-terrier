	<brief_summary>- The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of an energy drink on ventricular repolarization as measured by the interval between the cardiac Q wave and the cardiac T wave (QT interval)obtained from the body surface ECG. - The secondary objective is to assess the effects of an energy drink on heart rate and blood pressure (hemodynamic effects). To place the observed changes in context, comparison will be made to a commonly consumed drink, coffee: Starbuck's K-cup Breakfast Blend.</brief_summary>
