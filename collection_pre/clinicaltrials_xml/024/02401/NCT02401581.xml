	<brief_summary>Benign hypertrophy of the prostate (BPH) is the most frequent pathology in the urinary tract of middle-aged men. In recent years, to enable BPH treatment with larger volumes and to reduce the risk of hemorrhage known to be associated to the transurethral resection of prostate treatment, transurethral photovaporisation of the prostate (PVP ) with the GreenLight (GL) XPS 180 W was developed. Therefore, the question arises to maximally reduce the length of catheterization to facilitate outpatient surgical management of prostate adenoma. In the investigators study, the investigators propose to evaluate the failure rate of an early removal of the catheter 3 hours post-operative after a PVP procedure with GL 180 W/XPS in selected patients on general anesthesia or spinal anesthesia. To this end, the investigators realize a national multicenter prospective study including 300 patients. The effectiveness of this model of management is defined by absence of a need for re-catheterization in the post -operative period of 24 hours.</brief_summary>
