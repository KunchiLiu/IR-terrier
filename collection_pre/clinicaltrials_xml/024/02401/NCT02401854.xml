	<brief_summary>The ASSERT-III study aims to determine the incidence of sub-clinical (silent) atrial fibrillation (AF) among elderly patients with hypertension and at least one other risk factor for AF. This will be accomplished by monitoring with a wireless external loop monitor for 30 to 60 days.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients will be eligible for inclusion if they meet all of the following: 1. Age ≥ 80 years 2. History of hypertension OR a blood pressure of ≥ 140/90 mmHg 3. Attending a primary care clinic, OR ambulatory resident of a chronic care facility 4. At least one of the following additional risk factors for developing AF: 1. Diabetes 2. Body mass index ≥ 30 3. History of smoking 4. Documented Obstructive sleep apnea 5. Cardiovascular disease 6. Heart Failure 7. Left ventricular hypertrophy (on ECG or echocardiography) 5. Provide written informed consent 1. ECG documented history of AF or atrial flutter, with an episode duration ≥ 6 minutes 2. Existing implanted pacemaker or defibrillator 3. Patients considered by the investigator to be unsuitable for study followup because the patient: 1. is unreliable concerning the requirements for followup during the study and/or compliance with the use of the external loop recorder 2. has a life expectancy less that the expected study duration due to concomitant disease 3. has a condition which in the opinion of the investigator, would not allow current chronic treatment with anticoagultion</criteria>
