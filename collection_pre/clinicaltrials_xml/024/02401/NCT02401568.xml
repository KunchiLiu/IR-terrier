	<brief_summary>Compare various dynamic biomechanical markers (distances and angles) in the wrist during dynamic CT studies in three groups of patients: Normal subjects, with scapholunate instability and with other types of wrist instability.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Morphologic and Biomechanical Analysis of the Carpal Ligaments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients referred for the evaluation of wrist pain with CT arthrography will be eligible for inclusion. Patients will benefit from dynamic CT acquisitions before and after arthrography with three maneuvers: radio-ulnar deviation, clenching fist and dart throwing motion. Patients will also benefit from a wrist MR study on a 3 tesla scanner. The morphology of the carpal ligaments will be evaluated on static imaging (MR and CT arthrograph) and on dynamic CT arthrography. Distance and angular measurements will be obtained from dynamic CT studies using an appropriate post processing tool (4D-Ortho). Data obtained with dynamic wrist evaluation will be correlated to ligament morphology, classical wrist instability criteria on conventional radiographs and with surgery (if available).</detailed_description>
