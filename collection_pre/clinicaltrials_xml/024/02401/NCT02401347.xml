	<brief_summary>The aim of this single-arm phase II clinical trial is to evaluate the anti-cancer activity of Talazoparib (also known as BMN 673) in patients with advanced breast cancer with specific genetic or tumor genomic alterations. Patients with either triple-negative or HER2-negative breast cancer are eligible.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Talazoparib Beyond BRCA (TBB) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Talazoparib (BMN 673) is a novel, dual-mechanism PARP inhibitor that potently inhibits the PARP enzyme and effectively traps PARP on DNA. Talazoparib has shown promising single-agent anti-tumor efficacy in several BRCA1/2 mutation-associated advanced cancers. The efficacy of PARP inhibition in BRCA1/2 wild-type TNBC with homologous recombination (HR) defects and in breast tumors with mutations in other non-BRCA1/2 HR pathway genes is currently unknown. This Phase 2 trial (TBB) explores the activity of single agent talazoparib in BRCA1/2 wild-type BC patients using an optimal Simon two-stage design. Eligible subjects will be assigned to one of two parallel cohorts: 1) Cohort A: Subjects (n=29) with advanced TNBC with underlying HR defects as assessed by the HRD assay and, 2) Cohort B: Subjects (n=29) with advanced HER2-negative BC with a somatic or germline mutation in a non-BRCA1/2 HR pathway gene. Gene mutations of interest are: PTEN, PALB2, CHEK2, ATM, NBN, BARD1, BRIP1, RAD50, RAD51C, RAD51D, MRE11, ATR, Fanconi anemia complementation group of genes (FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL).</detailed_description>
