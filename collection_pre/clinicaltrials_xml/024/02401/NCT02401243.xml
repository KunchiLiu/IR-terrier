	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: The primary objective of this study is to obtain efficacy and safety descriptive data on 2 different titration algorithms: the INSIGHT titration algorithm (self-titration of 1 unit/day) and the EDITION trial algorithm with insulin glargine 300 units/mL when given as basal insulin in uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients on basal insulin with or without non-insulin anti-hyperglycemic agent (NIAHA) or in insulin naïve patients. Secondary Objective: The secondary objective is to gain additional efficacy and safety data (glycated hemoglobin [A1C], fasting plasma glucose [FPG], 7-point self-measure plasma glucose [SMPG], insulin dose and weight) and determine patient related outcome and health care professional satisfaction as it pertains to each titration regimen.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients who are ≥18 years of age. Treated for diabetes for at least 6 months. If on basal insulin, stable for at least 3 months prior to screening visit on their basal insulin treatment(s) (±20% total insulin dose) If on NIAHA, stable for at least 8 weeks prior to screening visit on their NIAHA(s) (no change in dose or initiation of new NIAHAs). Patients on uncontrolled basal insulin (insulin glargine, normal protamine Hagedorn [NPH], detemir) +/ NIAHAs with an A1c &gt;7.0% and ≤10% or uncontrolled on NIAHAs (insulin naïve patients) with an A1c &gt;7.0% and ≤11%. Signed informed consent form. Exclusion criteria: Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Nightshift worker. Female patients who are pregnant or lactating. Treatment with an insulin other than basal insulin (premixes, rapid insulin, fast acting insulin analogues) within the previous 3 months. Patients with less than 1 year history of diabetes. Patients unwilling to inject insulin or perform selfmonitoring blood glucose. Current alcohol or drug abuse. Patients unlikely to comply with the protocol and complete the study eg, uncooperative attitude, inability to return for followup visits. Patients with active cancer or any other diseases or conditions which in the opinion of the Investigator would make the patient unsuitable for participation in the study. Any clinically significant laboratory findings that in the judgment of the Investigator would preclude safe completion of the study. Known allergies to study drugs. Participation in another clinical study. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
