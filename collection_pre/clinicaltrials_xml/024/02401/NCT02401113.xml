	<detailed_description>This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was designed to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of Ursolic Acid of Loquat Extract for treatment of muscle function improvement with relatively health adults. 54 subjects received 500 mg of Loquat Extract per day or a placebo for 12 weeks. Change over time in muscle fuction was evaluated by four outcomes: assessment of appendicular skeletal mass using DEXA (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry); quadriceps muscle power by Biodex; hand grib power; and Short Physical Performance Battery, SPPB.</detailed_description>
