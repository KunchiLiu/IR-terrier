Maternal morbidity - Major side effects (Sepsis, considerable vaginal bleeding leading to hemodynamic instability or necessitating blood transfusion) - Minor side effects (fever, rigors, nausea, vomiting) Patient's compliance and adherence to treatment Hemoglobin and hematocrit deficit</detailed_description>
