	<brief_summary>The primary goal of the CIBMTR Research Program is to improve the safety and effectiveness of hematopoietic cell (HC) transplantation for both donors and recipients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Protocol for a Research Database for HCT, Other Cellular Therapies and Marrow Toxic Injuries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Research Database contains demographic and clinical data on allogeneic related and unrelated donor and autologous HC transplants. Data are also collected on unrelated donors and their donation experiences. The data contained in the research databases are observational data. CIBMTR does not determine which therapies are used for patients, but rather collects information regarding therapies as they are applied by transplant centers. Secondary goals of the CIBMTR Research Program are to understand uses of hematopoietic cells for regenerative medicine or immune-based therapy, including for malignancy or infection, and to improve treatments and outcomes for those individuals who have been exposed to radiation or other chemicals that are toxic to marrow. In these cases, exposure data, organ injury data, treatment data, and outcomes data are collected.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Any recipient of an unrelated or related donor or autologous HC transplant (includes cells collected from peripheral blood, bone marrow or cord blood) or any recipient of cellular therapy in a CIBMTR center is eligible to participate in the Research Database. This includes adults with and without decision making capacity, and children. Individual with Marrow Toxic Injury Eligibility Criteria In the event of a radiation exposure accident, the NMDP has a radiation injury treatment network, whose purpose is to collect data to understand the outcomes of patients treated under these circumstances. Any individual who is treated for a marrow toxic injury at a center participating in the NMDP's Radiation Injury Treatment Network (RITN) is eligible to participate in the Research Database. This includes adults with and without decision making capacity, and children. Eligible individuals may have received supportive care only, growth factor support, HC transplant or other appropriate medical treatment for marrow toxic injury. Treatments applied are at the discretion of the care facility, and are not determined by the NMDP or CIBMTR. Unrelated Donor Eligibility Criteria All donors registered on the NMDP Registry who have been requested to donate a product for a recipient are eligible to participate in the Research Database.</criteria>
