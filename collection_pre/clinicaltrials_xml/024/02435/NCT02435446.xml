	<brief_summary>Computed tomography scan (CT) is routinely used for the diagnosis and the pre-operative assessment of otosclerosis. The cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a imaging technique with reduced irradiating and, therefore, could replace the CT. In this study, a CBCT will be proposed to all patients undergoing a CT exam for the diagnosis and/or the pre-operative assessment of an otosclerosis. The results of the CBCT will be compared to those of the CT scan.</brief_summary>
