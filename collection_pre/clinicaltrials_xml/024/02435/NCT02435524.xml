	<brief_summary>The time between birth and age 24 months provides a unique opportunity to impact the long-term health and development of children through improved infant and young child feeding practices. In Burkina Faso, the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding is currently around 25% in infants younger than six months. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the Alive &amp; Thrive intervention package, consisting of interpersonal counselling and community mobilisation activities, can increase the exclusive breastfeeding rate among infants younger than six months to at least 50% using a cluster randomised design.</brief_summary>
