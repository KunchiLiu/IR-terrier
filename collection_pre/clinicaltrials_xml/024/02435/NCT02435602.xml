	<brief_title>The Role of Chromoendoscopy in the Early Detection of Esophageal Cancer in Patients With Prior Head and Neck Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with head and neck cancers have an increased risk for developing an esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Small, superficial, curable lesions are difficult to diagnose using only white light endoscopy. To improve detection chromoendoscopy is recommended. In this project patients are divided into two groups based on received chromoendoscopy (NBI versus Lugol). The results of two methods will be compare regarding positive predictive value to establish usage of chromoendoscopy in early detection of ESCC.</detailed_description>
