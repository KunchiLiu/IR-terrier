	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter, two arm, phase II study to evaluate treatment compliance and change in serum ferritin of a deferasirox granule formulation and a deferasirox DT formulation in children and adolescents aged ≥ 2 and &lt; 18 years at enrollment with any transfusion-dependent anemia requiring chelation therapy due to iron overload, to demonstrate the effect of improved compliance on iron burden. Randomization will be stratified by age groups (2 to &lt;10 years, 10 to &lt;18 years) and prior iron chelation therapy (Yes/ No). There will be two study phases which include a 1 year core phase where patients will be randomized to a 48 week treatment period to either Deferasirox DT or granules, and an optional extension phase where all patients will receive the granules up to 5 years. Patients who demonstrated benefit to granules or DT in the core phase, and/or express the wish to continue in the optional extension phase on granules, will be offered this possibility until there is local access to the new formulation (granules or FCT) or up to 5 years, whichever occurs first.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Written informed consent/assent before any studyspecific procedures. Consent will be obtained from parent(s) or legal guardians. Investigators will also obtain assent of patients according to local guidelines. Male and female children and adolescents aged ≥ 2 and &lt; 18 years. [France: Male and female children and adolescent aged ≥ 2 and &lt; 18 years old, however children aged ≥ 2 and ≤ 6years can be enrolled only when deferoxamine treatment is contraindicated or inadequate in these patients as per investigator decision. Applicable to core phase only. Once in the core phase patients can turn 18 years and still be considered eligible, also for participation in the optional extension phase. Any transfusiondependent anemia associated with iron overload requiring iron chelation therapy and with a history of transfusion of approximately 20 PRBC units and a treatment goal to reduce iron burden (300mL PRBC = 1 unit in adults whereas 4 ml/kg PRBC is considered 1 unit for children). Serum ferritin &gt; 1000 ng/mL, measured at screening Visit 1 and screening Visit 2 (the mean value will be used for eligibility criteria). Patient has to have participated and completed the 48 weeks core phase treatment as per protocol (For optional extension phase eligibility only). Patient needs to meet all the eligibility criteria (inclusion and exclusion) as defined in the core phase at Visit 17 (For optional extension phase eligibility only). Creatinine clearance below the contraindication limit in the locally approved prescribing information (using Schwartz formula) at screening visit 1 or screening visit 2. Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 xULN at screening measured at screening Visit 1 and or screening Visit 2 ALT and/or AST &gt; 3.0 x ULN at screening visit 1 or screening visit 2. (Criterion no longer applicable, removed as part of Amendment 1): Prior iron chelation therapy. Liver disease with severity of ChildPugh class B or C. Significant proteinuria as indicated by a urinary protein/creatinine ratio &gt; 0.5 mg/mg in a second morning urine sample at screening Visit 1 or screening Visit 2. Patients with significant impaired gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of oral deferasirox (e.g. ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome or small bowel resection). Other protocoldefined Inclusion/Exclusion may apply.</criteria>
