	<detailed_description>As part of normal clinical care, subjects will undergo peripheral blood draws and biopsies for disease assessment of their cancer. In cases of hematological malignancies, bone marrow aspiration &amp; biopsy are routinely performed. As part of this project, the following will be done to the samples collected and with clinical outcomes data: - donate peripheral blood specimens whenever blood is already being drawn for clinical purposes. - donate bone marrow aspiration samples whenever a bone marrow aspiration procedure is already being done for clinical purposes. - allow the investigators to perform gene mutation profiling. - allow the investigators to study gene mutation results. - allow the investigators to perform pharmacogenetic profiling. - allow the investigators to study pharmacogenetic profiles. - allow the investigators to examine chromosome copy number variations. - allow the investigators to examine genomic methylation. - allow the investigators to quantify metabolomics/cytokines.</detailed_description>
