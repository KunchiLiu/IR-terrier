	<brief_summary>A randomized controlled trial of 12-month duration to compare gingival margin location, buccal horizontal ridge dimensions, and interproximal crestal bone levels following two surgical approaches for immediate placement of implants in the esthetic zone: one involving flap elevation and another using a flapless protocol.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Esthetic Outcomes of Single Immediate Implant Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the test group, the implant will be placed according to standard protocol at a position engaging the palatal wall without elevation of a mucoperiosteal flap. In the control group, intrasulcular incisions will be carried out from one tooth distal to one tooth mesial to the extraction site and full thickness flaps will be elevated with periosteal elevator, including the papillae. The implant will be placed according to standard protocol at a position engaging the palatal wall, and the flaps will be sutured using a combination of interrupted and mattress sutures. In both groups, temporary restorations will be delivered immediately after implant placement provided that the implant shows primary stability and has engaged in the bone with an insertion torque of 25Ncm or more (Norton, 2004). In case of a lower insertion torque, the protocol will be abandoned, a cover screw will be placed, and a two stage implant protocol will be followed. All patients will be advised to receive a permanent restoration 6 months after surgery, if the implant is deemed to be successful (Misch et al., 2008).</detailed_description>
