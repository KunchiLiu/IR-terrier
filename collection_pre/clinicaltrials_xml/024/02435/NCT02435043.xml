	<brief_title>A Trial of Nature-based Post-stroke Fatigue Rehabilitation (NASTRU)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients randomized to the intervention undergo a rehabilitation program in groups up to 8 patients in an especially designed garden at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Alnarp. The intervention is grounded in environmental psychology and occupational therapy, supported by a multimodal rehabilitation team that utilizes the garden/nature for sensory stimulation, body awareness, meaningful occupations and nature experiences. The enrollment of 101 patients (51 intervention; 50 control) was completed on August 2014. Follow-up is on-going, with assessments by examiner blinded to treatment group, at end of intervention period, 8 months, and 14 months after randomization. A parallel study with qualitative in-depth interviews in a subset of patients, who were randomized to the intervention group, as well as the staff, is also ongoing.</detailed_description>
