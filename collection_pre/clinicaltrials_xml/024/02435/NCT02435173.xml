	<brief_summary>This study is designed to explore CDZ173, a selective PI3Kδ inhibitor, in patients with genetically activated PI3Kδ, i.e., patients with APDS/PASLI. The study consists of two parts. Part I is the open label part designed to establish the safety and pharmacokinetics of CDZ173 in the target population, as well as to select the optimal dose to be tested in part II. Part II is designed to assess efficacy and safety of CDZ173 in this population.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>patients who have a documented APDS/PASLIassociated genetic PI3K delta mutation study patients must have nodal and/or extranodal lymphoproliferation and corresponding clinical findings and manifestations compatible with APDS/PASLI such as a history of repeated otosinopulmonary infections and/or organ dysfunction (e.g., lung, liver). Any medically significant disease or condition that is unrelated to APDS/PASLI Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
