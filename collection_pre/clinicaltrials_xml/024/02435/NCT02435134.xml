	<brief_summary>Hip internal rotation range of motion (HIRROM) assessment is performed to assess the mobility of the hip. The assessment is typically done manually (manual testing), which induces large variability in the results between and within testers. An initial version of an examination chair (EC1) was recently developed with the aim to minimize the variability of testing results for HIRROM assessments. A new version of the examination chair (EC2) has been implemented in order to individualize the testing protocol and will be validated in this study.</brief_summary>
