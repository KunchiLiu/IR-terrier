	<brief_summary>In recent years, an anatomical connection of suboccipital muscle fibers to the dura has been found in pathological studies. The physiologic function of these fibers is still unknown. Using Magnetic Resonance Tomography (MRI), this study will investigate whether these fibers undergo changes in patients suffering from primary chronic neck pain. In addition, the biomechanical parameters of neck movements in these patients will be correlated with the imaging findings.</brief_summary>
