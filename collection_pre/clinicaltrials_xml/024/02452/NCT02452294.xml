Patient has anxiety ≥ CTCAE grade 3 13.

Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive hCG laboratory test (&gt; 5 mIU/mL). Patients with elevated hCG at baseline that is judged to be related to the tumor are eligible if hCG levels do not show the expected doubling when repeated 57 days later, or pregnancy has been ruled out by vaginal ultrasound 17. Patient who does not apply highly effective contraception during during the study and through the duration as defined below after the final dose of study treatment: a. Sexually active males should use a condom during intercourse while taking drug and for 16 weeks after the final dose of study treatment and should not father a child in this period, but may be recommended to seek advice on conservation of sperm. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid. b. Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study and through at least 4 weeks after the final dose of study treatment c. Highly effective contraception is defined as either: i. Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. [Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception]. ii. Female sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment iii. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate postvasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). [For female study subjects, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient] iv. Use a combination of the following (both a+b): 1. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) 2. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/ film/ cream/vaginal suppository. 3. Note: Hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, and implanted) are not allowed as buparlisib decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Women are considered postmenopausal and not of childbearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. For women with therapyinduced amenorrhea, oophorectomy or serial measurements of FSH and/or estradiol are needed to ensure postmenopausal status. NOTE: Ovarian radiation or treatment with a luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone (LHRH) agonist (goserelin acetate or leuprolide acetate) is not permitted for induction of ovarian suppression. 18.
