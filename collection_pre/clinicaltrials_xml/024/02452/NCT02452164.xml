	<brief_summary>This is a one-center clinical study carried out in Turku, Finland. The study patients will be randomly allocated to one of the two parallel study groups (teaching group and control group). The hypothesis is that the diagnostic quality of tympanic membrane imagines is better when parents have been taught to conduct middle ear examination with a cellphone otoscope (CellScopeOTO) as compared to no teaching. Furthermore, this study aims at evaluating the diagnostic feasibility of cellphone otoscopy.</brief_summary>
