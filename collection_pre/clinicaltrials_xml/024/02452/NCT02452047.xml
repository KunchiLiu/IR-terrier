	<brief_summary>The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of imipenem+cilastatin/relebactam (MK-7655A) versus colistimethate sodium + imipenem+cilastatin in the treatment of imipenem-resistant bacterial infections. Infections evaluated in the study will be hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP), ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP), complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI), and complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Hospitalization that requires treatment with IV antibiotic therapy for a new, persistent or progressing bacterial infection involving at least 1 of 3 primary infection types (HABP, VABP, cIAI, or cUTI) Positive culture data from the primary infectionsite specimen collected within 1 week of study entry. At least one of the suspected causative pathogens from the specimen meets all of the following: 1) identified as a Gramnegative bacterium, 2) cultureconfirmed imipenem resistance (and colistin resistance for Group 3 only), 3) cultureconfirmed susceptibility to imipenem/relebactam and to colistin (for Groups 1 and 2 only) Not of reproductive potential, or of reproductive potential and agrees to avoid becoming pregnant or impregnating a partner by complying with one of the following: 1) practice abstinence, or 2) use of acceptable contraception during heterosexual activity Concurrent infection that would interfere with evaluation of the response to the study antibiotics Received treatment with any form of systemic colistin for &gt;24 hours within 72 hours before initiation of study drug (for Groups 1 and 2 only) HABP or VABP caused by an obstructive process cUTI which meets any of the following: 1) complete obstruction of any portion of the urinary tract, 2) known ileal loop, 3) intractable vesicoureteral reflux, 4) presence of an indwelling urinary catheter which cannot be removed at study entry History of serious allergy, hypersensitivity, or any serious reaction to listed antibiotics (perprotocol) Female who is pregnant or is expecting to conceive (or a male partner of a female who is expecting to conceive), is breastfeeding, or plans to breastfeed before completion of the study Anticipated treatment with any of the following during the study: valproic acid or divalproex sodium, or concomitant systemic (e.g. IV, oral or inhaled) antimicrobial agents with known Gramnegative bacterial coverage Currently undergoing hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis Participated or anticipates participating in any other clinical study involving administration of investigational medication up to 30 days before screening or during the course of the trial Concurrent endocarditis, osteomyelitis, meningitis, prosthetic joint infection, disseminated fungal infection, or active pulmonary tuberculosis</criteria>
