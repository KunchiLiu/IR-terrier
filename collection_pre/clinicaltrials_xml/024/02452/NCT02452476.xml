	<brief_summary>A multicenter, double blind, randomized, single dose, active-controlled study to investigate the efficacy and safety of synthetic surfactant (CHF 5633) in comparison to porcine surfactant (Poractant alfa, Curosurf ®) in the treatment of preterm neonates with respiratory distress syndrome. Main objectives of this study are to investigate the short term efficacy profile of CHF 5633 vs. porcine surfactant (Poractant Alfa, Curosurf®) in terms of reduced oxygen requirement and ventilatory support and to evaluate the mid-term efficacy profile in terms of reduced incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and mortality/BPD rate at 36 weeks post menstrual age (PMA), mortality rate at 28 days and 36 weeks PMA, RDS-associated mortality through 14 days of age and other major co-morbidities of prematurity. Inclusion criteria are: Written parental informed consent, inborn preterm neonates of either sex with a gestational age of 24+0 weeks up to 29+6 weeks, clinical course consistent with RDS, requirement of endotracheal surfactant administration within 24 hours from birth, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ≥0.30 for babies 24+0 to 26+6 weeks and FiO2 ≥0.35 for babies 27+0 to 29+6 weeks to maintain SpO2 between 88-95%.</brief_summary>
