	<brief_title>Different Acupoints Compatibility Difference of the Effect of Treatment of the Diabetic Gastroparesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order to establish a spectrum of acupoints compatibility of the law, is clear about the factors affecting the compatibility effect of acupoints, the formation of strong operability of acupoints compatibility optimization evaluation method, the project choice of the clinical acupuncture and moxibustion have curative effect of diabetic gastroparesis as the breakthrough point of the study, carried out clinical multi-center RCT research, through objective and scientific evaluation method, comparing the effect of different acupoints compatibility. Diabetic gastroparesis in clinical common disease, frequently-occurring disease, acupuncture curative effect is distinct, disease diagnosis, curative effect evaluation standard. Previous clinical data also show that the diabetic gastroparesis is acupuncture clinical diseases. This project by diabetic gastroparesis as the research object, research to better guide clinical practice, improve the clinical curative effect, promote acupuncture of the inheritance and innovation, promote scientification of acupuncture and moxibustion, modernization and internationalization, and will have broad prospect of application and significant scientific research value.</detailed_description>
