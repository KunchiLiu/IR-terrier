	<brief_summary>Urinary incontinence is defined according to the International Continence Society as any involuntary loss of urine, which may bring several negative consequences on women's lives, and among incontinent women, about 50% have urinary incontinence, 30% mixed and 20% emergency. The overactive bladder present in urge incontinence and mixed cause significant impacts on people's lives and has a prevalence of 16.5% in the US population. Behavioral therapies, exercises the pelvic muscles and drugs are the main forms of treatment. Drug therapy using drugs which are not specific for the bladder and are associated with many unwanted systemic side effects. The results obtained by researchers in several countries using conservative techniques in the treatment of patients with urinary incontinence are encouraging and this study aims to evaluate carefully and systematically the effectiveness of tibial stimulation technique. Importantly, also, that conservative techniques have lower cost than the surgical treatment and have virtually no side effects as most of the drugs used in the pharmacological treatment of female urinary incontinence.</brief_summary>
