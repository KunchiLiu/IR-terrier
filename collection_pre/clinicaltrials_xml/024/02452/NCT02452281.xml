	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to see if the combination of HSPPC-96 and ipilimumab is safe and effective in the treatment of advanced melanoma. HSPPC-96 is an investigational vaccine created from tissue from the patient's tumor. The vaccine is designed to capture the cancer's "fingerprint." Injection of the vaccine may cause the patient's immune system to recognize and attack any cells with the specific cancer fingerprint. Ipilimumab is a drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma that boosts immune response.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study to Evaluate the Effects of a Vaccine (HSPPC-96) Combined With Ipilimumab in Patients With Advanced Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, open label, single-center, phase I-II trial to determine the safety, feasibility and immunogenicity of combination treatment of HSPPC-96 and ipilimumab in patients with therapeutically unresectable Stage III or Stage IV malignant melanoma. The main purpose of this study is to assess whether the administration of the combination of ipilimumab and HSPPC-96 is safe. The rationale for combining the two treatments resides in their respective roles on the immune system as described below and based on the clinical experience collected so far. HSPPC-96 is able to initiate a tumor specific immune response that ipilimumab could theoretically amplify by blocking a checkpoint that naturally down-regulates T cells.</detailed_description>
