	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the differential efficacy of two ways of applying homework assignments in the treatment of Adjustment Disorders: 1) using an Internet-based emotional regulation therapy system (TEO) and 2) in the traditional way (using reading and audio materials). The principal hypothesis is that both treatment conditions (TEO and Traditional) will show a similar efficacy. All participants will improve significantly on all outcome measures, regardless the type of homework assigned (TEO or Traditional) with no differences between them.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Two Ways of Applying Homework Assignments in the Treatment of Adjustment Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adjustment Disorders (AD) are very prevalent in primary care and hospital settings. The available data indicate that the percentage of adults suffering from AD in primary care ranges from 5% to 21%. Furthermore, AD is an important public mental health problem in economic terms. Very frequently the distress and activity deterioration associated to this problem result in a decrease of work performance, causing a high percentage of sick leaves. However, nowadays there are no evidence-based psychological treatments for this problem, and only general treatment guidelines are available for this problem. For these reason, a Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment (CBT) supported by Virtual Reality (VR; EMMA system) was developed and has already shown its utility to treat this disorder. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are useful tools for offer and improve therapeutic services. VR offers a safe and flexible environment in where the person can explore and manage their problems in a controlled and gradual way. Computerized programs allow reducing the contact time between therapist and patient, so it can reach patients who would not receive treatment otherwise. ICTs have been mainly used within the therapeutic context; specifically many studies have been centered on how to use the technologies to deliver the treatment. As far as the investigators know, no study analyzes the ICTs contribution in the homework assignments field. CBT approach provides a crucial role to homework assignments because it allows reinforcing and supporting the patients along the therapy. More studies examining the utility of the application of ICTs for the treatment of AD are needed. Furthermore, the application of the homework assignments component through the Internet is also relevant. It is necessary an adaptive and flexible system that allows adjusting the therapeutic homework on every patient's characteristics and needs, attending to the specific meaning of his/her problem. This would be a way to facilitate the patient's treatment adherence and in consequence improve the effectiveness of the AD treatment. In the present study the differential efficacy of two ways of applied homework assignments for the treatment of AD is explored with a between subject randomized controlled trial. After the evaluation phase, all participants receive a 6-8 sessions weekly CBT program. After each treatment session, they practice their assigned homework (using TEO or in the Traditional way) and they assess several clinical variables. After treatment completion, a post-treatment assessment will be carried out as well as follow-up assessments at 6- and 12-month.</detailed_description>
