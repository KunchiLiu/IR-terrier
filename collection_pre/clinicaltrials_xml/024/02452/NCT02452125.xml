	<detailed_description>Subjects will be asked to sit and rest for 10 minutes. Blood pressure will be taken in this resting position after the 10 minutes.

They will be instructed to use it according to manufacturer's directions and remain chewing the gum for 30 minutes. The subject will remain in a seated position and BP and HR will be recorded every 5 minutes for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes the gum will be removed and subjects will still have HR and BP monitored in the seated position for another hour every 10 minutes. All values will be compared to pretreatment values. After 120 minutes if the subject is non-symptomatic, they can go home.</detailed_description>
