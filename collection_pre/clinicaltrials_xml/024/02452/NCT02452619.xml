	<brief_summary>In our institute there is ongoing treatment of brain injury patients with Hyperbaric oxygen therapy. These patients undergo neuro-cognitive function tests in addition to brain imaging studies before and after treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the perfusion and microstructure changes seen in MRI in addition to the cognitive tests before and after the treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI Brain Changes Induced by Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy in Brain Injury Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Retrospective analysis of patients suffering from chronic neuro-cognitive damage due to TBI treated at Sagol center for hyperbaric medicine and research, Assaf Harofeh Medical Center, Israel Patients included if they had at least two perfusion MRIs + DTI and two neurocognitive tests, before and after Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT). The study was approved by the institutional review board of the hospital. Patients are treated with 50-70 daily hyperbaric sessions, 5 days per week. Each session consists of 60 minutes exposure to 100% oxygen at 1.5 ATA. All patients that underwent MRI before and after HBOT. The MRI protocol included DSC, DCE, DTI, FLAIR, T2 and SWI. MRI scans sequences parameters: * DSC: 50 T2*-weighted gradient-echo echo planar imaging (EPI) volumes were acquired, 2 repetitions before a bolus injection of Gadolinium-DTPA (Gd-DTPA), 48 repetitions after injection of Gd-DTPA. Sequence parameters: TR=2,300 ms, TE= 40ms, flip angle = 30Â°, voxel size = 1.8 x1.8, Matrix = 128x128, No. of slices = 25, Slice thickness = 3.9 mm. - DCE: three T1 weighted Fast Low Angle SHot (FLASH) volumes were acquired with different flip angles (2, 7 and 15 degrees) followed by 70 dynamic T1 weighted FLASH volumes with flip angle of 15 degrees after bolus injection of Gd-DTPA. Sequence parameters: before injection: TR=4.09, after injection - TR=4.86 ms, TE= 1.76 ms, Voxel size = 1.5x1.5, Matrix = 192X192, No. of slices = 26, Slice thickness = 3.5mm. - DTI: 30 diffusion weighted images were scanned with different gradient directions (b=1000) and one volume without diffusion weighting, with the following parameters: TR=10,300 ms, TE=89 ms, Voxel size = 1.8X1.8, Matrix = 128 X 128, No. of slices = 63, Slice thickness = 2.2mm</detailed_description>
