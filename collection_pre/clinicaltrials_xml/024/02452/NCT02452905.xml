	<brief_summary>Bronchiolitis is an extremely common cause of respiratory illness in infants caused by viral infection.This study evaluates whether treatment with nitazoxanide (NTZ) reduces the duration and severity of respiratory symptoms caused by bronchiolitis. Half of the participants will receive NTZ while the other half will receive a placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Finding Better Treatment of Bronchiolitis: A Clinical Trial of Oral Nitazoxanide for the Treatment of Bronchiolitis in Infants Presenting to Hospital Emergency Departments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is a novel anti-infective medication that is licenced for use in the United States (US), including in children and infants for treating some infections. It is in the thiazolide class of antimicrobials and has been shown to have in vitro and/or clinical activity against a broad spectrum of pathogens, including a range of viruses, parasites and bacteria. This study will determine whether NTZ is an effective empirical treatment for bronchiolitis. It will also help us to understand what effect NTZ has on the amount of virus present and how viral load changes over the course of the disease. If this study shows that NTZ is a useful treatment, then a larger study will be conducted enrolling infants that present to primary care facilities.</detailed_description>
