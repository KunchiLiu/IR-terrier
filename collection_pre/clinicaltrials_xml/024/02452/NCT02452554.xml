	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well lorvotuzumab mertansine works in treating younger patients with Wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, pleuropulmonary blastoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), or synovial sarcoma that has returned or that does not respond to treatment. Antibody-drug conjugates, such as lorvotuzumab mertansine, are created by attaching an antibody (protein used by the body's immune system to fight foreign or diseased cells) to an anti-cancer drug. The antibody is used to recognize tumor cells so the anti-cancer drug can kill them.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lorvotuzumab Mertansine in Treating Younger Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Wilms Tumor, Rhabdomyosarcoma, Neuroblastoma, Pleuropulmonary Blastoma, Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor, or Synovial Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the efficacy of IMGN901 (lorvotuzumab mertansine) in Wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma and other cluster of differentiation (CD)56-expressing tumors such as pleuropulmonary blastoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) and synovial sarcoma. II. To determine the tolerability of the adult recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of IMGN901 administered as an intravenous infusion, administered on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle, to children with refractory Wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, pleuropulmonary blastoma, MPNST, or synovial sarcoma. III. To define and describe the toxicities of IMGN901 administered on this schedule. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To correlate tumor response with tumor CD56+ expression. II. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of IMGN901 in children with refractory cancer, including an assessment of impact on circulating CD56+ peripheral blood cells. OUTLINE: Patients receive lorvotuzumab mertansine intravenously (IV) over 1-1.5 hours on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 17 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.</detailed_description>
