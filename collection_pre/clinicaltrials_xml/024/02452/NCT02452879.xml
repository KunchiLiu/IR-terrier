	<detailed_description>Patient registry: Participants experiencing overactive bladder will be recruited from hospital outpatients and clinic-community. the diagnosis was made by the urologists. the random number table was generated by the Computer. Sample size: According to the preliminary experiment combined the literature. Sample size is based on the primary outcome. The first step: one-tailed test: the electroacupuncture group vs Solifenacin group is 79.5% VS 54.8%( α=0.05, β=0.20, n=51). The second step: two-tailed test :the electroacupuncture group vs Placebo group is 54.5% VS 20.9%,(α=0.05, β=0.20, n=37). To combine the first and second step, 51 cases in each group are needed. Allowing for a 10% dropout, 57 cases in each group are needed. So we set the sample size is 60. Quality control 1. Strict training on staff participating in the trial. 2. Rigorous control of the process of randomization. 3. Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. 4. Strict outcome assessors and statisticians. 5. The standard of the drugs, acupuncture apparatus, inspection equipment are consistant. 6.
