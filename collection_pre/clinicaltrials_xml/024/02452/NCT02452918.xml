	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 4, multicenter, open-label safety study of a single 1200 mg intravenous (IV) infusion of oritavancin in adult subjects on chronic warfarin with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (ABSSSI) suspected or proven to be caused by Gram-positive pathogens. An additional group of patients with ABSSSI, who are not on concomitant warfarin therapy, will also be enrolled to obtain information regarding the potential for antibody production following a single dose of oritavancin administration in patients.</brief_summary>
