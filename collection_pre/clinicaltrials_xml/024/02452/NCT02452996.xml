	<brief_title>Safety Study of GNbAC1 Monoclonal Antibody in Healthy Male Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The monoclonal antibody, GNbAC1, targets the envelope protein (Env) of the human endogenous retrovirus (HERV), also called multiple sclerosis associated retrovirus (MSRV), which is considered as a critical factor in the development of multiple sclerosis. This study will assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of GNbAC1 following single ascending doses (6, 18, and 36 mg/kg) administered via IV infusion.</detailed_description>
