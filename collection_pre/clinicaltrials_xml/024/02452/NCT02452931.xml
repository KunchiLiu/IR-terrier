	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study of Leuprolide Acetate Injectable Suspension in the Treatment of Central Precocious Puberty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Leuprolide acetate is a GnRH agonist that inhibits pituitary gonadotropin secretion by binding to the GnRH receptors and blocking downstream hormone synthesis. The steady decrease in hormone synthesis (LH and FSH) leads to a suppression of testicular and ovarian steroidogenesis. In children with CPP, this steady decrease in hormone synthesis disrupts the progression of puberty.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Females age 2 to 8 years (inclusive) or males age 2 to 9 years (inclusive) Confirmed diagnosis of CPP within 12 months of Baseline Visit (Day 0) but have not received prior GnRH agonist treatment for CPP Pubertaltype LH response following an abbreviated GnRHa stimulation test before treatment initiation Clinical evidence of puberty, defined as Tanner stage ≥ 2 for breast development in females or testicular volume ≥ 4 mL in males Difference between bone age (Greulich and Pyle method) and chronological age ≥ 1 year Gonadotropinindependent (peripheral) precocious puberty Prior or current GnRH treatment for CPP Prior or current therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate, growth hormone or insulinlike growth factor1 (IGF1) Diagnosis of short stature (ie, 2.25 standard deviations (SD) below the mean height for age) Known history of seizures, epilepsy, and/or central nervous system disorders that may be associated with seizures or convulsions Any other medical condition or serious intercurrent illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may make it undesirable for the subject to participate in the study</criteria>
