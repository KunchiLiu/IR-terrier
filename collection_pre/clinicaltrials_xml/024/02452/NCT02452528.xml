	<brief_title>Study of ARC-520 in Patients With HBeAg (Hepatitis B e Antigen) Positive Chronic Hepatitis B Virus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-dose study of ARC-520 in combination with entecavir or tenofovir administered to patients with HBeAg positive and immune active chronic HBV infection, who have been receiving ongoing entecavir or tenofovir therapy. Patients who have signed an Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee-approved informed consent, and have met all of the protocol eligibility criteria will continue receiving daily oral entecavir (0.5-1.0 mg/day) or daily oral tenofovir (300 mg/day) and either ARC-520 at 1.0 mg/kg or placebo for 3 total doses administered once every four weeks. Patients will undergo the following evaluations at regular intervals during the study: medical history, physical examinations, vital sign measurements (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature), weight, adverse events assessment (AEs), echocardiograms, 12-lead ECGs, liver fibrosis testing, concomitant medication assessment, blood sample collection for hematology, coagulation, chemistry, Pharmacokinetic (PK) and exploratory Pharmacodynamic (PD) measures, HBV serology, Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) testing (post-menopausal females) and pregnancy testing for females of childbearing potential. Patients will be monitored for a total of 21 weeks. Clinically significant changes including AEs will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or until the patient is lost to follow-up.</detailed_description>
