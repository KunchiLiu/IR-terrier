	<brief_title>Prospective Safety and Tolerability Assessment of a Cardiovascular Health Dietary Supplement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension is an important overall risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease in the United States, and is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, and cardiovascular-related mortality with advancing age. Based on population based studies and clinical trials, both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) elevations are continuous, strong and independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The product being studies is a cardiovascular health dietary supplement that has been commercially available since 1993. It is currently sold to healthcare practitioners as well as directly to consumers. Some healthcare providers use the product as part of a plan to treat high blood pressure in their patients. This is the first study collecting prospective safety data on this product.</detailed_description>
