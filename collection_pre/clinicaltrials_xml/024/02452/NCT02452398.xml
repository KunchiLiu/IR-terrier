	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation of Hair Removal and Permanent Hair Reduction for Skin Types VI Using Intense Pulsed Light</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One hundred and twenty (120) subjects who are Fitzpatrick Skin Type V-VI, and have a suitable treatment area for hair removal will be evaluated in this study. Each subject will receive six treatments at four to six week intervals upon re-growth of hair and return for follow-up visits at one, three and six months after the last treatment. Measurement Equipment Standard High Resolution Digital Camera Labels for hair count Customized hair count sticker templates will be placed directly on the skin and the hairs in this window will be counted at specific visits during the study as detailed in section. Study Procedures Each subject will participate in the study for a period of at least 11 months. The study is anticipated to be completed within twelve months. Test spots Up to 3 test spots will be performed in the selected treatment area to determine the optimal parameters / setting. Treatment The treatment areas are divided into 3 groups. Each Subjects will be allocated to one of the following groups:: - Two small anatomical areas (right and left axillae and double sided bikini line) or; - One double sided large area (right and left thighs) or; - One large area (whole back / abdomen) Based on the mild nature of treatment, anesthesia is not required. Before starting treatment apply a layer of conductive gel to the treatment area. After applying the conductive gel, locate the applicator in close contact, perpendicular to the skin with no pressure applied. Pressing the applicator will fire the IPL pulse. In order to ensure full coverage of the treatment area applicator placement should overlap approximately 1/3 of the previously treated skin. Post-treatment Instructions Cold packs may be placed on the treated area for post treatment cooling. Subjects should be aware that post treatment erythema, edema and some discomfort of the treated areas are possible and should not be a cause for concern. They may also experience some purpura in the treated areas which would be expected to resolve within several days.</detailed_description>
