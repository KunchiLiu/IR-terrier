	<brief_summary>Implantable venous access port infections are mainly due to coagulase negative staphylococci and may be managed by antibiotic lock therapy with retention of the port. Most of the time a vancomycin lock is used. Experimental data show that vancomycin may be poorly effective in eradicating the staphylococcal biofilm in the port. Another disadvantage of Vancomycin-containing lock solution is the occurrence of resistant organisms and the risk of catheter occlusion. Ethanol-containing lock solution is highly effective in vitro and does not expose to the risk of emergence resistance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized, Multicenter, Double-blind, Vancomycin-controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Ethanol Lock Solution for the Curative Treatment of Implantable Venous Access Port Infection Due to Coagulase-negative Staphylococci</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type of study: multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled clinical trial. Number of centers: 9 French centers in Auvergne and Rhône-Alpes regions Medical product Ethanol 40% + Enoxaparine 400UI/ml Versus Vancomycin 5 mg/ml + Héparine 2500UI/ml Patients Patients eligible for inclusion will be randomized to one of the two groups: - Experimental group: 90 patients will receive 10 injections of ethanol lock solution in implantable venous access port during the first 10 days of the study. - Control group: 90 patients will receive 10 injections of vancomycin lock solution in implantable venous access port during the first 10 days of the study. - For each group, in case of bacteraemia, the lock therapy is associated with a systemic antibiotic therapy using another venous line and optimized by a specialist in infectious diseases. Study Performance Patients will be assessed at baseline D0, 3 days (D3), 10 days (D10), 14 weeks (W14) after D0 as follows: Visit 1 (D0 - baseline): - Signature of an informed consent form. - Demographic and clinical characteristics (sex, age, disease associated with implantable venous access port, implantable venous access port infection data, bacteraemia data) Days 1 to 10 - Injection of ethanol or vancomycin lock solution in implantable venous access port - Ethanolemia 30 minutes after injection, on first day - Side effects evaluation Visit 2 (D3) and Visit 3 (D10) - Side effects evaluation - Blood culture - Bacteraemia data (antibiotic therapy modification) Phone contact each week from week 2 to week 13 End Visit (W14) - Side effects evaluation - Blood culture - Bacteraemia data (antibiotic therapy modification)</detailed_description>
