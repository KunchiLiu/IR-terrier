	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is: - to evaluate the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR), as defined as complete disappearance of invasive tumor in breast and axillary nodes. - to estimate the percentage of clinical objective responses (cOR) (complete plus partial) in the breast, as assessed by ultrasonography (US) - to estimate the percentage of breast conservative surgery - to evaluate the safety profile - To perform correlative biomarker analyses</detailed_description>
