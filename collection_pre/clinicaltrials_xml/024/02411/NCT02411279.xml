	<brief_summary>Heart failure (HF) is a serious chronic disease with frequent readmissions, some of which can be prevented by early action. The management of HF is complex: long, often difficult and costly. In France, nearly one million people suffer from HF and 120,000 new cases are diagnosed every year. With the aging population, this number will continue to evolve and become a real public health problem. Within 10 to 20 years ahead, WHO projects that heart failure in either the 3 most common diseases in industrialized countries. The objective of the project is to test an intelligent platform for monitoring at home, using non-intrusive sensors, patients with heart failure, particularly those with stage II and III NYHA. It will assist the medical automating the processing of information from these sensors to detect and report an early stage risk situations. Patient monitoring, by a system of telemedicine tools associated with motivation and education helps significantly reduce the number of days of hospitalization becomes important when the patient is hospitalized for acute HF.</brief_summary>
