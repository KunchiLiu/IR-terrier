	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out why patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have poor exercise capacity and what causes an increase in blood pressure during exercise (i.e. increased adrenaline levels, or decreased ability of blood vessels to dilate).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sympatholysis in Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) suffer from exercise intolerance and poor physical capacity which contributes to increased cardiovascular risk in this patient population. Prior studies have shown that CKD patients have an exaggerated increase in blood pressure (BP) during both static and rhythmic exercise. Such abnormal hemodynamic responses to exercise can contribute to poor physical capacity and abnormal muscle blood flow during exercise in these patients. The goals of this project are to investigate the mechanisms and potential therapies targeting the abnormal hemodynamic response during exercise in CKD by examining the roles of impaired vasodilation, and exaggerated vasoconstriction.</detailed_description>
