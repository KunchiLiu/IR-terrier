	<brief_summary>Simulation training in surgical education in Urology specialist training in flexible cystoscopy has been demonstrated a valid and efficient learning instrument. The classical setup with a medical expert introducing the novices to the theoretical background and technics of the procedure is time-consuming and expensive. Directed self-regulated simulation training (DSR) is a validated method in simulation training. The power of testing in DSR and flexible cystoscopy is to our knowledge not known. We introduced a setup in which the novices started by training in a directed self-regulated simulation training environment and informed them that they would be tested by a medical expert afterwards. The intervention group novices were given only written theoretical information and anatomical pictures. The control group were first given a classical oral theoretical introduction by a medical expert and secondly did DSR training. We tested the outcome of the intervention by a validated rating scale for flexible cystoscopy. The novices in both the control and intervention group were tested on patients prescribed a flexible cystoscopy and evaluated by a specialist in Urology. The main hypothesis was that testing in relation to DSR would result in higher scores on a validated scale when performing a flexible cystoscopy on a patient evaluated by a specialist in Urology compared to a group having a oral lecture before DSR.</brief_summary>
