	<brief_summary>The CommunityRx system generates patient-centered e-prescriptions for community services (HealtheRx) via an interface between the electronic health records (EHR) and a comprehensive community resource database. Based on a patient's diagnoses, a HealtheRx will be printed automatically at the end of the ambulatory care visit and will provide patients with a customized map and/or list of places in their community that provide health and social services as well as contact information for a local community health worker who can provide limited case management support. The CommunityRx program aims to promote: 1) better healthcare, 2) better health, and 3) lower cost. The purpose of this research is to systematically evaluate the impact of CommunityRx on health outcomes as well as health care service utilization and total cost of care for Medicaid, Medicare and other beneficiaries. The investigators hypothesize that beneficiaries who participate in the CommunityRx intervention will experience better healthcare, better health and lower total cost of care.</brief_summary>
