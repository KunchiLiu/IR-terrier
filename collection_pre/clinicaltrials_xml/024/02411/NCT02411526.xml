	<detailed_description>Approximately 75 male and female patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder on antipsychotic maintenance medication will be enrolled into the study. There will be 4 planned cohorts of 14 patients per cohort. In Cohorts 1-3, patients' planned participation in the study is for a total of approximately 22 weeks, including a Screening period of up to 35 days, and a study treatment period of 120 days (including follow-up). In Cohort 4 planned participation in the study is for a total of approximately 18 weeks including a Screening period of up to 35 days and a study treatment of 92 days (including follow-up).</detailed_description>
