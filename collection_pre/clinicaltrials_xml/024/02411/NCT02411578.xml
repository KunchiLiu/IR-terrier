	<brief_title>Mini-Dose Glucagon for Adults With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are three phases included in this study: (1) Pre-crossover Trial Pilot Phase, (2) Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) Crossover Trial Phase, and (3) Post-Crossover Trial Phase. 1. Pre-crossover Trial Pilot Phase: Prior to commencing the crossover trial, study enrollment will begin with a pilot phase for up to 6 participants to assess logistical and safety issues. Participants will have a screening visit followed by 2 weeks of home use of mini-dose glucagon to treat non-severe hypoglycemia or to prevent the development of hypoglycemia. At the completion of the 2 weeks, a clinic visit will occur. Following completion of this pilot phase, study results will be assessed to determine whether any changes in the crossover trial protocol are warranted. Participants in the pilot phase can participate in the crossover trial if eligibility criteria are met. 2. Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) Crossover Trial Phase: The Crossover Trial Phase will start with a run-in phase of up to 48 participants for 2 weeks followed by two (3-week) periods of the crossover trial. The Crossover Trial Phase will include 24 participants who complete these study periods. Participants who do not complete both periods or who do not have at least one event during both periods may be replaced. During the Crossover Trial Phase participants will be randomized into two groups: (1) Group A will use mini-dose glucagon in period 1 and oral glucose tablets in period 2 and (2) Group B will use oral glucose tablets in period 1 and mini-dose glucagon in period 2. Each group with follow the applicable treatment arm according to their randomized group. 3. Post-Crossover Trial Phase: The Post-Crossover Trial phase will commence upon completion of the second 3-week period of the Crossover Trial Phase. Participants will have a 3 week phase during which time they will decide how and when to use mini-dose glucagon or glucose tablets to treat non-severe hypoglycemia or to prevent hypoglycemia.</detailed_description>
