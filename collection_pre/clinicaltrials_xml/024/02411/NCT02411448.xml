	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ramucirumab in combination with erlotinib as compared to placebo in combination with erlotinib in participants with stage IV non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring an activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation (Del19 and L858R). Safety and tolerability of ramucirumab in combination with erlotinib will be assessed in the first portion (Part A) before proceeding to the second portion of this study (Part B).</brief_summary>

Significant bleeding disorders. Radiologically documented evidence of major blood vessel invasion or encasement by cancer. Radiographic evidence of intratumor cavitation. History of gastrointestinal perforation within last 6 months. History of bowel obstruction, inflammatory enteropathy or extensive intestinal resection. History of any arterial thrombotic event within 6 months prior to enrollment. The participant has any known significant ophthalmologic abnormalities of the surface of the eye.</criteria>
