	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators ask the question: can incentivizing smaller, less costly behaviors—like just getting yourself dressed to go to the gym—be more effective (and palatable) than incentivizing the larger goal directly?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dress for Success: Can Just Dressing for the Gym Help Going to the Gym?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To test this hypothesis, the investigators will randomly assign participants to one of three experimental conditions: (1) control, (2) dress for success (low effort), and (2) exercise for success (high effort). The investigators' hypothesis is that incentivizing a low effort, indirect/workout-related behavior (i.e., "dressing for success") will be more effective in motivating workouts than the control, despite a lack of economic incentive for the workout itself. Additionally, the investigators will compare workout levels for groups 2 and 3; if there is no difference between the two groups (or if 2 has higher exercise rates than 3), this would suggest that indirect incentives may be as effective as direct ones.</detailed_description>
