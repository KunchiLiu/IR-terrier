	<brief_title>Clinical Study to Investigate Safety and Performance of NeuRx DPS in Patients Undergoing Bilateral Lung Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a prospective, single-center feasibility study to acquire more knowledge regarding the NeuRx DPS and develop a routine in the optimal pacing of the diaphragm with this system during the weaning period from mechanical ventilation in the Intensive Care Unit in patients after bilateral lung transplant. The objectives are to evaluate the safety and technical performance of DPS by assessing: - the immediate safety and technical surgical results of implantation - the safety and tolerability of use and removal until patient discharge from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or hospital - the effects of diaphragm pacing on MV interaction, diaphragm force, fatigue resistance, and diaphragm electromyography (EMG)</detailed_description>
