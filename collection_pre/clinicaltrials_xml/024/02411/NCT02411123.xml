	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing on clinical outcomes in a group of subjects exhibiting neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety, as compared to a group of subjects with the same attributes without the guidance of PGx testing for their treatment. This study will also evaluate whether pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing can reduce adverse drug events, hospitalization rates, hospital length of stay, emergency room visits, disability, death or other serious drug side effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study to Evaluate Patient Outcomes Following Pharmacogenetic Testing of Subjects Exhibiting Neuropsychiatric Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medications are still administered by a trial and error method, which results in a substantial number of patients suffering from either a lack of benefit from drug therapy or severe side effects. Approximately 40% of all anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medications prescribed are ineffective, and patients who need to be on medication often discontinue taking their medications, which can have potentially dangerous consequences. Clinical features often fail to predict the drug response and tolerability of a patient to a prescription medication. Genetics can help guide therapeutic decisions for patients exhibiting neuropsychiatric disorders and improve patient outcomes by maximizing drug efficacy and minimizing the risk of adverse events. Genetics and drug interactions can alter both the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a multitude of drug compounds and in turn influence both the safety and efficacy of selected therapeutic regimens. Pharmacogenetic-guided therapy selection using the IDgenetix Neuropsychiatric Test Panel can enhance patient response and tolerability by facilitating the selection of the most appropriate medication at the most effective dose in the shortest possible time. In this prospective, randomized, single-blind study, new patients presenting to the clinical site with evidence of depression or anxiety as determined by a qualified clinician will be invited to participate. Study participants will be randomized to one of two groups with respect to the IDgenetix Neuropsychiatric Test Panel result: group with testing results revealed to the medical provider prior to treatment selection (Experimental Group) or group without testing results prior to treatment selection (Control Group). Participant outcomes will be measured at baseline and throughout the 4-month duration of the study.</detailed_description>
