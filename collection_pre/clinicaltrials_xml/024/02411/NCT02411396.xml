	<brief_summary>The Emergency Department has been the standard location where patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) go to seek care for the treatment of acute painful events. Vaso- Occlusive Crisis (VOC) is the most common complication of SCD, The purpose of this study is to compare patient centered outcomes for patients being treated for an uncomplicated VOC in Infusion Centers (IC) and Emergency Departments (ED) in four locations around the United States.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Patient Centered Outcomes for People With SCD in the Acute Care Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emergency Department care is marked by long delays, lack of efficacy, and conflict. A sub-specialty Infusion Center staffed by expert clinicians and delivering individualized care can improve care quality while reducing costs. The study will examine whether care provided in an Infusion Center is more patient centered and efficient than care provided in an Emergency Department for adults with SCD and uncomplicated VOC. Sites will prospectively enroll patients in VOC seen in participating centers from either the EDs or the ICs. Specific data from the acute visits (e.g. Times of arrival, time to first dose of analgesic, etc) will be captured. This study will compare: pain management, disposition of subjects (home or admission) and patient experiences of care delivery in both settings. Subjects will complete surveys/questionnaires to asses their experiences in the setting where care was provided. The four sites to participate in the study are Baltimore, Maryland (Johns Hopkins Hospital), Cleveland, Ohio (Cleveland Medical Center), Milwaukee, Wisconsin (Medical College of Wisconsin), and Baton Rouge, Louisiana (Our Lady of the Lake Hospital). A maximum of 500 subjects will participate in the study. Participants will be enrolled for 18 months.</detailed_description>
