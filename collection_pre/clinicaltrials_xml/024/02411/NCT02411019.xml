	<detailed_description>This is a follow-up study to investigate the change of immunogenicity and lesion condition in subjects with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 who have enrolled and participated GX-188E phase II trial(GX-188E_CIN3_P2). Subjects will make visits 7 times for about three years from the last visit of GX-188E phase 2 trial (GX-188E_CIN3_P2). The endpoints are to evaluate the change of immune response, involved lesion and infection status compared to that of the final visit in phase 2 trial (GX-188E_CIN3_P2).</detailed_description>
