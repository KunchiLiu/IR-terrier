	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the effects of on technique of chest physiotherapy on pulmonary function. Effects of pulmonary function will be measured by the spirometry, body plethysmography and by the multiple breath nitrogen washout technique.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Chest Physiotherapy (CPT) on Lung Clearance Index (LCI) in Non Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Bronchiectasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a before-after intervention study. Spirometry, body plethysmography and then multiple breath nitrogen washout will be measured before the application of chest physiotherapy. The chest physiotherapy technique used will be autogenic drainage during 30 minutes. A resting period of 5 minutes will be given to the participant before the following tests. Spirometry, body plethysmography and then multiple breath nitrogen washout will be measured again, in the same order, after the application of chest physiotherapy.</detailed_description>
