	<brief_summary>The investigators team had found that the presence of dynamic changes of Clopidogrel resistance are not associated with genetic factors. Currently, study on moderate doses of statins and dynamic Clopidogrel resistance has not been reported, therefore this study will observe 160 cases of open prospective secondary prevention in patients with cerebral infarction. Excluded: those patients occurs Clopidogrel resistance because of slow metabolism caused by cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C19（CYP2C19, and then observed the impact of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 （CYP3A4）-metabolized and non-cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 （CYP3A4）—metabolized statins dynamically on Clopidogrel resistance in the next 9 months, adverse events will be recorded, the metabolite of clopidogrel（H4 ）and the polymorphism of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C19 （CYP2C19）/cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 （CYP3A4）/ cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C9（CYP2C9）will be detected. Expected Result: the patients use the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4（CYP3A4）-metabolized statins will result in dynamic Clopidogrel resistance easily ,H4 levels will decline, and Clopidogrel resistance is not related to the polymorphism of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 （CYP3A4）.</brief_summary>
