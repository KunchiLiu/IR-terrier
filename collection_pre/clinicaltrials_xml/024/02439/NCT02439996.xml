	<brief_title>Different Doses of IVIG for Kawasaki Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kawasaki disease is an acute febrile illness recognized most often in young children. Coronary abnormality is the most serious complication preventable with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) administration. Various treatment regimens of IVIG have been reported.The optimal administrative doses of IVIG deserves more observations.We will conduct a multicenter, randomized, prospective trial to determine the effect of different doses of IVIG (1g/kg once, 1g/kg twice, 2g/kg once) for Kawasaki disease. The KD children will be randomly assigned to three groups and receive three doses of IVIG (1g/kg once, 1g/kg twice, 2g/kg once). Patient age, gender, white blood cell count, hemoglobin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), red blood cell specific volume (HCT) , serum albumin, the fever days,and the cost of hospital stay will be analyzed among the three groups. All the patients will be detected the 6 genes polymorphisms including ITPKC縲，ASP3縲？LA縲。LK縲：CGR2A and CD40. The final outcome is the rates of IVIG unresponsiveness and the incidence of coronary artery lesions .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Individual patient's medical file data confirmed the diagnosis of KD using the 5th revised edition of diagnostic criteria for KD, issued by the Japan Kawasaki Disease Research Committee at the 7th International Kawasaki Disease Symposium in 2002. the patients aged from 1 months to 12 years old. All included patients required to sign an informed consent form. the patients didn't receive treatment before. The patients with the application of hormone or other immunosuppressive agents; The patients didn't want to signed informed consent.</criteria>
