	<brief_summary>Development of myocardial reparative therapy for the treatment of acute ischemic cardiac disease, based on the intracoronary administration of allogeneic Cardiac Stem Cells (CSCs) to ameliorate myocardial cell death and promote cardio-regeneration. The study comprises two phases: 1. Initial dose-escalation open-label safety phase comprising 6 patients. Escalation will start with the Maximum Recommended Safe Dose (MRSD) calculated from Non-Observed Adverse Events Level (NOAEL) and it is expected to finish with the target dose (TD). There will be no placebo group for this initial phase. 2. Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled safety and efficacy phase in which the TD will be injected if the dose-escalation phase is completed successfully.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Evaluation of Intracoronary Infusion of Allogeneic Human Cardiac Stem Cells in Patients With AMI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a "First in Patient" Clinical Trial to obtain safety and efficacy results about the intracoronary administration of a suspension of allogeneic cardiac stem cells (CSCs) for the treatment of ST elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI). This clinical trial will have a first dose-escalation phase in which the safety of 10, 20 and 35 million CSCs administration will be evaluated in 6 patients. A second double-blind randomized and placebo controlled phase will be initiated, if no major safety effects are observed during the first week after cell administration. The 35 million cells dose is the one expected to be used during the randomized phase. Patients with EF&lt;45% and with infarct sizes &gt; 25% will be selected by magnetic resonance image (MRI). 49 patients will be included in the randomized phase with the aim of having 38 patients for efficacy analysis at the end of the follow up period (12 months). In this phase, patients will be randomly allocated for receiving CSCs or placebo in a 2:1 scheme. Three bioequivalent cellular batches obtained from different donors will be indistinctly used during the assay. CSCs or placebo treatment will be infused into the coronary artery responsible for the ischemic event. Placebo will be a commercial preparation of human serum albumin 5% in saline solution that will also be used for cell product reconstitution. After treatment, patients will be monitored overnight in a coronary care unit for any toxicity and discharged from hospital 24h after treatment if no adverse events are observed. Subsequent safety follow-up will be done first at day 7 after treatment and then monthly or quarterly thereafter for 12 months. In addition, efficacy evaluations will be performed by MRI and clinical parameters at 1, 6 and 12 months after treatment. Finally, cellular and humoral immunological response (screening for anti-HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) class I and class II antibodies, HLA typing, cross-matching between cells and treated patient and cytokine profiling in blood samples) will be analysed during the clinical trial.</detailed_description>

Patients presenting a STsegmentelevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) according to the universally accepted definition found in the STEMI management guide of the European Society of Cardiology Killip ≤ 2 on admission Successful primary coronary revascularization by Percutaneous Coronary Intervention PCI (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] = 3) within 12h after the onset of infarct symptoms Baremetal or drugeluting stents (DES) of second generation (including new second generation stents, e.g. biolimus, novolimus and bioreabsorbable stents) at coronary revascularization by PCI Ejection Fraction (EF) ≤45% by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This MRI will be done between day 3 and day 5 after infarction and will be used as inclusion MRI Infarct size in left ventricle (LV) tested in the screening MRI ≥25% The presence of microvascular obstruction at inclusion MRI is permitted The affected coronary artery is adequate for cells infusion at the administration time. The administration procedure is technically feasible on day 47 after coronary revascularization by PCI The patient is stable and in adequate clinical condition to undergo the procedure.
