	<brief_summary>It is hypothesized, that local retinoic acid (RA) homeostasis is functionally involved in the pathophysiology of depression. In a cross-sectional (and partly longitudinal) analysis, serum RA status will be assessed in healthy controls and subjects with Major Depression, Alzheimer's disease, alcoholism and in subjects with schizophrenia.</brief_summary>
