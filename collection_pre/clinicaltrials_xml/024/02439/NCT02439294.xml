	<brief_summary>Coronary artery disease is a common and serious disease, the leading cause of death worldwide. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is common and often under-diagnosed in coronary artery disease where it could be involved in the pathophysiology and perhaps prognosis. The entanglement of the two pathologies is actually quite well known, in particular the consequences of one over the other just beginning to be studied. Understanding the pathophysiology through new imaging modalities should improve the management of patients to propose new approaches. "SAS-IDM" is an interventional and prospective study conducted at the University Hospital of Montpellier. Patients will be divided in three groups depending of the results of the polysomnography: 1/ AHI &lt; 5/h: normal, without OSA ; 2/ 5/h ≤ AHI &lt; 30/h: mild or moderate OSA ; 3/ IAH ≥ 30/h: severe OSA. A treatment by CPAP will be proposed to patients of the group "severe OSA".</brief_summary>
