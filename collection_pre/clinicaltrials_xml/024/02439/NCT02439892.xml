	<brief_summary>Patients treated for head and neck cancer (HNC) suffer from severe side-effects such as pain and difficulties in swallowing, often leading to weight loss. More than 70 % of the weight loss is attributed to lean muscle wasting that is associated with decline in physical function, substantial fatigue and significantly decreased quality of life. Rehabilitation that includes physical exercise, nutritional counselling and oral nutritional supplements (ONS) can potentially reduce or prevent muscle wasting. The primary aim of this pilot randomised trial is to assess feasibility, evaluate patient experiences and assess preliminary effects on muscle mass, physical function, nutritional status and quality of life of rehabilitation interventions during and after radiotherapy (RT). Newly diagnosed HNC patients referred for curative RT with or without chemotherapy, will be randomised to a) rehabilitation during RT or b) rehabilitation after RT. Rehabilitation during RT will be carried out at an outpatient facility during the treatment period (6-7 weeks) and rehabilitation after RT will be carried at a rehabilitation centre and last for 3 weeks.</brief_summary>
