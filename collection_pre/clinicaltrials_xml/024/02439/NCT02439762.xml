	<brief_title>Intervening to Reduce Suicide Risk in Veterans With Substance Use Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The project is a multi-site randomized controlled trial of the CBT intervention versus the SPC condition for 300 suicidal Veterans seen in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) intensive outpatient substance treatment programs (SUD IOP). Participants will be screened for current suicidal ideation and other conditions by completing a self-report survey questionnaire. Eligible participants will complete a baseline assessment which will include a self-report survey questionnaire, a research staff administered interview, and a voluntary urine drug screen. Participants will be randomized to either a Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) or Supportive Psycho-education Control (SPC) condition. Both conditions will involve receipt of 8 one-on-one sessions lasting approximately one hour over a period of approximately 3-4 weeks in addition to their standard SUD IOP treatment of care they may be receiving at the VAMC. The intervention is designed to augment their current treatment, not to take the place of current treatment. Participants will be re-assessed immediately after receiving the study interventions (at 1-month) and then again at 3-, 6- 12-, 18-, and 24-month post-intervention follow-ups by completing a series of self-report surveys, researcher administered interviews, and a voluntary urine drug screen. To ensure adequate monitoring of suicidal ideation, additional telephone follow-up assessments will occur 2-, 4-, and 5-months post-intervention.</detailed_description>
