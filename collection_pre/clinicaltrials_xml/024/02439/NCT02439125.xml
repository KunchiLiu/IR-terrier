	<brief_title>A Study of Efficacy and Safety of Eltoprazine HCl for Treating Levodopa-induced Dyskinesia in Parkinson's Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, dose-range finding study in patients with Parkinson's disease and levodopa-induced dyskinesia. The study will examine the effects of three different doses of eltoprazine HCl, compared to placebo, on severity of dyskinesia, parkinsonian symptoms, patient function, safety and tolerability, using Parkinson's disease rating scales, patient diaries and physiological measurement of abnormal movement by means of motion sensors.</detailed_description>
