	<brief_summary>A total of 46 patients diagnosed with liver cirrhosis will be recruited. All patients will be evaluated with five psychometric tests and critical flicker frequency to diagnosis minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE). A breath test sample will be performed in all patients with MHE with 10 g of lactulose to establish the diagnosis of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Patients diagnosed with EHM and SIBO will be randomized to receive per day 1200 mg of rifaximin (group A) or placebo (group B) for 2 weeks. A complete medical history, nutritional assessment, biochemical studies, and evaluation of quality of life will be performed in all patients included in the study. Besides the initial visit, patients will receive subsequent care 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks after the beginning of the study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Rifaximin on Minimal Hepatic Encephalopathy and Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MHE impairs the quality of life, increases the risk of motor vehicle accidents, and mortality. Currently, there is no consensus on treatment and yet there are few proven treatment options. Among the factors associated with MHE, is the small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) present in 38.6% of patients with MHE. Rifaximin is a broad spectrum antimicrobial administered orally, with low risk of inducing bacterial resistance, and has been used in the treatment of MHE. It is unknown if the beneficial effect on MHE is associated with the elimination of SIBO and its efficacy when administered in patients with simultaneous diagnosis of MHE and SIBO was never been evaluated. The aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of rifaximin on MHE and SIBO in patients with cirrhosis.</detailed_description>
