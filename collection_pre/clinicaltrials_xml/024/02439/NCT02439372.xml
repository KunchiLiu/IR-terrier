	<brief_summary>Consequences of latent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection reactivation on ulcerative colitis flare, as a flare-worsening factor or simple bystander, are debated. Theoretically, CMV-specific cell-mediate immune response will further categorize the patients into high or low risk of CMV colitis. The investigators thus evaluate the usefulness of CMV-specific ELISPOT assay in patient with ulcerative colitis flare to assess the the impact of CMV colitis on ulcerative colitis flare.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of CMV-specific ELISPOT Assay for Predicting CMV Colitis in Patient With Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Moderate to severe ulcerative colitis patients admitted in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) center will be enrolled in this study. Eligible patients had active UC with a Mayo score of 6-12 points (moderate or severe disease activity). The investigators will evaluate whether CMV-specific cell-mediated immune response at admission will predict the risk of active cytomegalovirus infection (true pathogen versus bystander).</detailed_description>
