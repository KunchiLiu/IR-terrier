	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is accepted as gold standard in the management of cholelithiasis. Although laparoscopic procedures have many advantages,intra-abdominal CO2 insufflation can cause decreased lung volumes and compliance, increased airway resistance and impaired ventilation-perfusion ratio. In this study, investigators aim to investigate effects of intra-operative PEEP treatment at 3 distinct levels on respiratory dynamics and elimination time of volatile anesthetic agent.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Effects of PEEP Levels on Respiratory Mechanics in Patients Undergoing Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the study, 75 ASA I-II patients aged 30-65 years will be randomized into 3 groups to receive 0 cmH2O PEEP (Group-1), 5 cmH2O PEEP (Group-2) and 8 cmH2O PEEP (Group-3) in PVC mode. In all patients underwent general anesthesia; hemodynamic parameters, Ppeak, Pplateau, compliance values as well as Fisevo/Fexpsevo ratio at 1 MAC and times from 1 MAC to 0.3 and 0.1 MAC will be recorded. In addition, preoperative and postoperative pulmonary function tests will be compared in all patients.</detailed_description>
