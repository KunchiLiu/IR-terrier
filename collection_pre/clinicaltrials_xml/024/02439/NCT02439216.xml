	<brief_summary>The MoveDMD study is a 3-part, Phase 1/2, multi-site study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of CAT-1004 (now known as edasalonexent) in pediatric patients with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of DMD. Approximately 30 ambulatory, male patients from ≥4 to &lt;8 years of age will be enrolled overall. Edasalonexent is an orally administered small molecule targeted to inhibit activated NF-κB, a molecule that is activated from infancy in DMD and which is central to causing muscle damage and preventing muscle regeneration. Data on magnetic resonance imaging of the lower and upper leg muscles, physical function (including timed function tests) and muscle strength will be studied. Part A was initiated in April 2015 and is now complete. All three doses of CAT-1004 tested were generally well tolerated with no safety signals observed. The majority of adverse events were mild, and the most common adverse events were gastrointestinal (primarily diarrhea). There were no serious adverse events and no drug discontinuations. Part B is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple dose study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, PK, and PD of edasalonexent over 12 weeks. Patients who participated in Part A may also participate in Part B, along with newly enrolled patients. Following completion of Part B, all patients will receive CAT-1004 for 36 weeks in Part C, the open-label portion of the CAT-1004-201 study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Written informed consent from parent or legal guardian prior to participation and, for patients who are 7 years of age, written assent from patient Diagnosis of DMD based on a clinical phenotype with increased serum CK and the presence of a mutation in the dystrophin gene known to be associated with a DMD phenotype Ability to walk independently (assistive devices are permitted) Adequate immunization for influenza and varicella Use of corticosteroids within prior 6 months of treatment initiation or planning to initiate steroid therapy within the next 6 months Other prior or ongoing significant medical conditions Exposure to another investigational drug (such as eteplirsen or idebenone) within 28 days prior to start of study treatment or ongoing participation in any other therapeutic clinical trial Note: There are separate criteria for patients who participated in Part A versus newly enrolling patients. New patients must meet all of the Part A entry criteria to participate in Part B. Patients who participated in Part A must meet the following criteria to participate in Part B: Completed Part A Continue to meet all of the Part A entry criteria, including an absence of safety concerns (however, patients may be ≥8 years of age) There are no entry criteria for Part C; all patients who complete Part B will automatically continue in Part C</criteria>
