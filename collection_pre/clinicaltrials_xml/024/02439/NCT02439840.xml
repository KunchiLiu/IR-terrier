	<brief_summary>In the previous study, the investigators obtained the cutoff value of Bispectral Index to detect early deep sedation in patients with mechanical ventilation. Bispectral Index monitoring can be used as an adjunct tool in screening and confirming deep sedation during the early period of mechanical ventilation. In present study, validation test will be carried out to clarify the sensitivity and specificity of obtained cutoff value in screening deep sedation in patients with mechanical ventilation.</brief_summary>
