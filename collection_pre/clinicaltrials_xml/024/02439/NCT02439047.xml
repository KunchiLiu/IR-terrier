	<brief_summary>The objective of this study, which will be realised in vitro on human samples, is to test 2 cell sources isolated from peritoneum for adult mesothelial cells (peritoneal samples) and from adipose tissue for the adipose stem cells (adipose tissue samples). The latter will be differentiated towards the mesothelial phenotype and morphotype. The 2 routes will be compared and the most satisfactory one will be chosen to make a non-stick patch.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Patient information and collection of a signed informed consent - Clinical data collection: surgery date, age, weight, height, medical and surgical history - Prospective collection of peritoneal and adipose biopsies of patients during their surgery at the Oscar Lambret Center (Dr L. BRESSON) - Transportation of the samples to the 1008 INSERM Unit. - Isolation of cells from the samples : mesothelial cells from the peritoneum and adipose stem cells from adipose tissue - Cell culture and expansion of mesothelial cells; and cell culture and differentiation of adipose stem cells - Identification by the morphotype and phenotype of mesothelial cells - Comparison of the results according to the cell source, peritoneum or adipocyte, to the purity of cells and to the efficacy of the expansion</detailed_description>
