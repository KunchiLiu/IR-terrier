	<brief_summary>This study will test whether vaccination with viagenpumatucel-L combined with strategies to modulate the immune response is safe for patients with non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma who have failed at least one prior line of therapy for incurable or metastatic disease. These methods collectively use the body's immune system to target the patient's own tumor. Immunosuppression hinders than response, and may develop in NSCLC patients in a variety of ways, such as activation of checkpoint pathways in the tumor microenvironment. Drugs that disrupt checkpoint molecule signaling like anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies nivolumab, may release this brake on the immune system. Tumor expression of PD-L1 plays an important role in patient response to checkpoint inhibitors; in general, clinical response to checkpoint inhibitors requires tumor expression of PD-L1 and presence of Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL). Combining viagenpumatucel-L with anti-PD-1 agents may enhance the vaccine's anti-tumor activity while prolonging or increasing the efficacy of the checkpoint inhibitor.</brief_summary>
