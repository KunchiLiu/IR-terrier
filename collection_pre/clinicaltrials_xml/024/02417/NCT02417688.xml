	<brief_title>PET Imaging of Natriuretic Peptide Receptor C (NPR-C) in Carotid Atherosclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a single center, open-label baseline controlled imaging study designed to demonstrate feasibility of PET imaging of radiopharmaceutical nanoparticle Cu[64]-25%CANF-Comb uptake by PET-MR. Patients will undergo Cu[64]-25%CANF-Comb PET-MR imaging of both carotid arteries. Both carotid arteries will be imaged at the same time. We hope to demonstrate differences in PET SUV (Standardized Uptake Value) in the significantly atherosclerotic artery in patients who will be going to carotid endarterectomy surgery in comparison to the PET SUV in the artery that is not significantly diseased (ie; the artery that will not undergo surgery) . We also will determine whether PET SUV of the Cu[64]-25%CANF-Comb by the plaque correlates to the American Heart Association classifications of atherosclerosis and tissue presence of NPR-C in the ex vivo carotid endarterectomy specimen post surgery as measured by RT-PCR.</detailed_description>
