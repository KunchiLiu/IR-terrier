	<brief_title>Efficacy of PAP Therapy on Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scientific data about the causal role of obstructive sleep apnoea hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) in the development of systemic hypertension and the effects of positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment on blood pressure (BP) control are continuously increasing; however they are controversial. We aimed to determine the long term effects of compliance with PAP therapy on BP in both hypertensive and normotensive patients with OSAHS.</detailed_description>
