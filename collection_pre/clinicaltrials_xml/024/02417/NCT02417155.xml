	<brief_summary>Inflammatory cytokines play a pivotal role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and innovative non-pharmacological therapies aimed at limiting cytokine production are highly warranted. Adrenaline, a neurotransmitter of the autonomic sympathetic nervous system, attenuates cytokine production. Along these lines, endogenous modulation of sympathetic activity could limit inflammation and therefore represent a treatment modality that would empower RA patients to exert self-control over disease activity. However, both the autonomic nervous system and the inflammatory response are regarded as systems that cannot be voluntarily influenced. Nevertheless, results from two recent studies demonstrate that this is possible through techniques developed by 'iceman' Wim Hof, namely meditation, exposure to cold, and breathing exercises. Hof himself and healthy volunteers trained by him were able to voluntarily activate the sympathetic nervous system, resulting in adrenaline release and subsequent suppression of the inflammatory response during experimental human endotoxemia (a model of systemic inflammation elicited by administration of lipopolysaccharide [LPS] in healthy volunteers). Interestingly, while having been taught all three techniques, during the endotoxemia experiment the trained subjects (like Hof himself) predominantly practiced the breathing exercises consisting of two different techniques. A `hyper/hypoventilation` technique, characterized by cycles of hyperventilation followed by breath retention and a `strength ventilation` technique consisting of deep inhalations and exhalations followed by breath holding. These techniques resulted in intermittent hypoxia and cyclic shifts in acid-base balance. Based on these observations and previous studies, the investigators hypothesize that these breathing techniques account for the increased production of adrenaline and thus for the suppressed inflammatory response but it is unclear which of these two techniques is most important.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Increasing Plasma Adrenaline Levels Through Breathing Techniques - an Explorative Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective of the study is to compare the increase in plasma adrenaline levels during the two different breathing techniques in a group of healthy volunteers trained by Hof. Also, the investigators investigate whether it is necessary to be trained by Hof and if a relatively short instruction instead of the extensive training is sufficient. Additionally, the investigators want to evaluate the influence of the training and breathing techniques on pain thresholds.</detailed_description>
