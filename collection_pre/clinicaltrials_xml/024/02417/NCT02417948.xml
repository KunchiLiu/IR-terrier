	<brief_summary>This randomized clinical trial uses an educational brochure and online tutorial program to assess sun-protective behavior and skin self-examination among African Americans. Skin cancer is very common among African Americans, with a disproportionately high mortality rate. Providing a brochure and an online educational program about sun-protective behaviors may encourage African Americans to take preventative measures against skin cancer, help improve early skin cancer detection, determine how far the disease has spread, and plan the best treatment.</brief_summary>
