	<brief_summary>The objective of this trial is to assess if Fecal Microbiota Therapy (FMT) can reduce the risk of endoscopic recurrence of CD in patients after intestinal resection. The specific outcomes of FMT to be examined are: 1) endoscopic appearance, 2) clinical symptoms, 3) safety and tolerability, and 4) microbial diversity. The research team hypothesizes that FMT will prevent establishment of "pro-inflammatory" microbiome after surgery, leading to a reduced probability of recurrence of macroscopic inflammation. It is also hypothesized that FMT will be safe and well-tolerated in these patients.</brief_summary>
