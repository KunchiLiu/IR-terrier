	<brief_summary>In plastic and reconstructive surgery, treatment strategies of second-degree burns, superficial wounds, hypertrophic burn scars, flaps and chronic wounds aim at reducing infection and improving microcirculation. Although previous studies indicate that extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) can accelerate wound healing, only a few studies focused on the elucidation of its mechanisms of action. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the microcirculatory effects of extracorporeal shock wave therapy on second-degree burns, superficial wounds, hypertrophic burn scars, flaps and chronic wounds in a human in-vivo setting for the first time.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Group A (n=20): Consentcapable male and female patients ≥18 years of age who have sustained a seconddegree burn on ≥1% and ≤30% of the surface of the body. Group B (n=20): Consentcapable male and female patients ≥18 years of age who require a skin excision for the purpose of a skin graft. The minimal size of the skingraft donor site must not be less than 1% of TBSA. Group C (n=20): Consentcapable male and female patients ≥18 years of age suffering from a wound that has not yet healed ≥3 weeks. The minimal size of the wound site must not be less than 1% of TBSA.
