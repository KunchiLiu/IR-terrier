	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the treatment with the GLP-1 Analogon Liraglutide on the lipid metabolism an inflammation in adipose tissue. As GLP-1 is presumed to improve insulin sensitivity and associated parameters the investigators hypothesize that this might be due to changes in lipid metabolism which might be involved in the regulation of insulin sensitivity. Therefore the investigators intend to investigate changes of metabolic pathways before and after treatment with the GLP-1 analog liraglutide that could play a crucial role in pathogenesis as well as regulation of insulin sensitivity and atherogenic dyslipidemia such as: de novo lipogenesis and reverse cholesterol transport</detailed_description>
