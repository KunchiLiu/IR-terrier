	<brief_title>Changes in the Risk Factors of Coronary Heart Disease Observed After Scaling and Root Planing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized, outcome assessor blinded, parallel group, trial to evaluate the effect of non surgical periodontal treatment in the form of scaling and root planing on coronary heart disease patients. 70 clinically defined coronary heart disease (CHD) patients with mild to moderate periodontitis, were allocated into two groups- experimental and control, in a ratio of 1:1. Scaling and root planing was provided as the intervention to the experimental group. To the control group no periodontal intervention in any form was provided. The primary outcome assessed is the changes in C-reactive protein level at baseline and after 1, 3, and 6 months of periodontal intervention. The secondary outcomes assessed are lipid profile, white blood cells (WBC) profile, and blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) at baseline and after 1, 3, and 6 months of periodontal intervention. Periodontal parameters including plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP), periodontal probing depth (PPD), and clinical attachment loss (CAL) is also assessed at baseline and after 6 months. All these parameters were also compared with their corresponding values in the control group.</detailed_description>
