	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to determine if oral supplementation of Citrulline, when combined with HIIT, can produce significant changes in body composition, muscle quality, muscle metabolism and functional capacity in older obese men and women . The investigators hypothesize that Citrulline combined with HIIT will be more beneficial than HIIT alone which will be more beneficial than citrulline alone which will be more beneficial than placebo alone in obese elderly men and women .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Citrulline Supplementation Combined With Exercise: Effect on Muscle Function in Elderly People (CITEX Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Citrulline is a non-protein amino acid, isolated from watermelon, involved in the urea cycle and an arginine precursor. Participants will take 10g/d of citrulline or placebo (isocaloric). High intensity interval training (HIIT) is a high intensity aerobic training (30 sec at 85% and up of HRmax + 1min30 at 65-70% of HRmax). they HIIT duration is 30 min/session. HIIT is recognized as beneficial to improve health in human such as Vo2max, body fat or . Then intervention will be follow during 12 consecutive weeks.</detailed_description>
