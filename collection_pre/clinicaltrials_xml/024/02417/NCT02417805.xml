	<brief_summary>In plastic and reconstructive surgery, treatment strategies of second-degree burns, superficial wounds and chronic wounds aim at reducing infection and improving microcirculation. Although previous studies indicate that remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) can accelerate wound healing, only a few studies focused on the elucidation of its mechanisms of action. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the microcirculatory effects of remote ischemic preconditioning on second-degree burns, superficial and chronic wounds in a human in-vivo setting for the first time.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Group A (n=20): Consentcapable male and female patients ≥18 years of age who have sustained a seconddegree burn on ≥1% and ≤30% of the surface of the body. Group B (n=20): Consentcapable male and female patients ≥18 years of age who require a skin excision for the purpose of a skin graft. The minimal size of the skingraft donor site must not be less than 1% of TBSA. Group C (n=20): Consentcapable male and female patients ≥18 years of age suffering from a wound that has not yet healed ≥3 weeks. The minimal size of the wound site must not be less than 1% of TBSA. Group D (n=20): Consentcapable healthy male and female probands ≥18 years of age serving as sham group. None of the the criteria of groups AC must be evident. No soft tissue injury must be evident. General exclusion criteria below 18 years of age wounds requiring artificial respiration, since consent for the study participation is unobtainable Exclusion Criteria Groups A, B, D: peripheral arterial occlusive disease vasculitis diabetes mellitus chronic kidney or liver disease cardiac dysfunction arterial hypo or hypertension Anamnestic exclusion criteria ongoing immunosuppressive or chemotherapy treatment drug abuse systemic skin diseases systemic and local cortisone therapy</criteria>
