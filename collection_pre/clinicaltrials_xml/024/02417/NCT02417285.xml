	<brief_summary>CC-122-NHL-001 study is a multicenter, open-label, phase Ib study with dose escalation and expansion parts. It evaluates the safety, tolerability and clinical pharmacokinetics of CC-122 in combination with obinutuzumab (GA101). The study is also assessing the preliminary efficacy of the combination as well as pharmacodynamic and tumor biomarkers as exploratory objectives. In the dose escalation part, the safety and tolerability of increasing doses of CC-122 administered with a fixed dose of obinutuzumab will be administered to identify the maximum tolerated dose. In the dose expansion part, more patients will be enrolled at a CC-122 dose selected from the escalation part of the study in combination with fixed dose obinutuzumab to further study safety and efficacy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The one or two cohorts during the dose expansion phase (Part B) will enroll subjects with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) who were either refractory to or relapsed after treatment with a lenalidomide-containing regimen (FL-1 cohort) or never been exposed to lenalidomide (FL-2 cohort). The FL-1 and FL-2 cohorts will enroll up to 20 and/or up to 30 subjects, respectively.</detailed_description>

Entry Criteria Specific for DoseEscalation Phase (Part A) 3. Subjects with CD20 positive, histologically or cytologicallyconfirmed, diffuse large Bcell lymphoma (DLBCL)(including transformed low grade lymphoma) who have relapsed or refractory disease following at least two prior standard treatment regimens (eg, RCHOP or similar firstlineregimen and at least one secondline salvage regimen) and/or autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in chemotherapysensitive patients, with the following ASCT EXCEPTIONS: Subjects in the preASCT setting with poor prognosis, defined as primary refractory disease, that have relapsed within 12 months following firstline treatment; "doublehit" lymphomas with Bcl2/Myc gene rearrangements or, overexpression or high IPI score (2,3) at relapse. Subjects refusing ASCT or for whom ASCT is not appropriate based on the Investigator's judgment. Entry Criteria Specific for DoseExpansion Phase (Part B) 4.

Systemic therapy includes treatments such as rituximab monotherapy, chemotherapy given with or without rituximab, radioimmunoconjugates such as 90Yibritumomab tiuxetan and 1311tositumomab. Systemic therapy does not include, for example, H. pylori eradication or antibiotic treatment. Lenalidomide naïve 1.
