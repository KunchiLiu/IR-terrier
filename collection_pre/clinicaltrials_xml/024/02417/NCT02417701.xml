	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well target of rapamycin complex 1/2 (TORC1/2) inhibitor MLN0128 works in treating patients with lung cancer that is stage IV or has come back (recurrent) and has a mutation in the nuclear factor, erythroid 2-like 2 (NFE2L2) or kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) gene. Damage to these genes may cause the cancer to grow. TORC1/2 inhibitor MLN0128 may stop this from happening by blocking enzymes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TORC1/2 Inhibitor MLN0128 in Treating Patients With Stage IV or Recurrent Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECITVES: I. Evaluate the overall response rate of the TORC1/TORC2 inhibitor MLN0128 in NFE2L2 or KEAP1 mutant stage IV squamous cell lung cancers. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the median progression free survival of patients in each cohort. II. To explore the feasibility of performing reverse phase protein array analysis (RPPA) in paired snap-frozen core biopsies from patients in this study prior to MLN0128 (TAK-228) dosing and during week 2 of treatment. III. To describe the effectiveness of MLN0128 (TAK-228) in suppressing activation of mTOR and PI3K signaling through the exploratory RPPA analysis. OUTLINE: Patients receive TORC1/2 inhibitor MLN0128 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
