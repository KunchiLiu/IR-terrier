	<brief_summary>Recently, the quality of generic metoprolol extended-release (ER) (Toprol XL, Activas,Wockhardt) products has been called into question with reports of inconsistent effects when switching from the brand name product to a generic formulation. Problems with how the body processes these drugs could have serious and widespread consequences given the high frequency of metoprolol ER use in the management of various cardiovascular disorders, including high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias. Investigators hypothesize that both product- and subject-specific factors lead to variability in the way the body breaks down the drug (pharmacokinetics) and clinical response to generic versus name brand metoprolol ER formulation. Investigators will study the brand name and generic metoprolol ER formulations in subjects with high blood pressure to compare the pharmacokinetics and cardiovascular responses among equivalent labeled doses of each product. The study objective is to provide information on how the body breaks down generic and brand name metoprolol ER products (pharmacokinetics) and how the body responds to generic and brand name metoprolol ER products (pharmacodynamics) to better understand if generic metoprolol ER products are as good as the brand name product.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As a participant in this study the following will happen. A study nurse will draw 3 teaspoonfuls (15 ml) of blood. Two teaspoons (10ml) will be drawn for basic blood work and one teaspoon (5ml) will be drawn for genotyping. The study physician, Dr. Sigfried Schmidt will perform a physical exam and discuss all medical history. The study will be randomized to one of two groups like flipping a coin. - Study Group A- start with Toprol XL, switch to Wockhardt metoprolol, switch back to Toprol XL, then switch to Activas metoprolol - Study Group B- start with Toprol XL, switch to Activas metoprolol, switch back to Toprol XL, then switch to Wockhardt metoprolol. Each study group will consist of treatment with Toprol XL for 2 periods, treatment with Wockhardt metoprolol for one period, and treatment with Activas metoprolol for one period. The generic drug periods will be in a different order for each study group. During the times the switch will take place the following tests will be performed: 24-hour pharmacokinetic parameters, 24-hour heart rate, 24-hour blood pressure, 24-hour holter monitor, exercise treadmill to induced heart rate, and a 24-hour gastric pH through SmartPill Capsule.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects will be targeted for enrollment based on current treatment of their hypertension with a betablocker or known tolerability to a betablocker based on their previous participation in the Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses studies (PEAR1 and PEAR2). If necessary to meet enrollment targets, additional patients will be recruited from the existing patient population in the UF Health Family Medicine clinic Documented secondary forms of HTN Known cardiovascular disease (including history of angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization procedure, heart failure, or presence of a cardiac pacemaker) Known cerebrovascular disease (including stroke and TIA) Known peripheral vascular disease Diabetes mellitus (Type 1 or 2) (defined as a diabetes diagnosis in the medical record or fasting blood glucose greater than or equal to 126 mg per dl or nonfasting blood glucose greater than or equal to 200 mg per dl on screening laboratories) Systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than180 mm Hg on screening visit Heart rate less than 55 bpm on screening visit (in the absence of treatment with a betablocker) Renal insufficiency (serum creatinine greater than 1.5 in men or greater than 1.4 in women on screening laboratories) Liver enzymes (ALT and or AST) greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal on screening laboratories.
