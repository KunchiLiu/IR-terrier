	<brief_summary>Background: - Computed Tomography (CT) is a scan that makes detailed pictures of the body. It uses radiation to do that. In 2011, about 85.3 million CT scans were done in the United States. But there is growing concern about the health effects of radiation. There are new and different ways to make CT pictures that use less radiation. Researchers want to learn whether these new methods create images that are similar to images from a traditional CT. Objective: - To learn if new CT imaging methods with less radiation make images that are similar to traditional ways. Eligibility: - Adults 18 years of age and older who are scheduled for a CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis with contrast. Design: - Researchers will review participants medical records to see if they can be in this study. - Participants may have blood drawn from an arm vein by a needle stick. The blood will be used to make sure they can be in this study and that it is safe for them to have contrast. - During the participants CT scan appointment, one extra scan will be done using low radiation methods. - During a CT scan, the participant lies on a table. A large x-ray machine takes pictures of the body.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Computed Tomography uses ionizing radiation to make pictures of the body. Different methods of creating CT pictures have been developed that allow reductions in the amount of radiation. The purpose of this research study is to learn whether these new imaging methods using less radiation to create images are similar to the traditional and current method.</detailed_description>
