	<brief_summary>The Western Cape province of South Africa (SA) is changing the way it treats pregnant women with HIV. Now, all HIV-infected pregnant women, regardless of how sick or healthy they are, will receive antiretroviral treatment (ART) for life ("Option B+"). However, there are few well-developed models of service delivery to support this change to "Option B+" in the Western Cape and many parts of the continent. The parent study -- Strategies to Optimize ART Services for Maternal &amp; Child Health (MCH-ART)-- is testing two clinic-based models of service delivery for Option B+ . To complement MCH-ART, this study, PACER, will test whether community-based Adherence Clubs are an effective model for keeping breastfeeding women in HIV care after pregnancy. These clubs have been used to free up space at ART clinics by moving stable HIV+ patients to community-based services, but they have not been studied as an effective strategy among breastfeeding women after delivery. PACER seeks to address this gap.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Western Cape province of South Africa (SA) is implementing the policy of universal initiation of lifelong ART in all HIV-infected pregnant women regardless of CD4 cell count or disease stage ("Option B+"). However there are few well-developed models of service delivery to support implementation of "Option B+" in the Western Cape and many parts of the continent. In particular, while systems for initiation and follow-up of pregnant women on ART are based within well-established antenatal care clinics (ANC), there are major concerns regarding delivery of ART to HIV-infected women during the postpartum period. Multiple studies indicate high levels of non-retention in care, and/or inadequate ART adherence, during the postpartum period, presenting a threat to HIV-infected women and their infants.4-8 In turn, there is an urgent need for evidence-based approaches to support the growing number of HIV-infected mothers on ART. In this context, the parent study-- Strategies to Optimize ART Services for Maternal &amp; Child Health (MCH-ART)-- provides a rigorous implementation science framework for understanding optimal approaches for managing HIV-infected women and their HIV-exposed infants in the first year after delivery under "Option B+". While MCH-ART focuses on clinic-based models of care, there is also growing attention to the role of community health workers (CHWs) in supporting patients on ART, including community-based distribution and adherence support away from health facilities.To complement MCH-ART, the PACER study aims to investigate community-based Adherence Clubs as an effective model for engaging and retaining breastfeeding women beyond pregnancy to maximize maternal and infant health. In Cape Town, specifically, Adherence Clubs have been developed in which ART services are located away from clinics and are led by CHWs with support from ART clinic nurses. These clubs have been implemented to help decongest ART clinics by shifting stable patients to community-based services, but they have not been studied as an effective strategy among breastfeeding women in the postpartum period. PACER seeks to address this gap by randomizing women in the parent study, MCH-ART, to either the AC system or to the nearest adult ART clinic. Infants in both arms will receive the same services, following the local standard of care.</detailed_description>
