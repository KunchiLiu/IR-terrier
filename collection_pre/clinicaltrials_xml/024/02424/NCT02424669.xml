	<brief_summary>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is the most common motor neuron diseases. It is considered as a rare disease with a prevalence of about 8 per 100,000 persons. Initiating in mid-life by progressive paralysis, it evolves rapidly into a generalized muscle wasting that leads irrevocably to death within 2 or 5 years of clinical onset. Since there is no cure for ALS, the management of the disease is supportive and palliative. Riluzole is the only drug that has been shown to extend survival by about three months. The identification of biomarkers sensitive to the progression of the disease might enhance the diagnostic and provide new drug targets. Dysfunction of the immune system is a pathological hallmark of ALS. Increased levels of interferon gamma (IFNgamma) were found in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of ALS patients. However, the cell origin as well as the pathogenic influence of this peripheral source of IFNg is unknown. Thus, IFNgamma might have a role in the pathogenic process of ALS and might be a potential biomarker of the disease.</brief_summary>
