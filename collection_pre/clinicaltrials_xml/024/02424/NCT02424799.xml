Able to refrain from shaving and waxing the areas on which the study cream will be applied during the duration of the study from SCR to follow up. Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in protocol. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until the follow up visit or a time period that is 5 terminal halflive postlast dose which will be determined following Part A of the study. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. Willing, committed and able to return for all clinic visits and complete all studyrelated procedures. Able to read, understand and complete study related questionnaires. Inclusion criteria specific for healthy subjects (Part A) The subject is aged between 18 and 55 yrs of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Body weight &gt;=50 kilogram (kg) and body mass index (BMI) within the range 19 to 30 kg per square meter (m^2 )(inclusive). Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s) which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator, in consultation with the GSK Medical Monitor (MM) if required, agrees and documents that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. Demonstration of a positive weal and flare reaction (&gt;=3 millimeter (mm) in diameter relative to negative control) to at least one allergen from a battery of allergens (mixed grass pollen, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, birch pollen and cat dander) on skin prick testing at SCR. Subjects must be free from any past or present benign or malignant skin conditions and disease, unless in the opinion of the investigator it will not compromise the subject's safety and quality of data. Nonsmokers or if the subject is a tobacco smoke: smokes less than 5 cigarettes per day and commits to not smoke tobacco for the duration of the inhouse stay, and commits to stable and moderate use (as determined by the Investigator) of tobacco or nicotinecontaining products, including nicotine patches/gum, during the course of the study, as long as the patches do not interfere with the study procedures. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy for this definition, "documented" refers to the outcome of the investigator's/designee's review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt;40 milli international unit [MlU]/milliliter [mL] and estradiol &lt;40 picogram (pg)/mL (&lt;147 picomoles/litre) is confirmatory. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods described if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 24 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.
