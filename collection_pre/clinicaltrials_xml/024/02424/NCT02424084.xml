	<brief_summary>In trauma surgery and hand surgery treatment strategies of none healing bone fractures aim at replacing pseudarthrosis by well vascularized bone and improving microcirculation. Although previous studies indicate that extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) can accelerate bone healing in case of non-union, only a few studies focused on the elucidation of its mechanisms of action. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the microcirculatory effects of extracorporeal shock wave therapy on scaphoid bones and metacarpal and metatarsal in a human in-vivo setting for the first time.</brief_summary>
