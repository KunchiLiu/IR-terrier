	<brief_summary>The aim of this project is to study the association of a number of demographic and cardiovascular risk factors with death, health care utilisation and systemic embolisation by examining the clinical evolution of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in a large, community based cohort identified from linked electronic health records.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Morbidity and Mortality in Patients With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: a CALIBER Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most data on hypertrophic cardiomyopathy related morbidity and mortality are derived primarily from longitudinal, observational studies based at tertiary cardiac centres. It is unclear what the main causes of morbidity and death are in the general hypertropic cardiomyopathy population (outside tertiary referral centres) and it is likely that many patients have a benign clinical course and die from non-cardiac causes. Linkage of the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) to the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP), Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and Office of National Statistics (ONS), offers the opportunities to study the natural history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, from the time of diagnosis to the end of life, health care utilisation and to investigate the association between clinical characteristics and common clinical fatal and non-fatal outcomes.</detailed_description>
