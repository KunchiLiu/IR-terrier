	<brief_summary>This is an open-label single-arm pilot study to measure the microbiological and clinical impacts of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) in patients with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC). The investigators will prospectively enroll 10 PSC patients Stage 1 and 2 who also have concurrent inflammatory bowel disease Donor Stool from one healthy donor will be obtained from OpenBiome. OpenBiome is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization that provides hospitals with screened, filtered, and frozen material ready for clinical use</brief_summary>
