	<brief_summary>The investigators compared the results of sono-guided interscalene brachial plexus block (ISB) combined with arthroscopy-guided suprascapular nerve block (SSNB) with those of ISB alone within the first 48 h after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interscalene Brachial Plexus Block Combined With Suprascapular Nerve Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Forty-eight patients with rotator cuff tears who had undergone arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were enrolled. The 24 patients randomly allocated to group 1 received ISB and SSNB; the remaining 24 patients in group 2 underwent ISB alone. VAS pain score, patient's satisfaction (SAT) were checked postoperative 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 hours. VAS pain score was selected from 0 to 10 was no pain and 10 was severe pain that the patient had ever experienced. SAT was also selected from 0 to 10 was unsatisfactory and 10 was very satisfactory. Rebound of postoperative pain was confirmed if there had been an increase of VAS pain score after postoperative 1 hour.</detailed_description>
