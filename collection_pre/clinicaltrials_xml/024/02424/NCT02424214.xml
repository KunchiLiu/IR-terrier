	<detailed_description>The IVF outcome had been varied widely with a good portion of total fertilization failure even after the most advanced procedure for this group of patient Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection, many factors that had been tested for assisting the failed group of patient to be fertilized artificially like Ca Ionophore, Strontium Chloride and others but we decide to compare the clinically proven factors for the efficacy and safety in a well randomized clinical trial and monitor the embryogenesis and pregnancy within the 2 groups.</detailed_description>
