	<brief_summary>A 35-month cross-sectional observational study was conducted at an outpatient university hospital in Amman, Jordan. We obtained a comprehensive medical and laboratory evaluation for 134 short-statured children (64 boys and 70 girls, aged 4-16 years). Complete and partial growth hormone deficincy (GHD) were defined as peak forwth hormone (GH) response of 5 and 7 ng/ml [IRMA/ DiaSorinÂ®], respectively in both clonidine stimulation and insulin tolerance tests. Serum IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and IGF-I/IGFBP-3 ratio were determined for all participants.</brief_summary>
