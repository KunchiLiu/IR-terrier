	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of Ceftaroline in Paediatrics With Late-Onset Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicentre, multinational, open-label, single treatment arm study of intravenous (IV) ceftaroline fosamil and ampicillin, plus an optional aminoglycoside of choice, in hospitalized neonates and young infants aged 7 to &lt;60 days with late-onset sepsis (LOS). Baseline assessments for study eligibility will occur within 36 hours before administration of the first dose of study therapy. Study Day 1 is defined as the 24-hour period starting at the onset of the first administration of study therapy. Thereafter, subsequent Study Days are to follow the same pattern. Safety assessments will occur throughout the study. Clinical outcome evaluations will occur at End-of-Therapy (EOT; within 24 hours after completion of last infusion) and Test-of-Cure (TOC; 8 to 15 days after the last dose of study therapy).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Informed consent in writing from parent(s) or other legallyacceptable representative(s); Male or female, gestational age ≥34 weeks, and chronological age 7 to &lt;60 days at the time of screening; Diagnosis of sepsis within 36 hours before enrolment, defined as the presence of at least 2 clinical criteria and at least 1 laboratory criterion in the presence of or as a result of suspected or proven bacterial infection that requires IV antibiotic therapy; Patients must meet at least 2 of the following clinical criteria :Hypothermia (&lt;36°C) OR fever (&gt;38.5°C); Bradycardia OR tachycardia OR rhythm instability; Urine output 0.5 to 1 mL/kg/h OR hypotension OR mottled skin OR impaired peripheral perfusion; Petechial rash OR sclerema neonatorum; New onset or worsening of apnoea episodes OR tachypnoea episodes OR increased oxygen requirements OR requirement for ventilation support; Feeding intolerance OR poor sucking OR abdominal distension; Irritability; Lethargy; Hypotonia: Patients must meet at least 1 of the following laboratory criteria: White blood cell count ≤4,000 × 109/L OR ≥20,000 × 109/L; Immature to total neutrophil ratio &gt;0.2; Platelet count ≤100,000 × 109/L; Creactive protein (CRP) &gt;15 mg/L OR procalcitonin ≥2 ng/mL; Hyperglycaemia OR Hypoglycaemia; Metabolic acidosis. Documented history of any hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to any βlactam antibiotic or aminoglycoside; At study entry, has confirmed infection with a pathogen known to be resistant to the combination of ceftaroline fosamil, ampicillin, and the optional aminoglycoside of choice OR confirmed viral, fungal, or parasitic pathogen as the sole cause of infection; Refractory septic shock within 24 hours before enrolment that does not resolve after 60 minutes of vasopressor therapy; Moderate or severe renal impairment defined as serum creatinine ≥2 times the upper limit of normal (× ULN) for age OR urine output &lt;0.5 mL/kg/h (measured over at least 8 hours) OR requirement for dialysis; Evidence of progressively fatal underlying disease, or life expectancy of ≤60 days; Documented history of seizure; Requiring or currently taking antiretroviral therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or a child from an HIV positive mother; Proven or suspected central nervous system (CNS) infection (eg, meningitis, brain abscess, subdural abscess), osteomyelitis, endocarditis, or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC); Any condition (eg, cystic fibrosis, urea cycle disorders), antepartum/peripartum factors, or procedures that would, in the opinion of the investigator, make the patient unsuitable for the study, place a patient at risk, or compromise the quality of data; Patient's parent(s) or legallyacceptable representative(s) involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca staff and/or staff at the study site). Concurrent participation in another clinical study with an investigational product (IP), previous enrolment/participation in this study, or participation in another study of ceftaroline fosamil within 14 days before the intended start of the first dose of study therapy.</criteria>
