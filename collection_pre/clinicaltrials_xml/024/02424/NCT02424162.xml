	<brief_summary>This study will compare cataract patients with implantation of diffractive multifocal IOL with an additional power of +2.75 diopters (Group 1) and with +3.25 diopters (Group 2). Evaluations will be performed 1 and 3 months following cataract surgery, including measurement of uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), refractive error (manifest refraction [MR]), and uncorrected near visual acuity (UNVA) at 33, 40, and 50 cm. At 3 months, internal aberrations and contrast sensitivity will be evaluated and subjects will complete a questionnaire on outcomes satisfaction, visual symptoms, and spectacle use.</brief_summary>
