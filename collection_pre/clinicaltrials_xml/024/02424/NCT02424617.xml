	<brief_title>A Study of BGB324 in Combination With Erlotinib in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, multi-arm open-label Phase I/2 study that will be conducted at up to 11 clinical sites in the US. Up to approximately 66 patients with histologically- or cytologically-confirmed Stage IIIb or Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer will receive BGB324 as a single agent (Run-in Cohort(mono therapy)) or in combination with erlotinib (Arms A, B, C). Run-in Arm to establish the safety and tolerability of BGB324 administered as a single agent. BGB324 will be administered at a loading dose of 600 mg on Day 1 and Day 2 of Cycle 1, followed by 200 mg daily thereafter. After 6 patients have been dosed and safety established Arm A ( dose escalation arm) will be opened to confirm the BGB324 to be used in combination with erlotinib. In Arm A the dose of BGB324 will be escalated in a standard 3+3 fashion until an MTD of the combination ( BGB324+ erlotinib) is established. The dose of BGB324 to be investigated in arm B and C will be confirmed upon recommendation of a Safety Review Committee. Arm B and C will open in parallel and will investigate BGB324 in combination with erlotinib.</detailed_description>

Male patients and female patients of reproductive potential must agree to practice highly effective methods of contraception (such as hormonal implants, combined oral contraceptives, injectable contraceptives, intrauterine device with hormone spirals, total sexual abstinence, vasectomy) throughout the study and for â‰¥3 months after the last dose of BGB324.
