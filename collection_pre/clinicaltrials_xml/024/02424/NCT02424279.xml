	<brief_summary>Pancreatic cancer is a difficult to treat disease, mainly due to the fact that diagnosis is made usually in the late stage of this condition. One of the treatment methods of pain accompanying this neoplasm is thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy. It has been shown that it is a safe procedure with a small percentage of complications, nevertheless it is often use as the last stage in pain management what significantly decreases its effectiveness. The aim of this study is to determinate the effect of invasive pain treatment (splanchnicectomy) in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer on subjective pain perception at rest, in movement and after meals (measured with the BPI, QLQ- C30 and FACIT questionnaires), and suffering (measured with PRISM projection test), the use of painkillers during the disease and patients' overall survival. Moreover the investigators want to check if early performance of splanchnicectomy (on lower steps of analgesic ladder WHO) is combined with better therapeutic effect of this treatment.</brief_summary>
