	<brief_summary>The present study is planned to evaluate the effect of the aclidinium bromide/formoterol fumarate 400/12 μg FDC BID on the hyperinflation, exercise endurance and physical activity in patients with moderate to severe COPD. Additionally, the effect of the behavioural intervention on top of aclidinium bromide/formoterol fumarate 400/12 μg will be assessed both on the exercise endurance and the physical activity.</brief_summary>

Patients who understand and are able to follow the study procedures, are cooperative and are willing to participate in the study as indicated by signing the informed consent. 1. History or current diagnosis of asthma. 2. Any respiratory tract infection (including upper respiratory tract) or COPD exacerbation in the 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 or during the runin period. 3. Patients who have been hospitalised for an acute COPD exacerbation within 3 months prior to Visit 1 or during the runin period. 4. Clinically significant respiratory conditions other than COPD. 5. Use of longterm oxygen therapy (≥ 15 hours/day). 6. Oxygen saturation ≤ 85% as measured by pulse oximetry during exercise testing at Visit 1, Visit 2 or Visit 3 prior to randomisation. 7. Patients with a Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 40kg/m2. 8. Patient who may need to start a pulmonary rehabilitation program during the study and/or who started/finished it within 3 months prior to Visit 1 or during the runin period. 9. Patients with clinically significant cardiovascular conditions. 10. Patients with Type I or uncontrolled Type II diabetes, uncontrolled hypoor hyperthyroidism, hypokalaemia, or hyperadrenergic state, uncontrolled or untreated hypertension. 11. Patient with known noncontrolled history of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and/or active hepatitis. 12. Patients with clinically relevant abnormalities in the results of the blood pressure, ECG, or physical examination at Visit 1. 13. Patients with any serious or uncontrolled physical or mental dysfunction that could place the patient at higher risk derived from his/her participation in the study or could confound the results 14. Patients with conditions other than COPD that may contribute to dyspnoea and exercise limitation or with contraindications to clinical exercise testing according to ATS recommendations for CPET 15. Patients with other relevant comorbidities that make the patient nor suitable to followup study procedures and/or could affect physical activity 16. Patients who cycled &lt; 2 minutes or &gt; 15 minutes during the constant workrate exercise tests conducted at Visit 2 (Runin Visit) or at Visit 3 even after adjustment of the work load. 17. Patients with history of hypersensitivity reaction to inhaled anticholinergics, sympathomimetic amines or inhaled medication or any component thereof (including report of paradoxical bronchospasm) 18. Patients for whom the use of anticholinergic drugs is contraindicated (acute urinary retention, symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy, bladder neck obstruction or narrowangle glaucoma) 19. Patients unable to properly use a multidose dry powder inhaler or a pressurized metereddose inhaler (pMDI). 20. Patients using any prohibited medication (including IMP within 30 days (or 6 halflives, whichever is longer) before Visit 1) or who have not undergone the required washout period. 21. History of malignancy of any organ system (including lung cancer), treated or untreated, within the past 5 years other than basal or squamous cell skin cancer). 22. Patients who do not maintain regular day/night, waking/sleeping cycles (e.g., night shift workers, sleep apnea). 23.
