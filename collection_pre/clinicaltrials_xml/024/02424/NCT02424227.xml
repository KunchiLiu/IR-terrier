	<brief_title>Non Invasive Blood Test To Diagnose Acute Rejection After Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multicenter, observational study of kidney transplant subjects where blood specimens, intended for dd-cfDNA and other future research purposes, will be drawn after transplant periodically and also after the treatment of acute rejection up to 8 weeks post treatment. The blood samples and all relevant clinical data will be provided to CareDx scientists for laboratory assay of dd-cfDNA levels and correlation of dd-cfDNA levels with the clinical features of the subjects. The primary objective of the study is to correlate circulating dd-cfDNA to clinical and sub-clinical acute rejection in renal allograft recipients. The secondary objective of the study is to correlate circulating dd-cfDNA to renal function, both serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1. Adult recipients (Age &gt; 18 years ) 2. Both genders and all racial and ethnic groups 3. Kidney transplant alone 4. Both living and deceased donor transplants 5. Primary and retransplants. A total of 30 retransplant recipients across all study sites will be eligible for enrollment. CareDx will notify all centers when this subset of enrollment has been met. Thereafter, all enrolled patients should be primary transplant recipients. 6. Ability to come for followup and undergo biopsy (Performed in accordance to SOC) 7. Ability to give written informed consent prior to study enrollment Patients can be enrolled at any time; before or after transplantation and/or at time of outpatient or inpatient visits for workup of medical problems; e.g. at the time of a renal biopsy (regardless of elapsed time since post transplant) as specified in this study protocol. Exclusion Criteria 1. Pediatric recipients (Age &lt; 18 years) 2. Pregnant women 3. Patients undergoing multiorgan transplants (e.g. kidney with pancreas or liver) 4. Patients receiving donor organ from an identical twin</criteria>
