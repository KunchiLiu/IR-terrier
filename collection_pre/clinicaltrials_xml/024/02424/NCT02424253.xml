	<brief_summary>This will be a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study in approximately 90 subjects with moderate-severe AD Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) ≥12 and ≤ 48 (0-72 scale). Following a run-in subjects will be randomized to receive either oral 30 mg ZPL-3893787 once daily (od) or placebo od for 8 weeks (56 days).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Determine the Efficacy of ZPL-3893787 in Subjects With Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study in approximately 90 subjects (60:30 in the active:placebo groups respectively) with a pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score of ≥5 (0-10 scale), an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) &gt; 3 (0-5 scale) and moderate-severe AD Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) ≥12 and ≤ 48 (0-72 scale). Each subject will have a screening visit(s) to confirm suitability to enter the study. At a subsequent visit (start of Run In), the subject will be provided with the electronic diary (eDiary) to capture pruritus, sleep disturbance and emollient use, which must be completed on Days -7 to -1 (Run In). Subjects will then attend the clinic at Baseline (Day 0) when they will be reviewed to confirm they meet inclusion/exclusion criteria and have completed the Run In diary appropriately. If appropriate, they will then be randomized to receive either oral 30 mg ZPL-3893787 once daily (od) or placebo od for 8 weeks (56 days).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males and females aged 1865 years inclusive with physician documented history or diagnosis of atopic dermatitis for at least 12 months prior to screening. Chronic AD should be diagnosed by the Eichenfield revised criteria of Hanifin and Rajka (Eichenfield, 2004) Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) of ≥12 and &lt;48. An Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score ≥ 3 at both Screening and Day 0. A mean pruritus score of ≥ 5 on a 010 scale over the 7 day Run In (Days 7 to 1) Atopic dermatitis affecting ≥10% BSA AD of such severity (EASI &gt;48) that the subject could not comply with the demands of the study and/or the subject is not a suitable candidate for a placebocontrolled study Have concurrent skin disease (e.g. acne) of such severity in the study area that it could interfere with the study evaluation or presence of skin comorbidities that may interfere with study assessments. Have an active skin infection or any other clinically apparent infections. Hypersensitivity to mometasone or to any other ingredients contained by the topical corticosteroid product used as rescue medication in the study. Have received phototherapy (e.g. UVA, UVB), or systemic therapy (e.g. immunosuppressants, cytostatics) known or suspected to have an effect on AD, within 4 weeks of the start of the Run In. Have received systemic corticosteroids ([CS] e.g. oral, intravenous, intraarticular, rectal) within 4 weeks of the start of the Run in. Subjects on a stable maintenance dose (over the preceding 3 months) of inhaled or intranasal CS may participate. Were treated with oral antihistamines or topical calcineurin inhibitors or topical steroids within 7 days of starting Run In; intranasal antihistamines for the treatment of allergic rhinitis are acceptable.</criteria>
