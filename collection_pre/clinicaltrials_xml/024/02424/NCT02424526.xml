	<brief_title>Intensive Home-based Treadmill Training and Walking Attainment in Young Children With Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine optimal parameters for dosing home-based treadmill training by comparing high-intensity (5 days/week, twice daily for 10-20 min for 6 weeks) to low-intensity (2 days/week, once daily for 10-20 minutes for 6 weeks) treadmill training; and to compare the effects of high- versus low-intensity treadmill training on walking attainment and overall walking activity in young children with cerebral palsy. Hypotheses - A more intensive protocol of treadmill training will increase walking onset in young children with CP. - A more intensive protocol of treadmill training will increase overall walking activity in young children with CP. Specific Aims - To determine optimal parameters for dosing home-based treadmill training by comparing high-intensity to low-intensity home-based treadmill training. - To compare the effects of high- versus low-intensity treadmill training on walking onset and overall walking activity. Study design •Prospective randomized controlled trial Study population •Two groups of 12 children with CP under the age of 3 years and are not walking yet will receive either home-based high-intensity treadmill training or low-intensity treadmill training. The children will be assessed before, immediately after, at 1-month and at 4-months following the intervention via standardized outcome measures.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Signs of walking readiness as demonstrated by the ability to sit for 30 seconds when placed and to take 5 to 7 steps when supported at the trunk or arms. Because young children often are not formally diagnosed with CP until 2 years of age, we will include children who show bilateral impairment (i.e. diplegia and quadriplegia, but not hemiplegia) who demonstrate upper motor neuron signs (i.e. spasticity and/or hyperreflexia) who have been identified as highrisk for a motor disability by a physician a history of uncontrolled seizures a diagnosis of a genetic disorder cardiac or orthopedic contraindications for standing and walking orthopedic surgery in the past 6 months use of spasticityreducing medication or Botox injections in the past 6 months</criteria>
