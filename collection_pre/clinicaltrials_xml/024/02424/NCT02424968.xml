	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)+ memory T-cells work as a consolidative therapy following a donor non-myeloablative hematopoietic cell transplant in treating patients with leukemia or lymphoma. Giving total lymphoid irradiation and anti-thymocyte globulin before a donor hematopoietic cell transplant helps stop the growth of cells in the bone marrow, including normal blood-forming cells (stem cells) and cancer cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells (called graft-versus-host disease). Giving cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this from happening. Once the donated stem cells begin working, the patient's immune system may see the remaining cancer cells as not belonging in the patient's body and destroy them. Giving an infusion of the donor's white blood cells, such as CD8+ memory T-cells, may boost this effect and may be an effective treatment to kill any cancer cells that may be left in the body (consolidative therapy).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CD8+ Memory T-Cells as Consolidative Therapy After Donor Non-myeloablative Hematopoietic Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Leukemia or Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the rate of conversion to full donor chimerism (FDC) following a post transplant infusion (day 30-60) of freshly enriched allogeneic CD8+ memory T-cells in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), or Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), who received non-myeloablative total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) transplant conditioning. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the risk of disease progression, overall and event free survival, and non-relapse mortality. II. To determine the incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following the infusion of allogeneic CD8+ memory T-cells. OUTLINE: Patients undergo TLI on days -11 to -7 and -4 to -1 and receive ATG per standard institutional practice on days -11 to -7. Patients also receive cyclosporine orally (PO) daily starting on day -3 and will continue for at least 6 months post-transplant. Patients undergo non-myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) on day 0. Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil PO daily beginning on day 0 and continue until day 28. Based on the patient's status after the initial transplant, patients receive CD8+ memory T-cells intravenously (IV) over 10-20 minutes sometime between day 30 and day 60. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must have a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)matched or single allelemismatched adult sibling serving as donor Must have a myeloid or lymphoid malignant disease that is treated with TLI and ATG reduced intensity conditioning for allogeneic transplant (any of the following AML, myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS], myeloproliferative disease [MPD], CLL, B or Tcell NHL, HL) Patients who due to age, preexisting medical conditions, or, prior therapy are considered to be at high risk for regimen related toxicity associated with fully ablative transplant conditioning, and therefore reduced intensity conditioning is recommended Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document; patients must have signed informed consent to participate in the trial DONOR: Must be an HLAmatched or single allele mismatched sibling of enrolled transplant patient DONOR: Must be 1875 years of age, inclusive DONOR: Must be in a state of general good health and have completed a donor evaluation with history, medical examination and standard blood tests within 35 days of starting the hematopoietic cell collection procedure; in order to fairly represent the interests of the donor, the donor evaluation and consent will be performed by a study team member other than the recipient's attending physician DONOR: Must have a white blood cell count &gt;
