	<brief_summary>Interleukin‐2 (IL‐2) was initially discovered and used as a stimulator of effector T lymphocytes (Teffs), but is now viewed as a very promising immunoregulatory drug having the capacity to stimulate regulatory T cells (Tregs). At low dose, Il-2 tips the Treg/Teff balance towards Tregs. Recently, it has been shown that Tregs of MS patients have reduced proliferative potential. MS-IL2 will assess the safety and biological efficacy of low-dose IL2 as a Treg inducer in a Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS), with the aim to stimulate Treg and define potential clinical benefits</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biological Activity and Safety of Low Dose IL2 in Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In MS-IL2, 30 RRMS patients will be treated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial. IL‐2 will be administered first as an induction course of IL-2 or placebo each day for 5 days, followed by a maintenance course at the same dose or placebo every two weeks over 6 months. The primary efficacy criteria will be the % change from baseline in Treg at day‐5, which is indicative of the biological response to IL‐2. The secondary efficacy criteria will be (i) the maintenance of regulatory T cells during the 6 months of treatment with IL-2 vs. placebo and (ii) the stabilization or regression of the disease as determined by disease activity parameters assessed by MRI (cumulative number of new lesions in T1 enhanced by gadolinium after 6 months) in the groups treated with IL-2 compared to placebo. Expected impact: MS-IL2 will define which patient respond to IL2 and which doses prevent relapses in RRMS. In addition, the deep phenomics studies will further provide the foundation for a clinical phase II to define clinical efficacy.</detailed_description>
