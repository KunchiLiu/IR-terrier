	<brief_title>Effect of Remifentanil on Hemodynamic Stability During Placement of a Mayfield Head Fixation Device for Craniotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded comparative effectiveness study to test hypothesis that addition of remifentanil bolus to a standard anesthetic drug regimen will better attenuate the hemodynamic response to the noxious stimulus of Mayfield head pin insertion than the standard anesthetic drug regimen.</detailed_description>
