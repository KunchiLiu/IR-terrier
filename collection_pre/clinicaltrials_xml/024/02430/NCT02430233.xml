	<brief_title>Vaginal Progesterone for the Prolongation of Pregnancy After Arrested Pre-term Labor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since progesterone derivatives are useful in preventing preterm labor in cases of risk factors or previous preterm labor, we hypothesize that they will also show efficacy in pregnancy prolongation in women whose preterm labor was arrested following tocolytic treatment. Patients diagnosed with arrested pre-term labor following tocolytics at 24-34 gestational weeks will be randomly allocated to receive either vaginal micronized progesterone 400 mg/day or placebo. This study has the potential to find a treatment to prevent preterm labor and thus to reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality.</detailed_description>
