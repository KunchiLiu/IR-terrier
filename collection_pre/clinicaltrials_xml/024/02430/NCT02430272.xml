	<brief_summary>Anticholinergic drugs have traditionally been used for their antisialagogue properties. But use of anticholinergic drugs can interfere with thermoregulation via inhibition of the parasympathetically mediated sweat secretion. Sweating inhibition can reduce heat elimination, and children's thermoregulation depend more on sweating than adults and they can become hyperthermic when given these agents. The investigators evaluated the fever-causing effects of adjunctive anticholinergics in children under general anesthesia using ketamine.</brief_summary>
