	<brief_summary>The study hypothesis is that clearer visual presentation of guideline recommendations and educational outreach, or academic detailing, can improve guideline compliance. However, it will investigate other aspects of screening-related decision-making, such as provider and patient beliefs about screening, provider-patient communication and patient's willingness to forgo expected testing. The research question is whether educational interventions can decrease non-compliance with screening guidelines for 5 common cancers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Compliance With Medical Testing Guidelines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a cluster randomized trial that compares the immediate post-encounter impressions of 12 physicians and 18 of their patients about the discussion of screening for breast, cervical, colorectal, lung and prostate cancer as well as their beliefs about screening efficacy and patient reports of the screening experience. The interventions are educational materials and academic detailing (educational outreach) for providers. The investigators are particularly interested in contrasting the patient and provider recollections, the differential impact on underuse and overuse compliance and whether patient behaviors are consistent with their stated screening plans.</detailed_description>
