	<brief_title>Caregiver-Guided Pain Management Training in Palliative Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of this study is to test the efficacy for the Caregiver-Guided Pain Management Training intervention to improve the caregiver's self-efficacy for helping the patient manage pain. Secondary aims include testing the effectiveness of the CG-PMT intervention to improve patient pain severity, patient self-efficacy for pain management and patient psychological distress, as well as short-term caregiver adjustment and caregiver adjustment following the patient's death. In this multi-site study, 236 dyads (patients with cancer pain and their family caregivers) will be randomized to either a Caregiver-Guided Pain Management Training protocol or to an Enhanced Treatment-as-Usual control condition. Dyads in the Caregiver-Guided Pain Management condition will receive three one-hour sessions conducted via videoconference. Dyads in the Enhanced Treatment-as-Usual condition will receive educational material about cancer pain and its management but will not receive any study-related treatment sessions. Assessments will be conducted with patients and caregivers before and after treatment, and with caregivers 4 months and 11 months following the patient's death. The primary hypothesis to be tested is that caregivers who receive the intervention will report significantly higher levels of self-efficacy for helping the patient manage pain than caregivers in the control condition. Secondary aims will focus on (a) improvements in short-term caregiver adjustment as well as caregiver adjustment following the patient's death, and (b) patient pain severity, self-efficacy for pain management, and psychological distress.</detailed_description>
