	<brief_summary>Lipodystrophies are rare disorders characterized by selective loss of adipose tissue and predisposition to insulin resistance and its metabolic complications. Hepatic steatosis is a common complication in patients with partial and generalized lipodystrophies.Despite aggressive management of diabetes and hyperlipidemia, hepatic steatosis and its complications present a therapeutic challenge in many patients. Due to this large disease burden, it is important to assess the efficacy and safety of novel therapies for hepatic steatosis in patients with lipodystrophies.There are, however, no systematic studies evaluating various therapeutic interventions for reducing hepatic steatosis in patients with lipodystrophies. A variety of drugs have been investigated in nonlipodystrophic patients with non-alcoholic hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis (NASH) or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Recent data support the activation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR, NR1H4), a nuclear hormone receptor regulated by bile acids, for treatment of NASH and NAFLD. FXR activates transcription of several genes particularly the atypical nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2) and thus can influence triglyceride metabolism within hepatocytes.Both cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are ligands for FXR, however, UDCA which is the 7 hydroxy β-epimer of CDCA, does not activate FXR. Obeticholic acid (OCA) is a first-in-class selective FXR agonist which has approximately 100 fold greater FXR-agonistic activity in the nanomolar range, as compared to CDCA .It therefore appears that FXR modulation offers interesting therapeutic possibilities in treating hepatic steatosis. This study is primarily designed to study efficacy of OCA, a strong FXR ligand, in reducing hepatic triglyceride levels in patients with hepatic steatosis and Familial Partial Lipodystrophy (FPLD). If proven to be effective, it may reduce morbidity and mortality as a result of sequelae of hepatic steatosis in patients with lipodystrophies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study of Obeticholic Acid for Lipodystrophy Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over trial. Patients who are considered eligible for the study will undergo screening evaluation to determine their eligibility for the trial. For those who are found to be eligible, during the baseline period, they will continue their usual diet and other lifestyle measures without changing any medications for 1 month in order to establish a baseline state. Three blood samples will be obtained during this period at the Clinical and Translational Research Center. Following the baseline period, the patients will receive obeticholic acid (OCA) or an identical placebo in the dose of 25 mg/day for a period of 4 months and then will receive the other treatment (OCA or placebo) for 4 months. There will be a wash-out period of 4 months in-between the two study periods. Patients will be educated to maintain their usual physical activities and diet during the study. The subjects will be admitted to the Clinical and Translational Research Center for the baseline evaluations (at the beginning of the two study periods), and at the end of four months during each study period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with familial partial lipodystrophy of the Dunnigan variety with heterozygous diseasecausing missense mutation in lamin A/C (LMNA) gene. 2. Hepatic steatosis (&gt;5.6% hepatic triglyceride content) as demonstrated by 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. 3. Age 1870 years. 4. Alcohol intake of less than 20 g per day in females and 30 g per day in males. 5. Participants and their partners with whom they are having sex, must use medicallyacceptable birth control (contraceptives) during the study. Medicallyacceptable methods of contraception include: (1) surgical sterilization, such as hysterectomy, tubal ligation or vasectomy. (2) approved hormonal contraceptives, such as birth control pills, patch or ring; DepoProvera, Implanon. (3) barrier methods, such as condom, cervical cap or diaphragm used with a spermicide. (4) an intrauterine device (IUD). 1. Laboratory or other histologic findings highly suggestive of liver disease due to causes other than nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, such as chronic viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, biliary obstruction or genetic liver diseases such as Wilson's disease, hemochromatosis or alpha1antitrypsin deficiency. 2. Treatment with drugs associated with steatohepatitis, e.g., corticosteroids, high dose estrogens, methotrexate, amiodarone, tamoxifen, valproic acid, sulfasalazine, or oxacillin for more than 2 weeks in the 6 months prior to the study. 3. Decompensated liver disease as evidenced by clinical features of hepatic failure (variceal bleeding, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy etc.) and laboratory investigations (prolonged prothrombin time with INR &gt; 1.3, hypoalbuminemia with serum albumin less than 3.0 g/dL, direct bilirubin &gt; 1.3 mg/dL, or presence of esophageal varices etc.) 4. Evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma: alphafetoprotein levels greater than 200 ng/ml and/or liver mass on imaging study suggestive of liver cancer. 5. Use of drugs which can potentially decrease hepatic steatosis during previous 3 months; ursodeoxycholic acid, thiazolidinediones, highdose vitamin E, betaine, acetylcysteine and choline. 6. Significant systemic or major illnesses other than liver disease, such as congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, respiratory failure, renal failure (serum creatinine &gt;2 mg/dL), acute pancreatitis, organ transplantation, serious psychiatric disease, and malignancy, that could interfere with the trial and adequate follow up. 7. Acute medical illnesses precluding participation in the studies. 8. Known HIVinfected patient. 9. Current substance abuse. 10. Pregnant or lactating woman. 11. Hematocrit of less than 30%. 12. History of weight loss during past 3 months. 13. Patients on bile acid binding resins, cholestyramine, colestipol or colesevelam. 14. Hypersensitivity or intolerance to OCA or any components of its formulation. 15. Failure to give informed consent 16 .Previous clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or fasting blood glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL or hemoglobin A1c ≥ 6.5%.</criteria>
