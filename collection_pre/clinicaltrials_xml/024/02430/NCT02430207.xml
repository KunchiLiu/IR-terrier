	<brief_summary>Temporary pacing via femoral vein is used widely in mainland China, because of its feasibility and simplicity. However, pulmonary embolism often occurred after the procedure. It is not known that whether there was any difference in incidence of pulmonary embolism between via different approaches. This randomized and multi-center study was designed to verify whether temporary pacing via subclavian vein has lower incidence than via femoral vein.</brief_summary>
