	<brief_title>Lonafarnib With Ritonavir in HDV (LOWR-2)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic delta hepatitis is a serious form of chronic liver disease caused by infection with the hepatitis D virus (HDV), a small RNA virus that requires farnesylation of its major structural protein (HDV antigen) for replication. Up to forty-five subjects with chronic delta hepatitis will be randomized to receive one of nine different doses of lonafarnib. Dosing will occur over 12-48 weeks, and during that time, evidence of antiviral response will be assessed by frequent measurements of HDV-RNA. The primary therapeutic endpoint will be an improvement in quantitative serum HDV RNA levels after treatment with lonafarnib therapy. The primary safety endpoint will be the ability to tolerate the drug at the prescribed dose for the treatment duration. Several secondary endpoints will be measured, including side effects, ALT levels, and symptoms. Therapy will be stopped for intolerance to lonafarnib. This study is designed as a phase 2a study assessing the safety, tolerance and antiviral activity of nine dosing combinations of lonafarnib with ritonavir boosting with and without PEG IFN-alpha.</detailed_description>
