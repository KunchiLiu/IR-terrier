	<brief_title>A Study of the Effectiveness of Cognitive Adaptation Training in Early Intervention for Psychosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed project will expand knowledge of the role of compensatory and restorative cognitive interventions for early intervention population individuals with schizophrenia. The investigators will conduct a two arm randomized trial comparing the impacts of CAT and Action Based Cognitive Remediation (ABCR) for individuals with schizophrenia who are under the age of 30. The model would mirror the investigators' preliminary work at CAMH (Kidd et al., 2014) in which there will be 4 months of specialist-delivered treatment followed by 5 months of maintenance by case managers with pre, 4 month, and 9 month evaluations conducted. This study will be among the most rigorous examinations of such interventions to date, would be among the first to examine integrative approaches, and would make a substantial contribution to the early intervention literature. The questions for the purposes of this project are: 1. Is CAT effective among individuals with schizophrenia under the age of 30? and 2. Does integrating cognitive remediation with CAT enhance outcomes as compared with CAT alone?</detailed_description>
