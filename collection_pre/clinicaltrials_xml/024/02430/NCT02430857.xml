	<brief_title>Osteopathy and Latent Hypothyroidism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with latent hypothyroidism show an increased hormone status in TSH and a normal hormone status in fT4. A study has shown that osteopathic treatment had positive effects to some symptoms in patients with latent hypothyroidism. The study was using the pain inventory as the instrument to measure the effect. In this study we want to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment on the hormone status (TSH, fT4) The intervention group will receive a neurological osteopathic stimulation over 5 weeks. A parallel control group will not receive any therapy. A follow up blood screening (TSH, fT4) will be done. The results of both groups will be compared.</detailed_description>
