Patient understands the nature of the procedure and provides written informed consent, prior to enrollment in the study 6. Prior to enrollment, the target lesion was crossed with standard guidewire manipulation One target lesion is located within the native SFA: distal point 3 cm above knee joint 7. The target lesion has angiographic evidence of stenosis or occlusion 8. Length of the target lesion is ≤ 15 cm by visual estimation 9. Target vessel diameter visually estimated is ≥4 mm and ≤7 mm 10. There is angiographic evidence of at least one vesselrunoff to the foot 1. Presence of a stent in the target vessel that was placed during a previous procedure 2. Presence of an aortic thrombosis or significant common femoral ipsilateral stenosis 3. Previous bypass surgery in the same limb 4. Patients contraindicated for antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulants or thrombolytics 5. Patients who exhibit persistent acute intraluminal thrombus at the target lesion site 6. Perforation at the angioplasty site evidenced by extravasation of contrast medium 7. Patients with known hypersensitivity to nickeltitanium or other study device components 8.
