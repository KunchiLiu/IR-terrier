	<brief_title>Transperineal Ultrasound to Assess the Progress of Labour</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective observational study of transperineal ultrasound between 24-42 weeks gestation and a prospective longitudinal observational study in all term (37-42 weeks) labouring women. AIMS: This study aims to firstly assess the effectiveness and acceptability of transperineal ultrasound in women presenting between 24 and 42 weeks gestation in comparison with digital vaginal examination (VE). Secondly, in all term (37-42 weeks) labouring women, investigators aim to create an ultrasound based labour record, "a sonopartogram" and from this develop a predictive model for the outcome of labour.</detailed_description>
