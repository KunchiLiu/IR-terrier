	<brief_summary>This is a phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-center, multiple-dose study in healthy participants and participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of TAK-648 when administered as multiple oral doses of TAK-648 solution at escalating dose levels in healthy participants of Japanese decent and participants with T2DM.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TAK-648 Multiple-Rising Dose Study in Healthy Japanese Participants and Non-Japanese Participants With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being evaluated in this study is TAK-648 for the treatment of T2DM. This study will consist of 2 parts: (1) multiple ascending doses in participants with T2DM treated with a stable dose of metformin, (2) multiple ascending doses in healthy participants of Japanese descent. Part 1 of this study will consist of 2 multiple dose treatment cohorts (Cohorts 1-2 designated as P1C1 and P1C2) dosed sequentially in escalating order. The projected doses of TAK-648 for Part 1 are 0.15 and 0.35 mg of TAK-648, but may be adjusted higher or lower, and additional cohorts may be added, based on available safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) data. All cohorts in Part 1 will consist of 8 (2 placebo) T2DM participants. Part 2 of this study will consist of 3 multiple dose treatment cohorts (Cohorts 1-3 designated as P2C1, P2C2 and P2C3) in healthy participants of Japanese descent dosed sequentially in escalating order. The projected doses of TAK-648 chosen for Part 2 are 0.05, 0.15 and 0.35 mg of TAK-648, but may be adjusted higher or lower based on available safety and PK data. All cohorts in Part 2 will consist of 8 (2 placebo) healthy participants of Japanese descent. Additional cohorts may be recruited and studied as necessary to better evaluate safety, tolerability, PK, and/or PD parameters.</detailed_description>

Has a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level between 6.5% and 10.0%, inclusive at Checkin (Day 2). 8. Has a fasting Cpeptide concentration ≥0.8 ng/mL at Screening. 9. Has no medical history of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), hypoglycemia unawareness, diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma. Part 2: 1. Is a healthy adult male or female of Japanese descent (born to Japanese parents and grandparents) and have lived outside of Japan for less than 5 years, inclusive. 2. Is aged 20 to 55 years, inclusive, at the time of informed consent and first study medication dose. 3. Weighs at least 45 kg and has a BMI from 17.0 to 25.0 kg/m^2, inclusive at Screening. 4.

If out of range, may be repeated once for eligibility determination within a maximum of 5 minutes. 5. Has a calculated creatinine clearance &gt;60 mL/min at Screening and Checkin (Day 2). Part 1: 1. Has Screening or Checkin (Day 2) laboratory values of serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL for males or ≥1.4 mg/dL [females] or abnormal creatinine clearance. 2. Has a history of T1DM, hypoglycemia unawareness, diabetic ketoacidosis, or hyperosmolar coma. 3. Has a history of any clinically significant retinopathy, which is defined as more than moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy or any stage of proliferative diabetic retinopathy or any history of lasertreated retinopathy. 4. Has received any antihyperglycemic medication with the exception of metformin within the previous 12 weeks of Checkin (Day 2) or the subject has changed the dose of metformin within the previous 8 weeks of Screening. 5. Is expecting to receive, receiving or has received systemic glucocorticoid therapy for a duration longer than 5 days within the previous 12 weeks of Checkin (Day 2). Parts 1 and 2: 1.
