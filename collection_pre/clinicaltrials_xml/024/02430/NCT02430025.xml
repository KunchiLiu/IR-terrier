	<brief_summary>This proposal delineates a research plan to collect blood from the patients with cardiovascular diseases for the purpose of establishing a molecular biological bank registry. The Fujian provincial hospital will enroll 8,000 patients.The blood collected will be processed to create a repository of molecular biological plasma. Along with a sample of blood collected from individual patients, a concise general medical history, demographic data, electrocardiographic data, echocardiographic data, and laboratory data will be collected. A short interview will take place after enrollment during the outpatient visit or hospital stay, or may be conducted via phone call after enrollment. All the clinical data gathered will be compiled in Fujian provincial hospital center database, and would be stored in a format where a culmination of clinical findings, i.e. representing a disease of interest, can be used to search the database to identify the blood samples of all patients with such characteristics for further study.</brief_summary>
