	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, single-center, open label, within-subject clinical trial to evaluate the identification of anatomical markers in the gastrointestinal tract using the IRIS feeding tube. The trial will evaluate hospitalized subjects who require short-term enteral feeding with an anticipated duration of at least 3 days while in an intensive care unit (ICU) or step-down unit. Eligible men and women at least 18 years of age who give voluntary, written informed consent to participate in the clinical investigation will be included as subjects. If a potential subject is incapacitated and unable to provide informed consent, a designated legally authorized representative will be allowed to provide the informed consent on behalf of the subject to allow their participation in the study. Study entry will be defined as the point of signed informed consent.
