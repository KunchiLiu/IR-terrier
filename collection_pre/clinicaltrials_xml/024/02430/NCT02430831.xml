Extreme caution should be given to blinding. Methods should give full certainty that blinding was perfect at the subject (parent) level, but also at the pediatrician and with all involved personnel. Randomization should be done according to 3 feeding modes : - "breast feeding: only breast, except for 2 bottle feedings a week, - "formula fed": only formula except two breast feeding a week, - "mixed feeding": all the remaining</detailed_description>
