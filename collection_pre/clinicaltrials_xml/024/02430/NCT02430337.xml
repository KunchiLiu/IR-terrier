	<brief_summary>In this study, a computer-assisted adaptation of SafeCare, an evidence-based home visiting program, will be developed and tested in child welfare. This approach will assist home visitors with delivery of SafeCare to families, with the goal of improving provider fidelity and implementation success. In the computer-assisted SafeCare sessions, a portion of the session will be delivered on a tablet computer that the home visitor brings to the family's home. The computer software will deliver the educational piece, or explain piece of each session, along with modeling videos of the skills. The home visitor will follow up with the practice and feedback portions of the session. A randomized feasibility trial will be conducted to test the technology-based approach against the standard SafeCare implementation approach in terms of feasibility of implementation, provider job demands and resources, as well as client outcomes such as skill acquisition and mental health.</brief_summary>
