	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to investigate whether treatment with BG00012 (dimethyl fumarate) compared with placebo slows the accumulation of disability not related to relapses in participants with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). The secondary objective of the study is to assess the effect of BG00012 compared with placebo on patient-reported outcomes, brain atrophy, and cognitive function.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Onset of SPMS at least 1 to 2 years prior to randomization. SPMS is defined as relapsingremitting disease followed by progression of disability independent of or not explained by relapses. Have documented confirmed evidence of disease progression independent of clinical relapses over the 1 year prior to randomization. Have an Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 3.0 to 6.5, inclusive. Have a Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Severity Score of 4 or higher. Key Have a diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis or primary progressive MS as defined by the revised McDonald criteria. Had a recent clinical relapse (within 3 months) prior to randomization. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to: ongoing or active infection; symptomatic congestive heart failure; unstable angina pectoris; cardiac arrhythmia; serious or acute liver, kidney, or bone marrow dysfunction; uncontrolled diabetes; serious or acute psychiatric illness that would limit compliance with study requirements.
