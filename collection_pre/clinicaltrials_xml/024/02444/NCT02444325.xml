	<brief_title>Diabetes Group Prenatal Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Long term, the investigators aim to test the central hypothesis that group prenatal care, compared to traditional prenatal care, will improve glycemic control and, ultimately, maternal and neonatal outcomes in women with type 2 and gestational diabetes. The objective of this proposal is to conduct a pilot randomized trial to determine the effect of group prenatal care on self-care activities, which have been associated with improved glycemic control, in women with diabetes.</detailed_description>
