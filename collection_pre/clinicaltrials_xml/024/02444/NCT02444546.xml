	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of wild-type reovirus (viral therapy) when given with sargramostim in treating younger patients with high grade brain tumors that have come back or that have not responded to standard therapy. A virus, called wild-type reovirus, which has been changed in a certain way, may be able to kill tumor cells without damaging normal cells. Sargramostim may increase the production of blood cells and may promote the tumor cell killing effects of wild-type reovirus. Giving wild-type reovirus together with sargramostim may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Wild-Type Reovirus in Combination With Sargramostim in Treating Younger Patients With High-Grade Relapsed or Refractory Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and describe the toxicities of wild-type reovirus (Reolysin) when given once a day for three days following two days of treatment with sargramostim (GM-CSF). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety, tolerability and adverse events in the patient population. II. To assess the median overall survival time in this patient population. III. To assess the median progression free survival time in this patient population. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether there is a correlation between antibody responsiveness to the virus and a positive tumor response to Reolysin in patients who receive the virus following treatment with GM-CSF. II. To determine whether there is a correlation between an increased number of circulating monocytes and a positive tumor response to Reolysin in patients who receive the virus following treatment with GM-CSF. III. To explore the possible predictive value of monocyte numbers in response to Reolysin + GM-CSF therapy. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of wild-type reovirus. Patients receive sargramostim subcutaneously (SC) daily on days 1 and 2 and wild-type reovirus intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 3-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually for up to 2 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histological confirmation of a high grade (grade 3 or 4) primary brain tumor either classified as a glioma (including astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma and glioblastoma multiforme), medulloblastoma, atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) or primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) Note: Patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) are exempt from this confirmation of tumor if characteristic radiologic findings are noted on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Patients must have no known curative therapy available Evidence of tumor progression by MRI scan following radiation therapy or following the most recent antitumor therapy; note: patients who have had surgical treatment at recurrence are eligible if they had a resection with measurable residual disease on postoperative imaging or if there is imaging evidence of disease progression as compared to the first postoperative scan Measurable disease: measurable by gadolinium MRI scan Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 750 /uL obtained =&lt; 7 days prior to registration Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) &gt;= 250/uL obtained =&lt; 7 days prior to registration Platelet count (PLT) &gt;= 75,000 /uL without transfusions obtained =&lt; 7 days prior to registration Hemoglobin &gt;= 7.0 gm/dL obtained =&lt; 7 days prior to registration Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 times upper limit of institutional normal (ULN) for age obtained =&lt; 7 days prior to registration Aspartate transaminase (AST) =&lt; 3 times ULN for age obtained =&lt; 7 days prior to registration Serum albumin &gt;= 2 g/dL Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 times ULN for age OR a creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &gt;= 70 mL/min/1.73 m^2; obtained =&lt; 7 days prior to registration Karnofsky or Lansky performance status (PS): performance status of &gt;= 50 assessed within two weeks prior to registration; neurological deficits in patients must have been relatively stable for a minimum of 1 week prior to study enrollment; patients who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but who are up in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the performance score Ability to understand and the willingness to provide written informed assent or consent Willing to return to enrolling institution for followup Immunosuppressants: patients must be receiving a stable or decreasing dose of dexamethasone for at least 1 week prior to start of therapy AND dexamethasone dose must be =&lt; 0.1 mg/kg/day AND =&lt; a total daily dose of 4 mg/day If patient has a clinically indicated surgery or biopsy at any time during treatment with Reolysin, a tissue sample will be collected for correlative research purposes Patient willing to provide mandatory blood samples for correlative research purposes; the inability to provide a blood sample or the lack of an available blood sample does not make the patient ineligible Negative urine or serum pregnancy test done =&lt; 7 days prior to registration for females who are postmenarchal Patient agrees to use an acceptable form of contraception during the study and for up to 28 days after the last dose of Reolysin if patient or female partner is postmenarche;
