	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy catheter-based renal denervation in reducing blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension compared to a sham procedure. Patients will be randomized to RDN or sham control in a 2:1 ratio. All participants will be switched to a single pill triple combination treatment prior to the procedure. A total of 105 patients will be recruited into the study, 70 patients in the RDN arm and 35 patients in the sham control arm. The duration of this study is 36 months.</brief_summary>
