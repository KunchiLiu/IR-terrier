	<brief_summary>Significant clinical improvements of ME/CFS symptoms were observed in two patients with long-standing ME/CFS who received adjuvant chemotherapy including cyclophosphamide for breast cancer, also in one ME/CFS patient who received chemotherapy including iphosphamide for Hodgkin lymphoma. Three pilot ME/CFS patients were thereafter treated with six intravenous infusions four weeks apart, in two of these with a significant clinical response. The hypothesis is that a subset of ME/CFS patients have an activated immune system, and that ME/CFS symptoms may be alleviated by treatment with cyclophosphamide as intravenous pulse infusions four weeks apart, six infusions in total. The purpose of the present study is to treat ME/CFS patients with cyclophosphamide as intravenous pulse infusions four weeks apart, six infusions in total. The effects on ME/CFS symptoms and tolerability/side effects during 12 months follow-up will be registered, and additional tests will be performed to objectively register changes in physical ability during follow-up. Studies to investigate possible large vessel endothelial dysfunction and skin microvascular dysfunction will be performed before start of intervention and during follow-up.</brief_summary>
