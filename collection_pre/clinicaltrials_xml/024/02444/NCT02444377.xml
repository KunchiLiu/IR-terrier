	<brief_summary>Purpose: The purpose of this study would be to evaluate the effects of interval training on cardiovascular health, lipid profile and body composition in overweight and obese men and women. A secondary purpose will be to compare lab based measurements of body composition [4-compartment model (4C)) with portable equipment [bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) and ultrasound (US)] Participants: Seventy-six men and women (age 18-55 yrs; BMI 25-45 kg/m2) will be randomly assigned to a high-intensity short interval group (SIT), high-intensity long interval group (HIT) or a control group (CON). Procedures (methods): Participants will be assessed for peak oxygen utilization (VO2peak), blood lipids, glucose and insulin levels. Body composition will also be measured using a 4C model, as measured from dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), air displacement plethysmography (BodPod), and BIS, in comparison to US values. Participants assigned to either training group will undergo 3 weeks of interval training, 3 days per week. SIT will complete 10 bouts of a series of 1 min cycling with 1 min rest periods at 90% of the power output obtained during VO2peak;in comparison HIT will complete 5 bouts of the same protocol: 2 min bouts with 1 min recovery at varying intensities of VO2peak (80-100% power output).</brief_summary>
