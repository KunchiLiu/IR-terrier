	<brief_summary>Treating severe thrombocytopenia is a challenge in the management of systemic lupus erythematosus. Although rheumatologists have followed some rules in real practice,there is very few evidence to support the current treatment algorithm. The purpose of this study is to compare the complete remission rate and partial remission rate of cyclophosphamide and hydroxychloroquine for treating severe thrombocytopenia in Chinese SLE patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cyclophosphamide and Hydroxychloroquine for Thrombocytopenia in SLE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective,randomized,open-label,multi-center clinical trial. The aim of this study is to test the efficacy of GC(gluco-corticosteroid)+HCQ(hydroxychloroquine) and GC(glucocorticosteroid)+CTX(cyclophosphamide) with sequential AZA(azathioprine) in the induction and maintenance therapy of severe thrombocytopenia in SLE patients.</detailed_description>
