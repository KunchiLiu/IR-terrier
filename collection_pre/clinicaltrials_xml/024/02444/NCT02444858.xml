	<brief_title>Human Umbilical-Cord-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy in Paraquat Poisoning Induced Lung Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I-II Clinical Trial-Safety and efficacy of umbilical-cord-derived mesenchymal stem cell (UC-MSC) in patients with paraquat poisoning induced lung injury,randomized, single blind, controlled prospective study. Forty patients will be selected and randomized into two groups: the first group of 20 patients will receive three-time injection of UC-MSC and the remaining 20 patients will comprise the control group. Every patient will maintain their standard treatment of paraquat poisoning, with maximum tolerated dosage without side effects. The day of last infusion will be considered day zero. From that moment, followup will be divided into 2 d,7 d,14 d, 28 d and 2 m. Clinical results will be analyzed after completion of 2 months of followup.</detailed_description>
