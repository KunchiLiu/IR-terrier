	<brief_summary>Based on the anatomical features of the anterior Communicating artery complex, the investigators will analyze the outcome of the ACoA aneurysms treated by endovascular therapy. The most common site of intracranial aneurysms is the anterior communicating artery (AcomA). AcomA aneurysms account for approximately one-fourth of all intracranial aneurysms. Recent publications have addressed specifically the endovascular treatment of AcoA aneurysms. Furthermore, detailed anatomic characteristics and the effects of the multiple variations of the anterior communicating artery complex have scarcely been reported. The hemodynamic factors play a fundamental role in the adequate treatment of aneurismal coiling. The objective of our registry is to analyze the impact of morphological configuration of the anterior communicating artery complex and the results of coil embolization in AcoA aneurysms</brief_summary>
