	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of IgM-enriched immunoglobulins (Pentaglobin) on the endotoxin activity, conventional coagulation parameters, viscoelastic and aggregometric measurements of patients with severe sepsis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IgM-enriched Immunoglobulin Attenuates Systemic Endotoxin Activity in Early Severe Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Before the change of the standard operating procedure (SOP) with the implementation of the application of IgM-enriched immunoglobulins to patients with severe sepsis and septic shock conventional inflammatory and coagulation parameters, viscoelastic and aggregometric measurements as well as the endotoxin activity was measured in 15 patients. After the change of SOP the same parameters were recorded for additional 15 patients.</detailed_description>
