	<brief_summary>Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) can be defined as physical symptoms that at present have no clear physical pathological cause. In primary care between 20 and 40% of patients have medically unexplained physical symptoms and in secondary care this figure rises to 50% in many specialties. This study design is a cross over randomized controlled trial with a waiting list to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of studying a whole systems approach to care in general practice for adults with PPS. 'Integrated GP care' will be compared with treatment as usual (TAU) within a waiting list design. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a future randomized trial and to identify suitable primary outcome measures (outcomes that may be affected by 'integrated GP care'), for a future trial evaluation and to inform the sample size/power calculation for such a trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Persistent Physical Symptoms Reduction INtervention: a System Change &amp; Evaluation in Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with persistent physical symptoms (PPS) are often severely functionally impaired and very distressed. They consume large amounts of health care and welfare benefits. However, patients are often resistant to reassurance, traditional medical explanations and standard treatments aimed at symptom relief. In new referrals, it is generally appropriate to carry out a standard battery of investigations. However, in patients with PPS the search for demonstrable pathology often continues. Physicians in both primary and secondary care often feel they have little to offer. Advocacy groups evolve to mobilize public opinion, influence scientific debate and shape policy. Patients with PPS are often at the center of disputes over health insurance, health, welfare, disability and unemployment benefits. Return to work programs are often aimed at this group of patients who are at most risk of failing to return to work after a period of absence. The management of PPS is one of the most important tasks facing both general practice and the specialist in hospital medicine. There is an accumulating body of evidence demonstrating that cognitive behavioral interventions can reduce levels of symptoms and improve functioning in patients who have had PPS for several years. In 2011, a meta-analysis examined the efficacy of short term psychotherapy for PPS and this drew on ten previously published systematic reviews on psychological interventions as well as new trials. Overall, the studies were small and focused on patients with longstanding problems (mean = 13.3 years). It was difficult for the authors to generalize, as the studies were so diverse in terms of number of sessions, setting, mode of delivery, who delivered therapy etc. In general, there was evidence for a small beneficial between group effect of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for PPS but moderate effects for within group contrasts. The effect sizes differed considerably depending on the setting and outcome, such as, healthcare utilization, functional impairment, psychopathology and physical symptoms. Larger effect sizes tend to be seen for more specific syndromes, such as non-cardiac chest pain and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). The authors concluded by suggesting that mental health professionals were better placed to deliver therapy but that consultation rates could be tackled by general practitioners (GPs) trained specifically in communication skills. Furthermore, the authors also argued that because many patients are not willing to receive psychotherapy that medical health specialists should be trained to provide some treatment. There is evidence to suggest that interventions are efficacious for fatigue and fibromyalgia in primary care. The strength of evidence is much stronger for CBT in chronic PPS. The evidence for shaping the management of new referrals is less robust. However, any service development and evaluation should take this evidence into account. Commissioning Support for London piloted an integrated service model for medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) but that focused on commissioning and cost saving. The proposed study will build on this pilot by: - Measuring patient satisfaction and patient reported outcomes; - Include a broad range of patient groups in primary care, including those with non-cardiac chest pain, functional movement disorder, dizziness and fibromyalgia; - Assess feasibility of trialing a new systems approach to management of patients in primary care using robust methods, namely a cluster randomized waiting list controlled trial.</detailed_description>
