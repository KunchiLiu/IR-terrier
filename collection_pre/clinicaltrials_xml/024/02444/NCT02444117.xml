	<brief_title>Clinical and Neurophysiological Evolutions Through a Functional Rehabilitation of Social Communication in ASD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>200 children with autism spectrum disorders (1-12 years old) will be included in a 2 years follow-up study. Both clinical and neurophysiological evaluations (electrophysiological and eye tracking) will be completed at different times of the follow-up. This integrative approach, combining clinical and biological markers, will allow the identification of different developmental trajectories and then a better individuation of treatment in autism spectrum disorders.</detailed_description>
