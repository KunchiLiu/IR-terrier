	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics of Tedizolid Phosphate in Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent epidemiological studies have demonstrated that the presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the airways of patients with CF is associated with more rapid lung function decline and a higher mortality. Tedizolid is a new antibiotic with potent activity against MRSA. Tedizolid is currently FDA approved for treatment of skin soft tissue infections with MRSA. The proposed study is designed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of intravenous and oral tedizolid in patients with CF.</detailed_description>
