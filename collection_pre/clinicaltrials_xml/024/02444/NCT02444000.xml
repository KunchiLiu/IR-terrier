	<detailed_description>Multicentric, Randomized phase III study (1:1), Population: newly diagnosed 1p/19-codeleted anaplastic gliomas, Primary objective: To determine whether treating newly diagnosed 1p/19q-codeleted anaplastic gliomas with PCV alone can increase overall survival without neurocognitive deterioration Control group: radiotherapy followed by 6 cycles of PCV chemotherapy. Experimental group: 6 cycles of PCV chemotherapy (radiotherapy being deferred at the time of progression). Number of centres participating: the 31 centers of the POLA network Recruitment duration: 7 years, the accrual rate being 40 patients per year, and patients are followed-up until the end of the trial.</detailed_description>
