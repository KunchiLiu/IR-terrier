	<brief_summary>This is a prospective biomarker study to show that p4EBP1 staining predicts clinical benefit from treatment with everolimus in patients who are eligible for everolimus+exemestane treatment. This trial is not aimed at evaluating a drug activity. Everolimus and exemestane are prescribed within their approved indication as per usual practice and are not part of this trial.</brief_summary>

Patients with metastases that can be biopsied, except bone metastases 8. Measurable or evaluable disease 9. Age ≥ 18 years 10. WHO Performance Status 0/1 11. Provision of signed and dated, written informed consent prior to any protocol specific procedure, including biopsy 12. Patient with social insurance coverage 1. Contraindications for everolimus+exemestane treatment 2. Previous treatment with an antimTOR therapy 3. More than 1 previous line of chemotherapy in metastatic setting 4. Life expectancy &lt;3 months, 5. Spinal cord compression and/or symptomatic or progressive brain metastases (unless asymptomatic or treated and stable off steroids for at least 30 days prior to start of study drug). 6.
