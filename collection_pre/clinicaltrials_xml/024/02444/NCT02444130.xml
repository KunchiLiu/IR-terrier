	<brief_title>Presbyopia Compensation: Looking for Electrophysiological Predictors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For each participant, presbyopia was compensated with contact lenses by monovision during three weeks and multifocality (three weeks again). A break of two weeks without any presbyopia compensation came in between the two phases of the test that were randomized. All subjects were tested three times: before any compensation, after three weeks with monovsion and after three weeks with multifocality. Each testing session was strictly the same including visual examinations and VEPs (visual evoked potentials).</detailed_description>
