	<brief_title>The Effect of Increased Water Intake on the Frequency of the Clinical Recurrent Urinary Tract Infections in Pre-menopausal Women: S-HYDRACYST</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to assess the effect of increased daily water intake on the frequency of clinical, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI) among low drinking pre-menopausal women suffering from recurrent community-acquired UTI over 12 consecutive months of study product consumption. It is a prospective, single site, open-label, randomised controlled trial in two parallel groups: - Control group: not changing their fluid intake habits - Intervention group: provided with mineral water, fluid intake recommendations and regular hydration coaching support The study population consists in pre-menopausal women diagnosed with recurrent UTIs and having a 'low drinker' profile. The total number of randomized subjects in this study is estimated at 140. The study will include only women who are low-drinkers (&lt; 1.5 L fluids per day; urinary volume &lt; 1.2 L per day) since they are most likely to have a predisposition to UTIs due to infrequent voiding.</detailed_description>
