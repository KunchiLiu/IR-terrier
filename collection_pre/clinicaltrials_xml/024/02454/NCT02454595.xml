	<brief_summary>This is a prospective open registry to measure the impact on first-line therapy of genomic testing of biopsy tissue from recently diagnosed treatment-na誰ve patients with early stage localized prostate cancer. Physicians will complete a series of questionnaires. Biopsy tissue will be tested using the Prolaris速 genomic test and a relative cancer aggressiveness score will be shared with the physician and the patient.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Registry to Measure the Impact of Adding Genomic Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective open registry to measure the impact on first-line therapy of genomic testing of biopsy tissue from recently diagnosed treatment-na誰ve patients with early stage localized prostate cancer . Physicians, using standard clinical-pathological parameters (PSA, Gleason score, clinical stage and percent positive cores), will complete a questionnaire that will record their recommendation for first-line therapy from among various treatment options. A sample of the biopsy tissue will then be tested using the Prolaris速 genomic test and a relative cancer aggressiveness score will be shared with the physician. After reviewing and considering the results of the genomic testing but prior to the patient consult, the physician will then complete a second treatment decision questionnaire and VAS again. The physician will then discuss the recommended treatment plan with the patient and record the agreed treatment plan on a third questionnaire. After the initial treatment has been initiated, the physician or research staff will record the actual treatment administered in the fourth questionnaire (preferably recorded within 3 months of the patient consultation).</detailed_description>
