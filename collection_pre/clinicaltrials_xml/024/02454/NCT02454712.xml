	<brief_summary>PF614 is an oxycodone prodrug that is designed for extended-release of oxycodone comparable to OxyContin. This Single Ascending Dose (SAD) study is designed to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of PF614 in comparison to standard doses of OxyContin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of PF614 Compared to OxyContin® in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a Phase 1 randomized, single-center, SAD study in 6 cohorts of 8 healthy male and/or female subjects. The study will evaluate the safety and PK of PF614 and the PK of oxycodone at doses sufficient to characterize the extent to which plasma oxycodone is produced and maintained following oral ingestion of PF614. The PK of the prodrug fragments will also be evaluated. There will be a parallel study arm in each cohort dosed that will use oral OxyContin® as an active comparator. Subjects will receive PF614 (n=6) or OxyContin as comparator (n=2) orally in the fasted state. In addition, all subjects starting with Cohort 1C will receive naltrexone at 14 hours pre-dose, 2 hours pre-dose and 10 hours post dose to block the effects of oxycodone. The starting dose for administration of PF614 will be 15 mg. The lowest available dose of OxyContin, 10 mg, will be used as the comparator in the first cohort. PK assessments will be conducted after each cohort to compare the oxycodone area under curve (AUC) of PF614 and OxyContin to determine the most appropriate dose for the subsequent cohorts. In Cohort 6 (fed subjects), all subjects (n=8) will receive the same PF614 and naltrexone doses as administered in Cohort 5 to evaluate the PK and safety of PF614 in fed vs. fasted state. Subjects in Cohort 6 will receive a Food and Drug Administration-defined high-fat, high-calorie breakfast 30 minutes prior to study drug administration.</detailed_description>

Male subjects must agree not to donate sperm throughout the study and for 90 days after the last study drug administration; 8. Subjects must have normal or no evidence of clinically significant findings in physical examination and 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) according to the Investigator, and normal vital signs (respiratory rate between 10 and 18 breaths per minute, blood pressure between 100139/5089 mmHg, heart rate between 40100 beats per minute, temperature between 96.44°F and 100.04°F (between 35.8°C and 37.8°C), and oxygen saturation (SpO2) &gt; 97% in the absence of supplemental oxygen; 9. Clinical laboratory values must be within the normal limits as defined by the clinical laboratory, unless the Investigator decides that outofrange values are not clinically significant; 10. Subjects must be able to provide meaningful written informed consent; 11. Subjects must be willing and able to follow study instructions and be likely to complete all study requirements. 1. History of allergy or sensitivity to oxycodone, OxyContin, any other opiate, naltrexone, or naloxone; 2. History of loud snoring or sleep apnea; 3. History of medical problems encountered with opioid therapy; 4. Urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking or history of regular use of tobaccocontaining or nicotinecontaining products within 2 months prior to screening; 5. History of alcoholism or drug abuse (prescription or illicit drugs) according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IVText Revision (DSM IVTR) criteria; 6. Use of prescription medications within 14 days of study drug administration, except for contraceptive medications used by female subjects; use of overthecounter (OTC) medications within 7 days prior to study drug administration; 7. Use of any opioid within 30 days prior to screening; 8. Donation of blood within 60 days prior to screening; 9. Donation of plasma, platelets, or white blood cells within 7 days prior to dosing; 10. Acute illness (eg, gastrointestinal illness, infection such as influenza, upper respiratory tract infection, or known inflammatory process) within 7 days of dosing 11. History of gastrointestinal disturbance requiring frequent use of antacid; 12. History of clinically significant gastrointestinal disease and/or surgery which would result in the subject's inability to absorb or metabolize the study drug (eg, gastrectomy, gastric bypass, cholecystectomy); 13. Anticipated need for surgery or hospitalization during the study or followup period; 14. Dosing with an investigational drug or participation in an investigation device study within 30 days or 5 halflives of first dose of the study drug; 15. Women who are lactating; 16. Any other condition, that, in the Investigator's opinion, (i) puts the subject at increased risk, (ii) could confound the study results (iii) may interfere significantly with the subject's participation in the study or (IV) has the potential to limit the subject's ability to complete the study.</criteria>
