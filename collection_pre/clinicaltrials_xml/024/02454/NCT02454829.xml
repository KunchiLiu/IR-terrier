	<brief_summary>Evaluation of ovarian function by a questionnaire and by medical file analysis of women and girls who underwent ovarian cortex cryopreservation for fertility preservation between 1997 an 2013 in the investigators' institution in order to evaluate their residual ovarian function. A second part of the questionnaire concerns these women's satisfaction regarding the procedure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Follow-up of Ovarian Function in Young Women Who Underwent Ovarian Cortex Cryopreservation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Between 1997 and december 2013, 546 girls and women underwent ovarian cortex cryopreservation in the investigators' institution for fertility preservation. The main indications were the need for a gonadotoxic treatment, repeated ovarian surgery and a genetic risk for premature ovarian failure . These women will be sent a questionnaire concerning their ovarian function since the procedure and a questionnaire about their satisfaction concerning the procedure. Six different questionnaires will be used adapted to the patient's initial indication for cryopreservation and the patient's age at the time of cryopreservation. Complementary data will be obtained by medical file analysis and by contacting the patient's family doctor or gynecologist. Data will be correlated with received gonadotoxic treatment and surgical interventions. The purpose of the study is to improve the indications and patient selection for ovarian cortex cryopreservation.</detailed_description>
