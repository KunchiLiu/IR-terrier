	<brief_summary>LGN-VN-003 is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single oral dose of vanoxerine for the conversion of subjects with recent onset atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AFL) to normal sinus rhythm. Up to 625 subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion so at least 400 vanoxerine and 200 placebo subjects receive study drug.</brief_summary>

Treatment with any loop diuretic (e.g., furosemide, bumetanide, torsemide, ethacrynic acid, etc.) in the 30 days prior to randomization. Ejection fraction of &lt;35% within the 3 months prior to randomization (most recent measure if more than one). AF/AFL as a result of surgery (postoperative AF/AFL) within 30 days prior to randomization. History of electrical cardioversion within the 7 calendar days prior to randomization. History of any polymorphic ventricular tachycardia including torsades de pointes. History or family history of long QT syndrome or other inherited arrhythmia syndrome. History of ventricular tachycardia requiring drug or device therapy.</criteria>
