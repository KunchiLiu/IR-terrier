	<brief_summary>With the aim of enhancing the quality of surgery, the robotic cystectomy is often conducted using continuous intravenous infusion of curare, which ensures maximum neuromuscular relaxation until the end of the intervention. Sugammadex, administered for the reversal of deep neuromuscular blocked, enable rapid awakening. Moreover, Sugammadex seems to have a positive effect also on the recovery of cognitive function, psychomotor coordination and mental ability, effects undocumented in Literature. The aim of the investigators study was to assess whether the reversal with sugammadex after intraoperative continuous infusion of rocuronium, can improve the quality of awakening.</brief_summary>
