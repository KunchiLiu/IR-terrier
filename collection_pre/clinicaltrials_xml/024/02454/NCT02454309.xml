	<detailed_description>Participants will be randomized to receive either a cranberry concentrate or placebo. Participants, study staff and investigators will remain blinded until after the dataset has been cleaned. At the baseline visit participants will be instructed to consume the assigned supplement twice daily for 12 consecutive months. A calendar will be provided to record compliance, recurrent UTIs and any side effects. Participants will be phoned/texted each month to encourage participation. Additional study visits will be completed at 3 months, 6 months and 9 months to collect information on recurrent UTIs and adherence. A urine sample will be collected from participants at each visit to test for pregnancy and the presence of an undetected UTI. Supplements will be distributed at each visit for the following 3-month study period and the last bottle of unused product returned. At the 12-month visit, participants will complete an end-line questionnaire and return their supplement bottle in addition to the calendar and side effect diary. If participants withdraw from the study, they will be encouraged to return at 12 months to complete a survey to allow for intent-to-treat analysis.</detailed_description>
