	<brief_title>Influence of Dietary Nitrate on Time Trial Performance in Swiss Paracycling Athletes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The influence of dietary nitrate on performance will be tested performing a time trial on a handbike. The time trial will be the same as in the Paralympics 2016 in Rio. The subjects perform three trials and receive another supplement for each trial: beetroot juice with 6mmol nitrate, 6mmol sodium nitrate or plain water (placebo supplement). The time to complete the time trial will be the main outcome parameter.</detailed_description>
