	<brief_title>A Trial of TAS-114 in Combination With S-1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation Phase I study of TAS-114 administered in combination with S-1, evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary antitumor activity of the TAS-114/S-1 regimen in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study will be conducted in two parts: a Dose-Escalation Phase (Part 1) to determine the MTD; and an Expansion Phase (Part 2) to further evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy with the MTD. Patients will receive the study medication according to the proposed treatment schedule until disease progression (PD), occurrence of intolerable side effects, removal by the Investigator or withdrawal of consent. A patient is considered discontinued from study treatment when TAS-114 is discontinued. Male or female patients age 18 years or older with confirmed advanced solid tumor(s) for which no standard therapy exists. TAS-114/S-1 will be administered BID for 14 days followed by a 7-day recovery period, every 21 days (1 cycle) in patients with advanced solid tumors.</detailed_description>
