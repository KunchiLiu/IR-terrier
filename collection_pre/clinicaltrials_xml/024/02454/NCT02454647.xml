	<brief_title>Induction Chemotherapy, Chemoradiotherapy and Surgery in Locally Advanced Gastric Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with locally advanced gastric cancer (T3-4 and/or N+) are included. Initially, patients are diagnosed by computerized tomography scan and endoscopic ultrasound. The neoadjuvant strategy consists of 3-4 cycles of induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Chemoradiotherapy comprises weekly chemotherapy concurrently with daily external beam radiotherapy up to 45 Gy). Surgery is scheduled 4 to 6 weeks after the end of CRT. Pathological response is graded according to the Becker criteria. Statistical analysis is performed IBM SPSS v20. Estimate whether R0 resection rate, pathological response degree, patterns of recurrence and long-term outcomes may be initially predicted by dynamic prognostic factors as tumor size, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR)</detailed_description>
