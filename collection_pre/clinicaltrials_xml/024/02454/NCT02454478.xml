Male participants and their female partners must meet the criteria above 1. Participants with CNS metastases are not eligible, unless they have completed local therapy and have discontinued the use of corticosteroids for this indication for at least 4 weeks before starting treatment in this study. Any signs (eg, radiologic) or symptoms of brain metastases must be stable for at least 4 weeks before starting study treatment. 2. Prior exposure to lenvatinib 3.
