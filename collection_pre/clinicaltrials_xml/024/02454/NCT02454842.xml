	<brief_summary>This phase 2 study is designed to evaluate the safety and activity of TH-4000 (Tarloxotinib), a hypoxia-activated prodrug, in patients with EGFR-Mutant, T790M-Negative, Advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study for Treatment of Patients With EGFR Mutant, T790M-negative NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single arm open label multi-center Phase 2 study in which the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and efficacy of TH-4000 (Tarloxotinib) will be assessed in patients with EGFR mutant, T790M negative advanced NSCLC. Patients must have demonstrated progression during EGFR TKI therapy. Hypoxia PET scans will be obtained in select centers to analyze potential predictors of tumor response.</detailed_description>
