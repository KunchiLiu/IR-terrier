A subject with a previous history of calcium hydroxylapatite to the treatment area within the past year. 11. A subject with a previous history of ablative laser surgery to the treatment area within the past year. 12. A female subject who is pregnant, nursing an infant or planning a pregnancy during the study. 13.
