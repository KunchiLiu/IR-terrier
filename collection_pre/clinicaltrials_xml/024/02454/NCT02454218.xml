	<detailed_description>Check that the tDCS can modify the attentional response of patients with fibromyalgia. Methods: This study deals with a randomized, blind, crossover, controlled tDCS-sham. The sample will consist of 40 patients, divided into two groups with sham interventions and active crossover. Patients answer the questionnaires in order to verify the Psychological Factors and Clinical. Will use the Impact of Fibromyalgia (QIF), Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire, Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM), Beck Depression Scale II, Catastrophic Scale , Go noGo Test, Attention Network Task (ANT) to verify the ability attentional as well as to verify the Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) brain oxygenation. They will be used before, during and after the intervention with tDCS. Intervention with tDCS or sham will be held in a single session. Expected results: It is expected that fibromyalgia patients undergoing tDCS present, after the intervention, improved attention capacity .</detailed_description>
