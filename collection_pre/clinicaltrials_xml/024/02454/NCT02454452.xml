	<brief_title>Comparison of Radiofrequency, Vein Stripping and CHIVA for Venous Insufficency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized controlled trial will compare three surgical techniques (stripping, CHIVA and radiofrequency) for the treatment of varicose veins which are currently considered interchangeable standards of care. The trial will include symptomatic patients with chronic venous insufficiency and saphenous vein insufficiency confirmed by Doppler with diameter greater than 4.5 mm. Clinical assessments will be made on first and seventh day after surgery, and then at months 1, 6, 12 and 24. The primary endpoint of the study is the absence of venous reflux in the great saphenous vein segment above-knee. Secondary variables will include VAS for pain and quality of life as assessed by the SF 36 and CIVIQ questionnaires validated in Spanish language. Ultrasound scans will be done the first week and after 1, 6, 12 and 24 months. Intra- and postoperative complications will be recorded.</detailed_description>
