	<brief_summary>This is a phase I safety, PK and food effect study of the CMV drug. In part 1 of the study, subjects will receive one of four dosage strengths of MBX-400 (100 mg once daily, 350 mg once daily; 750 mg once daily; and 1000 once daily) for 7 days and safety and PK will be assessed. Subjects must be 18 to 65 years of age, male or female; if female, be surgically-sterilized or post-menopausal; if male, have undergone vasectomy; have a body mass index (BMI) of 18 to 32 kg/m^2; not be a user of nicotine-containing products; be willing to abstain from nicotine-containing products, alcohol and illicit drugs during the study. Subjects will be followed for 28 days post dosing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and PK of MBX-400 (Cyclopropavir) in Normal Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common cause of viral illness in children and adults. CMV is also an important congenital infection with complications including deafness, developmental delay, and cerebral palsy. The proposed study design is a standard multiple ascending dose escalation study. Four cohorts of 8 subjects each (6 active; 2 placebo) will be enrolled sequentially. MBX-400 will be administered orally once daily for 7 days, in the form of capsules, by study staff while the subject is an inpatient in a research unit. The study doses will be 100, 350, 750, and 1,000 mg daily. Up to 32 healthy male and female (non-pregnant, non-lactating) volunteers ages 18-65 in one site, will be consented and allowed to participate in the study if upon screening they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Subjects will be enrolled into one of four sequential cohorts groups: Cohort 1 will receive 100 mg PO once daily for 7 days, Cohort 2 will receive 350 mg PO once daily for 7 days, Cohort 3 will receive 750 mg PO once daily for 7 days, and Cohort 4 will receive 1000 mg PO once daily for 7 days of MBX-400. Two members of each cohort will receive placebo. The study duration for each subject is expected to be approximately 80 days (screening period, administration of daily dose, and follow-up). Each subject may be admitted to the unit 1 day prior to the first dose, and will remain in the unit until the day after the 7th daily dose. Subjects will return for follow-up visits after the last dose. Safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics will be assessed. The overall study duration across all study groups is expected to be approximately 18 months. The primary objective evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending doses of 100, 350, 750, and 1000 mg PO once daily for 7 days of MBX-400 in healthy subjects. The secondary objective determine the plasma and urine pharmacokinetic profile of multiple doses of 100, 350, 750, and 1000 mg PO once daily for 7 days of MBX-400 in healthy subjects.</detailed_description>
