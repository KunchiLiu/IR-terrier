	<brief_summary>Baseline self-report outcome measures will be completed and additional assessments will occur mid-treatment , post-treatment , 3 months following completion of all sessions, and 6 months following completion of all sessions. Patients and therapists will complete the evaluation measures in private (at home, in an office). At the University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center, BBI treatment is offered in group and individual formats. The course of individual treatment varies and group treatment consists of 10 1.5-hour weekly sessions in the "intensive" phase, followed by 2 1.5-hour bi-weekly maintenance sessions. Individual treatment is one-on-one. In group treatment, there are typically 6-12 patients per group and 1 or 2 therapists. The intervention helps patients to learn adaptive coping strategies and how to apply them to daily stressors. Additional content discusses use of seeking information, enhancing social support, enhancing body esteem and intimacy, and maintaining positive changes.</brief_summary>
