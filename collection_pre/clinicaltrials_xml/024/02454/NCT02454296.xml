	<brief_title>Paracervical Block for Pain Associated With Laminaria Insertion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pre-operative dilation of the cervix with use of osmotic dilators (e.g. laminaria, dilapan-S) is commonly done prior to pregnancy termination to make the procedure safer. This study seeks to assess whether paracervical blocks are effective at reducing pain associated with placement of laminaria. Secondarily, this study will evaluate if paracervical blocks are effective at reducing overall procedural pain and increasing overall patient satisfaction for the intracervical laminaria placement procedure.</detailed_description>
