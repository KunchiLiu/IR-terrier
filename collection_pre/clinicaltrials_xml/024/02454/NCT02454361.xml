	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of KBP-7072</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of KBP-7072 following oral single ascending dose administration and with an open label food effect panel. Part 1: A total of 40 subjects will be evaluated with 30 subjects randomized to receive active drug and 10 subjects randomized to receive placebo in a double-blind fashion (eight subjects in each dose cohort, six subjects randomized to active drug and two subjects randomized to placebo). 5 dose levels will be evaluated. Extensive PK samplings will be collected after dosing (pre-dose (within 30 min prior to dosing) and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192, 216 and 240 hr post-dose). Part 2: A separate panel of 6 subjects will receive a single dose of KBP-7072 under fed conditions. The dose tested in Part 2 will be determined based on the safety, tolerability and PK data available from Part 1. Extensive PK samplings will be collected after dosing (pre-dose (within 45 min prior to dosing) and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192, 216 and 240 hr post-dose). Safety assessments will include monitoring of adverse events (AEs), vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate and oral temperature), clinical laboratory findings, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical examination findings.</detailed_description>
