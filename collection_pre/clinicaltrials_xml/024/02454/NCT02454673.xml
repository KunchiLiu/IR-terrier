	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the R0 rate, pathological response degree, patterns of recurrence and long-term outcomes may be initially predicted in patients with locally advanced gastroesophageal junction and gastric cancer treated with a neoadjuvant approach and salvage surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Therapeutic Individualization for Patients With Locally Advanced Gastric and Gastroesophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with locally advanced gastroesophageal junction and gastric cancer with T3-4 and/or N+ are included. Initially, patients are diagnosed by computerized tomography scan and endoscopic ultrasound. The neoadjuvant strategy consisted of 3-4 cycles of preoperative chemotherapy (group A) or 3-4 courses of induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (group B). Chemoradiotherapy comprised weekly chemotherapy concurrently with daily external beam radiotherapy up to 45 Gy). Surgery is scheduled 4 to 6 weeks after the end of CRT. Pathological response is graded according to the Becker criteria. Statistical analysis is performed IBM SPSS v20. Nonlinear mixed effects (NLME) modelling is applied to evaluate the impact of dynamic changes in tumor size, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR) on the clinical outcome of these patients.</detailed_description>
