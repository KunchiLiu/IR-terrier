	<brief_summary>Amygdala Retraining Treatment (ART) is a new and promising therapy for patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and Fibromyalgia (FM), however, randomized controlled trials (RCT) are scarce. The investigators have added mindfulness to this therapy, based on preliminary reports of its efficacy on patients, obtaining Amygdala Retraining Treatment with Mindfulness (ART+MF). Other therapy that has been assessed in many psychiatric and medical disorders during the last years has been Compassion Therapy (CT). There are no studies on its efficacy in FM. Aims: The aim of this trial is to assess the efficacy of both ART+MF and CT on the general function of the patients with FM. A secondary objective is to assess the effect of these therapies on psychological (pain, depression, anxiety, etc.) and biological variables (some biomarkers related with inflammation). Methods: - Design: Randomized, controlled trial with three arms: a) ART+MF, b) CT and c) Relaxation as control intervention. - Sample: A sample (N=60 patients, about N=20 for each arm) will be recruited from primary care settings at the city of Zaragoza, Spain.</brief_summary>
