	<brief_summary>Delirium is a common and serious condition and is associated with adverse outcome. The elderly who have cognitive dysfunction are expected to show delirium more frequently. It is most likely that delirium represents a response to impaired cholinergic neurotransmission. Investigators aimed to establish the preventive effect of the cholinesterase inhibitor, rivastigmine patch, on the post-operative delirium limited to femur neck fracture operation in patients at risk of dementia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rivastigmine Patch Effect on the Post-operative Delirium in Patients at Risk of Dementia.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators evaluated the delirium prevention effect of rivastigmine patch in patients with femur neck fracture and cognitive impairment. Investigators measured the frequency and severity of post-operation delirium in the patch applied and non-applied subjects.</detailed_description>
