	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Study of Two Platinum Regimens in Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sporadic and germline BRCA mutation associated triple-negative breast cancer share several pathological and molecular similarities which have led to the exploration of DNA damaging agents like platinum compounds in patients with triple-negative breast cancer. Recent studies demonstrate that addition of neoadjuvant carboplatin to doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/taxane-based chemotherapy improves pathological complete response in patients with stage I-III triple-negative breast cancer but also increase toxicity. A recent study reported encouraging pathological complete response rates with a non-anthracycline carboplatin plus docetaxel neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen in a cohort of 49 triple negative breast cancer patients. This chemotherapy regimen of carboplatin plus docetaxel yielded an overall pathological complete response rate of 65% in unselected triple-negative breast cancer with pathological complete response rates of 61% in sporadic and 77% in germline BRCA-associated triple-negative breast cancer. The chemotherapy regimen of carboplatin/docetaxel is well tolerated and should be studied further and compared with regimens that add carboplatin to the standard anthracycline/taxane containing regimens. This is the basis for the proposed randomized neoadjuvant phase II study to further estimate and compare pathological complete response rates of carboplatin plus docetaxel x 6 cycles to carboplatin plus paclitaxel x 4 cycles followed by doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide x 4 cycles in stage I-III triple negative-breast cancer.</detailed_description>
