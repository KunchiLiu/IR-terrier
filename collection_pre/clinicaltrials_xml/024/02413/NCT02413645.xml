Patient must be on stable treatment with cART for at least 6 months (cART is defined as an antiretroviral regimen consisting of at least three registered antiretroviral agents) 6. Nadir CD4+ cell counts must be above or equal to 350 cells/μl (1 or 2 occasional determinations below 350 will be allowed) 7. Current CD4+ cell count must be at least 450 cells/μl 8. HIVRNA must be below 50 copies/ mL for the last 6 months prior to inclusion, during at least two measurements (occasional so called 'blips' up to 50 copies/mL are permitted) 1. Treatment with a noncART regimen of antiretroviral agents prior to the start of cART; 2. History of a CDC class C event (see Appendix V); 3. Patient is female and has a positive pregnancy test or the wish of pregnancy: 4. Active opportunistic infection, or any active infection or malignancy within 30 days prior to screening visit; 5. Therapy with immunomodulatory agents, including cytokines (e.g. IL2) and gamma globulin, or cytostatic chemotherapy within 90 days prior to screening visit; 6. Use of anticoagulant medication; 7. Use of any investigational drug during the 90 days prior to study entry; 8. Previous failure to antiretroviral and/or mutations conferring genotypic resistance to antiretroviral therapy EudraCT No. 201400459132 33 Protocol version 1.1, dated 10 February 2015 9. Any other condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives. 10. Active hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B virus coinfection 11.
