	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Ascending Single- and Multiple-Doses of TAK-020 in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-020. TAK-020 is being tested to find a safe and well-tolerated dose. This study will look at the pharmacokinetic characteristics (how the drug acts throughout the body) of the drug and safety and tolerability (lab results, vital signs, ECG, and side effects) in healthy people who take TAK-020. The study will enroll a total of approximately 128 participants. This study is designed to consist of 2 sequential parts: Part 1-a SRD, and Part 2-a MRD. The study population for Part 1 will consist of 72 participants enrolled into 9 cohorts. Each cohort will have 8 randomized participants with 6 receiving a single dose of TAK-020, and 2 receiving matching placebo under fasted conditions. In Cohorts 1-8 doses of 0.1, 0.5, 2.5, 4.4, 8.8, 17.5, 35, and 70 mg have been evaluated. For Cohort 9, the subsequent dose level is to be determined following review of safety, tolerability and PK data from the previous cohort, and is proposed to be 105 mg. The study population for Part 2 will consist of 56 participants enrolled into 7 cohorts. Each cohort will have 8 randomized participants. with 6 participants receiving one dose of TAK-020 on Day 1 and daily dosing on Days 3-9 of TAK-020, depending on whether washout is required, and 2 receiving matching placebo under fasted conditions. This single-center trial will be conducted in the US. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 45 days. Participants in Part 1 will make multiple visits to the clinic including a period of confinement to the clinic and will be contacted by telephone 14 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment. Participants in Part 2 will make multiple visits to the clinic including a period of confinement to the clinic and will be observed at the clinic 17 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Participant eligibility is determined according to the following criteria prior to entry into the study: 1. In the opinion of the investigator, the participant is capable of understanding and complying with protocol requirements. 2. Participant or, when applicable, the participant's legally acceptable representative signs and dates a written, informed consent form and any required privacy authorization prior to the initiation of any study procedures including requesting that a participant fast for any laboratory evaluations. 3. Participant is a healthy adult male or female. 4. The participant is a health adult male or female aged 18 to 55 years, inclusive, at the time of informed consent and first study medication dose. 5. The participant weighs at least 45 kg and has a body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 and 32.0 kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2), inclusive at Screening and Day 1. 6. A male participant who is nonsterilized and sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential agrees to use adequate contraception from signing of informed consent throughout the duration of the study and for 12 weeks after last dose. 7. A female participant of childbearing potential who is sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner agrees to use adequate contraception* from signing of informed consent throughout the duration of the study and until the next menstrual period or 30 days after last dose, whichever is first. If the next menstrual period is delayed, a pregnancy test will be required for exclusion of pregnancy. Exclusion Criteria Any participant who meets any of the following criteria will not qualify for entry into the study: 1. The participant has received any investigational compound within 30 days prior to Screening. 2. The participant is an immediate family member, study site employee, or in a dependent relationship with a study site employee who is involved in the conduct of this study (example, spouse, parent, child, sibling) or may consent under duress. 3. Participant has a known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation of TAK020, Captisol or related compounds. 4. The participant has a positive urine drug result for drugs of abuse at Screening or Checkin (Day 1). 5. The participant has a history of drug abuse (defined as any illicit drug use) or a history of alcohol abuse (defined as 4 or more alcoholic beverages per day) within 1 year prior to the Screening visit or is unwilling to agree to abstain from alcohol and drugs throughout the study.

Participant has taken any excluded medication, supplements, or food products, Prohibited Medications and Dietary Products. 7. If female, the participant is pregnant or lactating or intending to become pregnant before, during or within 1 month after exit from this study (30 days post last dose); or intending to donate ova during such time period. 8. If male, the participant intends to donate sperm during the course of this study or for 12 weeks thereafter. 9. Participant has evidence of current cardiovascular, central nervous system, hepatic, hematopoietic disease, renal dysfunction, metabolic or endocrine dysfunction, serious allergy, asthma hypoxemia, hypertension, seizures, or allergic skin rash. There is any finding in the participant's medical history, physical examination, or safety laboratory tests giving reasonable suspicion of a disease that would contraindicate taking TAK020, or a similar drug in the same class, or that might interfere with the conduct of the study. This includes, but is not limited to, peptic ulcer disease, seizure disorders, and cardiac arrhythmias. 10. Participant has current or recent (within 6 months) gastrointestinal disease that would be expected to influence the absorption of drugs (that is, a history of malabsorption, esophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease, erosive esophagitis frequent [more than once per week] occurrence of heartburn, or any surgical intervention [example, cholecystectomy]). 11. Participant has a history of cancer, except basal cell carcinoma which has been in remission for at least 5 years prior to Day 1. 12. Participant has used nicotinecontaining products (including but not limited to cigarettes, pipes, cigars, chewing tobacco, nicotine patch or nicotine gum) within 28 days prior to Checkin Day 1. Cotinine test is positive at Screening or Checkin (Day 1). 13. The participant has poor peripheral venous access. 14. Participant has donated or lost 450 milliliter (mL) or more of his or her blood volume (including plasmapheresis), or had a transfusion of any blood product within 30 days prior to Day 1. 15. Vaccination with any live vaccine within 4 weeks of study drug administration. 16. Participant has a Screening or Checkin (Day 1) abnormal (clinically significant) electrocardiogram (ECG). Entry of any subject with an abnormal (not clinically significant) ECG must be approved, and documented by signature by the principal investigator medically qualified sub investigator. 17.

Participant has abnormal Screening or Day 1 laboratory values that suggest a clinically significant underlying disease or participant with the following lab abnormalities: 1. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;1.2* the upper limit of normal (ULN). 2. Positive screen test for drugs of abuse. 3.
