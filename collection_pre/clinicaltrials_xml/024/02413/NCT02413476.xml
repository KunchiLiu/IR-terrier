	<brief_summary>The study aims to compare the clinical outcomes between robotic-assisted and laparoscopic-assisted gastrectomy for gastric cancer,and evaluate the the feasibility and safety of robotic gastrectomy. Furthermore, the investigators can explore the patients who are more suitable for robotic gastrectomy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Surgical,Clinical and Oncological Outcomes Between Robotic-assisted and Laparoscopic-assisted Gastrectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective study lasting 36 months. Minimally invasive gastrectomy is accepted widely in Asian countries. Laparoscopic-assisted gastrectomy offers improved early postoperative outcomes and improved long-term oncologic outcomes,but it still has its own limitations.The advantages of robotic surgery include a 3D imagine, convenient movements of the robotic arm, no tremor, and ambidextrous capability. This study therefore aimed to compare the clinical results between robotic-assisted gastrectomy(RAG) using the da Vinci Surgical System and conventional laparoscopic-assisted gastrectomy(LAG) in gastric cancer patients.To evaluate the the feasibility and safety of robotic gastrectomy and explore the patients who are more suitable for robotic gastrectomy.</detailed_description>
