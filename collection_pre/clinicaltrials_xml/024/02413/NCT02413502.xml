	<brief_summary>The objective of this protocol is to obtain biological samples through leukapheresis and cryopreservation of cells for the future study, by in vitro assay, of immune responses after one dose of BCG in BCG-naïve healthy adults.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Leukapheresis Sampling for Immune Responses After BCG Vaccination in BCG-naïve Healthy Adults in the US</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label protocol in 12 healthy adults who are BCG-naïve. All participants will receive a single dose of BCG, by percutaneous administration, on Study Day 0. There will be two follow-up visits on Study Days 54 and 56, with telephone contact every 2 weeks in between these visits. Leukapheresis will be conducted on Study Days 0 and 56. The Study Day 56 leukapheresis was selected based on results from functional biological assays that suggest analysis of samples at this time point may provide insight into the protective immune responses elicited by BCG. The study will be conducted at a single site in the US (University of Rochester Medical Center [URMC]).</detailed_description>
