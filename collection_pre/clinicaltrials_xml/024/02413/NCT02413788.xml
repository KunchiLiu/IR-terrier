	<brief_summary>Inflammatory markers have been analyzed in several diseases of unknown etiology, in the expectation of increasing therapeutic perspectives. This possibility arises from the different levels of tissue injury with low-grade chronic inflammation that have been observed in studies in which the markers were not evaluated traditionally, and today have influenced clinical management. The investigators aimed, therefore, to evaluate the inflammatory markers in patients with AIS before and after aerobic and combined exercise training.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Aerobic Training and Combined in Inflammatory Markers in Patients With Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inflammatory markers have not been evaluated in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), but this deformity potentially involves various musculoskeletal structures permanently, which justifies the analysis. A low-grade chronic inflammation may be related to the lower capacity in exercise performance observed in this population, which must be stimulated to perform standardized physical activity.</detailed_description>
