	<brief_title>PackHealth: Asthma Engagement Tool</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient engagement is a critical part of improving patient care and outcomes. Current patient engagement strategies only focus on the patient-physician interaction and have been shown to be ineffective. The need for a comprehensive approach to patient engagement is no different among patients with asthma as it is in any other chronic condition.

Obtaining, communicating, processing, and understanding non- biased health information are crucial in making appropriate and informed treatment decisions. Pack Health LLC and Duke will develop a patient engagement toolkit known as "Packs" to help empower and engage patients.
