	<brief_summary>1. To assess the acute and long-term bimodal efficacy of iloperidone (IL), as an adjunct to ongoing treatment with lithium (Li) or divalproex (DIV) or lamotrigine (LAM) or any combination of the three thereof, in a group of patients with an index episode of a mixed state in BD. 2. To assess background, baseline features, and behavioral components which characterize treatment response/non-response in the acute and long term management of MS</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Iloperidone in Mixed States of Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective 20-week, open-label study of iloperidone added to ongoing treatment regimen with mood stabilizers (Li or DIV or LAM or any combination of these) in the acute and maintenance treatment of MS- Total number of subjects: 40. Severity of the illness and psychopathological features will be measured by the following rating scales: YMRS, MADRS, CGI-S and GAS, and the BISS . The study will monitor the safety and tolerability of the combination iloperidone plus mood stabilizers. Efficacy Measures: Primary efficacy measures include 1) Mixed effects repeat measure of change from baseline in BISS total score and, secondarily, manic and depression subscale scores. Secondary Efficacy Measures: 1) response defined as 50% reduction in YMRS and MADRS and 2) Time to intervention or discontinuation for any mood episode. Iloperidone will be initiated at 2 mg at hs on day 1 with increase to 4mg at hs on day 2, 8 mg at hs on day 3. All patients will have iloperidone titrated to receive a dosage of at least 12 mg a day. Dosages can be titrated up to 24 mg a day based on tolerability and clinical indication. Dosage of iloperidone can be reduced to 6 mg a day if patients develop side effects necessitating a reduction in the dosage</detailed_description>
