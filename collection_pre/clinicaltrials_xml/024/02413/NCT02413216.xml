	<brief_summary>Tic Disorders (including Tourette Disorder) are relatively common in school-age children and for some children can lead to significant psychosocial and physical impairment and diminished quality of life. Non-pharmacological treatments have been shown to be effective for reducing tics in some children. These treatment options are desired by parents, but are not widely available. The investigators recently developed an online, computerized, self-administered version of CBIT called TicHelper.com. The current study will test the efficacy of TicHelper.com in a randomized clinical trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TicHelper: A Computerized Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Effective non-pharmacological treatment options such as comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics (CBIT) have been shown to be effective for reducing tics in some children with chronic tic disorders, including Tourette's disorder. Although effective, many parents and children do not have access to a provider trained in these therapies and practical barriers such as travel and high costs for ongoing therapy limit treatment dissemination and utilization.The investigators recently developed an online, computerized, self-administered version of CBIT called TicHelper.com. This program is an 8-week online program designed to teach children and families empirically-supported tic management skills. The current study will test the efficacy of TicHelper.com in a randomized clinical trial in which 64 children with Tourette's Disorder or a persistent (chronic) tic disorder will be randomly assigned to 8-weeks of TicHelper.com (N=32) or an 8-week internet resource control condition (N=32). Tic symptoms will be assessed by a condition-blind independent evaluator at baseline, post-treatment, and 1-month follow-up. Information regarding patient acceptability of the program will also be collected. This project will test whether TicHelper.com is an efficacious and acceptable way to teach tic-management skills for children with tics.</detailed_description>
