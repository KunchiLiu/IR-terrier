	<detailed_description>Study design: it's a A prospective, open-label, multicenter, single-arm study. After a one- to two-week screening period, subjects receive Nifedipine GITS 60mg for 8 weeks. The primary objective is to evaluate the antihypertensive efficacy of 8-week Nifedipine GITS 60mg treatment in Chinese hypertensive subjects who failed to achieve BP control with the starting-dose antihypertensive mono-therapy. The secondary objective is to evaluate the tolerability of Nifedipine GITS 60mg.</detailed_description>
