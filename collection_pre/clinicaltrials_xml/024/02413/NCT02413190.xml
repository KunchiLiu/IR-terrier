	<brief_summary>This is a cross-sectional single visit study to determine bone health in individuals with FSHD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bone Health in Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bone health will be assessed using 1) a DEXA scan to measure bone mineral density and lean body mass, and 2) blood tests of biomarkers of bone resorption and formation. These procedures will be correlated to measures of muscle strength testing and timed function tests to determine fracture risk in FSHD individuals considering age, gender, muscle strength and FSHD allele size.</detailed_description>
