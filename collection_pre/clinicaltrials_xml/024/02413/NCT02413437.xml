	<brief_title>A Trial on Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound Versus Conventional Ultrasound Guided Biopsy of Liver Neoplasms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patients with liver neoplasms who need receive percutaneous biopsy were randomized into contrast-enhanced ultrasound(CEUS) group and conventional ultrasound(US) group.The aims include: 1. Comparison the diagnostic accuracy rate, specificity and sensitivity between CEUS and US group. 2. Comparison the diagnostic accuracy rate specificity and sensitivity between smaller(＜3cm) and larger(≥3cm) nodule group. 3. To explore operating strategy of contrast-enhanced ultrasound guided biopsy. 4. To evaluate economic efficiency of contrast-enhanced ultrasound guided biopsy compared with conventional ultrasound guided biopsy.</detailed_description>
