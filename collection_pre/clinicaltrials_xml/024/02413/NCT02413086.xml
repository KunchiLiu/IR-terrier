	<brief_summary>Diabetic Foot as the popular chronic complications of diabetes, is one of the main factors leading to limb amputation, it was reported that the amputation rate is 15 times of the non-diabetic patients. Common surgical amputation is not only about high plane amputation but also bring a tremendous mental stress to patients which may affect the quality of life seriously. Diabetic foot patients facing the great risk of serious infection, endotoxemia , and septic shock which could be the main cause of death before amputation. It become an important topic that how to control the infection, reduce the amputation plane, save the function as possibility, and improve the life quality of the patients as well. This study is based on years of clinical experience of and brings out "early-stage amputation" concept firstly in China with a systematic exposition, experimental research and clinical research. Early-stage amputation refers to cut in the normal tissue from the inflammatory tissue at the junction line of limbs, in order to achieve more retained stump, block endotoxin absorption and improve the quality of life of patients. External therapy of herbs chitosan can promote granulation tissue regeneration and control of local infection, it solved the problem of difficult wound healing and it is a reliable guarantee of early-stage amputation.</brief_summary>
