	<brief_summary>Intensive Care Unit (ICU) acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, is a frequently occurring health-care associated infection, which causes considerable morbidity, mortality and health care costs. Important pathogens causing ICU pneumonia are Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The epidemiology of ICU pneumonia and patient-related and contextual factors is not fully described, but is urgently needed to support the development of effective interventions.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Participant is 18 years or older at the time of enrollment. 2. Participant is on mechanical ventilation at ICU admission, or is (expected to be) within 24 hours thereafter, based on investigator's judgment. 3. Expected stay in ICU is 48 hours or longer based on investigator's judgment. 4. SA colonization status is known within 72 hours after start of first episode of mechanical ventilation and according to the result, the patient qualifies for enrollment. 5.
