	<brief_summary>The patients with complications of COPD and asthma have features mixed with two diseases, COPD and asthma. Therefore, the outcomes are worsened if the patients with COPD have symptoms overlapped with asthma, however, no sufficient data exist in Japan for estimating the prevalence of ACOS in patients with COPD. The primary objective of this NIS is to clarify the proportion of ACOS defined by GINA and GOLD in patients with COPD. The main secondary objectives are To explore the features of history of COPD exacerbations, symptoms, eosinophilic inflammation and patient background in patients with ACOS, to clarify the history of COPD exacerbations in patients with COPD, to evaluate the degrees of eosinophilic inflammation of the respiratory tract in patients with COPD and to evaluate the symptoms in patients with COPD. This is a cross-sectional study targeting COPD patients receiving outpatient treatment and follow-up by physicians in Japan. FSI is scheduled as 2Q 2015 and DBL would be locked by 3Q 2015.</brief_summary>
