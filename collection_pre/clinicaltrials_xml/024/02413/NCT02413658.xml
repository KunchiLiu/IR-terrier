	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential healing properties of phenytoin. The investigators will use the donor site of a split skin thickness graft (SSTG) to model a basic wound in a randomized controlled trial of topical phenytoin against current best clinical practice. The investigators aim to demonstrate a dose dependent effect. The investigators hypothesis, based on previous clinical experience at our center and on current available literature, that phenytoin will reduce wound healing time.</brief_summary>
