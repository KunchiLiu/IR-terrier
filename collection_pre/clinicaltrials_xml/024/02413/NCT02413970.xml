	<brief_title>Inspire® Post-Approval Study / Protocol Number 2014-001</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, prospective, single-arm study conducted under a common protocol. Each subject will serve as their own control. Each subject will be followed for 5 years from date of implant. Potential study subjects will be considered for study participation and consented once pre-implant screening and implant qualification process have been completed. This includes an in-lab PSG, surgical consultation, and a drug-induced sleep endoscopy procedure. This study will collect pre-operative baseline data including, verification of ineffective CPAP treatment, PSG information, medical history and subject quality of life measures. Intra- and post- operative procedure data will be collected. Post-implant, procedure- and device-related adverse events, QoL questionnaires, Functional Tongue Exam, therapy usage and device adjustment data will be collected. In-lab PSG sleep study data will be collected during the 2-month and 1 &amp; 3 year follow-up visits, home sleep tests will be conducted and data collected at the 6-month and 2, 4, &amp; 5 year follow-up visits. The subject population will consist of otherwise healthy men and women that are at least 22 years old and have: 1) Provided written informed consent to participate, 2) Indicated a willingness to comply with the study requirements for the specified follow-up duration, and 3) Met all inclusion and exclusion criteria of this protocol. Up to 127 subjects will be implanted at a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 20 qualified sites in the United States.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Sleep Apnea, Obstructive</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Likely suffer moderatetosevere OSA based on history and physical or have an established diagnosis of OSA (20≤AHI≤65) based on a prior inlab Polysomnography 2. Documentation the subject not effectively treated with CPAP therapy. (Examples include noncompliance, discomfort, undesirable side effects, symptoms persist despite use). Subjects who have been prescribed, but refuse to try CPAP would be considered intolerant. 3. Age 22 or above 4. Willing and capable to have stimulation hardware permanently implanted, and to use the patient remote to activate the stimulation 5. Willing and capable to return for all followup visits and conduct sleep studies at home, including the evaluation procedures and filling out questionnaires 6. Willing and capable of providing informed consent Contraindications: 1. Central + mixed apneas &gt; 25% of the total apneahypopnea index (AHI) 2. Any anatomical finding that would compromise the performance of upper airway stimulation, such as the presence of complete concentric collapse of the soft palate 3. Any condition or procedure that has compromised neurological control of the upper airway 4. Patients who are unable or do not have the necessary assistance to operate the patient remote 5. Patients who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant 6. Patients who will require magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 7. Patients with an implantable device that may be susceptible to unintended interaction with the Inspire system. Additional exclusions for study purposes only: 1. Body Mass Index (BMI) of &gt; 32 2. Any chronic medical illness or condition that contraindicates a surgical procedure under general anesthesia, as judged by the clinical study Investigator 3. Has a terminal illness with life expectancy &lt; 12 months 4. Active psychiatric disease (psychotic illness, major depression, or acute anxiety attacks) which prevents subject compliance with the requirements of the investigational study testing 5. Any other reason the investigator deems subject is unfit for participation in the study</criteria>
