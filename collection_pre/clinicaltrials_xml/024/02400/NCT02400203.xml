	<brief_title>FREE Living Hulled HEMP Seed and Oil Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial will be a 4 week double-blinded, randomized, cross-over design with 2 treatment intervention (hemp and control) periods separated by a 4 week washout period. Thirty metabolically healthy overweight volunteers will be recruited into the trial. On day 1, and 27, 28 of each treatment period participants will be asked to come to the Richardson Center for Functional Foods and Nutraceuticals (RCFFN) for a 12 hour fasted blood sample. On day 1, participants will be given prepackaged sachets of treatment hulled seeds (hemp or sesame) and salad dressing, containing 30 g/d of treatment (hemp or soybean) oil (in individually packaged daily containers) will also be supplied. Participants will be instructed by clinical coordinators to integrate the products (2 sachets of seeds, 1 salad dressing) into their daily meals and to avoid other dietary sources of n-3 fatty acids, such as flax, chia, camelina, krill and fish products. Participants will be given activity monitors to wear during the intervention periods. Participants will be required to eat one sachet of hulled seeds in the morning and one in the evening, and to consume the dressing throughout the day, for each 4 week treatment period. Participants will be asked to continue their habitual diets, while avoiding large dietary sources of n-3 fatty acids, throughout the treatment and washout periods. Participants will be instructed to maintain the same level of physical activity and alcohol intake throughout the trial period. The trial coordinator will contact participants weekly via telephone or email to monitor treatment adherence and to answer any questions or concerns participants might have. Background dietary intakes will be measured at day 1 of the trial using a food frequency questionnaire, and during each treatment period by 3-day food record to be completed in the last week of each treatment period. Participants will be asked questions about the interventions including side effects, mood and perceived energy level by trial coordinators at the end of each intervention period.</detailed_description>
