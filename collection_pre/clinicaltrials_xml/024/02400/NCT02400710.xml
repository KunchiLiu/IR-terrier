	<brief_summary>PTSD Coach is a mobile application (app) that aims to teach individuals self-management strategies for symptoms of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Despite PTSD Coach's use of evidence-based cognitive behavioral strategies there is still a need to test the effectiveness of the app in managing PTSD symptoms. There is research evidence that self-management programs are often underutilized, but that clinician contact can increase patient involvement. The addition of clinician support may enhance the utilization and effectiveness of the PTSD Coach. In Phase 1 the investigators propose to conduct stakeholder interviews with primary care (PC) and mental health (MH) leadership staff to investigate barriers and facilitators to implementing Clinician-Supported (CS-PTSD Coach) to increase the uptake, use, and impact of PTSD Coach by PC patients. The interviews will inform the development of a CS-PTSD Coach protocol and manual that will be used in phase 2. In phase 2 the investigators propose to conduct a feasibility study where 30 (20 eligible) PC Veterans with diagnostic-level or subthreshold PTSD symptoms will be randomized to receive Self-Managed (SM) PTSD Coach or CS-PTSD Coach. The investigators' specific aims are to 1) investigate the feasibility of recruiting and retaining participants and delivering the SM and CS conditions and 2) conduct a preliminary investigation of the efficacy of SM vs. CS. The investigators predict that CS will lead to greater treatment gains than SM. Effect sizes will be generated for the following outcomes: a) reductions in PTSD, depression, and general distress, and increases in health-related functioning, b) increases in knowledge about PTSD symptoms, PTSD management strategies, and patient coping self-efficacy, c) increases in initiation of tradition PTSD treatments.</brief_summary>
