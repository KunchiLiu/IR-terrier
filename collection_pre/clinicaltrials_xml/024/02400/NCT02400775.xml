	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Effects of Azilsartan on Coronary Artery Plaque in Essential Hypertensive Patients With Stable Angina and Dyslipidemia.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The open-label design without a control group was selected because this clinical study primarily aims to explore the effects of azilsartan on coronary artery plaques. This study targeting patients with coronary artery plaque has been designed to enroll hypertensive patients with dyslipidemia. Also in light of the invasive nature of the major assessment procedures (i.e., IB-IVUS, OCT), this study will only enroll patients with stable angina planned to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement, among patients with coronary artery plaque. The starting dose of azilsartan has been set to 20 mg on the basis of the usual clinical dose of the drug in patients with essential hypertension, and dose increase of azilsartan will be permitted only when the target blood pressure has not been achieved. The duration of treatment has been set to 32 weeks in line with clinical practice, in which coronary angiography is typically performed after a 32-week follow-up period following PCI with stent placement.</detailed_description>

Patients with dyslipidemia meeting both of the following criteria: Patients treated with one HMGCoA reductase inhibitor with no change in the dosage for at least 12 weeks before informed consent Patients with an LDLC level of &lt; 100 mg/dL as shown by a laboratory test performed within 4 weeks before informed consent 5. Men or women aged 20 or older at the time of informed consent 6. Patients capable of making outpatient study visits throughout the observation period 7. Patients who, in the opinion of the principal investigator or investigator, are capable of understanding the contents of the clinical study and complying with the study requirements 8. Patients capable of providing written consent in person before any study procedures 1. Patients with secondary hypertension or malignant hypertension 2.

Patients with an HbA1c level (National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program [NGSP] value) of ≥ 7.0% as shown by a laboratory test performed within 4 weeks before informed consent 7. Patients with the plaque unevaluable because of severe calcification of the coronary artery shown by IBIVUS to be performed before the start of study treatment (Week 0) 8. Patients with a change to their antidyslipidemic medication (including a change to the dosage) within 12 weeks before informed consent 9.
