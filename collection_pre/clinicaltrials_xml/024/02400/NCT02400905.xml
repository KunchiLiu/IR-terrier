	<brief_summary>To demonstrate that the BioMimics 3D Stent System meets the performance goals defined by VIVA Physicians, Inc. for the safety and effectiveness of Nitinol stents used in the treatment of symptomatic disease of the femoropopliteal artery. It is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter clinical trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Safety and Effectiveness of the BioMimics 3D Stent System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The BioMimics 3D stent is intended to improve luminal diameter in the treatment of symptomatic de-novo, obstructive or occlusive lesions in native femoropopliteal arteries with reference vessel diameters ranging from 4.0 - 6.0 mm. Subjects with symptomatic atherosclerotic disease of the femoropopliteal artery who comply with all study eligibility criteria may be considered for enrollment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of the lower extremities requiring intervention to relieve de novo obstruction or occlusion of the native femoropopliteal artery. PAD classified as Rutherford clinical category 2, 3 or 4. Resting anklebrachial index (ABI) of ≤0.90 (or ≤0.75 after exercise of the target limb) or angiographic or DUS evidence of &gt;/= 60%. Single or multiple stenotic or occlusive lesions within the native femoropopliteal artery ("target lesions") that can be crossed with a guidewire and fully dilated. Single or multiple target lesions must be covered by a single stent or two overlapping stents. Target lesion(s) eligible for treatment at least 1 cm distal to the origin of the deep femoral artery and at least 3 cm above the bottom of the femur. Target lesion(s) reference vessel diameter is between 4.0 mm and 6.0 mm. Single or multiple target lesions measure ≥40 mm to ≤140 mm in overall length, with ≥60% diameter stenosis by operator's visual estimate. Patent popliteal artery (no stenosis ≥50%) distal to the treated segment. At least one patent infrapopliteal vessel (&lt;50% stenosis) with runoff to the ankle. Iliac stent in target limb that has required reintervention within 12 months prior to index. Target vessel that has been treated with bypass surgery. PAD classified as Rutherford clinical category 0, 1, 5 or 6. Known coagulopathy or has bleeding diatheses, thrombocytopenia with platelet count less than 100,000/microliter or INR &gt;1.8. Stroke diagnosis within 3 months prior to enrollment. History of unstable angina or myocardial infarction within 60 days prior to enrollment. Thrombolysis within 72 hours prior to the index procedure. Acute or chronic renal disease (e.g., as measured by a serum creatinine of &gt;2.5 mg/dL or &gt;220 umol/L), or on peritoneal or hemodialysis. Significant disease or obstruction (≥50%) of the inflow tract that has not been successfully treated at the time of the index procedure (success measured as ≤30% residual stenosis, without complication). No patent (≥50% stenosis) outflow vessel providing runoff to the ankle. Target lesion(s) requires percutaneous interventional treatment, beyond standard balloon angioplasty alone, prior to placement of the study stent.</criteria>
