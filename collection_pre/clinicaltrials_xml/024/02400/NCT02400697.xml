	<brief_summary>The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization have recently published recommendations related to placental transfusions in preterm infants. This project will review outcomes of preterm infants following a quality improvement implementation process in several delivery centers in Indiana. Centers involved in this project are also part of the Indiana Vermont Oxford Network (IRB#1003-84). Data is recorded for that network and the investigators site will be reviewing that data every 3 months from infants who have completed the Vermont Oxford Network collection. This project will specifically look at the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing entercolitis, periventricular leukomalacia, sepsis and death following the implementation of the ACOG recommendations.</brief_summary>
