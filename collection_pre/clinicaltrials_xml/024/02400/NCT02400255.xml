	<brief_summary>This is a single-arm, Phase II study of crenolanib as maintenance in AML patients with FLT3 mutations who have achieved complete remission (CR) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Oral crenolanib will be administered daily post-transplant for up to two years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Crenolanib Maintenance Following Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation in FLT3-positive Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are two patient subgroups: 1) those who were in complete remission (CR) at the time of transplant, and 2) those who were not in complete remission (NCR) at the time of transplant. Start of crenolanib therapy at 100 mg TID is intended at the earliest time no sooner than 30 days but no later than 90 days after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Patients may take crenolanib continuously for up to 728 days or until one of the criteria for study discontinuation is fulfilled.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. History of AML according to World Health Organization (WHO) classification 2. First allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using myeloablative conditioning (MAC), nonmyeloablative (NMA), or reducedintensity conditioning (RIC) preparative regimens. 3. FLT3ITD or FLT3D835 positive disease at any time during disease course. 4. Hematopoietic stem cell source is either with peripheral blood, bone marrow or cord blood. 5. Donor source is matched related, unrelated, haploidentical donor or cord blood. 6. At the time of allogeneic HSCT: 1. No more than 1 antigen mismatch at HLAA, B, C, DRB1 or DQB1 locus for unrelated donor with peripheral blood and bone marrow as the hematopoietic stem cell source; and 2. Bone marrow blast ≤ 10% 7. No sooner than 45 days but no later than 90 days after allogeneic HSCT. 8. Posttransplant bone marrow blast count ≤ 5% confirmed by standard of care bone marrow biopsy performed posttransplant (at least 30 days posttransplant). 9. Evidence of donor engraftment as defined by institutional standard T cell chimerism &gt; 50%. 10. Adequate engraftment within 7 days prior to starting study therapy: ANC ≥ 1.0 x 109/L without daily use of myeloid growth factor; and platelet ≥ 25 x 109/L without platelet transfusion within 1 week 11. Nonhematological toxicities ≤ Grade 2 12. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN OR creatinine clearance ≥ 50mL/min/1.73 m2 for subjects with creatinine levels above institutional normal 13. Adequate liver function with serum AST, ALT and bilirubin within the normal range at the time of crenolanib commencement 14. Acute graftversushost disease (GVHD) ≤ Grade 1, either no signs of chronic GVHD or mild chronic GVHD graded as limited disease 15. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 02 16. Age ≥ 18 years with the capacity to give written informed consent 17. Nonpregnant and nonnursing women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test ("Women of childbearing potential" is defined as a sexually active mature woman who has not undergone a hysterectomy or who has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months) 18. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation and for 90 days following completion of therapy 1. Active GVHD grade ≥ 2 2. Concurrent use of corticosteroids equivalent of prednisone at a dose &gt; 0.5 mg/kg 3. Active and/or untreated central nervous system (CNS) leukemia 4. Concomitant therapies for treatment or control of leukemia. 5. Use of any of the following after transplantation and prior to starting study therapy: 1. Chemotherapeutic agents for therapy of AML (note that prophylactic use of these agents is allowed in this study, e.g., methotrexate for GVHD) 2. Investigational agents/therapies 3. Azacitidine, decitabine or other demethylating agents 4. Lenalidomide, thalidomide and pomalidomide 6. Uncontrolled infection 7. Known positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); active hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) infection 8. Significant cardiac disease (New York Heart Association classes III or IV) or unstable angina despite medication 9. Pregnant or breastfeeding 10. Receipt of investigational agents within 5 halflives of last dose of investigational agent 11. Prior treatment with crenolanib with progression on treatment</criteria>
