	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of stereotactic lung radiation therapy after concomitant radiochemotherapy for unresectable stage III non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with peripheral primary tumor. Evaluate in terms of local control rate at 6 months the addition of stereotactic radiotherapy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of mediastinal non-resectable stage III NSCLC having a peripheral primary tumor. The number of patients required in this multicenter prospective study is 70. This is a prospective, multicenter, non comparative and non randomized study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Efficacy of SBRT on Unresectable Peripheral Primary Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stereotactic radiotherapy or SBRT (Body Stereotactic Radiation Therapy) allows to irradiate with high dose limited lesions size with a local control surrounding of 80-98% and with a low level of toxicity. We propose to realize a classic concomitant RT-CT for mediastinal irradiation and combine this treatment with stereotactic RT for peripheral primary tumor. The estimated inclusion period is approximately 3 years. Follow-up duration for each patient is 2 years. The duration of the research is 5 years.</detailed_description>
