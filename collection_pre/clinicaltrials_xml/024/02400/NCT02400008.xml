	<brief_summary>Selective laryngeal bilateral reinnervation as a secondary treatment in patients with bilateral vocal fold paralysis, previously treated by endoscopy, without residual arytenoids ankylosis. The surgical procedure is : functional reinnervation with the upper root of one phrenic nerve, is used for reinnervation of both cricoarytenoid muscles (laryngeal inspiratory muscles), and simultaneous reinnervation of adductor laryngeal muscles is performed by right and left thyro -hyoid nerves (coming from the hypoglossi) on both sides. Results are obtained after 6 to 9 months delay. In case of good inspiratory arytenoid abduction, and residual dysphonia, a secondary vocal fold medialization is done by an endoscopic approach 12 months after reinnervation (included in the protocol). Improvement is expected in voice and breathing, without aspiration.</brief_summary>
