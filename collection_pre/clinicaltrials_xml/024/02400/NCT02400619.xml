	<brief_summary>Spasticity is a motor disorder that can affect the lower limbs in up to 75% patients with cerebral palsy, having a significantly effect on their mobility and quality of life. There is much controversy about what is the most appropriate treatment of spasticity The objective of the present study is to evaluate the effects of radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT) compared to treatment with botulinum toxin to improve spasticity in patients with cerebral palsy The number needed of patients is 70 (35 per group). Leaving a period of washout between one therapy and the other</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Shockwaves Therapy and Botulinum Toxin for the Treatment of Spasticity in Patients With Cerebral Palsy. A Cross Over RCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Outcome Measures: The primary outcome will be to measure spasticity with passive range of motion of the foot (pROM) by muscular extensibility and its traction reflex using goniometryIt will be assessed at baseline before the treatment, as well as after 3 weeks, 2 months, 3 months, after the washout period (3months), 3 months and 3 weeks, 5 months and 6 months, when the end the intervention. Secondary outcome includes: 1) Pain will be assessed with Visual Analog Scale (VAS) after the first application of each therapy. 2) Ascertain if the type of Gross Motor Functional Classification System (GMFCS) has an influence on the improvement of these two treatments; 3) Assess whether infiltration of Botulinum Toxin in other muscle groups have influence on the results of study; and 4) Undergo a qualitative registration to know the perception and experience that patient/family will have during this study, through a satisfaction questionnaire.</detailed_description>
