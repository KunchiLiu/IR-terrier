	<brief_summary>This pilot phase I trial compares administration schedules of anti-programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibody MPDL3280A and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy in treating patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MPDL3280A, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy, also known as stereotactic body radiation therapy, is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MPDL3280A with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy may be a better treatment for non-small cell lung cancer. However, it is not yet known what the best administration schedule is for these treatments.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine which administration schedule of MPDL3280A (anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MPDL3280A) and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SAR) will be most promising to move forward to a phase II trial based on safety and objective response rate. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To define the safety and toxicity profile of MPDL3280A plus SAR using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4 (v4). II. Radiographic response rates by immure-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST). III. Progression free survival using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and irRECIST. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Conduct correlative immunologic endpoints. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 arms. ARM I (CONCURRENT COHORT): Patients receive anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MPDL3280A intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning on day 1 of course 1, patients also undergo SAR 2-3 times per week (with a minimum of 40 hours and a maximum of 96 hours between fractions) over 1.5-2 weeks for a total of 5 fractions. ARM II (INDUCTION COHORT): Patients receive anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MPDL3280A IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning on day 1 of course 3, patients also undergo SAR 2-3 times per week (with a minimum of 40 hours and a maximum of 96 hours between fractions) over 1.5-2 weeks for a total of 5 fractions. ARM III (SEQUENTIAL COHORT): Patients undergo SAR 2-3 times per week (with a minimum of 40 hours and a maximum of 96 hours between fractions) over 1.5-2 weeks for a total of 5 fractions beginning on day 1 of course 1. After completion of SAR (beginning on day 1 of course 2), patients receive anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MPDL3280A IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.</detailed_description>
