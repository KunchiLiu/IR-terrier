	<brief_summary>The study is a multi-center, prospective, open label, uncontrolled feasibility study enrolling 30 patients with refractory or recurrent ascites and cirrhosis at up to 6 sites. Patients will be enrolled during a 6 month enrollment phase after which data will be collected for 12months with an initial analysis after 3 months. Extended follow-up for safety monitoring purposes will continue for the lifetime of the patient or until the device is explanted.</brief_summary>
