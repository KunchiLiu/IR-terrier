	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, safety, and tolerability of oral GS-9883 in adults with impaired renal function relative to matched, healthy controls with normal renal function. Each participant in the renal impairment groups will be matched for age (± 10 years), gender, and body mass index [BMI (± 20%, 18 ≤ BMI ≤ 40 kg/m^2)] with a participant in the control group.</brief_summary>
