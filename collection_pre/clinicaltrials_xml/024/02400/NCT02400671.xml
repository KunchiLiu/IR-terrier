	<brief_summary>The investigators are conducting a 3-arm randomized trial comparing the effects of unidirectional SMS (ie: "push" messaging to participant) vs. bidirectional SMS dialogue between participant and provider vs. control (no SMS) among HIV-infected Kenyan mothers in Kenyan PMTCT-ART for outcomes of ART adherence and retention in care.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators will compare trial arms for impact on maternal retention, adherence, virologic failure and resistance and infant HIV or HIV-free survival. The investigators will determine correlates of maternal loss to follow-up and virologic failure and correlates of infant HIV in the overall study and stratified by trial arm. In the bidirectional SMS arm, the investigators will determine the rate of SMS interactivity, impact of critical time-points on messaging, and characteristics of high and low 'interactors'. The investigators will determine cost-effectiveness of unidirectional and bidirectional SMS interventions. These data will contribute a potential scale-able strategy to improve PMTCT-ART as programs aspire to 'virtual elimination' of infant HIV.</detailed_description>
