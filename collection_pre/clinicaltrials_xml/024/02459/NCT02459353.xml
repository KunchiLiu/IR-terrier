	<brief_summary>Dapagliflozin improves glycemic variability in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus when added to insulin therapy. The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of dapagliflozin on glucose variability compared to placebo after 12 weeks of treatment in type 2 diabetic patients with inadequate glycemic control on insulin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Dapagliflozin on Glycemic Variability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 4 study to evaluate whether treatment with dapagliflozin add-on to insulin reduces glucose variability in type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. The study will recruit type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients with inadequate glucose control on insulin treatment with or without metformin or sulphonylurea. It is estimated that 90 type 2 diabetic patients will be enrolled. After randomization, a total 12 week treatment of dapagliflozin or matching placebo will be administered. Before and after treatment, tests for efficacy and safety outcomes will be performed.</detailed_description>
