	<brief_summary>Part A: The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a potential vaccine against Group B streptococcus. Part B: To evaluate the long term safety profile of the GBS-NN vaccine up to one year following the first dose.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Immunogenicity of a Group B Streptococcus Vaccine in Non-pregnant Women 18-40 Years of Age.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part A: Subjects will receive 2 doses of the vaccine, GBS-NN, and will be followed for 12 weeks after the first dose of the vaccine. The following safety endpoints will be evaluated to support this objective: local and systemic reactogenicity; adverse events; laboratory tests; urinalysis; vital signs; 12-Lead ECG parameters; physical examination. In addition hereto, immunological parameters will be evaluated. Part B: Subjects will receive one or 2 doses of GBS-NN, and will be followed for 12 months after the first dose of the vaccine. The following safety endpoints will be evaluated to support this objective: local and systemic reactogenicity; adverse events; laboratory tests; urinalysis; vital signs; 12-Lead ECG parameters; physical examination. In addition hereto, immunological parameters will be evaluated.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Healthy adult female volunteers (as determined by medical history, physical examination, laboratory test values, vital signs and electrocardiograms [ECGs] at screening) aged 18 40 years. 2. Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18 and ≤ 30 kg/m2. 3. Volunteers weight ≥ 50kg and ≤100kg at screening. 4. Able to voluntarily provide written informed consent to participate in the study. 5. Must understand the purposes and risks of the study and agree to follow the restrictions and schedule of procedures as defined in the protocol. 6. Volunteers must be premenopausal. Volunteers who have had a hysterectomy will have premenopausal status confirmed by a FSH and oestradiol test. 7. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening (β HCG) and prior to each dose and must be willing to use an adequate and highly effective method of contraception until at least Day 85 of the study. A highly effective method of birth control is defined as one which results in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly such as sterilisation, implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, IUDs (Intrauterine Device), condoms, occlusive caps (cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/ film/cream/suppository. True sexual abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the volunteer (periodic abstinence e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods, declaration of abstinence for the duration of the trial, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception) 8. In Part A: Volunteers must be nonsmokers for at least 3 months prior to first studyvaccine administration. In Part B: Volunteers may be light smokers i.e. up to a maximum of 5 cigarettes per day or nicotine equivalent. 9. Must be willing to consent to have data entered into The Over Volunteering Prevention System (TOPS). 10. The volunteer's primary care physician has confirmed within the last 12 months that there is nothing in their medical history that would preclude their enrolment into a clinical trial. 1. Volunteers with history or presence of significant cardiovascular disease, pulmonary, hepatic, gallbladder or biliary tract, renal, haematological, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatological, neurological, psychiatric, autoimmune disease or current infection. 2. Pregnant or lactating females. 3. Laboratory values at screening which are deemed to be clinically significant, unless agreed in advance by the Sponsor's Responsible Medic and Principal Investigator. 4. Current or history of drug or alcohol abuse, or a positive alcohol breath test prior to first dosing. 5. Positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or hepatitis C. 6. Participation in a clinical drug study during the 90 days preceding the initial dose in this study. 7. Any significant illness during the 4 weeks preceding checkin for this study (Day 1). 8. Volunteers with a history of severe allergic reactions after previous vaccination. 9. Volunteers who have received any vaccine within 30 days of screening, or who are planning to receive a vaccine up to Day 85 of the study. 10. Volunteers receiving immunosuppressive therapy (e.g. systemic steroids, cancer therapies, methotrexate, azathioprine) in the 6 months prior to screening, antibiotics within 10 days of receiving the first dose or taking any shortterm medications including overthecounter preparations, vitamins, herbal and/or mineral supplements within 7 days of the first dose. Chronic medications such as antihypertensives, bronchodilators, oral contraceptives or statins that do not affect the immune system, will be permitted and allowed to continue during the study at the discretion of the Investigator. Paracetamol will be permitted for the treatment of headache or other symptoms. 11. Volunteers with tattoos at the proposed site of vaccine administration. 12. Donation of blood or blood products within 90 days prior to vaccine administration. 13. Volunteers who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are unsuitable for participation in the study.</criteria>
