	<brief_summary>Social processes that impact the health of individuals have been labeled the social determinants of health (SDOH). These are "the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age. These circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power and resources at global, national and local levels". Perhaps the most important SDOH is income security, a person's actual, perceived and expected income. Our objective is to carry out a pragmatic randomized controlled trial that evaluates the impact of an income-focused health promoter.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study aims to answer the question: What is the impact of an income security health promotion service based in a primary care setting on the income security of people living in poverty? Our hypothesis is that an income security health promotion service as a small but significant impact on the income security of a minority of participants. We will carry out a pragmatic randomized controlled trial that evaluates the impact of such a new service focused on income security health promotion. The St. Michael's Hospital Academic Family Health Team has received ongoing funding from the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOHLTC) to support this service. The primary outcome is income security, and secondary outcomes include quality of life, financial literacy and community integration. Population - Adults living in poverty Intervention - Income security health promotion Control - Usual care Outcome - Primary: Improvement in income per month. Secondary: quality of life, self-rated health, community engagement.</detailed_description>
