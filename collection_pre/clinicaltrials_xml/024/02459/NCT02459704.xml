	<brief_summary>The aim of this study will be evaluate clinically the use of the Semilunar Coronally Positioned Flap (SCPF) for the treatment of gingival recessions, with or without Enamel Matrix Derivative (EMD). Thirty patients will be assigned in two groups. Half of patients will receive EMD associated to SCPF, while the other half, will receive SCPF alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Semilunar Coronally Positioned Flap With or Without Enamel Matrix Derivative for the Treatment of Gingival Recessions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study will be evaluate clinically the use of the Semilunar Coronally Positioned Flap (SCPF) for the treatment of gingival recessions, with or without Enamel Matrix Derivative (EMD). Thirty patients will be selected, randomized and allocated in two groups: test group (SCPF + EMD) and control group (SCPF). The subjects will should present buccal Miller class I gingival recessions with height greater than or equal to 2.0 mm and less than to 4.0 mm in maxillary canines or premolars. Clinical parameters will be evaluated: gingival recession height (GRH), gingival recession width(GRW), clinical attachment level (CAL), probing depth (PD), height (HKT) and thickness (TKT) of keratinized tissue and papillas height (HP) and width(LP), as well as plaque and gingival index. These data will be collected at baseline and 180 days after surgery.</detailed_description>
