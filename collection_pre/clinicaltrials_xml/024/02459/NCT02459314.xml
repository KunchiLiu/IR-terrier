	<brief_summary>This was a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled-trial study in hypercholesterolemic volunteers (serum LDL-C &gt; 130 mg/dL). Eligible subjects were randomized to receive either plant sterol and soluble fiber-enriched soymilk or plain soymilk 360 mL/day (2 packages a day) for 8 weeks. Venous blood samples were collected from the eligible subjects during pre-treatment (screening period; day -7), every 2 week after treatment (at the end of week 2, 4, 6 and 8) to test for lipid profiles and fasting blood sugar (FBS).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of the Efficacy of Plant Sterol-Enriched Soymilk Versus Plain Soymilk in Volunteers With High LDL-Cholesterol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled-trial study in hypercholesterolemic volunteers (serum LDL-C &gt; 130 mg/dL). After initial assessment at the screening period, eligible subjects were randomized to receive either plant sterol and soluble fiber-enriched soymilk (SFSM) or plain soymilk (SM) 360 mL/day (2 packages a day) for 8 weeks. The participants might take the study product as snack, the first one in the morning and the second one in the afternoon. It was possible to take it before or after meal, however taken before meal was highly suggested. A physical examination (including vital signs, height, weight, body mass index, waist circumference, and systemic evaluation) was performed at each visit, every 2 weeks. Concurrent medications usage were record at each visit during the study as well. Three-day per week of food intake and weekly exercises were recorded and evaluated at every visit. It was recommended every participant to follow dietary control and lifestyle modification to improve hypercholesterolemia during the entire study. Details of overall product satisfaction were evaluated by the participants after 2 and 8 weeks of study products consumption (at visit 2 and 5). To evaluate compliance, the participants were asked to collect and return the empty packages to the investigator every 2 weeks at visit 2, 3, 4, and 5. More than 90% of study product consumption would be considered as eligible on-going subjects. Venous blood samples were collected from the eligible subjects during pre-treatment (screening period; day -7), every 2 week after treatment (visit 2, 3, 4, 5; at the end of week 2, 4, 6 and 8) to test for lipid profiles and fasting blood sugar (FBS). Adverse events, if any, were recorded immediately after study enrollment.</detailed_description>
