	<brief_summary>The MOMS Partnership aims to create "MOMS Zones" in New Haven neighborhoods where the hardest to reach families live. These "MOMS Zones" will have two unique features: (1) a MOMS "Hub" to deliver centralized mental health and family economic success services to the hardest to reach families living in New Haven's most impoverished neighborhoods, as measured by actual socio-economic status as well as by access to resources; (2) a neighborhood workforce of Community Mental Health Ambassadors (CMHAs--mothers who themselves live in New Haven). The MOMS Workforce Program and MOMS Mental Health Program will be offered at all three Hubs.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The MOMs workforce program will involve teaching, coaching, and supportive services for participants as they navigate their journeys to sustainable employment that pays a family-supporting wage. Participants will be guided through an individualized progression of services designed to increase their employability, to increase their ability to earn higher incomes in career-track employment, and to improve their chances of retaining jobs and advancing in them. The MOMS Mental Health program centers around a manualized Stress Management Course 8-class group treatment, delivered once per week. The course was adapted from "The Mother and Child Course" by Munoz and Le (2011) for the population of New Haven mothers who are served by the MOMS Partnership.</detailed_description>
