	<brief_summary>Background: Chronic pain is one of the most burdensome potential consequences of a physical disability, such as spinal cord injury (SCI). Estimates of the incidence of chronic pain in SCI range between 65 - 80%. A recent pilot-study of a computer-based tailored positive psychology intervention showed a significant reduction in pain intensity, pain interference, pain catastrophizing and depression and an enhancement of subjective well-being and control over pain in persons with chronic pain secondary to a physical disability. Study Objective: Objective 1: To determine the efficacy of a tailored positive psychology intervention (T3P) in a community-based, single-blind, randomized, controlled, parallel group trial on subjective well-being and pain in individuals with chronic pain secondary to SCI. Hypothesis 1: T3P will result in (1) greater immediate and long-lasting increase in subjective well-being, and perceived control over pain and (2) greater immediate and long-lasting decrease in depression, pain intensity, pain interference and catastrophizing, relative to an active control treatment. Specific aim 1: To increase the understanding of the mechanisms underlying T3P by determining potential mediation effects. Hypothesis 2: (1) Pain catastrophizing and pain control mediate the effect of T3P on pain intensity, and (2) positive and negative affect mediate the effect of T3P on life satisfaction and depression. Objective 2: To identify for whom T3P is most effective by exploring potential moderator effects. Study Design: The proposed study is a single-blind, randomized, controlled trial with a parallel group design to determine the effects and mechanisms of T3P in a Swiss community sample of persons with chronic pain secondary to SCI.</brief_summary>
