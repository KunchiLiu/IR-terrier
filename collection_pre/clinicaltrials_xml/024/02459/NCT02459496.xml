	<brief_summary>Basic treatment of type 2 diabetes should focus on diet, physical activity and lifestyle. Nevertheless, in early and late stage of T2DM, lifestyle intervention is mostly substituted by pharmacological intervention, although lifestyle modification and dietary treatment would be favourable. The researchers therefore investigate dietary strategies such as low-carb and very-low calory diets regarding their potential to improve metabolism and body weight in (mostly) long-term T2DM patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Basic treatment of type 2 diabetes should focus on diet, physical activity and lifestyle. Nevertheless, in early and late stage of T2DM, lifestyle intervention is mostly substituted by pharmacological intervention, although lifestyle modification and dietary treatment would be favourable. The researchers therefore investigate dietary strategies such as low-carb diets and very-low calory diets regarding their potential to improve metabolism and body weight in (mostly) long-term T2DM patients. An intensive intervention of 3 weeks is followed by an 11-month maintenance phase to consolidate metabolic improvements.</detailed_description>
