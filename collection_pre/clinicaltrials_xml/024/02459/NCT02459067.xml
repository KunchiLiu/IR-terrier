	<brief_summary>To determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and efficacy of ImmuniCell® in patients with melanoma, renal cell cancer (RCC) or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study is an adaptive design that has 3 stages: Stage 1 - dose escalation, Stage 2 - efficacy, and Stage 3 - confirm efficacy in one of the tumor types.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ImmuniCell® in Patients With Advanced Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label trial of ImmuniCell® treatment of patients with malignant melanoma, renal cell cancer (RCC) or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) which are refractory to current treatment or who have indolent disease for which immunotherapy may be beneficial. The trial is designed to identify a safe dose of ImmuniCell® for future clinical trials, to identify a response signal from one or more of the cancers under investigation and to confirm the safety and efficacy in the selected target tumour. The trial has three stages: Stage I comprising a safety cohort of patients to identify a safe dose Stage II comprising an expanded patient group for response signal identification Stage III to confirm efficacy and safety.</detailed_description>
