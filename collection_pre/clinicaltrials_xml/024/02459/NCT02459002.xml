	<brief_title>Prospective Study to Determine Impact of Early Palliative Care Consult on Quality of Life (QOL), Cancer Related Symptoms In Advanced Lung Cancer Patients: Thoracic Pilot Project</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advanced lung cancer (ALC) will be assessed for participant outcomes in a sample which is prior initiation of palliative consultation and in a sample after the initiation of early palliative consultation. Study goals are: I. To determine the differences in participant outcomes including quality of life (QOL); symptom distress [Edmonton symptom assessment scale (ESAS)] and caregiver outcomes [Zarit Burden Interview {ZBI}, Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale(HADS) and FAMCARE] at week 12 in advanced lung cancer (ALC) patients receiving early palliative care consultation versus those who don't. II. Identify the cellular, molecular, and immune basis for the development of symptoms in patients with ALC.</detailed_description>

A caregiver will be defined as a spouse, first degree relative, or other person designated by the patient as providing direct assistance to the patient in his/her activities of daily living. 1. Patients to be excluded from the study will be those unable to complete the baseline assessment forms or to understand the recommendations for participation in this project. 2. Patients seen at the Thoracic center at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center after 8 weeks of the initial diagnosis (first cohort only patients using the current Palliative Care referral practices prior to the implementation of the early palliative care program).</criteria>
