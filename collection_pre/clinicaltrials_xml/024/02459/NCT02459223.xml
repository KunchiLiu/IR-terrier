	<brief_summary>Present study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of the nutritional intervention, in the SAM (Severe Acute malnutrition)children by monitoring various Anthropometric,Biochemical ,Hormonal and Enzymatic parameters before and after the nutritional intervention treatment.This study was also intended to study possible functional role of gene HRI (heme regulated inhibitor) as a molecular marker for the early detection of iron deficiency anemia in malnourished children similarly present study has also tried to find anthropometric marker and different correlations among study parameters.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Blood Parameters of the Malnourished Children: Before and After Giving Nutritional Biscuit's Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In India, child malnutrition is responsible for 22% of the country's burden of disease. Development of local therapeutic nutritional intervention is highly recommended by WHO. Present study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of the nutritional intervention, as well as to study HRI (heme regulated inhibitor) gene expression, to suggest it as a molecular marker for the early detection of iron deficiency anemia in malnourished children also to find anthropometric marker and different correlations of study parameters. 105 test and 100 control SAM (Severe Acute malnutrition) children without infection, of 1 to 5 years of age and either sex were enrolled. Test group was given treatment of nutritional intervention therapy (NIT), providing 2.5 to 3gm Protein and 90-100kcal/kg body Weight/day, for the three months period. Their Anthropometric, Enzymatic, Biochemical and Hormonal parameters were measured before and after the NIT. Correlation of serum triglyceride with weight for height% , as well as correlation of HRI with Mean corpuscular hemoglobin,(MCH) was studied. Similarly status of Hairs, Skin, oedema, WHO z- score,and BMR was also studied before and after the NIT.</detailed_description>
