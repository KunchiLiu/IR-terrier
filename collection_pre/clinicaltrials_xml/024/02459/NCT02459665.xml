	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study to prepare for larger clinical trials. Sixty HIV-negative, non-pregnant, sexually active women aged 18-45 with bacterial vaginosis (BV) by Amsel criteria and/or Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) on wet mount or by culture will be treated using oral metronidazole for 7 days. After successful treatment, and when they are free of vaginal candidiasis, other curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and urinary tract infection (UTI)), they will be randomised to 4 different vaginal microbiome (VMB) maintenance interventions (15 per group) within 3 days of completing oral metronidazole treatment: 1) Behavioral 'vaginal practices cessation and safer sex' counselling only (control); 2) Behavioral counselling plus 500mg metronidazole pills twice per week for two months; 3) Behavioral counselling plus Ecologic Femi vaginal capsule, once per day for 5 days immediately after oral metronidazole treatment followed by thrice weekly, for two months; 4) Group 4: Behavioral counselling plus Gynophilus vaginal tablet, once every 4 days for two months. In all 3 biomedical intervention groups, vaginal product use may be ceased temporarily during menstruation. Participants will be asked to adhere to the interventions for 2 months, and VMB assessments will take place before (screening and enrolment visits), during (Day 7, Month 1 and Month 2 visits), and after the interventions (Month 6 visit).</brief_summary>
