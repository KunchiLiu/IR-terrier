	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test preliminary efficacy, as well as acceptability and feasibility, of a dyadic exercise intervention, the current study will randomize LGBT cancer survivors and their non-professional caregivers as dyads to either an individual or a dyadic Exercise for Cancer Patients (EXCAP) intervention. The primary outcome assessed will be psychological distress. Analyses will involve pre-post comparisons of outcomes across the study arms, testing the hypothesis that a 6 week, daily, dyadic exercise intervention will result in greater improvements in psychological distress than an individual intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise Intervention for LGBT Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed randomized controlled trial aims to recruit 70 lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) cancer survivors who have completed treatment (surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy) within the past 24 months, so as to have a final, evaluable sample of 60 LGBT survivors after attrition. The proposed RCT will also recruit caregivers (broadly defined) of the above cancer survivors. Each recruited cancer survivor will be asked to name a person who they feel provided care (emotional, informational, tangible, etc.) during their cancer experience, with no further strictures placed on this relationship in terms of type or duration. The caregiver will be approached to participate in the RCT. Thus the sample will consist of 70 LGBT survivors (60 evaluable) and their caregivers (140 individuals total/120 evaluable). Recruitment and primary analyses will specifically target the LGBT cancer survivor. All data will be gathered from participants 21 years of age or older. Participants are cancer survivors who have completed treatments or caregivers of cancer survivors; both survivors and caregivers are able to read and understand English.</detailed_description>
