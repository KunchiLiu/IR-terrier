	<brief_title>Comparison of Refraction Measurments in Children Under General Anesthesia, With and Without Cycloplegic Drops</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Comparing to adults, children have high ability to preform accommodation of the intraocular lens, that is due to the Ciliary muscle. In order to measure children's refraction in an accurate way the Ciliary muscle must be paralyzed and that is usually done be cycloplegic eye-drops .In case a child is undergoing a medical procedure under general anesthesia the assumption that the Ciliary muscle is paralyzed (complete or partially) due to anesthetic medications. In this study we would like to compare the refraction measurements in children under who undergo general anesthesia before and after applying cycloplegic eye-drops. In this way we can learn about the effect of anesthetic medication on the Ciliary muscle.</detailed_description>
