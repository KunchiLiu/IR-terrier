	<brief_summary>Constipation is the most frequent (prevalence, about 60%) dysautonomic non motor symptom affecting Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Unfortunately, limited treatment options have been investigated and are now available for the management of constipation in PD. Preliminary data have suggested that probiotics could be help improving bowel habits but high-quality randomized trials are required in this area. Therefore, the investigators designed a randomized trial to evaluate whether the use of a fermented milk containing multiple probiotics strains and prebiotic fiber have a beneficial effect on constipation in PD compared to placebo.</brief_summary>
