	<brief_summary>Epidemiological data suggest, that not only sugar-based, but also artificially sweetened soft drinks may play a role in the development of diabetes. Recent studies in animals and humans have shown, that artificial sweeteners (AS) influence metabolic responses after glucose ingestion, possibly alter the intestinal microbiome and even modulate incretin release. However, it is unclear, if these findings are valid for all kinds of AS, as they are chemically different. Furthermore, data on human subjects are sparse and controversial. The investigators will therefore conduct 7 consecutive single oral stimulations with glucose or AS alone or a combination. Three different AS will be tested.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Epidemiological data suggest, that not only sugar-based, but also artificially sweetened soft drinks may play a role in the development of diabetes. Recent studies in animals and humans have shown, that artificial sweeteners (AS) influence metabolic responses after glucose ingestion, possibly alter the intestinal microbiome and even modulate incretin release. However, it is unclear, if these findings are valid for all kinds of AS, as they are chemically different. Up to now, no single study has ever compared metabolic responses to different AS in the same subjects. Furthermore, data on human subjects are sparse and controversial. This is partially explained by different methodical approaches such as intragastral/intraduodenal application of AS, rather than conventional oral consumption. The investigators will therefore conduct 7 consecutive single oral stimulations with glucose or AS alone or a combination. Three different AS will be tested: saccharin, aspartame and sucralose.</detailed_description>
