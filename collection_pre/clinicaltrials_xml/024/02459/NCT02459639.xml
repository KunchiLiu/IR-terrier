	<brief_summary>Using a comprehensive prospective clinical study design, the investigators intend to compare changes in health-related markers in patients with chronic widespread pain (CWP), undergoing one of two intervention "packages" of multimodal health care, namely anthroposophical integrative care (AIC) or standard care (SC), respectively. AIC combines evidence-based conventional care with complementary/alternative (CAM) treatments. As markers, the investigators will use indicators of drug utilization and sick leave, as well as constructs mirroring possible changes in psychological and existential factors and genomic stability (such as telomere length and telomerase levels).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Existential Genomics: Effects of Multimodal Rehabilitation and Integrative Care on Patients With Chronic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this comprehensive prospective clinical study is to compare and contrast two different but well-established multimodal chronic widespread pain rehabilitation programmes, i.e. one at a conventional county council hospital (CC) and one involving integrative care at a private non-profit hospital (IC), in terms of changes in health-related outcomes, ranging from DNA stability to health economy, in patients with chronic pain. Notably, for the first time, differences can be seen and correlations made between CC and IC outcomes with relevance for clinical care development and implementation of multimodal interventions for people with chronic pain. The overall aim of the present prospective clinical trial is to achieve a better understanding of the possible effects of, and useful measure for evaluating, two different multimodal treatment interventions for pain. More specifically, the aims of this trial are to explore two different, but well-established multimodal pain rehabilitation programmes. The investigators will specifically investigate 1. If chronic pain impacts on patients' telomerase activity and telomere length over time; 2. If multimodal rehabilitation can be linked to positive changes in telomerase activity and telomere length after rehabilitation, and if these changes can be correlated to: Clinical diagnosis, pain characteristics (e.g. intensity, duration, frequency and spread of pain), co-morbidities (e.g. anxiety, depression and catastrophizing), time lost from work/sick-leave and self-rated health and stress, and; 3. If and how the two programmes and their treatment components differ in outcomes over time. The project outcomes will be of great relevance for clinical rehabilitation development and the implementation of multimodal interventions for people with chronic pain. Given that the most significant demographic and clinical factors associated with pain help-seeking are increasing age, female gender, pain severity and disability, we will also address such issues including gender differences when relevant. Specific work packages (WP): WP1 - Genomics (telomerase activity and telomere length); WP2 - Patient-reported outcomes ("existential" validated questionnaires regarding depression, anxiety, stress, quality of life, pain, mindfulness, spirituality/religiosity); WP3 - Health care experiences (interviews); WP4 - Registry data (drugs, health care, sick leave, return-to-work, morbidity, mortality); WP5 - The design of treatment programs; WP6 - Standardized and exploratory statistical analyses of differences and correlations between the collected data and the conventional and integrated care programs. WP7 - Implementation of the results problematized through the participation of representatives of the patient and care provider organizations.</detailed_description>
