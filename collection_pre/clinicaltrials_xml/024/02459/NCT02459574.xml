	<brief_summary>A streamlined AF ablation procedure done without PV mapping as a daycase is more effective than anti-arrhythmic drugs at reducing all hospital episodes for recurrent atrial fibrillation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ablation Verses Anti-arrhythmic Therapy for Reducing All Hospital Episodes From Recurrent Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AVATAR-AF is a multicentre, randomised controlled study comparing a streamlined AVATAR-protocol ablation procedure to anti-arrhythmic therapy in patients with documented paroxysmal AF who are considered to be failing current strategy for AF. A secondary control arm will also compare the AVATAR-protocol to conventional AF ablation. 300 patients who are on no prior anti-arrhythmic, 'pill-in-pocket' or taking regular anti-arrhythmics will be randomised in a 1:1:1 manner to a treatment strategy of either AVATAR-protocol ablation, anti-arrhythmic therapy or conventional AF ablation and followed-up for 1 year.</detailed_description>
