	<brief_summary>Basiliximab has been a routine induction therapeutic agent even for well-matched living kidney transplantation(KT) with tacrolimus-based immunosuppression in Korea. As tacrolimus is a different drug from cyclosporine, the investigators study the usefulness of tacrolimus-based immunosuppression without basiliximab in well matched living KT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Usefulness of Tacrolimus Without Basiliximab in Well Matched Living Renal Transplantation in Korea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators omit basiliximab induction therapy in patients who underwent one to three-HLA mismatched living donor renal transplantation. Participants should receive ABO compatible and T-flow negative transplants. The investigators compare the results of intervention group with conventionally treated control group (age and sex matched patient who underwent one to three-HLA mismatched living donor renal transplants with basiliximab induction therapy).</detailed_description>
