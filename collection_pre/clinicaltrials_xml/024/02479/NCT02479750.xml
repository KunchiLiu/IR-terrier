	<brief_title>Evaluation of ColdZyme® on Experimentally Induced Common Cold.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>88 subjects will be inoculated with rhinovirus 16 via the nasal route. The subjects will be randomized 1:1 to ColdZyme® or placebo. Treatment (6 doses per day) will be applied for 11 days from the day of inoculation. The subjects will visit the investigational clinic on 6 occasions. During these visits the subjects will leave nasal (lavage) and pharyngeal (swab) samples for quantification of virus replication. All subjects will have a diary for scoring of cold symptoms.</detailed_description>
