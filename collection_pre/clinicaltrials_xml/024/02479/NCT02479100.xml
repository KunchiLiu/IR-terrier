	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine if the addition of Contrast Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM) to standard diagnostic imaging, results in a decision regarding patient management - discharge, follow-up, surgery or treatment - being made sooner than it would if the patient had followed the standard course of investigations and review. The investigators also intend to compare CESM with MRI. Images and pathology results from patients who undergo both CESM ans MRI will be reviewed retrospectively for detection of abnormality and identification of type of abnormality, i.e. is it a cancer or not?</brief_summary>
