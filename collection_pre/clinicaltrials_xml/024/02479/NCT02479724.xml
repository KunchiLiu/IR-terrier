	<brief_title>A-line/CareTaker Comparison Study in ICU Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The object of the work presented here was to validate a new approach to tracking blood pressure that is based on the pulse analysis of the peripheral arterial pressure pulse. The approach, referred to as the Pulse Decomposition Analysis (PDA) model, goes beyond traditional pulse analysis by invoking a physical model that comprehensively links the components of the peripheral pressure pulse envelope with two reflection sites in the central arteries. In these experiments, approved by the University of Virginia Institutional Review Board, the arterial blood pressures of patients (23 m/11 f, mean age: 44.05 y, SD: 13.9 y, mean height: 173.3 cm, SD: 9.4 cm, mean weight: 95.3 kg, SD: 27.4 kg) hospitalized in University of Virginia Medical Intensive Care Units (MICUs) were monitored using radial intra-arterial catheters, while the CareTaker system collected pulse line shapes at the lower phalange of the thumb of the ipsilateral hand. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures continuously collected from the arterial catheter and CT were compared. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between arterial catheter and CT blood pressure measurements and a Bland-Altman analysis was created. Results were within the limits established for the validation of automatic arterial pressure monitoring (AAMI/ANSI/ISO 81060-1:2013).</detailed_description>
