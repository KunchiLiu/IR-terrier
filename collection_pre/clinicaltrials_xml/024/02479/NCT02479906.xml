	<brief_title>A Safety &amp; Efficacy Study With Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for the Treatment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Deep TMS in conjunction with brief trauma exposure will be compared to sham treatment in conjunction with brief trauma exposure, in a multicenter, randomized, controlled study for the treatment of PTSD. Study duration is 9 weeks, consisting of 4 weeks of treatment and a 5 week and 9 week follow-up visit. Subjects will be randomized to real or sham treatment stratified by site. The design is meant to demonstrate that the device shows superiority compared to sham treatment at the 5 week follow-up visit and at the 9 week follow-up visit, 1 month post-treatment.</detailed_description>
