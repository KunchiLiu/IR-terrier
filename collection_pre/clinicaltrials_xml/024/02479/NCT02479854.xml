	<brief_summary>Comparative randomized, single dose, two-way crossover open-label study To investigate the bioequivalence of Montelukast from 5 mg chewable tablets(Sandoz, Egypt) and Singulair5 mg chewable tablets(Merck &amp; Co. Inc. ), after a single oral dose administration of each to healthy adults under fasting conditions,</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study of Montelukast From Asmakast 5mg Chewable Tab.(Sandoz, Egypt) &amp; Singulair 5mg Chewable Tab.(Merck)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>19 blood samples will be drawn in each period. The total volume of blood will not exceed 200 ml throughout the whole study.0.00 (pre-dose), 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, 2.00,2.50, 3.00,3.50, 4.00, 4.50, 5.00, 6.00, 8.00, 10.00, 12.00, and 24.00 hours postdose , Primary Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Cmax, AUC0→t and AUC0→∞ Secondary Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Ke, tmax and t1/2e. ANOVA using 5% significance level for transformed (with the 90% confidence intervals) and untransformed data of Cmax, AUC0→t and AUC0→∞ and for untransformed data of Ke, tmax and t1/2e. The confidence intervals of logarithmically transformed Test/Reference ratios for Cmax, AUC0→t and AUC0→∞ to be within 80.00-125.00%. A comprehensive final report will be issued upon the completion of the study.</detailed_description>
