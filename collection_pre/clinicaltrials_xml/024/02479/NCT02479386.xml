	<brief_summary>This study seeks to better characterize relationships between visual function and the progression (worsening) of geographic atrophy (GA) due to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The study is also intended to generate new information on the relationship between genetics and GA progression. This is a global, prospective, multicenter, epidemiologic study enrolling patients with GA secondary to AMD. The study visits are scheduled to occur every 6 months. The anticipated duration of the study is up to 48 months. There is a planned interim analysis around the 2 year time window for the study.</brief_summary>
