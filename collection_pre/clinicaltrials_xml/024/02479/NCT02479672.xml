	<brief_summary>This is a prospective randomized clinical study to be performed in adult patients ages 18 and older who are undergoing surgical procedures requiring endotracheal intubation. Adult patients will be randomized to either the VideoTrac速 laryngoscope or direct laryngoscopy and the time to intubation will be compared and recorded. Patients in both treatment arms will receive manual inline stabilization. The study hypothesis is that the time to endotracheal intubation will be decreased in the VividTrac速 video laryngoscope group when compared to direct laryngoscopy.</brief_summary>
