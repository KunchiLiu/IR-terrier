	<brief_summary>The aim of this randomized out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation study is to investigate haemodynamics generated by the standard mechanical external chest compression device (LUCAS™ 2) compared to a new version generating chest compressions and active decompression above the initial starting position of the suction cup (LUCAS™ 2AD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Haemodynamic Effects of Mechanical Standard and Active Chest Compression-decompression During Out-of-hospital CPR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based on randomization patients will receive standard or active compression decompression chest compression and the haemodynamic effects will be compared.</detailed_description>
