	<brief_summary>In the investigators' institution, the failure rate for thoracic epidural blocks is 23.1%. This stems from the prevalence of trainee operators coupled with the non-specific nature of loss-of-resistance. In the current randomized trial, we will set out to compare conventional and epidural waveform analysis-confirmed loss-of-resistance. The investigators' research hypothesis is that loss-of-resistance combined with epidural waveform analysis will decrease the failure rate of thoracic epidural blocks.</brief_summary>
