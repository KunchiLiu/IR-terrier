	<brief_summary>This study aimed to compare detection rate between dual sentinel node staining method using mixture of indocyanine green (ICG) with radioisotope(RI), and RI only. To identify the first lymph node(s) along the lymphatic drainage pathway from the primary tumor in the breast cancer using RI only has several disadvantages such as invisibility, interference. As ICG can be visualized with a fluorescence imaging system, we expects dual sentinel lymph node staining method had better outcomes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Using mixture of indocyanine green (ICG) with radioisotope (RI) can guide surgeons to identify the first lymph node(s) along the lymphatic drainage pathway from the primary tumor in the breast to the axillary lymph node basin. Last pilot study, sentinel lymph node was successfully identified by using dual method of ICG and RI in 5 patients. In this study, when radiolabeled colloid is used, a gamma probe identifies radioactivity in the lymph nodes in the axilla. If ICG, RI both used, Near infrared fluorescence camera visualized during surgery. As investigators measure node detection time from axillary approach moment, investigators are going to compare detection rate. (ICG+RI or RI only). And determine the accuracy. Sentinel lymph node mapping with both ICG and radiolabeled colloid mapping agents was recommended to maximize the likelihood of SLN identification and to minimize the possibility of missing SLNs, which could result in a false-negative event.The protocol required that 130 patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In this study investigators expects using mixture of indocyanine green (ICG) with radioisotope (RI) has potential to improve sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in breast cancer patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Sentinel lymph node mapping with both ICG and radiolabeled colloid mapping agents was recommended to maximize the likelihood of SLN identification and to minimize the possibility of missing SLNs, which could result in a false-negative event.</detailed_description>
