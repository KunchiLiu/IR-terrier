	<criteria>Signed writteninformed consent. Subjects over 18 years of age, and less than 70 years old. Subjects with a definite, possible, or probable diagnosis of ALS, according to the revised El Escorial criteria. Subjects having experienced their first ALS symptoms within 18 months before recruitment/consent. FVC &gt; 70% Subjects must be medically suitable for study participation and of complying with all planned aspects of the protocol including blood sampling at the time of inclusion in the study. Subjects with a clinically significant preexisting lung disease not attributable to ALS. Subjects with a diagnosis of other neurodegenerative diseases or diseases associated with dysfunction of the motor neurons that can confuse the diagnosis of ALS. Participation in other clinical trials, or the reception of any other investigational drug in the six months prior to the start of the study. Female subjects who are pregnant, currently breastfeeding, or attempting to conceive during the study. Difficult peripheral venous access precluding plasma exchange and inability to implement a viable alternative catheter to make continued performing plasma exchange visits according to protocol Any contraindication for plasma exchange or abnormal coagulation parameters according clinical criteria from apheresis team A history of frequent adverse reactions (serious or otherwise) to blood products. Hypersensitivity to albumin or allergies to any of the components of Albutein. Subjects that can not interrupt treatment with acetylsalicylic acid or oral anticoagulants Plasma creatinine &gt; 2mg/dl. Present a history of heart disease including ischemic heart disease or congestive heart failure. Presence of prior conduct disorders requiring pharmacologic intervention, with less than 3 months of stable treatment Any condition that complicates adherence to study protocol (illness with less than one year of expected survival, drug or alcohol abuse, etc.)</criteria>
