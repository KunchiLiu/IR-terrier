	<brief_summary>After cardiac surgery, vasoplegic syndrome is a hemodynamic state characterized by profound hypotension associated with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. The care of this disease is based on the intravenous administration of a vasopressor, usually norepinephrine. During the recovery phase, weaning of norepinephrine, is an important step in which any lack of preload (blood volume) initial or secondary can be, and increase tissue malperfusion.</brief_summary>
