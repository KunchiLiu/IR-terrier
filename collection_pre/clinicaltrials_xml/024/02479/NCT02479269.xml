	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of 8 weeks of aerobic exercise on serum concentrations of Brain Natriuretic Peptide and C - reactive protein in patients with cardiovascular disease. Patients were divided randomly into two groups: control and experimental aerobic group. This study was done with two - stage blood sampling: at the beginning and at the end of the treatment phase. All subjects were requested to avoid any exercise at least 48 hours before blood sampling. To study Brain Natriuretic Peptide and C - reactive protein changes, 5 milliliters of blood were taken from patient's brachial vein. Blood samples for subsequent measurements were frozen immediately and transported to the Hormone Laboratory for serum separation. The experimental group did the aerobic exercise programs for 8 weeks for 3 sessions per week and the control group did not receive any training. After completion of training, the final blood samplings were performed. Exercise intensity according to the heart rate remained stable until the last week. Brain Natriuretic Peptide and C - reactive protein levels were measured by ELISA tests. All statistical analysis were done using SPSS software (version 16) and at the significance level of pâ‰¤ 0.05</brief_summary>
