	<brief_title>Diagnostic Laparoscopy in the Preoperative Staging of Pancreatobiliary Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate the role of routine staging laparoscopy in patients with potentially resectable pancreatobiliary cancer. All analyses are performed using SAS version 9.1.3 for Windows (SAS institute, Cary, NC). Clinical and pathological variables will be analyzed using the Ï‡2 test (or Fisher`s exact test) and the Student`s t test, depending on the normality of the distribution. P-values of &lt; 0.05 are considering statistically significant.</detailed_description>
