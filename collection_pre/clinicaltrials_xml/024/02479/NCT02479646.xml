	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic / Pharmacodynamic Study Comparing MYL-1401H, EU-sourced Neulasta and US-licensed Neulasta</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After successful screening, each subjects will be randomly allocated to one of the following six possible sequences, according a 1:1:1:1:1:1 randomization scheme: Sequence_1: Treatment A -&gt; Treatment B -&gt; Treatment C ; Sequence_2: Treatment A -&gt; Treatment C -&gt; Treatment B ; Sequence_3: Treatment B -&gt; Treatment A -&gt; Treatment C ; Sequence_4: Treatment B -&gt; Treatment C -&gt; Treatment A ; Sequence_5: Treatment C -&gt; Treatment A -&gt; Treatment B ; Sequence_6: Treatment C -&gt; Treatment B -&gt; Treatment A ; In study Period 1, Subjects will be administered MYL-1401H (Treatment A), EU-Neulasta(Treatment B) or US-Neulasta (Treatment C). After the 1st crossover, subjects will enter Study period 2 and will receive one of the remaining alternate treatments. After the 2nd crossover, subjects will enter Study period 3 and will receive the other alternate treatment. The washout between drug administrations is at least 4 weeks. Final follow-up visit is scheduled 4 weeks after the last study drug administration.</detailed_description>

Any past or concurrent medical conditions that potentially increase the subject's risks or affect the evaluation of any study results. Examples of these include medical history with evidence of clinically relevant pathology (e.g. sickle cell disorders, spleen pathologies, hematologic malignancies or myelodysplastic disorders, and pulmonary illnesses such as ARDS, interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary edema, pulmonary infiltrates and pulmonary fibrosis) and history of relevant drug and/or food allergies. Known history of previous exposure to filgrastim, pegfilgrastim, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) or any analogue of these. Hypersensitivity to the constituents of Neulasta® (sorbitol E420, polysorbate 20 and acetate or acetic acid) or hypersensitivity to E. coli derived proteins. Any infection, cough or fever within 1 week prior to first study drug administration. Fructose intolerance. First degree relatives with hematological malignancy. Treatment with nontopical medications within 5 days prior to first admission to the clinical research center, with the exception of hormonal contraceptives, multivitamins, vitamin C, food supplements and a limited amount of paracetamol (acetaminophen), which may be used throughout the study. Participation in a drug study within 60 days prior to study drug administration. Donation or loss of more than 500 mL of blood over a period of 60 days prior to study drug administration. Donation of more than 1.5 L of blood (for men) / more than 1.0 L of blood (for women) in the 10 months preceding the start of this study. History of alcohol abuse or drug addiction Regular intake of more than 24 units of alcohol per week (one unit of alcohol equals approximately 250 mL of beer, 100 mL of wine or 35 mL of spirits).
