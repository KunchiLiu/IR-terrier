	<brief_title>Measuring the Impact of Integrating Maternal and Newborn HIV Testing With Childhood Immunization Services</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This evaluation assessed two levels of support for the integration of early infant and maternal HIV testing with existing routine immunization services in rural health facilities in Southern Zambia with the aim of determining whether infant and postpartum maternal HIV testing rates would increase without harming immunization uptake. The evaluation randomized 60 health facilities to one of three study arms: 1) Control (status quo); 2) Simple Intervention; and 3) Comprehensive Intervention. The Simple Intervention included restocking of HIV test kits and reminding health facilities of existing HIV testing guidelines by government health officials. The Comprehensive Intervention included the Simple Intervention components, as well as community sensitization, hands-on operational support to integrate services and improve patient flow, and opt-out HIV testing for mothers and infants according to existing guidelines. The change in the average number of monthly HIV tests and immunizations (DPT1) between the intervention period and baseline were compared between treatment and control facilities.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Note that this evaluation used administrative data no participants were enrolled for the main part of this study. Participants were enrolled for the qualitative portions of the study. Mothers who had an infant within the past 18 months during the intervention period (Oct 2013 Mar 2014) Infants who were at least six weeks of age and under six months of age during the intervention period (Oct 2013 Mar 2014) Qualitative activities included facility staff and mothers and caregivers whose infants were due for their 6 week immunization during the intervention period. Mothers who did not have an infant within the past 18 months during the intervention period Infants who were less than six weeks of age during the intervention period or greater than six months of age throughout out the intervention period.
