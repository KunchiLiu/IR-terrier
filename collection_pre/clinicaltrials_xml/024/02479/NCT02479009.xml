	<brief_summary>Aim: The aim of this study is to analyze if fluoroscopy is as accurate as computed tomography in diagnosing displacement of acute scaphoid waist fractures. Primary null hypothesis: Fluoroscopy has comparable sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive values compared with computed tomography for the diagnosis of displacement of acute scaphoid waist fractures. Secondary null hypothesis: All fractures diagnosed as non-displaced and treated without surgery are healed on radiographs and discharged from care within 6 months of injury.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fluoroscopy vs. Computed Tomography for Diagnosis of Displacement and Instability of Acute Scaphoid Waist Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The only confirmed risk factor for nonunion of a scaphoid waist fracture is displacement. There is consensus that displaced fractures should be treated with open or arthroscopically assisted reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). However, the optimal method to diagnose displacement is debated. Radiographic, computed tomography (CT), and arthroscopic diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of displacement exist. There is no consensus regarding the imaging modality and measurements to use to diagnose scaphoid displacement. The definition of displacement in recent randomized trials is incompletely described and inconsistent. Fluoroscopy is more convenient, less expensive, and uses less radiation than CT scanning. If displaced fractures are unstable, then this should be apparent on fluoroscopy. The aim of this study is to analyze if fluoroscopy is as accurate as computed tomography in diagnosing displacement of acute scaphoid waist fractures.</detailed_description>
