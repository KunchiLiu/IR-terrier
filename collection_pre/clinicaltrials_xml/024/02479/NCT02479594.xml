	<brief_summary>In a randomized controlled study design, n = 58 treatments of patients with depression were to be conducted under a feedback-condition, in which the therapist would receive feedback five times within 20 treatment sessions. The competence-feedback includes detailed feedback about 14 different aspects of therapist behavior. The control group includes n = 58 further treatments within which therapists do not receive any competence-feedback (treatment as usual; TAU).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Competence-feedback and Therapy Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psychotherapeutic competencies are considered to be an important factor for therapy success. However, empirical studies which have investigated the competence-outcome relationship were only based on correlational analyses. Therefore, these studies are inappropriate for the investigation of causal relationships. In previous studies, feedback on therapists' competencies was found to be suitable for enhancing such competencies. Therefore, in the current research project, competence-feedback should be used to enhance therapeutic competencies systematically, in order to investigate the causal impact of these competencies on therapy outcome. Using a randomized controlled study design, n = 58 treatments of patients with depression were to be conducted under a feedback-condition, in which the therapist would receive feedback five times within 20 treatment sessions. The competence-feedback includes detailed feedback about 14 different aspects of therapist behavior. The control group includes n = 58 further treatments within which therapists do not receive any competence-feedback (treatment as usual; TAU). In order to ensure comparability of both treatment conditions (regarding an observation situation), the therapists in the TAU condition should also receive feedback, but only after the treatments are finished. We hypothesize that the feedback-group is superior to the TAU-group and that their treatments lead to significantly better therapy outcome. Moreover, we use mediator analysis to analyze whether the group-outcome relationship is mediated by therapeutic competencies or by the quality of the therapeutic alliance. The results are highly relevant for clinical process research, psychotherapy training and for the dissemination of treatment approaches in routine care.</detailed_description>
