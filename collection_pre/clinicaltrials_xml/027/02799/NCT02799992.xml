	<brief_summary>Acute central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) is a common disorder in middle-aged patients, characterized by serous retinal detachment in the macular region. We evaluated half-dose verteporfin photodynamic therapy (hd-PDT) versus 689 nm laser treatment in chronic CSC. Twenty-two eyes of 22 patients with symptomatic chronic CSC were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive hd-PDT (group 1) or 689-LT delivering 95 J/cm2 by application of an intensity of 805 mW/cm2 over 118 seconds. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography findings were compared between groups.</brief_summary>
