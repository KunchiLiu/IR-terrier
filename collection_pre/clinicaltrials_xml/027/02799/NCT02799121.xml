	<brief_summary>This prospective case series is to gain additional clinical experience in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers, by documenting and relating patient history (including baseline wound characteristics) and clinical outcomes (incidence of healing, rate of healing, and patient and physician satisfaction) in a group of study participants for whom the ReGenerCell™ Autologous Cell Harvesting Device (ReGenerCell™) is used in combination with conventional therapy for the closure of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). Participants will receive ReGenerCell™ treatment in addition to standard care (debridement, cleansing, dressings, offloading).</brief_summary>
