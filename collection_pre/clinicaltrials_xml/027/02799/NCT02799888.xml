	<brief_summary>HLA-mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD) and HLA-haploidentical donor (Haplo Donor) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is associated with increased graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and impaired survival. The chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) antagonist maraviroc has immunomodulatory properties potentially beneficial for GVHD control as it can blockade lymphocyte chemotaxis without impairing T-cell function. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of maraviroc combined with standard graft-versus-host-disease prophylaxis in patients with hematologic malignancies after allogeneic stem cell transplantation from HLA-Unrelated or HLA-Mismatched Related donors. Based on the results of our previously small sample study with maraviroc combined with cyclosporine/tacrolimus and methotrexate for prophylaxis of GVHD, the investigators plan to perform the clinical trail.</brief_summary>
