	<mesh_term>Atrial Fibrillation</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Experiencing at least one (1) documented episode of spontaneous persistent or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation during the last 3 months by rhythm strip/ECG. One (1) previous AF ablation (PVIonly any technology) in the last 2 years, but NOT within the last 3 months. Left atrial diameter &lt; 6.0 cm via transthoracic echo or transesophageal echo; or &lt;6.5 cm via CT or MRI with 6 months prior to the procedure. Sustained spontaneous or induced AF (&gt;5 min uninterrupted). Confirmation of PV conduction. Presence of structural heart disease with clinical significance NYHA Class IV Ejection fraction &lt; 35% Previous AF ablation within the last 3 months ASD closure device, LAA closure device, prosthetic mitral or tricuspid valve, or permanent pacemaker. History of myocardial infarction (MI) within the past three (3) months Atrial clot/thrombus noted within 72 hours of the procedure</criteria>
