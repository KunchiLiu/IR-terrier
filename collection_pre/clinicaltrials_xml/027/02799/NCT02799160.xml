	<brief_title>Clinical, Biochemical and Haemodynamic Effects of Large-volume Paracentesis (LVP) in Inflammatory Situations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ascites is one of the common complications in advanced liver cirrhosis. Large-volume paracentesis (LVP) is a widely used symptomatic intervention to remove large amounts of peritoneal fluid. Despite a low rate of interventional-associated complications like fistula or non life-threatening bleeding LVP induces an impairment of circulatory function. The hypothesis is that haemodynamic changes can be detected by non-invasive monitoring and that these haemodynamic changes could be associated to postinterventional organ dysfunction or complications. Additionally the investigators hypothesize that paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction could also be associated to present clinical and laboratory signs of inflammation or infection and could influenced by increased viable and non-viable bacterial translocation.</detailed_description>
