	<brief_summary>Most patients undergoing hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) suffer from underlying liver disease and are exposed to the risk of postoperative ascites, with subsequent morbidity, liver and renal failure, the need for specific treatments and prolonged hospital stay. Postoperative ascites is favored by an imbalance between portal venous inflow and the diminished hepatic venous outflow. Finding a reversible, non-invasive method for modulating the portal inflow would be of interest: it could be used temporarily during the early postoperative course to prevent acute portal hypertension. Somatostatin, a well-known drug already used in several indications, may limit the risk of postoperative ascites and liver failure by decreasing portal pressure after hepatectomy for HCC in patients with underlying liver disease.</brief_summary>
