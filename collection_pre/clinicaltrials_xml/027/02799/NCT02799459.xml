	<detailed_description>Hypnosis in conization is more and more use to substitute General Anesthesia (GA) in Anesthesia's field. There are few studies about this new anesthesia tool. The latter showed that it's possible to substitute GA by hypnosis. This tool could have many positive such as reduced pains, anxiety or post operative vomiting nausea (POVN). Hypnosis in conization also allows time reduction in post operative security monitoring room (SSPI), speedier hospital discharge and greater patient satisfaction. Most studies involves 1 or 2 practitioners and few patients. There is no reliable research which compare Hypnosis in conization costs and GA costs. Since 2010, anesthesia's team of Grenoble Mutualist Hospital group (GHM) realized many Hypnosis in conization surgical procedures. Half of the team had been trained to Hypnosis in conization and use it for several types of surgeries for a lot of surgeons. It's the case for conisations. Currently, the 7 gynaecologists surgeons of the team achieved between 150 and 200 per year , some of this used GA, others used Hypnosis in conization, and unusually they used " rachianesthesia ". Thus, it gives us the opportunity for studying Hypnosis in conization, without practitioner effect, for a relatively cohesive group of patients (vast majority of patients are between 30 and 50 years and they haven't any particular medical history).</detailed_description>
