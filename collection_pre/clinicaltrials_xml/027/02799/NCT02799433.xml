	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Healthy Apple Program in San Francisco</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the USA, First Lady Michelle Obama started a nationwide child care initiative called 'Let's Move! Child Care' which aims to improve nutrition and physical activity practices in child care centers to promote healthy weight for children ages 0-5y. The San Francisco Child Care Wellness Collaborative, including the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) and SF Children's Council, developed a citywide Healthy Apple Program (HAP) to support local implementation of the Let's Move! initiative. The San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDH) has an existing Child Care Health Program (CCHP) which provides nurse consultation and health education materials for child care centers and annual health screenings for children. The aim of this analysis is to see whether child care centers offered the HAP in addition to usual CCHP services can improve child care center nutrition and physical activity practices and child weight change better than usual CCHP services alone.</detailed_description>
