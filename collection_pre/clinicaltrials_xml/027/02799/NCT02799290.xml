	<brief_summary>Adipose Tissue Extract (ATE) has been found to be an antologous source of growth factors with proven in vitro angiogenic and adipogenic properties.It is obtained by a simple lipoaspiration procedure. We sought to compare the effect of ATE with another known source, platelet-rich plasma to compare the wound healing characteristics on skin graft donor sites.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Growth Factor Effect on Split-thickness Donor Site Healing: a Comparison of Adipose Tissue Extract and PRP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We enrolled 24 patients with and indication for skin graft. Two or more split-thickness grafts we taken per patient, one serving as control and the other as experimental. The experimenatl sites were covered with either autologous PRP or ATE prepared in the OR, which was selected in an unblinded manner due to surgical theater conveniece. However, donor sites were randomized through a computer generator. Covered with a semioclusive film, wound were separated and followed up on days 3,5,7,10,14 for wound healing and 30 and 60 for scar evaluation. Digital spectophotocutometry was applied to know the hemoglobin and melanin content of the wounds, and software was applied to know the rate of wound re-epithelization.</detailed_description>
