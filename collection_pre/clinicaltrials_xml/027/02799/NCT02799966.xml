	<brief_summary>Many individuals with cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) have difficulty using their hands and arms. MyndMove is a non-invasive medical device that uses short, low energy electrical pulses with surface electrodes to cause muscle contractions to produce a full range of reaching and grasping movements, which the patient is unable to perform by him/herself. By using MyndMove therapy to help the individual move their arms and hands as he/she attempts to carry out typical reaching and grasping movements, the individual improves their ability to perform these tasks voluntarily. The purpose of this study is to study the effectiveness of MyndMove therapy in improving the ability of individuals to move their arms and hands.</brief_summary>

Late treatment group = initiate treatment on or after 6 months plus one day (183 days+) post tSCI 4. SCIM selfcare subscore â‰¤ 10 5. Able to understand and follow instructions 6. Able to be in a seated position for a least one hour of upper limb therapy 7. Able to attend the study treatment sessions 8. Able to provide informed consent 9. Men and women of the age of majority in their province or state 1. Previous history of any other neurological disorder or conditions that may affect motor response 2. Upper extremity injury or condition prior to SCI that limits the function of the hand or arm 3. Malignant skin lesion on the affected upper extremity 4. History of seizure disorder not effectively managed by seizure medications 5. An existing electrical stimulation devices (e.g. ICD, Pacemaker, Spinal Stimulation) 6. Rash or open wound at any potential electrode site 7. Denervation of muscles that are targeted by MyndMove 8. Poorly controlled autonomic dysreflexia (as determined by the local site physician) 9. In the judgment of the local site physician, participant has medical complications that may interfere with the execution of the study 10. Botulinum toxin injection into affected upper extremity within 3 months prior to the study start. No botulinum toxin injections during the study treatment and follow up period. 11.
