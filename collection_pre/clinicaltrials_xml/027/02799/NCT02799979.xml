	<brief_summary>Pulmonary hypertension is a rare and severe disease, affecting a young population. Survival is very poor and has been closely related to right ventricular dysfunction. Current prognostic equations rely mostly on right heart catheterization data. The identification of simple echocardiographic prognostic factor is urgently needed. It could help identifying with a non invasive method, high risk patients who could benefit from an intensive specific therapy. 3D right ventricular imaging is a new echocardiographic tool which provides RV volumic analysis, RV ejection fraction, overcoming the classical limits of 2D ultrasound. The aim of this study is to validate a new software for 3D analysis of the right ventricle and assess its prognostic role in pulmonary hypertension. To do so, the investigators will realize a prospective monocentric longitudinal cohort study, including 100 pulmonary hypertension patients. Echocardiographic data will be collected at baseline and after 6 months.</brief_summary>
