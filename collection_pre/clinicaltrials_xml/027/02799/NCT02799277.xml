	<brief_title>A Multinomial Process Model of Moral Judgment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Medical Screening Interview: Participants will be asked to answer several questions to identify potential medical and non-medical conditions that would preclude the self-administration of testosterone. - First Saliva Sample: Participants will be asked provide a saliva sample after they completed the medical screening interview. - Testosterone Self-Administration: Immediately following the first saliva collection, participants will self-administer spray puffs of either testosterone or placebo. - Relaxation: Participants will be given the opportunity to relax for 30 minutes. - Second Saliva Sample: Participants will be asked provide a saliva sample after the relaxation period. - Moral Dilemmas Judgments: Participants will be asked to read a set of 28 moral dilemmas that describe situations in which an actor has to make a decision on whether or not to engage in a particular action (e.g., sacrifice the well-being of one person to protect the well-being of several others). Participants will be asked to indicate whether they consider the described action acceptable or unacceptable. - Demographics: Participants will be asked to indicate their gender, age, and ethnicity. - Ear Temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure will be measured before drug administration, and again 20 minutes after drug administration. If temperature changes more than 2 degrees, heart rate changes more than 20bmp, or if blood pressure changes more than 20%, the experiment will be terminated and subjects will be escorted across the street to the University Emergency Room.</detailed_description>
