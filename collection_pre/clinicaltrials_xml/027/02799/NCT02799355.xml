	<brief_summary>Of the six main genotypes of the hepatitis C virus (HCV), genotypes 2 and 3 account for approximately 30% of chronic infections worldwide. In North India, Genotypes 3 and 1 account for 95% of chronic hepatitis C patients The first three direct-acting antiviral agents to receive FDA approval—boceprevir, telaprevir, and simeprevir—do not currently have a role in the treatment of genotype 3 infection. In contrast, the direct-acting antiviral agents, daclatasvir and sofosbuvir, have good activity against all genotypes. The SVR rates of 90 - 100% in genotype 3 were achieved with oral sofosbuvir plus ribavirin regimen to 24 weeks. Similar SVR rates were achieved in Genotype 1 with oral sofosbuvir plus weight based ribavirin and Pegylated Interferon alpha 2 a. However, the ongoing discovery and development of agents that directly target various stages of HCV replication are likely to provide HCV-infected patients with effective interferon-free therapy. HCV genotype 3 infection is associated with a higher incidence of hepatic steatosis, more rapid progression of fibrosis, and possibly a greater risk of hepatocellular carcinoma than is HCV genotype 2 infection.Moreover, patients with HCV genotype 3 infection are less responsive to peginterferon based treatment than are patients with HCV genotype 2 infection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis With Sofosbuvir in Combination With Ribavirin With or Without Pegylated Interferon: North India Gastroenterology Consortium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sofosbuvir is an oral nucleotide analogue inhibitor of the HCV NS5B polymerase that is effective against HCV genotypes 2 and 3 when it is administered in combination with weight based ribavirin for 24 weeks. In Genotype 1, a combination of Pegylated Interferon alpha 2 a with oral Sofosbuvir and weight based Ribavirin for 12 weeks resulted in 90 -100 % sustained virological response rates (SVR). These SVR rates for chronic hepatitis C genotypes 1,2 and 3 are all based on Western studies. The investigators plan to conduct a retrospective study in Northern India region on patients treated with Sofosbuvir and Ribavirin or Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin and Peginterferon alpha 2a. The purpose of the investigators study is to assess the percentage of patients with sustained virologic response.</detailed_description>
