	<brief_summary>The trust between patients and medical providers is the cornerstone to obtain success treatment. To boost the trust can increase medical prescription compliance, enhance patient satisfaction, and improve the effectiveness of treatment. Otherwise, mistrust between medical providers and patients will result in ineffective treatment and excessive defensive health care. This situation may cause medical dispute and medical resources wasting problems. Most of treatment complete in a few times of admissions and interventions. So, how to improve the trust between patients and doctors quickly became a more knotty problem. Several studies found that speech (including listening, showing compassion, and take longer to explain), reputation, clothing, offer a newer therapy were more important than age, title, and sex. However, past researches were restricted to an unclear causal relationship. That is they can't be determined whether good doctor-patient relationship and better trust conditions create a longer visit time, better satisfaction, and good reputation, or vice versa. They also unable to clarify whether the high degree of trust result in improved treatment effects, or good relationship result from good medical outcomes. Investigators want to design a randomized control trial by giving patients recommendation and physical therapist introductions to enhance the trust of patients to therapists. And this study may verify whether enhance trust between therapists and patients will lead to changes in treatment effectiveness.</brief_summary>
