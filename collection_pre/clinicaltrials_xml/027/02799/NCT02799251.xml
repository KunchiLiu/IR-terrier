	<brief_summary>Postoperative infections are one of the most common complications in thoracic and digestive cancer surgery. Former studies have demonstrated that inflammatory response is altered during peri-operative period causing lymphopenia. It has been suggested that lymphopenia may contribute to postoperative infection. To date, no one has proved it in a multivariate analysis. The aim of this study is to determine if lymphopenia is associated with postoperative infections in thoracic and digestive cancer surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Postoperative infections are one of the most common complications in thoracic and digestive cancer surgery. Former studies have demonstrated that inflammatory response is altered during peri-operative period causing lymphopenia. It has been suggested that lymphopenia may contribute to postoperative infection. To date, no one has proved it in a multivariate analysis. The aim of this study is to determine if lymphopenia is associated with postoperative infections in thoracic and digestive cancer surgery. It is a multicenter French cohort study. Lymphocytes counts are obtained from patients undergoing pulmonary or digestive cancer surgery before surgery (day-0) as well 1, 3, 5 and 8 days after surgery. Anesthetic and surgical procedures are collected as well as risk factors for postoperative infections recognized in the literature. Clinical and biological signs of infection are collected.</detailed_description>
