	<brief_summary>This is a randomised, open-label, multi-centre, Phase II study in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Up to 87 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma will be enrolled in the study in a 1:2 allocation (standard of care (SOC): ALECSAT as an adjunct therapy to SOC). Data from a further 29 patients gathered from an ongoing observational study of glioblastoma patients treated according to SOC at Sahlgrenska University hospital in Göteborg, Sweden will be used as historical control data and combined with the randomised control data in performing the statistical analysis. Patients recruited into this study will receive either: - ALECSAT as an adjunct therapy to standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma (first line therapy: Stupp regimen, followed by second line therapy at the Investigator's discretion) or - Standard of care therapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma (first line therapy: Stupp regimen, followed by second line therapy at the Investigator's discretion).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female patients, aged between 18 and 70. Histologically confirmed glioblastoma (Grade IV) diagnosis. Eligible for combined radiotherapy and TMZ treatment. Patients with complete or partial tumour resection. For patients with limited tumour volume, biopsy is acceptable. WHO Performance status 02. Body weight ≥ 40 kg (males), ≥ 50 kg (females). Able and willing to provide written informed consent and comply with the study protocol and procedures. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and agree to use acceptable methods of contraception during the trial. Prior treatment for brain tumours at study entry. Prior treatment with temozolomide at study entry. Females who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant or breastfeeding. Positive tests for anti human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)1/2; HBsAg, anti HBc, antiHCV or being positive in a Treponema Pallidum test (syphilis). Patients who may have been exposed to West Nile virus or Dengue fever virus within the last 28 days prior to enrolment or Ebola virus within the last 60 days prior to enrolment should be excluded, unless the patient has been tested negative. Patients from high incidence areas for Human TLymphotropic Virus (HTLV1) virus or who has a parent or spouse from a high incidence area must be excluded unless tested negative for HTLV1 virus. Known allergy to study medication. Any condition or illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator or medical monitor, would compromise patient safety or interfere with the evaluation of the safety of the investigational drug. Any concurrent illness that may worsen or cause complications in connection with blood donation, for example uncontrolled epilepsy, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or respiratory disease. Use of immunosuppressant drugs with the exception of steroids. Blood transfusion within 48 hours prior to the donation of blood for ALECSAT production. Low haemoglobin count in the opinion of the Investigator. Lymphocyte count &lt;0.3 x 109/litre. Participation in any other interventional clinical trial within 30 days prior to inclusion. TMZ contraindication.</criteria>
