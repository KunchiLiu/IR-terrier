	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the longitudinal efficacy of two experimental oral rinses, one containing 1.5% weight/weight (w/w) dipotassium oxalate monohydride (KOX) /0 Parts per Million (ppm fluoride) and the other 2.0% w/w KOX /45ppm fluoride, for the relief of dentinal hypersensitivity (DH), compared to a placebo oral rinse, when used as an adjunct to twice daily brushing with a standard fluoride toothpaste.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participants in good general health with no clinically significant/ relevant abnormalities in medical history or upon oral examination Preexisting self reported and clinically diagnosed tooth sensitivity At screening a minimum of 20 natural teeth and at least two accessible, nonadjacent teeth (incisors, canines or premolars) preferably in different quadrants with a signs of facial/cervical gingival recession and/or signs of erosion or abrasion (EAR),tooth with modified gingival index (MGI) score =0 adjacent to the test area (exposed dentine) only and a clinical mobility of ≤1 and tooth with signs of sensitivity measured by qualifying evaporative air assessment (Y/N response). At baseline, a minimum of 2 nonadjacent accessible teeth (incisors, canines or premolars) with DH (qualifying tactile threshold Yeaple ≤ 20g, Schiff Sensitivity Score ≥ 2) Participants with a known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to study products Presence of chronic debilitating disease which could affect study outcomes Any condition which is causing dry mouth Use of an oral care product indicated for the relief of dentine hypersensitivity Participation in a DH treatment study in the 8 weeks prior to screening Taking daily doses of a medication/ treatment which could interfere with perception of pain or is causing dry mouth Require antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures Dental prophylaxis within 4 weeks of screening Treatment of periodontal disease within 12 months of screening Scaling or root planning within 3 months of screening Tooth bleaching within 8 weeks of screening Active caries or periodontitis Partial dentures, orthodontic appliances or dental implants which could affect study outcomes Pregnant and breastfeeding females Main Exclusions for Test Teeth: evidence of current or recent caries; treatment of decay within 12 months of screening; teeth with exposed dentine but with deep, defective or facial restorations; teeth used as abutments for fixed or removable partial dentures; teeth with full crowns or veneers, orthodontic bands or cracked enamel; sensitive teeth with contributing aetiologies other than erosion, abrasion or recession</criteria>
