	<brief_summary>The gastric emptying of 400 ml 12.6% carbohydrate rich drink is investigated in elderly women, age 75-100, with acute hip fracture. The emptying time will be assessed by the paracetamol absorption technique, and lag phase and gastric half-emptying time compared with two gender-matched reference groups: elective hip replacement patients, age 45-71, and healthy volunteers, age 28-55.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gastric Emptying in Elderly With Hip Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with hip fracture are submitted to prolonged fasting before surgery is undertaken. This is deleterious for their metabolic condition and slows recovery after surgery. A carbohydrate-rich beverage is taken immediately before surgery and gastric emptying rate is assessed in elderly (75-100 yo) women prior to surgery for acute hip fracture. As comparator another two groups of women are used; one scheduled for elective surgery for hip replacement due to osteoarthritis; another healthy female volunteers. On the day of surgery the primary study group of acute hip fracture is given a carbohydrate-rich beverage 400 ml, total 200 kcal in combination with paracetamol 1.5 g. Blood samples are intermittently drawn during 180 minutes to measure recovery of paracetamol in plasma and gastric emptying rate calculated according to previously published principles. In the same manner a group of women on waiting list for hip replacement surgery due to osteoarthritis are enrolled for estimation of gastric emptying rate. In addition, another group of completely healthy women are enrolled for assessment of gastric emptying.</detailed_description>
