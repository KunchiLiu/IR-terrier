	<brief_summary>The sample of this randomized controlled trial was obtained in the Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation Unit, of the Hospital Centre of Porto, Santo Antonio General Hospital. The target population was individuals who have completed the training phase of cardiovascular rehabilitation program, volunteers and referenced by the responsible for the service. This study has as main objective to analyze the influence of a specific exercise program, maintenance phase of cardiovascular rehabilitation , in home care context, for a period of 6 months, using a virtual format (computer and Kinect) or a conventional format (paper manual) in subjects with coronary artery disease. It was intended to analyze the immediate effect of exercise program on body composition and food consumption patterns, functional muscle strength of lower limb, level of physical activity: total volume of activity as well as the profile of this intensity, kyphotic index, balance, cognitive and executive function, as well as in the quality of life. The aim is also to examine the effects, approximately 3 months after the end of the exercise program, in the lipid profile, the level of physical activity: total volume of activity as well as the profile of this intensity and cardiovascular fitness: maximum double product ; metabolic equivalents; and proof and recovery time. The individuals were distributed at random, every 3 individuals, using the capabilities of Microsoft Excel 2010 RANDBETWEEN command, by three groups: the experimental group 1- a cardiovascular rehabilitation program, in home care context, using a computer and Kinect, virtual format, the experimental group 2- in cardiovascular rehabilitation program, in home care context, using a paper-based manual, conventional format, and control group-only subject to education for cardiovascular risk factors. The program defined 3 training sessions per week. The rehabilitation program was oriented by the guidelines for exercise prescription. Participants perform the a program of specific exercises independently and individually, with remote supervision, using communication (phone, email, etc.) and a routine scheduled individual meetings.</brief_summary>
