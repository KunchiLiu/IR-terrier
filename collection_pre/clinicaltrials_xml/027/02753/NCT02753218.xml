Subjects who have received any medications, including St John's Wort (or other dietary restriction), known to chronically alter drug absorption or elimination processes (change enzyme levels) within 30 days of the first dose administration of midazolam. Subjects who are still participating in a clinical study (e.g. attending followup visits) or who have participated in a clinical study involving administration of an investigational drug (new chemical entity) or a marketed drug within the past 3 months prior to the first dosing occasion. Subjects who have donated any blood, plasma or platelets in 3 months prior to screening or who have made donations on more than 2 occasions within the 12 months preceding the first dose administration of midazolam.

Subjects who consume more than 28 units of alcohol per week. Subjects who have a significant history of alcoholism or drug/chemical abuse as determined by the Investigator. Subjects with a positive urine drugs of abuse screen or alcohol breath test result at screening or first admission.

Active tuberculosis or history of incompletely treated tuberculosis, based on medical history or medical report, or tuberculosis test at screening. Subjects who, in the opinion of their General Practitioner or the Investigator, should not participate in the study, including subjects suspected for whatever reason of not being able to comply with the requirements of the protocol.
