	<brief_summary>This study aims at assessing the hard and soft tissues remodelling of the alveolar crest after extraction socket managements in the aesthetic areas: - 3D radiographic evaluation (CT scan) was performed post extraction and 3 months after at the time of implant placement. (Outcomes 1: Hard tissues analyses ) - Impressions, models and 3D analyses of the treated area allowed studying external soft tissue remodeling at different time points after extraction. (Outcomes 2: Soft tissues analyses )</brief_summary>
