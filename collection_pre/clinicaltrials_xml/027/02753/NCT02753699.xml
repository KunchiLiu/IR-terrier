	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to follow-up with participants from feeder studies who achieved sustained virologic response (SVR) over 24 hours posttreatment (SVR24), to assess durability of SVR, and to assess the changes in liver disease, development of hepatocellular carcinoma and post-treatment safety over time. Participants enter this study from feeder studies CDEB025A2210 (NCT01183169), CDEB025A2301 (NCT01318694), and CDEB025A2211 (NCT01215643). They return to the site for up to 48 weeks with a maximum of 3 visits. No treatment is involved.</brief_summary>
