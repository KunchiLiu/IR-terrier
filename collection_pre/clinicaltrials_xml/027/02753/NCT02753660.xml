	<brief_title>Pendant Position and Traditional Sitting Position for Successful Spinal Puncture in Spinal Anaesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approval from Ethical Committee of Faculty of Medicine University of Indonesia was acquired prior conducting the study. Subjects were given informed consent before enrolling the study. Subjects were divided into Group A for traditional sitting position (n=154) and Group B for pendant position (n=154). The outcome parameters recorded were the number of attempt for the successful spinal puncture, the number of spinal needle-bone contact and the duration to perform spinal puncture. Data were analyzed by using Statistical Package for Social Scientist (SPSS) version 21.0. Numerical data was served in median with minimal and maximal value. Numerical data was analyzed by using Mann-Whitney test. Categorical data was served by using relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and was analyzed by using Chi-Square test.</detailed_description>
