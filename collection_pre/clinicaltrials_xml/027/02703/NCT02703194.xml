	<brief_summary>The study has been designed as a 12-month, open-label, randomized, controlled study comparing the use of prednisone mono-therapy and prednisone and leflunomide combination therapy in treating patients with IgG4-related disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Leflunomide for Maintenance of Remission in IgG4 Related Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this clinical trial is to determine the safety and efficacy of Leflunomide in treating patients with IgG4-related disease by comparing the outcomes of prednisone and leflunomide combination therapy with prednisone mono-therapy. The follow-up period will be 12 months. During the follow-up period, results of laboratory tests and image examinations, IgG4-RD RI and other parameters which can reflect treatment response as well as adverse effect events will be recorded.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age between 18 and 80 years. 2. Diagnosis of IgG4RD according to either Consensus statement on the pathology of IgG4related disease (for those who have undergone biopsies) or 2011 Comprehensive diagnostic criteria for IgG4related disease. Both of the two criteria for diagnosis are specified below. (1)Consensus statement on the pathology of IgG4related disease 1. Histopathologic features consisting of dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, fibrosis(usually storiform in character)and/or obliterative phlebitis within involved organs. 2. Either an elevated IgG4+/IgG+cell ratio of ＞40% within the affected organs or elevated IgG4bearing plasma cells per highpower field is necessary. The cutoff number of IgG4bearing plasma cells per highpower field is different depending upon the types of affected organs and specimens(through surgery or needle puncture biopsy). (2)2011 Comprehensive diagnostic criteria for IgG4related disease 1. Clinical examination showing characteristic diffuse/localized swelling or masses in single or multiple organs. 2. Hematological examination shows elevated serum IgG4 concentrations(135 mg/dl). 3. Histopathologic examination shows marked lymphocyte and plasmacyte infiltration and fibrosis or Infiltration of IgG4+ plasma cells(ratio of IgG4+/IgG+ cells &gt; 40% and &gt;10 IgG4+ plasma cells/HPF). Definite: a + b + c,Probable: a + c,Possible: a + b 4. Excluded from malignant tumors of each organ (e.g. cancer, lymphoma) and similar diseases (e.g. Sjögren's syndrome, primary sclerosing cholangitis, Castleman's disease, secondary retroperitoneal fibrosis, Wegener's granulomatosis, sarcoidosis, ChurgStrauss syndrome) by additional histopathological examination. 5. Even when patients cannot be diagnosed using the Comprehensive diagnostic criteria, they may be diagnosed using organspecific diagnostic criteria for IgG4RD, such as Diagnostic criteria for IgG4Mikulicz's disease. 1. Subjects having received steroids or immunosuppressants in recent 3 months will be excluded. 2. Subjects who were hypersensitive to leflunomide will be excluded. 3. ALT and/or AST is more than two folds of the upper limit of relevant reference value at baseline. 4. WBC is less than 3×10*9/L at baseline. 5. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding. 6. Known significant concurrent medical disease.</criteria>
