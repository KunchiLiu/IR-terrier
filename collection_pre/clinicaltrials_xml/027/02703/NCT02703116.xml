	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility, acceptability and test the initial efficacy of eSBI, (electronic screening and brief intervention for alcohol use) coupled with STTR (Seek, Test, Treat, and Retain) in comparison to STTR only among YMSM (young men who have sex with men) and YTW (young transgender women) on frequency of substance use and engagement within the HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) care continuum.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility, acceptability and test the initial efficacy of eSBI, (electronic screening and brief intervention for alcohol use) coupled with STTR (Seek, Test, Treat, and Retain) in comparison to STTR only among YMSM (young men who have sex with men) and YTW (young transgender women) on frequency of substance use and engagement within the HIV and PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) care continuum. We will do this with the following aims: Aim 1: Assess the feasibility, acceptability and initial efficacy of electronic Screening &amp; Brief Intervention + Seek, Test, Treat and Retain (eSBI+ STTR) compared to STTR-only to reduce alcohol and other substance use among 450 YMSM and YTW in Chicago, ages 16-25, at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-intervention. Aim 2: To explore the initial efficacy of eSBI+STTR in comparison to STTR-only on secondary exploratory outcomes within the HIV and PrEP care continuum among YMSM and YTW. Aim 3: Determine the degree to which sub-groups of youth are differentially impacted by eSBI+STTR based on socio-demographic characteristics and co-morbid mental health problems to inform future targeting and/or tailoring of the intervention.</detailed_description>
