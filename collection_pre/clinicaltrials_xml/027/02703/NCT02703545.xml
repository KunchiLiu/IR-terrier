	<brief_summary>Various centers around the world are currently investigating the feasibility and yield of surveillance for pancreatic cancer in high-risk individuals. Evidence is beginning to accumulate that surveillance may lead to the early detection of non-invasive precursor lesions and asymptomatic early stage cancer. Ultimately, the goal of surveillance is to reduce mortality in these high risk individuals, but before this can be confirmed many research questions need to be answered. While the numbers of high-risk individuals screened in each separate screening facility are likely too small to properly address many of these questions, pooling data comprises a sizable sample size providing unique research opportunities. The objective of this study is retrospectively review all cases of high-risk individuals participating in our pancreatic surveillance program in whom 1) a suspicious precursor lesions was detected for which a pancreatic resection was performed and 2) in whom an advanced malignant disease was diagnosed. The de-identified information will be entered into an international multicenter database registry.</brief_summary>
