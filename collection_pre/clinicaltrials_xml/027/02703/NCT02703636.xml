	<criteria>1. Outpatient status at baseline. 2. Males, and females not of childbearing potential (surgically sterile, or one year or more from last menses). 3. A diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer's type according to the DSMIV criteria. 4. A clinical diagnosis of probable AD according to National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDSADRDA) criteria. 5. Brain scan (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], or computed tomography [CT]) were met diagnosis criteria conducted within 3 years prior to baseline. 6. Positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was met diagnosis criteria conducted within 3 years prior to baseline visit, as long as in the past a brain scan (MRI or CT) also was met. 7. MMSE score of ≥ 10 and ≤ 23 at screening and baseline. 8. Patients are currently on the oral monotherapy (donepezil, 5 mg), or galantamine (1624 mg) for 4 weeks prior to baseline visit. 9. Patients who failed to receive enough treatment benefit from the previous treatment can be defined if the patients meet at least one of following conditions at screening and baseline (multiple choices allowed) 10. Patients who declined ≥ 2 points of MMSE despite of treatment of other oral Cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors in initial 3month. 11. Patients who declined ≥2 points of MMSE in last 6 months with other oral ChE inhibitors (ChEI). 12. Patients who show marked worsening of BPSD, or ADL (can be defined by 1 state progression of FAST) judged by a physician despite of treatment of other oral ChE inhibitors in initial 3month or last 6month with other oral ChE inhibitors 13. Patients having difficulties being treated orally with ChEIs (donepezil or galantamine) by physician's judgement. 14. Poor compliance or adverse event except GI symptoms 15. Patients with swallowing difficulties. 1. Any medical or neurological condition other than AD that could explain the patient's dementia (e.g., abnormal thyroid function tests, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, posttraumatic conditions, syphilis, head injury, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, subdural hematoma, normal pressure hydrocephalus, brain tumor) at baseline 2. Any other DSMIV Axis 1 diagnosis that may interfere with the evaluation of the patient's response to study medication, including other primary neurodegenerative dementia, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder 3. An advanced, severe, progressive, or unstable disease of any type that may interfere with efficacy and safety assessments or put the patient at special risk 4. Current diagnosis of an active skin lesion/disorder 5. Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any ingredients of rivastigmine or carbamate derivatives 6. Each patient will be required to have a primary caregiver willing to accept responsibility for supervising treatment, assessing the patient's condition throughout the study, and for providing input into efficacy assessments. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
