	<brief_summary>The current study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of additional repeat doses of epelsiban in healthy females, and will be the first dosing experience of repeat dosing at higher doses in women with this compound. This study is a 14 day, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind (sponsor unblind), repeat dose, ascending cohort, dose escalation study in healthy, female volunteers. Upon successful completion of the Screening period, a subject will be enrolled in the study. The study will be composed of three periods: Screening, Treatment and Follow-up. A subject's total time involved in the study will be approximately six weeks. Cohorts will be conducted sequentially. Each subject will be enrolled in only one cohort. Ten subjects will be enrolled in each cohort and randomized to epelsiban (n=8) or placebo (n=2).</brief_summary>

Urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking or history or regular use of tobacco or nicotinecontaining products within three months prior to screening. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a known to inhibit or induce Cytochrome P450 3A4 [P450 CYP3A4]) or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety. Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), positive hepatitis C antibody test result at screening or within three months prior to first dose of study treatment. A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen. A positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products in excess of 500 mL within three months The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer). Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day.</criteria>
