	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of body weight-supported treadmill (BWST) training on static balance impairment in adults with incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) in chronic stage</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The individuals who participated in this study were subjects with SCI with more than twelve months of evolution. All were classified as incomplete injury class C or D according to the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA). Each received training on a BWST for six weeks. Two measures of stance balance were performed during the training protocol. The first measure was made before entering the training protocol; the final measure was implemented once the gait training on BWST protocol was completed. For instrumented stance balance testing, small wireless inertial motion sensors (OPAL sensors, APDM Inc., Portland, OR) were placed on the subjects' waist. Subjects performed instrumented stance with their eyes opened (iSway). Outcome measures were recorded and automatically generated using Mobility Lab software (APDM Inc., Portland, OR). Measures included the root mean square of sway and jerk (normalized to the range of acceleration amplitude).</detailed_description>
