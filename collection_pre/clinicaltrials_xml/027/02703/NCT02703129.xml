	<brief_title>Nutritional Intervention in Migraine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women with the diagnosis of migraine according to the International Headache Society (IHS-2) criteria received individualized diet meal plan and nutritional orientation for 12 weeks according to their nutritional diagnosis. Patients were evaluated three times with an interval of 30 days between each visit. Clinical, anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference and body composition assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis) and food evaluations were performed. Nutritional orientations were strengthened in each visit. The diet prescription did not change during intervention period. The diet quality of the patients was assessed through the Brazilian Healthy Eating Index - Revised (BHEI-R) version. Migraine severity was assessed with the Headache Impact Test (HIT) and the Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS). Depressive symptoms were also evaluated with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).</detailed_description>
