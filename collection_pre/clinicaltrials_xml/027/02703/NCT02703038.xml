	<brief_summary>Cardiogenic shock (CS) is defined as an organ hypoperfusion secondary to low cardiac output. Catches diagnostic management, and therapeutic monitoring of these patients remain highly variable from one center to another and even from one doctor to another within the same team. The management protocols are often not standardized or non-existent. It appears therefore necessary to make an inventory of the management practices of the CS in France in 2016, prerequisite to a common work of standardization of practices and the creation of specialized networks to support these complex patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>French Observatory on the Management of Cardiogenic Shock in 2016</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Observatory FRENSHOCK proposes to set up a cohort of 500 patients recruited prospectively over a period of 6 months. Patients will be followed up at 1 month and 1 year Patients should have agreed to participate in the observatory, knowing that participation or refusal to participate will not alter the therapeutic attitude of the physician responsible for the patient. The study of phenotypic characteristics will not change the therapeutic approach of the medical teams.</detailed_description>
