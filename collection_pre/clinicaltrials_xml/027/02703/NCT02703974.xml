	<brief_summary>The study will collect and analyze quantitative data regarding handwashing behaviors among school-aged children to determine the impact of nudges compared to handwashing and hygiene education programs. Based on the success of the preliminary pilot, we hypothesize nudges leading to higher rates of handwashing than traditional handwashing and hygiene education programs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nudging Handwashing: a Cluster-randomized Trial in Bangladesh</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will utilize a cluster-randomized trial design to collect quantitative data and analyze the handwashing behaviors of school-aged children. The primary purpose of this protocol is to assess nudges as a viable method of promoting handwashing among school-aged children. The specific objectives of this quantitative exploration are to: 1. Determine if nudges can prompt significant behavior change and result in higher rates of handwashing among school-aged children in Bangladesh 2. Determine if behavior change resulting from nudging is sustainable over time</detailed_description>
