	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to identify the potential benefits of a home-based, intervention designed to facilitate carepartners' roles in stroke survivor rehabilitation. Stroke survivors and caregivers will participate in pairs. Stroke survivors will receive constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT). Caregivers of stroke survivors will be randomized to traditional caregiver education or a web based intervention for the duration of stroke survivor therapy. By learning the best way to involve family members in therapy, investigators hope to decrease the harmful effects of stroke.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to identify the potential benefits of a home-based, intervention designed to facilitate carepartners' roles in stroke survivor rehabilitation. Stroke survivors and caregivers will participate in pairs. Stroke survivors will receive constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT). Caregivers of stroke survivors will be randomized to traditional caregiver education or a web based intervention for the duration of stroke survivor therapy. A tablet will be provided to participants who do not have access to complete the web based intervention. All participants will be asked to complete questionnaires at the beginning of therapy, the end of therapy, and one month post therapy.</detailed_description>
