	<brief_title>Combined tDCS and Vision Restoration Training in Post-acute Stroke: an Exploratory Efficacy and Safety Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Visual field defects after posterior cerebral artery stroke can be improved by vision restoration training (VRT), but when combined with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) which alters brain excitability, vision restoration can be potentiated in the chronic stage. Because it is possible that such therapy may be more effective during the early recovery phase after the stroke and can reach patients during the rehabilitation phase, investigators wished to explore the applicability, efficacy and safety of early intervention with a combined tDCS/VRT treatment. 19 post-acute stroke homonymous hemianopia patients were randomly assigned to either 10 sessions of combined rea-tDCS (2mA, 10 daily sessions of 15-20 min) and VRT, or sham-tDCS and VRT. The primary outcome criterion was the pre-post change in perimetric detection thresholds. Secondary outcome is neurophysiological changes in EEG measures (VEP, Connectivity, Spectral Power, ...)</detailed_description>
