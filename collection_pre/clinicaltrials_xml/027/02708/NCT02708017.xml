	<brief_title>Analgesic Effect of Subcostal TAP Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After approval from Ethics Review Committee, patients were enrolled according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Informed written consent for inclusion in the study was taken and during the process,patients were explained about the NRS and other secondary objectives. Blocks were performed under ultrasound guidance immediately after induction of anesthesia.For postoperative analgesia,patients were randomly allocated in two groups using draw/ballot method assigning patients to either of the S-TAP block group or P-TAP-block group. The patients and the staff providing postoperative care and the doctor assessing the pain after surgery were blinded to group assignment. Patients in both groups received standard of care analgesia during the post-operative period i.e., I/V Ketorolac 30mg every 8 hourly, I/V Tramadol 50mg every 8hourly and as per need basis, and I/V Paracetamol 1000mg every 6 hourly Subsequent surgical procedure was performed routinely. After completion of the surgery and emergence from anesthesia, patients were shifted to the Post Anaesthesia Care Unit, and time of arrival in recovery room was taken as 0-hour and noted. Assessment for outcome measures started in recovery room, and continued till 24 hours of the surgery.</detailed_description>
