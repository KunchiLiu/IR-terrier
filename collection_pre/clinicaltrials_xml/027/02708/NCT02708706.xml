	<brief_title>The Efficacy of Ultrasound-guided Hydrodilatation With Hyaluronic Acid for Patients With Adhesive Capsulitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adhesive capsulitis is a common cause of shoulder pain, and the efficacy of most interventions is limited. This study was conducted to compare the efficacy of hydrodilatation with hyaluronic acid under ultrasonographic guidance plus physical therapy (PT) with that of PT alone for treating adhesive capsulitis. Design: a prospective, single-blinded, randomized, clinical trial Patient and methods: Patients with adhesive capsulitis for at least 3 months were enrolled and randomly allocated into group 1 (hydrodilatation with hyaluronic acid under ultrasonographic guidance plus PT) and group 2 (PT alone). The patients were evaluated before treatment and were reevaluated 0, 6, and 12 weeks after the beginning of the treatment. Outcomes measures included a pain scale (visual analog scale), range of motion, Constant shoulder score, Shoulder Pain And Disability Index, and the Short Form-36</detailed_description>
