	<brief_summary>In addition to the physical, cognitive and psychological symptoms experienced by individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), there is new research which indicates that some individuals with MS have a deficit in emotional processing, specifically, facial affect recognition. Emotional processing is defined as "a central aspect of social cognition". Models of social cognition indicate that emotional processing is an essential component of interpersonal relationships. The failure to accurately perceive other's emotions has been shown to lead to difficulty in social relationships, misinterpreting other's affect, and consequently, inappropriate responding. However, even though a significant number of individuals with MS have impairments in emotional processing, we do not yet have an understanding of how these impairments affect the social functioning of individuals with MS, including the impact of these deficits on family structure. It is well-known that MS impacts one's social functioning including factors such as employment, daily living activities and interpersonal relationships. Recently a strong correlation was observed between reduced social participation in MS and quality of life. There is evidence to suggest that emotional processing deficits lie at the heart of this reduced social participation in persons with MS, leading to decreased social functioning and thus reduced quality of life. However, to date, this hypothesis has not been tested.</brief_summary>
