	<brief_title>Screening for Hesitancy to Optimize Talk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative intervention designed to address these barriers—the Screening for Hesitancy to Optimize Talk (SHOT) intervention—in improving provider-parent vaccine discussions and increasing vaccine acceptance. The SHOT intervention involves administering a validated parent-report measure to parents and communicating their score and item-specific responses to their child's provider before their child's 2 and 6 month health supervision visits. The survey contains 15 questions regarding Health Belief Model concepts that influence parent vaccination behavior and has been shown to predict under-immunization. Our specific aims are to (1) evaluate the impact of the SHOT intervention on a child's immunization status using a matched-pair, cluster randomized controlled trial design; (2) assess how parents' ratings of their vaccine discussions with their child's provider change as a function of the SHOT intervention; and (3) compare pre- and post-study perceptions of barriers to quality vaccine discussions with parents between providers in the SHOT and control arm.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Parents: Parents must be English speaking, ≥18 years old, have a newborn singleton infant ≤2 months, born at ≥35 weeks gestation who is receiving pediatric care at an enrolled Group Health clinic, and be vaccine hesitant (defined as positive screening score on eligibility survey). Newborns: Newborns 0 2 months old whose parents enroll in the study will be invited to participate. Providers: All pediatric and family practice providers at Group Health primary clinics within a 5 county region in western Washington (Snohomish, King, Pierce, Thurston, and Kitsap Counties) will be eligible to participate. Parents/Children: Parents who are not 18 years or older, require language interpretation for medical care, have an infant born &lt;35 weeks gestation, are not vaccine hesitant or will not be taking their child to a participating clinic for health supervision visits will be excluded. Providers: Clinics and providers outside the 5 county region in western Washington (Snohomish, King, Pierce, Thurston, and Kitsap) will be excluded.</criteria>
