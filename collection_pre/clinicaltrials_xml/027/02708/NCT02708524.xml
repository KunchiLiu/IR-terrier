	<brief_summary>This is a multi-site, 5-visit, double-masked, dispensing study comparing an investigational contact lens with currently-marketed contact lenses. The objective of the study is to evaluate the comfort of the lenses when worn for 30 (-2/+6) days on daily wear modality.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and receive a fully executed copy of the form. 2. The subject must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in this clinical protocol. 3. The subject must be between 18 to 40 years of age at the time of consent. 4. The subject's spherical equivalent distance refraction must be in the range of 1.25 to 6.00 in each eye. 5. The subject's refractive cylinder must be ≤1.00D in each eye. 6. The subject must have best corrected visual acuity of 20/30 or better in each eye. 7. The subject must be a habitual frequent replacement (reusable) daily wear spherical silicone hydrogel soft contact lens wearer in both eyes. 8. The subject must be able to wear contact lenses for a minimum of 8 hours, 4 days per week. 9. The subject must have normal eyes (i.e., no ocular medications or infections of any type). 1. Currently pregnant or lactating (subjects who become pregnant during the study will be discontinued). 2. Any ocular or systemic allergies or diseases that may interfere with contact lens wear. 3. Any systemic disease, autoimmune disease, or use of medication, which may interfere with contact lens wear. 4. Any known sensitive/allergic to Ingredients of OPTIFREE® PureMoist® solution. 5. Any daily disposable, extended wear, monovision, toric or multifocal contact lens correction. 6. Entropion, ectropion, extrusions, chalazia, recurrent styes, glaucoma, history of recurrent corneal erosions, aphakia, or moderate or above corneal distortion. 7. Any previous, or planned, ocular or interocular surgery (e.g., radial keratotomy, photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), laserassisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), etc.) 8. Any grade 3 or greater slit lamp findings (e.g., edema, corneal neovascularization, corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival injection) on the FDA classification scale, any previous history or signs of a contact lensrelated corneal inflammatory event (e.g., past peripheral ulcer or round peripheral scar), or any other ocular abnormality that may contraindicate contact lens wear. 9. Any ocular infection. 10. Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact lens wear. 11. Participation in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 7 days prior to study enrollment. 12. History of binocular vision abnormality or strabismus. 13. Any infectious disease (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis) or a contagious immunosuppressive disease (e.g., HIV), by selfreport). 14. Employee of investigational clinic (e.g., Investigator, Coordinator, Technician)</criteria>
