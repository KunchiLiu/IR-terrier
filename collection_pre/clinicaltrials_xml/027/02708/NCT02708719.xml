	<brief_title>Development of a MID for the 1-minute Sit-to-stand Test</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study we develop the minimal important difference for the 1-minute sit-to-stand-test (STST) with an anchor-based method. First step of this study is to find out the differences in the number of repetitions during 1-minute STST, 6-minute walk distance and health-related quality of life from pre to post inpatient pulmonary Rehabilitation program (3 weeks Duration) in the Schoen-Klinik Berchtesgadener Land. In Addition, Balance tests on the Leonardo-Mechanograph will be performed and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) will be assessed. For the second step we will use an anchor-based approach to estimate the MID of the STST. 6MWD and CRQ are used as anchors for which the MID has been established before.</detailed_description>
