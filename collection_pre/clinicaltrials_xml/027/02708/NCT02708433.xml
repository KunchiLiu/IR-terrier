	<brief_summary>Anecdotal data suggest that the buffered form of the local anesthetic is more potent at equal dosages, and a lower dosage of the drug might be used with an effect equal to higher dosage not buffered. Clinical data are needed to confirm these anecdotal data. No data exist comparing buffered local anesthetics at lower drug concentrations to current dosages commonly used in dental and oral surgical procedures</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Outcomes of Buffered 1% Lidocaine vs. Non-buffered 2% Lidocaine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims: Compare clinical depths of pulpal anesthesia (cold, Electronic Pulp Test) for mandibular molar, and canine teeth at 30 minute intervals post injection for mandibular block anesthesia with buffered 1% lidocaine with 1/100,000 epinephrine as compared to non-buffered 2% lidocaine with 1/100,000 epinephrine. Hypotheses: No differences exist in anesthetic depth for pulpal anesthesia after intraoral injection for mandibular block anesthesia between buffered 1% lidocaine with 1/100,000 epinephrine as compared to non-buffered 2% lidocaine with 1/100,000 epinephrine. Study Time Frame: 6 months Month One: Recruit 24 volunteers as subjects. Prepare case-books. Months Two-Three: Clinical Study, Months Four-Five: Analyze data Month Six: Prepare Abstracts, Papers Methods: Blinded, Randomized Clinical Design Recruit subjects with Institutional Review Board approved consent at UNC Subjects will serve as their own controls in a cross-over AB/BA study design which is uniform within sequences, uniform within periods, and balanced Randomized subjects to be injected orally for mandibular block (inferior alveolar, lingual, buccal nerves) alternatively with 4cc of buffered 1% lidocaine with 1/100,000 epinephrine and 4cc non-buffered of 2% lidocaine with 1/100,000 epinephrine. Assessment: pre, and post-anesthetic administration for pulpal anesthesia with cold, Electronic Pulp Test: Mandibular molar, canine at 30 minute intervals Inclusion Criteria: Age 18-30 years, American Society Anesthesiologists (ASA) I Exclusion Criteria Allergy to lidocaine class of anesthetic drugs, Local anesthetic drug past week Current symptoms teeth or oral mucosa. SAS will be used for database management and statistical analysis.</detailed_description>
