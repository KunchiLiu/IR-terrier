	<brief_summary>A multicenter prospective, randomized comparative study will be conducted in infants with colic, according to Rome III criteria. Enrolled infants will be assigned at random to receive Chamomilla L., Melissa Officinalis L. and tyndallized L. Acidophilus (H122), L reuteri DSM 17938 (108 CFU) or simethicone. Treatment will be given to subjects for 28 days and they will be followed for 4 weeks. Treatment success will be assessed at the end of study period. Daily crying and fussing times will be recorded in a structured diary, and maternal questionnaires will be completed to monitor changes in infant colic symptoms and adverse events.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Matricariae Chamomilla L., Melissa Officinalis L. and Tyndallized Lactobacillus Acidophilus (H122) for Infantile Colics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a prospective, multicentre, open label, randomized, controlled trial. All consecutive infants diagnosed with IC, according to Rome III criteria, will be prospectively enrolled in a 12 months period by 3 different Pediatric Gastroenterology units: Department of Translational Medical Science, Section of Pediatrics, University of Naples "Federico II"; Institute of Pediatrics of the University of Foggia; Endoscopy and Gastroenterology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, University of Messina. After the enrollment, all children will be randomly assigned to receive Chamomilla L., Melissa Officinalis L. and tyndallized L. Acidophilus (H122) (Group A), L reuteri DSM 17938 (108 CFU) (Group B) or Simethicone (Group C). Treatment will be given to subjects for 28 days. The study's primary outcome is defined as a reduction in the duration of average crying times, from baseline (day 0) to end of treatment (day 28). The secondary outcome measure is the number of participants who respond to treatment on days 28. Infants who experience a decrease in the daily average crying time of 50% from baseline will be considered as responders to the treatment. Parents will be instructed to complete a structured 28-day maternal diary, modified from Barr et al. in order to record the frequency of colic episodes and the daily crying and fussing time (in minutes), feeding schedule, stool frequency and characteristics, and any adverse events experienced (14). Follow-up visits will be conducted on study days 7, 14, 21 and 28 by the same study investigator. At that visit, diaries and unused study products will be returned.</detailed_description>
