	<brief_title>Automated Hovering for Congestive Heart Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using a 2-arm, randomized, controlled trial (RCT) among congestive heart failure (CHF) patients at the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS), to test the effectiveness of applying automated hovering to improve outcomes among CHF patients at high risk of readmission. This will leverage the electronic medical record (EMR), the Penn Data Store (an electronic repository that can be used to identify study cohorts), and the NIH-funded Way to Health platform, which provides linkages between home-based remote monitoring devices and a server that can provide automated feedback to patients. The primary outcome will be hospital readmission rate during the 12 months of study enrollment. Secondary outcomes will include the total cost of hospitalizations. We will enroll CHF patients discharged from UPHS and randomize them to either: usual care with no additional intervention; or 1) the provision of wireless pill bottles and scales with daily lottery incentives to encourage daily adherence 2) asked to provide the name and contact information of a family member or friend to serve as their support partner 3) have their weights monitored for clinically significant threshold, with verified weight gains alerts sent to the managing physician through the EMR. Managing providers will also be sent a weekly report of weight measurements.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with a recent University of Pennsylvania Health System hospital (UPHS) discharge of congestive heart failure (CHF) aged 1880 who will receive followup in a UPHS outpatient clinic. Patients will be excluded if they will not or cannot give consent or have a markedly shortened life expectancy (listed for heart transplant,have a ventricular assist device, are inotrope dependent, metastatic cancer, or dementia) endstage renal disease (since they may not produce urine and be responsive to diuretics). on dialysis Heart failure managed with a CardioMEMS monitor Receiving another remote monitoring/telemedicine intervention Receiving follow up care outside of UPHS</criteria>
