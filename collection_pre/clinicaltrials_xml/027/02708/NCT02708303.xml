	<brief_title>Mayo Clinic Foregut Surgery Report Card Questionnaire</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Foregut surgery includes conditions of the esophagus, stomach and proximal small intestine. More specifically foregut surgery includes surgery for gastroesophageal reflux disease, hiatal hernias, and paraesophageal hernias. Patients undergoing foregut surgery report having varying degrees of symptoms of reflux, regurgitation, dysphagia, and pain following surgery. Providers also note varying degrees of outcomes. Some of these issues can be assessed using pH probe testing, upper GI endoscopy, high resolution manometry, CT scans, and other testing. There are various validated questionnaires that have been used to assess problem areas of reflux, dysphagia, and pain such as the Promis Global Health Score, Mayo GER Score, Modified Dysphagia Questionnaire-30 Day, Zubrod Score, and pain scale. Each of these symptoms, tests, and questionnaires contributes to the provider's understanding of the patient's outcomes but there is currently no assessment tool that brings all of the test findings and information reported by the patient as symptoms or answers to the questionnaires in a format that that is usable for the clinician and understandable for the patient who has specifically undergone foregut surgery. The Mayo Clinic Foregut Surgery Report Card Questionnaire has been created in order to have a consistent evaluation tool for patients undergoing surgery in the foregut in order to standardize and validate outcome measures. Data will be used to establish the validation of the Mayo Clinic Foregut Surgery Report Card Questionnaire. Data will also lead to the establishment of "normal" or expected scores for patients undergoing each type of foregut procedure.</detailed_description>
