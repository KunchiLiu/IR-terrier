	<brief_summary>Crizotinib, an inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), was approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its administration has achieved considerable success. However, adverse effects inevitably occurred and the most common one was hepatic toxicity, appearing as elevating alanine aminotransferase(ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase(AST). Therefore, the investigators try to figure out the mechanism of crizotinib-inducing hepatic toxicity, and explore whether there is any biological marker to diagnose this side effect in an early stage, which may realize individualized therapy with more efficacy and less side effects.</brief_summary>
