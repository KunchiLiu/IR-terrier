	<brief_summary>Laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation causes significant hemodynamic response and thus presents an increased risk for patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery. Prevention or reduction of this increment is important for hemodynamic control. In this randomized single blind study, the aim of this study is to compare the hemodynamic responses of two different laryngoscopy techniques with Glidescope and Macintosh laryngoscope in coronary cardiac bypass surgery patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation causes significant hemodynamic response and thus presents an increased risk for patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery. Prevention or reduction of this increment is important for hemodynamic control. In this randomized single blind study, the aim of this study is to compare the hemodynamic responses of two different laryngoscopy techniques with Glidescope and Macintosh laryngoscope in coronary cardiac bypass surgery patients. After induction with our institutional protocol for cardiac bypass surgery, hemodynamic data including heart rate, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure data will be recorded. Time for intubation, age, sex, ASA status data will also be recorded.</detailed_description>
