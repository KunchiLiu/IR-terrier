	<brief_summary>This randomised trial is undertaken to assess whether MAD or LGIT is non-inferior to KD with regard to seizure control at twenty-four weeks among children with drug resistant epilepsy. The hypothesis of the study is that in 1 to 15-year-old children with drug resistant epilepsy, use of Modified Atkins Diet (MAD) or Low Glycemic Index Therapy (LGIT) as an add on to the ongoing anti-epileptic drugs would not be inferior to ketogenic diet by &gt;15% in terms of seizure reduction from baseline seizure frequency at 24 weeks. The primary outcome of the study is to determine the efficacy of MAD as compared to KD and LGIT as compared to KD for seizure reduction in drug resistant epilepsy following 24 weeks of dietary therapy in 1 to 15-year-old children on anti-epileptic drugs. The change in seizure frequency will be estimated as percentage change in seizure reduction at 24 weeks as compared to baseline.</brief_summary>
