	<brief_summary>The research on ageing during the last couple of decades has increasingly focused on questions regarding the quality of life and life satisfaction of the old people. Yet the research indicates that when it comes to the final stage of life, the end includes unnecessary suffering and the quality of life drops. Palliative care has traditionally been provided successfully to younger persons dying from incurable illnesses while older people dying of multiple morbidities or "old age" has received far less of this type of care. However, sixty percent of all people who died in Sweden in 2010 were at least 80 years old and it is well known that dying among older people often is a prolonged period of suffering. One reason might be that it is more difficult to identify when the final stages of life begins for older persons. The purpose of this project is to implement and evaluate how a knowledge-based model for palliative care in nursing homes affects the quality of life and the participation in the care process for older persons in nursing homes and their next of kin. A second aim is to explore the staff's implementation process of palliative care and the role of the leadership. The final aim is to investigate which factors (barriers and facilitators) that affect the implementation process of this model.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The project is conducted as a cross-over implementation project about evidence-based palliative care. It is an educational intervention with seminars for professionals in nursing homes. It takes place in two counties (Kronoberg and Skåne) in the south of Sweden. The strategy is based on two national knowledge documents concerning palliative care at the end of life and the Swedish Register of Palliative Care (SRPC). The main tailored intervention study is ongoing during 6 months. It is based on a pilot study conducted during fall 2014. The main intervention started in April 2015 in Alvesta and Ljungby municipalities, Kronoberg County. The educational intervention will be implemented in other municipal nursing homes than in the pilot/feasibility study. Implementation of the educational intervention is conducted in ten nursing homes in Kronoberg County (2015). An equal number of nursing homes in Skåne County will consist of the control group. The educational intervention will then be evaluated in the same way in the two counties through measurement before (baseline) and after the intervention. In the second phase (cross-over design) during 2016, the ten control nursing homes in Skåne will be chosen to implement the co-created palliative care educational intervention and ten new nursing homes in Kronoberg, which has not received the intervention, will be chosen as a control group in Tingsryd and Växjö municipalities. Every seminar group meets once a month and includes different professions (unit manager, district nurse, assistant nurse, and other staff i.e. occupational therapist and physiotherapist). There will be 5 meetings with 8-10 participants in each group from each nursing home. The total intervention period is about 6 months.</detailed_description>
