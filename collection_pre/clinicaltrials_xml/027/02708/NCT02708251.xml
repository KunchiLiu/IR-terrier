	<brief_summary>The intrauterine device (IUD) is a long-acting, highly effective, reversible contraceptive method that may be underutilized due to fear of pain during insertion. Although providers frequently prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for IUD insertion, there is no evidence for any pain reduction. Women can experience high levels of pain when the IUD is placed inside the uterus, and fear of this pain could be a reason that women decide not to use this method.</brief_summary>
