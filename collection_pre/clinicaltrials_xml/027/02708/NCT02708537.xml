	<brief_title>Effect of Plasma Rich in Growth Factors on Semen Quality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Platelet growth factors are a group of proteins involved in cellular communication modifying biological responses. Obtaining plasma rich in growth factors is already widespread and simple protocol technique that is being used in various areas of medicine with superb results. Described many of the growth factors present in the PRGF are related to sperm parameters, especially motility The described effects have been studied in mammalian and each growth factor individually. PRGF contains a pool of growth factors and therefore be interesting to analyze their effect on various sperm parameters. One of those parameters is very important for fertilization sperm motility, since the lack of it will prevent displacement by the cervix to meet the egg in the fallopian tube.</detailed_description>
