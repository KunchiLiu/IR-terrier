	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the molecular mechanisms of atypical-antipsychotic induced insulin resistance. This will be accomplished by administering olanzapine or placebo to healthy subjects for 7 days and analyzing genetic and protein changes in peripheral tissues known to play an important role in insulin resistance pathophysiology.</brief_summary>
