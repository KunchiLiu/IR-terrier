	<brief_summary>This is a PK study of a multi-dose oral cefixime regimen (three 800 mg doses given on a q 8-hour schedule) alone and also co administered with a single 1000 mg oral dose of azithromycin, both within a 24-hour period, in order to achieve total serum cefixime levels of mcg/mL for at least 20 hours. This will determine the tolerability of the regimen and whether there are significant changes in cefixime PK after co-administration. The primary pharmacokinetic objectives are: to determine if a cefixime dosing regimen of three 800 mg doses given alone, on a q 8-hour schedule achieves a total serum cefixime level that exceeds 2.0 mcg/mL for at least 20 hours; to determine if a cefixime dosing regimen of three 800 mg doses given on a q 8 hour schedule co-administered with a single 1000 mg of azithromycin, achieves a total serum cefixime level that exceeds 2.0 mcg/mL for at least 20 hours; and to evaluate whether a single 1000 mg dose of azithromycin alters the PK of a three dose regimen of 800</brief_summary>

The primary safety objectives are to assess the safety and tolerability of a treatment regimen that includes three doses of 800 mg cefixime; to assess the safety and tolerability of a treatment regimen that includes three doses of 800 mg cefixime co-administered with a single 1000 mg dose of azithromycin. The study will take place for 10 weeks.</detailed_description>

History of renal disease 13. Chronic renal, hepatic, or pulmonary disease or other condition that could interfere with the absorption of the study drug or predispose to adverse GI events (e.g., surgical resection of significant proportions of the stomach or bowel, gastric bypass, gastric banding, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease) 14. Positive serology results for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies 15. Subjects who have taken any prescription drugs in the previous 14 days or within five halflives before dosing 16. Ingestion of OTC medications or herbal supplements within seven days of dosing 17.

History of jaundice or hepatic dysfunction associated with prior use of azithromycin 22. Males with a QTcF &gt; 430ms or Females with a QTcF &gt;450ms (Fridericia's correction) on screening 23. Positive pregnancy test; pregnant or nursing women 24. Screening laboratory tests &gt; Grade 1 as defined by Appendix B 25.
