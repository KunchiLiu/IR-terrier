	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, observational, multi-center cohort study of pediatric cardiac arrests. The purpose of the study is to determine the association between chest compression mechanics (rate, depth, flow fraction, compression release) and patient outcomes. In addition, the investigators will determine the association of post cardiac arrest care with patient outcomes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiac arrests in children are a major public health problem. Thousands of children each year in the USA are treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and managed after their cardiac arrest. Neurological outcomes following these in-hospital CPR events are often abnormal. As children with neurological deficits following CPR are a major burden for families and society, improving neurological outcomes through superior chest compression delivery during CPR and optimal care and management after cardiac arrest is an important clinical goal. Therefore, the objective of this investigation is to obtain evidentiary support to associate the relationship of quantitative CPR quality data (depth, rate, chest compressions (CC) fraction, compression release) during CPR, post-cardiac arrest care (PCAC) and patient survival in those children who suffer an arrest within the study (RES-Q) Network.</detailed_description>
