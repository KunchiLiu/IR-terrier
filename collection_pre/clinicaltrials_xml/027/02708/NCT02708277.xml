	<brief_title>Reproductive Outcome Affected by Two Adjunctive Treatments in Patients With Severe Intrauterine Adhesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intrauterine adhesion, also known as Asherman's syndrome, is the partial or complete occlusion of the uterine cavity as a result of endometrium damage. Most intrauterine adhesions patients manifest amenorrhea, reduced menstrual pattern, infertility, and intrauterine growth restriction, which seriously affect their reproductive health. Currently, hysteroscopy is the preferred method of intrauterine adhesions diagnosis and treatment. However, because intrauterine adhesions patients generally have poor endometrium repair capability, the incidence rate of reformation of intrauterine adhesions ranging from 20%-62.5% in those with severe adhesions. The successful pregnancy rate after treatment in severe Asherman's syndrome is reported to be consistently lower, only 33%. The prevention of intrauterine adhesions recurrence after trans-cervical resection of adhesion is clinically important but difficult. Therefore, this study was conducted.</detailed_description>
