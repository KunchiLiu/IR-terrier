	<brief_summary>A common complication after surgery is a temporary state of confusion called postoperative delirium (PD) affecting particularly elder patients. In 2014, a computer program for tablet computers named Delirium Risk Profile (DRP) was developed at the University Hospital Basel to assist preoperative screening. The aim of this study is to generate normative data with cognitively healthy participants for the DRP.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A common complication after surgery is a temporary state of confusion called postoperative delirium (PD), affecting particularly elder patients. Prior studies found risk factors for PD, that are present preoperatively, e.g. older age, cognitive impairment, sensory impairment, surgical intervention-related factors, or the postoperative care. However, the preoperative risk of PD is not screened routinely as it is time-consuming and requires trained personnel. In 2014, the Delirium Risk Profile (DRP), a self-administered computer program for tablet computers, was developed at the University Hospital Basel to assist preoperative screening. It was tested in healthy and cognitively impaired volunteers, as well as in patients undergoing surgery. The aim of this study is to provide normative data for the computer program DRP, and to enable clinicians to administer the DRP as a routinely used tool in the Preoperative Evaluation Clinic.</detailed_description>
