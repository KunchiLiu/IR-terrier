	<brief_summary>Research already found that patients with autistic spectrum disorders lack of Prevotella intestinal type, then schizophrenia patients may also show the specific intestinal type, so investigators want to detect the gut metagenome of schizophrenia patients by high-throughput DNA sequencing to find specific intestinal type, so as to achieve the purpose of schizophrenia diagnosis. According to the detection of inflammatory factors in the blood, nerve growth factor in the cerebrospinal fluid, to find the mechanism of the gut-microbes-brain axis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Gut Metagenome Research of Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective observational study will be conducted and cases will be recruited by multi-center cooperation. Investigators plan to collect 100 schizophrenic patients as case group, 100 healthy people as control group. Investigators use the single drug of risperidone in the treatment of schizophrenia patients and follow up the patients on day 1, the third week, the third month, the sixth month and the first year. There are two objectives: 1. compare healthy population with schizophrenia patients in the difference of gut metagenome and inflammatory factors in the blood, stool samples aimed at detecting the difference of composition of intestinal microorganism; 2. Observe the change of intestinal microorganism, inflammatory factors, γ－aminobutyric acid of schizophrenic patients who received risperidone treatment according to the blood, stool samples, cerebrospinal fluid during the follow-up period.</detailed_description>

Patients have organic brain disease or complications and mental retardation. According to the DSMⅥ diagnostic criteria , patients have drug abuse or drug dependence and incomplete remission. glutamicoxalacetic transaminase (AST) or glutamicpyruvic transaminase (ALT) is 2 times higher than the normal limit. Renal dysfunction, creatinine is higher than the upper limit of normal value. The women in pregnancy or lactation now, and may be in pregnant during the study period. Patients are allergic to risperidone.</criteria>
