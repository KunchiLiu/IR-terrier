	<brief_summary>Insulin resistance (or pre-diabetes) is diagnosed using the oral glucose tolerance test. However, high blood glucose levels during this test may adversely impact on microvascular function. Investigators will determine whether a liquid mixed meal challenge (from carbohydrate, protein and fat) is a more appropriate test for assessing microvascular-derived insulin resistance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Microvascular Insulin Resistance and Mixed Meal Challenge</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After consuming a meal, 80% of glucose is disposed in skeletal muscle. Our research group has demonstrated that microvascular blood flow in skeletal muscle plays an integral role in this process. Physiological doses of insulin stimulate microvascular blood flow, and that this increase is associated with enhanced glucose uptake by muscle. This microvascular action of insulin is lost during insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. The oral glucose tolerance test (GTT) is the gold standard for assessing insulin resistance and pre-diabetes and is used world-wide. However high blood glucose levels following a glucose load may adversely impact on microvascular function. The aim of this project is to determine whether a mixed meal challenge (liquid drink consisting of carbohydrate, fat and protein) is a better test for assessing microvascular-derived insulin resistance.</detailed_description>
