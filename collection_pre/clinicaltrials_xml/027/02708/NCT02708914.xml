	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate a 1:1 dose conversion from Eprex速 to UB-851 in terms of clinical efficacy and safety in subjects with chronic renal failure receiving hemodialysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Compare the Safety and Efficacy of UB-851 and Eprex速</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 52-week, phase III trial consisting of two parts: Part I is designed as a double-blind, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of UB-851 in comparison to Eprex速 in subjects with renal anemia on hemodialysis with a treatment period of 24 weeks. Part II is designed as a single-arm, safety evaluation period (from week 25 to week 52) to evaluate the long-term safety and immunogenicity of UB-851.</detailed_description>
