	<brief_summary>This study will test a new MRI sequence that measures cerebral blood flow (CBF). Because this technique for measuring CBF is new, there is little information on what the normal values for different regions of the brain should be. Information from the study will be used to establish normative CBF values for the brain, improving the reliable use of this technique for the diagnosis of brain injury or disease.</brief_summary>
