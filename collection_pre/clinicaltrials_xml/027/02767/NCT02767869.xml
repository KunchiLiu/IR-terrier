	<brief_summary>The Metabolic Syndrome is a high prevalence disease worldwide. About a quarter of the adult population suffers the disease. Banaba has shown evidence that has on metabolic syndrome, insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. The investigators hypothesis was that the the administration of resveratrol modifies the metabolic syndrome, insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Banaba (Lagerstroemia Speciosa) on Metabolic Syndrome, Insulin Secretion and Insulin Sensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was carried out in 24 patients with a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome in accordance with the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). Waist circumference, glucose, insulin levels, lipid profile, creatinine and acid uric were evaluated after a 75 g of dextrose load. 12 received Banaba, 500 mg, two times per day (1000 mg) before meals during 3 months. The remaining 12 patients received placebo with the same prescription. Area Under the Curve of glucose and insulin was calculated as well as total insulin secretion (insulinogenic index), first-phase of insulin secretion (Stumvoll index) and insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index). This protocol was approved by a local ethics committee and written informed consent was obtained from all volunteers. Results are presented as mean and standard deviation. Intra and inter group differences were tested using the Wilcoxon signed-rank and Mann-Whitney U-test respectively; p≤0.05 was considered significant.</detailed_description>
