	<brief_summary>The study aims to evaluate the feasibility of transnasal endoscopy in patients with portal hypertension, cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic. The incidence of the procedure's adverse effects, the patient's tolerance and his/her opinion about the exam are analyzed. In addition, the interobserver matched for the discoveries found in the study is carried out.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Gastroesophageal Varices by Transnasal Endoscopy.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is a descriptive study that proposes to evaluate the feasibility of the transnasal endoscopy to screen for gastroesophageal varices in patients with portal hypertension, cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic. The rupture of gastroesophageal varices is the principal cause of death among cirrhotics, responsible for high rates of morbidity and mortality. Current medical literature recommends that the cirrhotic and the carriers of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension screen for gastric-esophageal varices in order to establish prophylactic and therapeutic measures, when recommended. Usually, the conventional peroral esophagogastroduodenoscopy is used for such purpose but the need for sedation reduces productivity, increases costs and introduces a small but not insignificant risk concerning complications, especially in decompensated cirrhotic. For this reason, a transnasal endoscopy would be an interesting option for these patients because it does not require sedation. The patients will be referred to endoscopy unit from general hepatology and viral hepatitis ambulatory settings. All of those who were asked to undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy to screen for gastroesophageal varices will be invited to participate in the study, as long as they fulfill the inclusion criteria and agree to participate and sign Consent Form. After the endoscopy, a questionnaire will be filled out with information about the exam, tolerance, incidence of adverse effects and alterations that were found. This questionnaire will have information about the liver disease cause, the cirrhosis staging to evaluate the patient's disease gravity and the patient's perception of the exam. The endoscopy will register the alterations that were found and the data about the patient's monitoring. Besides, the alterations related to the portal hypertension and afterwards the images analyzed by another endoscopist will be photographed for the matched calculation. The results will be submitted to analysis. Statistical differences will be calculated using test "t" of student or Chi-square and significant values (p) under 0.05 considered.</detailed_description>
