	<brief_summary>This study will include patients who are diagnosed with knee OA and are recommended for a knee injection. Study subjects will be randomized to receive either the standard of care knee injection (steroid) or amniotic tissue injection (BioDRestore). Study subjects will be asked for permission for a baseline knee aspiration prior to the knee injection. At 6 months post-injection, knee aspirations will be taken and sent for analysis. Study subjects will be followed for 1 year post-injection to include range of motion measurements and patient-reported pain/functional outcome measurements. X-rays will also be taken at the 1-year post-injection appointment.</brief_summary>
