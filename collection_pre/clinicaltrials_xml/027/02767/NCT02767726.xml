	<brief_summary>Cervix cancer is a major global health concern. A way to screen and immediately treat precancerous lesions (Screen-and-Treat) is greatly needed. Developed by MobileOCT, polarized difference imaging and conventional imaging are used to identify suspicious lesions. We aim to compare this non-invasive method with colposcopy. Patients at the Dickens Clinic will have 3-5 minutes of non-invasive imaging before colposcopy. Pathology will be compared both to colposcopy impression versus MobileOCT.</brief_summary>
