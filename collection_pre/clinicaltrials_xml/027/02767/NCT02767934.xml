	<brief_summary>This phase II clinical trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating small amounts of cancer cells that remain after attempts to remove the cancer has been made in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may strengthen the immune system and help it to target remaining cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab in Treating Minimal Residual Disease in Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab in minimal residual disease (MRD)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To describe the toxicity profile of pembrolizumab in patients with previously-treated ALL. II. To gain a preliminary assessment of how MRD response translates into relapse-free and overall survival. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare disease assessments by multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to a newly-developed and more sensitive next generation sequencing (NGS)-based platform. II. To correlate response to pembrolizumab to immunologic markers in peripheral blood and bone marrow specimens. III. To evaluate if treatment with pembrolizumab has a measurable impact on hematopoietic engraftment and graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) in patients who subsequently undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). OUTLINE: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete MRD response may receive up to 1 additional year of treatment at the discretion of the investigator. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 12 weeks for up to 2 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All subjects must have a diagnosis of ALL of either Bcell, Tcell, or mixed (i.e., B/T lineage) Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial Presence of MRD (defined as &lt; 5% blasts in the bone marrow by morphologic assessment and no clinicallyapparent extramedullary disease but with quantifiablymeasurable disease as assessed by either MFC or PCR) under any of the following circumstances: MRD persistence &gt;= 12 weeks after the start of initial therapy MRD persistence &gt;= 3 weeks after the start of salvage therapy, or MRD reappearance at any time Have previously received treatment with &gt;= 1 Abelson (ABL) kinase inhibitor (e.g., imatinib, dasatinib, etc.) or are ineligible for such treatment for patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) disease only Have previously received or are ineligible for treatment with blinatumomab; ineligibility will include (but not be limited to) cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19)negative disease, denial of insurance coverage, physician discretion, and/or patient refusal Be willing to provide tissue from a newly obtained bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy; newlyobtained is defined as a specimen obtained up to 28 days prior to initiation of treatment on day 1; subjects for whom newlyobtained samples cannot be provided (e.g., inaccessible or subject safety concern) may submit an archived specimen only upon agreement from the principal investigator (PI) Have a performance status of 0 to 2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance scale Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,000 /mcL Hemoglobin &gt;= 8 g/dL Platelets &gt;= 50,000 /mcL Serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) OR measured or calculated creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for subject with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] can also be used in place of creatinine or creatinine clearance [CrCl]) Serum total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 X ULN OR direct bilirubin =&lt; ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 ULN Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =&lt; 2.5 ULN International normalized ratio (INR) or prothrombin time (PT) =&lt; 1.5 ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) =&lt; 1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants Female subjects of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication; if the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment Has a known history of active bacillus tuberculosis (TB) Has a known hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients Has had a prior anticancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., =&lt; grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to study day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., =&lt; grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent Note: subjects with =&lt; grade 2 neuropathy or with hematologic toxicity that has recovered to levels above that stated in inclusion criterion are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study if all other inclusion/exclusion criteria are met Note: if subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention (i.e., =&lt; grade 1 or at baseline) prior to starting therapy Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment; exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer Has known active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia and/or leukemic meningitis; subjects with previously treated CNS leukemia may participate provided they are stable (e.g., without evidence of active disease by imaging for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline) and have no evidence of leukemic blasts on analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs);

antimicrobial prophylaxis will be permitted at the discretion of the treating investigator Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting from the time of consent through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment Has received prior therapy with any immune checkpoint inhibitor Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies) Has known active hepatitis B (e.g., hepatitis B virus surface protein antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or hepatitis C (e.g., hepatitis C virus [HCV] ribonucleic acid [RNA] [qualitative] is detected) Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy Note: seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed;
