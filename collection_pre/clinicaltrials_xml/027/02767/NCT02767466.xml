	<brief_summary>Using a single blind within-subject design, 16 patients with neurological disorders were randomly exposed to two different treatments: physical therapy and robotic assisted gait training. Both before and after the treatments, a self-report Mood Survey Scale (MSS) was used to assess the effects on the treatment on distinct affective states. The subscales of the MSS were tested for pre-post changes and different effects between treatments with non-parametric tests.</brief_summary>
