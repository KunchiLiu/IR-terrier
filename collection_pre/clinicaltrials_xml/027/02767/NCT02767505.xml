	<brief_summary>This is nationwide registry-based randomized clinical multicenter trial in which patients will be randomized to gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG). The co-primary endpoint are weight control over 5 years and the amount of severe adverse events. Additionally the investigators have predefined a number of secondary endpoints, and the trial has a sufficient number of patients to allow comparisons across subgroups.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Follow-up of the patients will use the routines respectively for regular follow-up on the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry (SOReg) after 6v, 1 year, 2 years, and after 5 years. In order to evaluate if SG has advantages compared to the previous standard, the investigators want to examine whether SG operations are equivalent (non-inferiority) for weight loss and weight stability five years after surgery in comparison to GBP, and if SG is associated with fewer long-term complications (superiority). The primary outcome measure emanates from assessment of long term weight management and the frequency of serious complications.</detailed_description>
