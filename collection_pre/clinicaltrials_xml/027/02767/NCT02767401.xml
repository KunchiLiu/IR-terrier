	<brief_title>The Success of Opening Single CTO Lesions to Improve Myocardial Viability Study (SOS-comedy)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with coronary artery disease might benefit from successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, there is currently no consensus on an optimal treatment modality for single lesions resulting in coronary total occlusion (CTO). Since the other coronary arteries are often lesion-free, or with stenosis of less than 50%, patients often present with no symptoms. Although the expert consensus on CTO lesion suggests reducing the incidence of long-term adverse events via successful revascularization, there are few retrospective studies on single CTO lesions. To date, it is unclear whether successful PCI based on optimal medication treatment (OMT) can increase myocardial viability and the extent of myocardial viability related to prognosis of those CTO patients. Therefore, the aim of this multi-center, prospective, open labeled, non-randomized controlled study was to determine if the improvement to myocardial viability in single CTO patients with successful PCI plus OMT was superior to that of patients with only OMT.</detailed_description>
