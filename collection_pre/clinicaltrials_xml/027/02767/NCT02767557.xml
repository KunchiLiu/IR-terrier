	<brief_title>Study of Nab-Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine With or Without Tocilizumab in Pancreatic Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The development of new effective treatment strategies remains a major challenge in patients with PC. High levels of IL-6 and presence of a systemic inflammatory response in PC patients have been reported to correlate with worse survival. Preclinical PC models have clearly shown that anti-IL-6-receptor antibody tocilizumab in combination with chemotherapy reduced tumor growth, number of distant metastases and the local recurrence rate. Thus, blockade of IL-6-regulated signaling pathways represents a promising approach in combination with chemotherapy. Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) alone or in combination with hypoalbuminaemia (Modified Glasgow Prognostic Score - mGPS) are induced by IL-6 and could feasibly represent surrogate markers for IL-6 bioactivity to stratify patients likely to gain benefit through targeting IL-6.</detailed_description>

A modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) criteria of 1 or 2 assessed within 14 days of randomization as defined below: mGPS of 1: CRP &gt; 10 mg/L and albumin ≥ 35 g/L mGPS of 2: CRP &gt; 10 mg/L and albumin &lt; 35 g/L No prior antineoplastic chemotherapy or anticancer drugs. Patients who have received neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and who are diagnosed with loco regional recurrent or metastatic disease are not eligible ECOG/WHO Performance Status (PS) 01 ≥ 4 weeks since prior major surgery, ≥ 2 weeks since prior minor surgery and ≥ 1 week since prior radiation therapy Measurable disease using the RECIST1.1 criteria, defined as lesions that can be measured in at least one dimension and which have not been previously irradiated. Longest diameter ≥ 20 mm with conventional techniques or ≥ 10 mm with spiral CT scan or MRI Fertile men and women of childbearing potential (defined as a sexually mature woman who (1) has not undergone hysterectomy [the surgical removal of the uterus] or bilateral oophorectomy [the surgical removal of both ovaries] or (2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months [ie, has had menses at any time during the preceding 24 consecutive months]) must use secure contraception methods as follows: intrauterine device, doublebarrier contraception, as a condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with a vaginal spermicidal agent (foam/gel/cream/suppository), vasectomized partner who is sterile prior to the female subject's entry and is the sole sexual partner for that female, or complete abstinence from sexual intercourse from before 2 months entering the study until 6 months after end of chemotherapy Acceptable hematology parameters defined as: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10⁹/L Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10⁹/L Haemoglobin ≥ 5.6 mmol/L Acceptable liver function defined as: Serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) ASAT/ALAT &lt; 2.5 x ULN ( &lt; 5 x ULN with known liver metastasis) Acceptable renal function with a creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/ (eg, using the CockroftGault formula) Subjects must have signed and dated a BIOPAC IRB/IEC approved written informed consent form in accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines. This must be obtained before the performance of any protocol related procedures that are not part of normal subject care Electrocardiogram (ECG) with significant modifications suggesting a high risk of occurrence of angina pectoris or high risk of arrhythmia. Other malignancies, except adequately treated basal carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or insitu cervix carcinoma or incidental prostate cancer (T1a, Gleason score ≤ 6, PSA &lt; 0.5 ng/ml), or any other tumor with a disease free survival of ≥ 5 years. History of serious or concurrent illness or uncontrolled medical disorder; any medical condition that might be aggravated by chemotherapy treatment or which could not be controlled; including, but not restricted to: Active infection requiring antibiotics within 2 weeks before the study inclusion Concurrent congestive heart failure NYHA ( class III IV ) Unstable angina pectoris, or myocardial infarction within 6 months and/or prior poorly controlled hypertension Inflammatory bowel disease (colitis, Crohns) or other serious gastrointestinal conditions associated with risk of perforation Peripheral neuropathy grade ≥ 2 according to CTCAE v 4.0 Concomitant use of immunosuppressive or myelosuppressive medications that would in the opinion of the investigator, increase the risk of serious neutropenic complications. No known or suspected allergy to the investigational agents or any agents given in association with this trial. Pregnant or lactating women. Any psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical condition which does not permit protocol compliance and medical followup. Enrollment in any other clinical protocol or investigational study with an interventional agent or assessments that may interfere with study procedures.</criteria>
