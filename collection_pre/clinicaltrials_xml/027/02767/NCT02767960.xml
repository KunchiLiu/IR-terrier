	<brief_title>Serum Tenascin-C Concentration in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is found that Tenascin-C plays an important role in ventricular remodeling, heart failure, aortic dissection, rheumatic heart disease and other cardiovascular diseases, which may be a new marker for the diagnosis and prognosis prediction of these diseases. However, there is few relevant studies about the Tenascin-C concentration in patients with acute coronary syndrome.This study valuates the serum Tenascin-C concentration in patients with acute coronary syndrome.</detailed_description>
