	<brief_summary>Abstract: It is intuitive that post discharge surgical complications are associated with increased patient dissatisfaction, and directly associated with an increase in medical expenditures. It is also easy to make the connection that many post hospital discharge surgical complications including surgical site infections could be influenced or exacerbated by patient co-morbidities. The authors of a recent study reported that female gender, obesity, diabetes, smoking, hypertension, coronary artery disease, critical limb ischemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dyspnea, and neurologic disease were all of among significant predictors of surgical site infections after vascular reconstruction was performed. The main concern for optimal patient care especially in geographically isolated areas of West Virginia is to have early, expeditious, and prompt diagnosis of early surgical site infection with subsequent indicated interventions. This theme will lead to patient satisfaction, minimizing third party interventions and decrease the total cost associated with these complications. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to believe that monitoring using telehealth technology and managing the general health care patients receive after a hospital vascular intervention will improve overall health and reduce post-operative complications. Aims/Objectives: 1. The primary objective of the current project is to compare early and late outcomes for patients who receive post discharge health care monitoring (which includes using Telehealth electronic monitoring; THEM) to patients who receive standard of care (SOC) and routine discharge instructions and no monitoring. Methods: 1. Randomize patients who are scheduled to have revascularization interventions with groin incisions to receive either telehealth electronic health care monitoring or normal standard of follow-up care. 2. Follow patients for 4 weeks, record any 30-day hospital readmissions or complications. In addition, have participants complete the follow-up survey questionnaires.</brief_summary>
