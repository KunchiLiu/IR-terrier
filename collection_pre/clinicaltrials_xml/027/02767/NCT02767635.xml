	<brief_title>Comparison Between Steroid and Different Sites of Botulinum Toxin Injection in the Treatment of Lateral Epicondylalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lateral epicondylalgia or tennis elbow is a common painful elbow disorder with a prevalence of 1% to 3% in the general population and has a higher rate up to 14.5% in strenuous jobs. Botulinum toxin type A injection was an emerging option in treating lateral epicondylalgia. In this study, the patients were randomly assigned into three groups: 1. Botox-Epic group received 20 units of Botox injection into lateral epicondyle; 2. Botox-Tend group had 20 units of Botox injected into tender point of muscles; 3. Steroid group had 40mg of triamcinolone injected into lateral epicondyle. The aim of this randomized controlled study was to compare the effects of injection with corticosteroid and botulinum toxin type A via two different sites in patients with lateral epicondylalgia.</detailed_description>
