Male subjects: • Must practice true abstinence or agree to use a condom during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while participating in the study, during dose interruptions and for 6 months following IP discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy 8. Understand and voluntarily sign an ICF prior to any study related assessments or procedures being conducted 9. Be able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements 10. Acceptable hematology parameters defined as: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10⁹/L Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10⁹/L Haemoglobin ≥ 5.6 mmol/L 11. Acceptable liver function defined as: Serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) ASAT/ALAT &lt; 2.5 x ULN 12. Acceptable renal function with a creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/ (e.g., using the CockroftGault formula) 1. Prior neoadjuvant treatment, radiation therapy, or systemic therapy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma 2. Presence of or history of metastatic or locally recurrent pancreatic adenocarcinoma 3. Other malignancies, except adequately treated basal carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ cervix carcinoma or incidental prostate cancer (T1a, Gleason score ≤ 6, PSA &lt; 0.5 ng/ml), or any other tumor with a DSF survival of ≥ 5 years 4. History of serious or concurrent illness or uncontrolled medical disorder; any medical condition that might be aggravated by chemotherapy treatment or which could not be controlled; including, but not restricted to: Active infection requiring antibiotics within 2 weeks before the study inclusion Concurrent congestive heart failure NYHA class III IV Unstable angina pectoris, or myocardial infarction within 6 months and/or prior poorly controlled hypertension History of interstitial lung disease, slowly progressive dyspnea and unproductive cough, sarcoidosis, silicosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypersensitivity pneumonitis or multiple allergies Concomitant use of immunosuppressive or myelosuppressive medications that would in the opinion of the investigator, increase the risk of serious neutropenic complications 5. Known or suspected allergy to the investigational agents or any agents given in association with this trial 6. Any psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical condition which does not permit protocol compliance and medical followup 7. Enrollment in any other clinical protocol or investigational study with an interventional agent or assessments that may interfere with study procedures 8. Any condition including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study 9. Any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study 10. Unwillingness or inability to comply with study procedures 11. Current use of anticoagulation therapy such as heparins both unfractionated and low molecular weighted</criteria>
