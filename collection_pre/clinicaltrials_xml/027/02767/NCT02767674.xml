	<brief_title>Trial of R-GemOx Versus R-miniCHOP Regimen in First-line Treatment of Elderly Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gemcitabine and Oxaliplatin(GemOx) shows effective activity in patients with relapsed diffuse large-cell lymphoma and other solid tumors. Our Previous study showed that two-weekly regimen of rituximab combined with GemOx regimen acheived comparable response rate to R-miniCHOP.The investigators therefore design this open-label,phase III and random trial to compared the safety and efficacy of R-Gemox versus R-miniCHOP as first-line treatment of elderly patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Primary Outcome Measures: • overall response rate Secondary Outcome Measures: - progression free survival - overall survival - safety and toxicity Enrollment:614 Study Start Date: June 2016 Primary Completion Date: June 2016</detailed_description>
