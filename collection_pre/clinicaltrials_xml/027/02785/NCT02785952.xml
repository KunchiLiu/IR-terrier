	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial compares nivolumab with ipilimumab and nivolumab alone in treating patients with stage IV squamous cell lung cancer that has come back after previous treatment. This is a "non-match" sub-study that includes all screened patients not eligible for a biomarker-driven sub-study. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may be able to shrink tumors. It is not yet known whether nivolumab works better with or without ipilimumab in treating patients with squamous cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S1400I Lung-MAP: Nivolumab With or Without Ipilimumab as Second-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Recurrent Stage IV Squamous Cell Lung Cancer and No Matching Biomarkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced stage refractory squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) of the lung randomized to nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare investigator-assessed progression-free survival (IA-PFS) in patients with advanced stage refractory SCCA of the lung randomized to nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab. II. To compare the response rates (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial) per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 among patients randomized to receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab. III. To compare the response rates (confirmed only, complete and partial) per RECIST 1.1 among patients randomized to receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab. IV. To evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab. TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate if there is a differential treatment effect on OS, IA-PFS, and response by tumor programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression status. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and ipilimumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1 of every third course (every 42 days). Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up until death or 3 years after sub-study registration, whichever occurs first.</detailed_description>
