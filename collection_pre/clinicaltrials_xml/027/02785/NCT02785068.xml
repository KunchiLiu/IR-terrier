	<brief_title>Evaluation of MM-151 + Nal-IRI + 5-FU + Leucovorin in RAS/RAF Wild-type Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part 1: Patients will be enrolled to determine the maximum tolerated dose, safety and tolerability of MM-151 + nal-IRI + 5-FU + LV in patients with mCRC that are RAS/RAF wild-type. Part 2: Patients will be enrolled at the maximum tolerated dose of MM-151 in combination with nal-IRI + 5-FU + LV to characterize initial efficacy in conjunction with levels of irinotecan and SN-38 measured in tissue.</detailed_description>
