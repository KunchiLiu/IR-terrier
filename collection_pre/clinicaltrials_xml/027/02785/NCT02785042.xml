	<brief_summary>This prospective, single-arm clinical multicenter study intends to measure normal structural parameters of the optic nerve head, the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer, and the macula using the Heidelberg Spectralis OCT device. This study is conducted in Hispanic descent volunteers. The main goal of the study is to provide the range of these structural parameters in normal eyes. The study will include at least 240 normal volunteers; up to 10 study sites will recruit subjects. Overall an approximately equal age distribution from 18 to 90 years and an approximately equal number of females and males will be enrolled (approximately 40-60% females in each age group). All subjects will undergo Spectralis OCT imaging, biometric and ophthalmoscopic examination, disc photography and visual field testing in one single visit, if possible. Repeated perimetry or Spectralis scans may be performed at a second visit within 30 days of the initial visit. All examinations performed on the subjects are non-significant risk procedures.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Able and willing to undergo the test procedures, give consent, and to follow instructions. Signed informed consent Age ≥18 to 90. Healthy eye without prior intraocular surgery (except cataract surgery and Laser in Situ Keratomileusis) and without clinically significant vitreal, retinal or choroidal diseases, clinically significant diabetic retinopathy (subject may have diabetes), or disease of the optic nerve. Small drusen are acceptable in older subjects. Hispanic decent (selfreported) Negative history of glaucoma (not including family history) Intraocular pressure ≤21mmHg. Best corrected visual acuity ≥20/40. Refraction between +6 and 6 diopters and astigmatism ≤ 2 diopters. Axial length ≤ 26.0 mm (by optical biometry) Normal visual field with Glaucoma Hemifield Test and Mean Deviation within normal limits or not abnormal visual field by judgment of the ophthalmologist / optometrist Clinically normal appearance of the optic disc, with normal appearing neuroretinal rim with respect to color and shape. The optic disc is examined ophthalmoscopically and by evaluation of stereo photographs. If both eyes are eligible, both eyes enter the study. Vulnerable subjects (as defined in ISO 14155 GCP) with the exception of employees of the site, and, if applicable, students of the respective university. Staff that is listed on the delegation form are excluded from participation. Subjects unable to read or write Unreliable visual field. The reliability indices should be used as guide as well as the perimetrist's notes. Unusable disc stereo photos. Inability to undergo the tests. Insufficient quality of Spectralis OCT images (this is not determined until after Spectralis OCT examination, and is an unusual circumstance).</criteria>
