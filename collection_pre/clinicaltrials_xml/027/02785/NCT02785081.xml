	<brief_title>Thoracic Epidural Depth in Children Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging.Magnetic Resonance Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thoracic epidural in children confers clinical benefits but are technically challenging. The prediction of thoracic skin epidural depth (SED) might increase the success rate and decrease complications. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most comprehensive imaging modality of the spine, and the measurements derived can be more accurate. The present study is based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-based measurements to evaluate the thoracic SED and define the ratio between the straight and inclined SED at the two thoracic levels (T6-7 and T9-10) in children.</detailed_description>
