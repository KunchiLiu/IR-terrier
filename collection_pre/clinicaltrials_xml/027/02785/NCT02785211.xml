	<brief_summary>Background: It is essential to understand how to prevent and treat the epidemic of depression. Several studies have reported the prevalence of depressive symptoms in the urban population in China, but there is a lack of information regarding intervention for depression in rural left behind old elderly people. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a Modified Behavioral Activation Treatment (MBAT) Intervention on reducing depressive symptoms in rural left behind elderly people. Methods: 80 rural left behind elderly people who had a Geriatric Depression Scale(GDS) score between 11 and 25 will be recruited and randomly assigned to the intervention (n=40) and control group(n=40). The intervention group will be received both MBAT and treatment-as-usual for 8 weeks while the control group received treatment-as-usual. Both groups will be assessed with the GDS, Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Oxford Happiness Questionnaire (OHQ) at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at 3 months post-intervention. Significance: This is the first time BA psychotherapy will be used in China.The current study will develop an intention model based on the traditional BA and CBT. The recurrence and seriousness of depression symptoms may be reduced by the intervention program. We hope that MBAT in clients will provide a direction for the management of mental health in rural left-behind elders..</brief_summary>
