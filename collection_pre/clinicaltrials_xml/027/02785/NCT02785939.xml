	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well palbociclib works in treating patients with stage IV squamous cell lung cancer that has come back after previous treatment. This is a sub-study that includes all screened patients positive for the cyclin dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) biomarker. CDK4/6 can cause tumor cells to grow more quickly. Palbociclib may decrease the activity of CDK4/6 and may be able to shrink tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S1400C Lung-MAP: Palbociclib as Second-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Recurrent Stage IV Squamous Cell Lung Cancer and Positive Biomarker Matches</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate if there is sufficient evidence to continue to the Phase III component by evaluating the objective response rate (ORR) for cell cycle gene alteration positive patients registered to S1400C treated with palbociclib. (Phase II) II. If the study meets the criteria specified in S1400 Section 11.2a, the study will be amended to include a follow-on randomized Phase III trial. (Phase III) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate investigator-assessed progression-free survival (IA-PFS) and overall survival (OS) in cell cycle gene alteration-positive treated with palbociclib. (Phase II) II. To evaluate the duration of response (DoR) among cell cycle gene alteration positive patients treated with palbociclib who achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (confirmed and unconfirmed) by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. (Phase II) III. To evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with palbociclib. (Phase II) TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE OBJECTIVES: I. To identify additional predictive tumor/blood biomarkers that may modify response or define resistance to palbociclib beyond the chosen biomarker for biomarker-driven sub-studies. II. To identify potential resistance biomarkers at disease progression. III. To establish a tissue/ blood repository from patients with refractory squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) of the lung. OUTLINE: As of 12/18/2015, patients are assigned to Arm I. ARM I: Patients receive palbociclib orally (PO) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL 12/18/2015): Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Upon progression, patients may be eligible to re-register to Arm III. ARM III: Patients in Arm II eligible for re-registration receive palbociclib PO on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, all patients are followed up every 6 months for the first 2 years and then at the end of the year 3 from date of sub-study/re-registration.</detailed_description>
