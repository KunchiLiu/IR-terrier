	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test a comprehensive, male-oriented, online screening and referral (Screening for Mental Health; SMH) and male-oriented online information and referral intervention program (Man Therapy; MT) to improve mental health and wellbeing with a focus on prevention of suicide and help-seeking behaviors among middle-aged men. The online programs will be offered together to maximize the effect on reducing suicide behavior and increasing mental health help-seeking behaviors for men.
