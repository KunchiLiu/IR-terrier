	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the potentiation of muscle relaxation caused by rocuronium by inhalational agent sevoflurane. Half the patients will be ventilated with oxygen ,nitrous oxide and sevoflurane during induction of anaesthesia and half will be ventilated only with oxygen and nitrous oxide.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Sevoflurane on the Onset Characteristics and Intubating Conditions of Rocuronium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rocuronium is a non depolarizing muscle relaxant. Inhalational general anaesthetic agents like Sevoflurane have some muscle relaxation effect by depressing the spinal motor neurons. Inhalational anaesthetics also alter the tonic input received from descending modulatory systems from the brain. Deep anaesthesia with inhalational agents may cause some degree of neuromuscular blockade.</detailed_description>
