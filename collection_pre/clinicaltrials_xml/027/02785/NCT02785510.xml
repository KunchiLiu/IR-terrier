	<brief_summary>Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease affecting about 1-3% of population above 60 years. Recently, non-motor symptoms are getting more attention in PD management. The pattern of PD onset and clinical course differ from one population to another. Many studies have been conducted to determine the clinical profile of PD in populations worldwide. However, no similar studies have been conducted in Egypt. Therefore, the investigators will conduct a nation-wide, collaborative, cross sectional study to determine the pattern of Parkinson's disease onset, clinical course, and non-motor symptoms among Egyptian population.</brief_summary>
