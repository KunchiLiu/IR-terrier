	<brief_summary>The promotion of physical activity (PA) is paramount to public health, yet interventions in the social cognitive tradition have yielded negligible improvements. Two reasons for these results may be the over reliance on intention as the proximal determinant of behaviour and a lack of consideration of implicit/automatic determinants of PA. The purpose of this study was to apply Multi-Process Action Control (M-PAC), a framework centered on PA intention-translation and the gradual building of habit to examine PA change using a two-arm parallel design, randomized controlled trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise Habit and M-PAC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Two of the most prominent limitations of traditional social cognitive models used to understand moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) are the gap between intention and behaviour and the lack of consideration of implicit processes in behavioural enactment. Thus, new models are now being examined that attempt to consider these potential limitations. Multi-Process Action Control (M-PAC) is one such attempt to build a more comprehensive schematic, whereby intention is established via the means of constructs from traditional social cognitive theories (i.e., outcome expectations, perceived capability), but the success of translating this intention to behaviour depends on behavioural-regulation (self-regulatory tactics) (BR), affective judgments (expected pleasure) (AJ) and opportunity (time, access). Over time, M-PAC proposes that habit (stimulus -behaviour bonds) and identity (role-behaviour bonds) develop from performing the behaviour and largely contribute to the maintenance of PA. Aim: The purpose of this study was to conduct at two-arm parallel design, RCT to determine if the M-PAC experimental group would demonstrate greater change in PA and post-intention constructs across time. Methods: Participants (n=94) were inactive new gym members and were randomized into a control or M-PAC experimental group. The experimental group attended a workshop and received a booster phone call follow-up at week four. Measures for both groups included accelerometry and M-PAC at baseline and at week eight.</detailed_description>
