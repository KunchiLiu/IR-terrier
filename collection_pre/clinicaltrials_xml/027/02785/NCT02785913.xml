	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well taselisib (GDC-0032) works in treating patients with stage IV squamous cell lung cancer that has come back after previous treatment. This is a sub-study that includes all screened patients positive for the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) biomarker. PI3K can cause tumor cells to grow more quickly. Taselisib may decrease the activity of PI3K and may be able to shrink tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S1400B Lung-MAP: Taselisib as Second-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Recurrent Stage IV Squamous Cell Lung Cancer and Positive Biomarker Matches</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate if there is sufficient evidence to continue to the phase III component by evaluating the objective response rate (ORR) for PI3K Genentech (GNE)-positive patients registered to S1400B treated with GDC-0032. (Phase II) II. If the study meets the criteria specified in S1400, the study will be amended to include a follow-on randomized phase III trial. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate investigator-assessed progression free survival (IA-PFS) and overall survival (OS) in both the subset of patients defined to be PI3K GNE-positive and in the entire S1400B (PI3K Foundation Medicine [FMI] positive) study population treated with GDC-0032. (Phase II) II. To evaluate ORR in the entire S1400B (PI3K FMI positive) study population treated with GDC-0032 to evaluate the duration of response (DoR) both in GNE positive and FMI positive. (Phase II) III. To evaluate the DoR both in the entire S1400B PI3K FMI positive study population and in GNE positive patients treated with GDC-0032 who achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (confirmed and unconfirmed) by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. (Phase II) IV. To evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with GDC-0032. (Phase II) TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE OBJECTIVES: I. To identify additional predictive tumor/blood biomarkers that may modify response or define resistance to the GDC-0032 beyond the chosen biomarker for biomarker-driven sub-studies. II. To identify potential resistance biomarkers at disease progression. III. To establish a tissue/ blood repository from patients with refractory squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) of the lung. OUTLINE: As of 12/18/2015, patients are assigned to Arm I. ARM I: Patients receive taselisib orally (PO) daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL 12/18/2015): Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Upon progression, patients may be eligible to re-register to Arm III. ARM III: Patients in Arm II eligible for re-registration receive taselisib orally (PO) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, all patients are followed up every 6 months for the first 2 years and then at the end of the year 3 from date of sub-study/re-registration.</detailed_description>

patients may not have any impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may significantly alter the absorption of GDC0032 (e.g. ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel resection) Patients must not be taking, nor plan to take while on protocol treatment and for 14 days post the last dose of study treatment, drugs, herbal supplements or foods that are known to be strong/moderate cytochrome p450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) substrates Patients must also be offered participation in banking for future use of specimens STEP 2 TO GDC0032 REREGISTRATION: Patients must have progressed on arm 2 (docetaxel) of this substudy Patients must not have received any prior systemic therapy (systemic chemotherapy, immunotherapy or investigational drug) within 21 days prior to step 2 reregistration; patients must have recovered (&lt; grade 1) from any side effects of prior therapy Patients must have measurable disease documented by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); the CT from a combined PET/CT may be used to document only nonmeasurable disease unless it is of diagnostic quality; measurable disease must be assessed within 28 days prior to step 2 reregistration; pleural effusions, ascites and laboratory parameters are not acceptable as the only evidence of disease; nonmeasurable disease must be assessed within 42 days prior to step 2 reregistration; all disease must be assessed and documented on the baseline tumor assessment form; patients whose only measurable disease is within a previous radiation therapy port must demonstrate clearly progressive disease (in the opinion of the treating investigator) prior to registration Patients must have a CT or MRI scan of the brain to evaluate for central nervous system (CNS) disease within 42 days prior to step 2 reregistration;
