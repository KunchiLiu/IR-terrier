	<brief_title>Spanish Registry of Cryoballoon Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With this study the investigators propose the performance of a prospective registry of pulmonary vein cryoablation in subjects with paroxysmal or persistent AF at Spanish sites to estimate evaluate the efficacy of the cryoablation procedure at 12 months, defined as the absence of recurrences of atrial fibrillation. Secondary objectives are also defined as: - Description of the profile of subjects who undergo this type of procedure (demographic factors, cardiovascular risk factors, medication, physical activity, sleep apnea, alcohol, smoking, chronic pulmonary disease, obesity, etc.). - To evaluate the acute efficacy of the procedure: complete isolation of the pulmonary veins demonstrated by the successful electrical disconnection of the pulmonary veins in the cryoablation procedure. - Description of the complications related to the procedure. - To evaluate the use of healthcare resources which this cryoablation procedure entails.</detailed_description>
