	<brief_title>Acupuncture in the Regulation of Dai Meridian for Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome Patients With Abdominal Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity, especially abdominal obesity, is one of most common clinical features of polycystic ovary syndrome, a widely and seriously influenced complex disorder related to reproduction and metabolism. Excessive accumulation of adipose tissue in the abdominal organs often leads to insulin resistance, which will increase the harm of hyperandrogenism and exacerbate ovulation disorders and metabolic abnormalities. Weight loss, likely beneficial for both reproductive and metabolic dysfunction in this setting , has been generally recommended as a first-line therapy for obese women with PCOS and can be accomplished via lifestyle modification and electroacupuncture. What's more, stimulating acupoints of Dai Meridian can regulate menstrual cycles and treat infertility according to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine. However, how much benefits patients will additionally get from the Combined therapy is not clear now.</detailed_description>
