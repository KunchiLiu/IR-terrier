	<brief_summary>A phase III double-blind randomized clinical trial on the effects of ganoderma spore lipids to the immunological response in patients with G.I. Cancers. The trial is randomized, double-blind. Cancer patients are diagnosed based on pathology or cell biology. Patients are randomized into 2 groups: both groups receive chemotherapy. Either group receives ganoderma spore lipids or placebo capsules 600mg three times a day (TID) in addition to the chemotherapy. Clinical evaluation includes chemotherapy drug toxicities, life quality improvement. Blood biochemistry tests mainly include malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), adrenaline, nor-adrenaline, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, interleukin (IL)-1b, interleukin (IL)-6, cell flow cytometry on Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg cytokines, as well as serum cortisol, estradiol (female), progesterone (female), testosterone (male), etc.</brief_summary>
