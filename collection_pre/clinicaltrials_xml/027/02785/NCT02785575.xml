	<brief_title>Adjusted Calculation of Heparin and Protamin Dosing and Correlation With Postoperative Bleeding and Transfusions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), efficient anticoagulation is required in order to avoid microscopic clot formation or, in worst case, massive lift threatening thrombus formation. Heparin is by far the most common drug used to prevent blood from coagulating during CPB. Activated clotting time (ACT) is a point-of-care test of fibrin clotting time that has to be well prolonged to initiate safe CPB. Following weaning from CPB, heparin is reversed by protamine. Administration of excess doses of protamine may have a deleterious effect on coagulation and contribute to postoperative bleeding with need of blood transfusions. In connection with CPB management, heparin and protamin doses are commonly calculated using body weight and ACT. However, a new Heparin-Protamin-Calculation computer program (HeProCalc) has been developed to provide patient titrated dosing of both heparin and protamin. However, any benefits regarding postoperative bleeding and transfusions has not been thoroughly investigated.</detailed_description>
