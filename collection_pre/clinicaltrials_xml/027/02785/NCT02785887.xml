	<brief_title>Impact of Geriatrician Interventions on Chemotherapy Delivery in Vulnerable Elderly Oncology Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized parallel group trial is designed to evaluate the impact of implementing geriatrician-prescribed interventions, on the ability to deliver adequate chemotherapy treatment, as measured by RDI of at least 85%, in a cohort of vulnerable [≥1 deficit identified at CGA and/or ≥1 comorbidity Grade 3-4 as defined by Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G)] elderly cancer patients with early stage or advanced solid organ malignancies.
