	<brief_title>Statin With Palliative Therapy for HCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most liver cancer patients did not accept the cure as the main objective of the treatment after diagnosis because they choose alternative therapies palliative based, such as hepatic arterial chemoembolization, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Statin is a preventive medicine for hepatitis B and hepatitis C which decreases the risk turning into liver cancer, yet the clinical effect for Statin is still unknown. In a previous study of 20,220 liver cancer patients in health care database, the investigators discovered that patients taking Statin live longer than patients who didn't take Statin in the incidence of liver cancer death cases. This study is a continuation of previous health insurance database studies for clinical trials to verify whether Statin could prolong disease-free survival role for palliative treatment of liver cancer.</detailed_description>
