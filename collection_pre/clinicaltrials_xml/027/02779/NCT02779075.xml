	<brief_summary>The overall aim of the application is to determine the contribution of the elevated incretin hormone concentrations seen after certain types of bariatric surgery to the regulation of food intake and satiety.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exendin-9,39 and Satiety After Bariatric Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) increase GLP-1 concentrations, although this is of lesser magnitude in SG compared to RYGB. Data suggests that endogenous GLP-1 is at least partially responsible for reducing free-choice caloric intake after RYGB, providing a mechanism underlying differences between procedures. Inhibition of GLP-1 action with Exendin-9,39 after RYGB accelerates gastric emptying. These observations suggest that factors other than anatomy regulate the upper gastrointestinal response to food ingestion. It is therefore reasonable to consider that the postprandial rise in GLP-1 might affect feeding behavior after RYGB, and to a lesser extent SG, where the increase in GLP-1 is less marked.</detailed_description>
