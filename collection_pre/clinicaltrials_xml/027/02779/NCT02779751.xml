	<criteria>Have a Stage IV diagnosis of 1 of the following: Part A: NSCLC (Kirsten rat sarcoma mutant [KRAS mt], PDL1+); Part B: NSCLC (squamous histology); or Part C: metastatic breast cancer (HR+, HER2). Part A: must be chemotherapy naïve for metastatic NSCLC Part B: must have received at least 1 prior therapy containing platinumbased chemotherapy for advanced/metastatic NSCLC Part C: must have previously received prior treatment with at least 1 but no more than 2 chemotherapy regimens in the metastatic setting Are amenable to provide tumor tissue prior to treatment and provide tumor tissue after treatment initiation (both mandatory). Have presence of measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1). Have a performance status (PS) ≤1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale. Have discontinued all previous treatments for cancer and recovered from the acute effects of therapy. Have an estimated life expectancy of ≥12 weeks. Have a personal history of any of the following conditions: syncope of either unexplained or cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia (including but not limited to ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), or sudden cardiac arrest. Exception: subjects with controlled atrial fibrillation for &gt;30 days prior to study treatment are eligible. Have central nervous system (CNS) metastasis with development of associated neurological changes 14 days prior to receiving study drug. Have corrected QT interval of &gt;470 milliseconds on screening electrocardiogram (ECG). Have history of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis. Have history of or active autoimmune disease, or other syndrome that requires systemic steroids or autoimmune agents for the past 2 years. Have received a live vaccination within 30 days of study start. Have received prior treatment with an anti PD1, antiprogrammed death ligand 1 (PDL1), or anti cytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated protein 4 (CTLA4) agent.</criteria>
