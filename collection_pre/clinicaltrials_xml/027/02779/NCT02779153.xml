	<brief_summary>This is a randomized study exploring the efficacy, safety and steroid sparing ability of two doses (40 U and 80 U) of Acthar in SLE patients with immune mediated hematologic manifestations requiring steroid use for a minimum of 2 weeks prior to screening.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acthar SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acthar is currently labeled for use during an exacerbation or for maintenance therapy in selected SLE cases, however data from prospective trials on hematologic manifestations of SLE are not available. Due to the potential effect of lowering or eliminating autoantibodies, the absence of bone marrow suppression, and a steroid sparing effect, Acthar may represent a novel therapeutic option in recalcitrant cases of hematologic SLE.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Able to provide informed consent. Diagnosis of SLE according to the American College of Rheumatology revised criteria (fulfilled ≥ 4 criteria). Hematologic BILAG scores due to hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia of BILAG A (including hemolytic anemia with hemoglobin &lt; 8.0 g/dL or platelet count &lt; 25 x 109 l) or BILAG B (including hemolytic anemia with hemoglobin 8.0 9.9 g/dDL or platelet count 25 49 x 109 l) based on screening laboratory assessment. Currently taking prednisone ≥ 7.5 mg or equivalent for hematologic SLE for at least 2 weeks prior to screening. Use of antimalarials and NSAIDs (stable regimen within the 4 weeks prior to screening), as well as methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil (stable regimen within the 4 weeks prior to screening) are permitted but not required. If used, the regimen must remain stable through the study. An increase or addition of SLE medication at any time during the study is not permitted. Ability to comply with study procedures, which include SC injections of study medication, adhering to concomitant medication restrictions, and attending scheduled office visits. Patients with a recent history (&lt; 2 week prior to screening) of starting prednisone or equivalent. Patients with active nephritis, defined as serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL or protein/creatinine ratio (PCR) &gt; 1.5 g/g, or patients that required hemodialysis within 3 months prior to screening. Active central nervous system (CNS) lupus (including seizures, psychosis, organic brain syndrome, cerebrovascular accident, cerebritis, or CNS vasculitis), requiring therapeutic intervention within 3 months prior to screening. Type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus (history of gestational diabetes is not an exclusion), or patients currently taking hypoglycemic medication. Patients with a history of concomitant medication use as follows: a. Receipt of the following within 1 month prior to screening: i. Any steroid injection (IM, intraarticular, or IV) b. Receipt of any of the following within 3 months prior to screening: i. Cyclosporine ii. Any nonbiologic investigational drug c. Receipt of the following within 4 months prior to screening: i. IVIg ii. Plasmapheresis d. Receipt of cyclophosphamide within 6 months prior to screening e. Receipt of the following within 12 months prior to screening: i. B cell targeted therapy (rituximab or other antiCD20 agent, antiCD22 [epratuzumab], antiCD52 [alentuzumab], or belimumab) ii. Abatacept iii. Any biologic investigational agent Contraindication per Acthar Prescribing Information: scleroderma, osteoporosis, systemic fungal infections, ocular herpes simplex, recent surgery, history of or the presence of peptic ulcer, congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, primary adrenocortical insufficiency, or adrenal cortical hyperfunction. 1. For the purposes of this study, osteoporosis is defined as evidence of vertebral or long bone fracture, or lumbar spine Tscore &gt; 2.0 standard deviations below the mean of the reference population. 2. For the purposes of this study, history of peptic ulcer is defined as ≤ 6 months prior to screening. 3. For the purposes of this study, congestive heart failure is defined as New York Heart Association Functional Class IIIIV. 4. For the purposes of this study, uncontrolled hypertension is defined as a mean systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg on ≥ 3 seated readings taken at least 5 minutes apart during the screening period. Reproductive status: 1. Women who are pregnant, 2. Women who are breastfeeding, 3. Women of childbearing potential who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method of birth control to avoid pregnancy for the entire study period, as evaluated by the Investigator (women of nonchildbearing potential are those that have a history of hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or are postmenopausal with no history of menstrual flow for ≥ 12 months prior to screening). Immune System: Known immunocompromised status (not related to SLE or therapies for SLE), including individuals who have undergone organ transplantation or who are known to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus. Patients with acute or chronic hepatitis C, or active hepatitis B infection, positive interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) or signs or symptoms concerning for active tuberculosis (TB); or use of antibiotics (antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, or antiparasitic agent) within 4 weeks of randomization for treatment of an active infection. Presence of any other clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Investigator (by its nature or by being inadequately controlled), might put the patient at risk due to participation in the study, or may influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to complete the study. Any clinically significant laboratory abnormality, based on the Investigator's judgment. The following laboratory exclusions apply for all patients: 1. AST &gt; 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) 2. ALT &gt; 2.5 times ULN 3. Hemoglobin A1c &gt; 6.5%</criteria>
