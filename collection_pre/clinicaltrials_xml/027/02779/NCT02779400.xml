	<brief_title>Assessment of a Diagnostic Medical Device for the INR (International Normalized Ratio) Measurement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will assess the performance of an in vitro diagnostic device for assessing the INR. The evaluation will consist of make several INR measurements using the device and compare these measures to the reference value. The INR will be measured using the study device on capillary blood drops taken from the fingertip. In the same way a venous blood sampling will be carried out to measure a reference INR. A total of 20 healthy subjects and 180 patients treated with vitamin K agonist will be enrolled in the study.</detailed_description>
