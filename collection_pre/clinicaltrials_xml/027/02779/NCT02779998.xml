	<brief_summary>Acute respiratory failure is frequent during rhythmology procedure under light sedation in high risks selected patients. Non invasive ventilation (NIV) is recommended for acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema and sleep apnea. The investigators will perform a monocentric, prospective, randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of NIV which associated pressure support ventilation (PSV: 5 to 15 cmH2O) and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP: 5 to 10 cmH2O) with standard oxygen therapy in prevention of peroperative respiratory event. Our hypothesis is that peroperative use of NIV should reduce the incidence of apnea and hypoxia during procedure in rhythmology under light sedation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study is an investigator-initiated, monocentric, two-arm parallel-group trial with electronic system based randomization. The study protocol was approved by a Central Ethics Committee (France) according to French law. Our teaching hospital have a long experience with peroperative use of NIV during light sedation and acute respiratory failure. This study is designed as a PROBE study (Prospective Randomized Open with Blinded Evaluation) : the investigators will provide a blinded analysis of peroperative computer collected data.</detailed_description>
