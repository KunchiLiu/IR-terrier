	<brief_title>PIIR Study: Comparison of Genetic Tests for Age-Related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are currently two different genetic tests that have been developed for this purpose. They both look at specific DNA components to determine the risk. Participants in the study will be over the age of 60 years and caucasian as this is the population of people in which these tests have been validated. Each participant will have the study explained to them and then will be asked to sign the informed consent document if they agree to participate. They will have a dilated exam of their eyes along with photographs taken of the retina. If their doctor sees that it is necessary they will also have a special scan or a special angiogram of their eyes to look at their retina in more detail. For the genetic testing a member of the research team will use two swabs from each of the genetic companies to gently scrap some cells from the inside of the cheek. These cells will be sent to each respective lab for analysis.</detailed_description>
