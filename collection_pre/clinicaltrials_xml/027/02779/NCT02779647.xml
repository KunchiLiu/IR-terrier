	<brief_summary>Introduction Overweight and obesity are characterised by excess fat, which results in weight gain and is identified by the Body Mass Index (BMI). Studies show that overweight and obesity are the result of a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors, which begins prenatally. Various studies have shown that physical exercise is an important component of weight loss programmes and that it also benefits the metabolic profile. Other authors have reported that greater weight loss is achieved by a programme that includes both diet and exercise, rather than either of these alone. Aim The aim of this study is to analyse an intervention based on play as a means of improving the body composition of children with overweight or obesity. Design / Method The design of the Kids-Play study is based on cases and controls. The study was conducted in Granada (Spain) from October 2014 to June 2015. The analysis sample of 54 children was divided into two groups: cases, consisting of 27 children, who participated in an intervention programme based on physical activity, play and nutritional advice (to both the child and the parents); and controls, another 27 children, who received only nutritional advice.</brief_summary>
