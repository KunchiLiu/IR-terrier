	<brief_summary>SPI-1005 is a novel oral drug that contains a glutathione peroxidase mimetic (ebselen) that will be tested in subjects with a history of NIHL at risk for additional NIHL. The goal of this multi-center Phase 2b study is to determine whether SPI-1005 is effective in reducing an acute NIHL in this affected population. In this Phase 2b study subjects with prior NIHL will be enrolled and exposed to a calibrated sound challenge (CSC) that induces a slight acute NIHL.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2b Study of SPI-1005 to Reduce the Incidence, Severity, and Duration of Acute Noise Induced Hearing Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, safety and efficacy study of oral SPI-1005 in adults with Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). All recruited subjects will have their severity of NIHL determined before the start of SPI-1005 treatment using otoscopy, tympanometry and audiometry. Subjects with &gt;15 and &lt;/= 40 decibel (dB) NIHL will be enrolled and randomized to either placebo or SPI-1005. Patients will be dosed with either placebo or SPI-1005 for 7 days, beginning 1 day before an acute NIHL. Patients will have audiometry and Words In Noise Testing (WINT) before and immediately after a calibrated sound challenge (CSC). The CSC involves listening to 4 hours of pre-recorded music (100 dBA SPL) through insert earphones. The CSC induces a slight acute NIHL. Follow-up audiometry and WINT will be performed at 1 and 7 days post-CSC. A total of four clinic visits will be required over 10-14 days.</detailed_description>
