	<brief_summary>This two-stage study is designed to investigate the antitumor activity of tipifarnib in approximately 58 eligible subjects with very low, low or INT risk MDS who have no known curative treatment. Eligible subjects may have received no more than 2 prior systemic therapies. In the first stage, 44 eligible subjects will be enrolled and stratified in to one of four biomarker-defined strata (11 subjects per stratum) based on subject KIR2DS2 and KIR2DL2 positivity. Subjects will receive tipifarnib administered at a starting dose of 900 mg, orally with food, twice a day (bid) for 7 days in alternating weeks (Days 1-7 and 15-21) in 28 day cycles. At the discretion of the investigator, the dose of tipifarnib may be increased to 1200 mg bid if the subject has not experienced dose limiting toxicities at the 900 mg dose level. Determination of RBC tranfusion independence and disease response will be performed by the Investigator according to the MDS/MPN International Working Group (IWG) criteria. Similarly, disease progression will also be determined based on the MDS/MPN IWG criteria.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This phase 2 study will investigate the antitumor activity in terms of RBC transfusion independence (RBC TI) of tipifarnib in approximately 58 eligible subjects with very low, low or INT risk MDS who have no known curative treatment. Eligible subjects may have received no more than 2 prior systemic therapies. Prior systemic therapies are those that have been received at standard doses for at least one full treatment cycle. A two-stage study design will be employed in order to minimize the number of study subjects treated if tipifarnib were considered not sufficiently efficacious to grant further development in this subject population. In the first stage, 44 eligible subjects will be enrolled and stratified in to one of four biomarker-defined strata (11 subjects per stratum) based on subject KIR2DS2 and KIR2DL2 positivity. Subjects will receive tipifarnib administered at a starting dose of 900 mg, orally with food, twice a day (bid) for 7 days in alternating weeks (Days 1-7 and 15-21) in 28 day cycles. At the discretion of the investigator, the dose of tipifarnib may be increased to 1200 mg bid if the subject has not experienced dose limiting toxicities at the 900 mg dose level. Subjects who develop serious adverse events, ≥ grade 2 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) that are deemed related to tipifarnib and lasting ≥ 14 days will not undergo dose escalation. Stepwise 300 mg dose reductions to control treatment-related, treatment-emergent toxicities are also allowed. In the absence of unmanageable toxicities, subjects may continue to receive tipifarnib treatment until disease progression. If a complete response is observed, therapy with tipifarnib will be maintained for at least 6 months beyond the start of response. Hematologic assessments, including peripheral blood evaluations and review of transfusion requirements, will be performed at screening and at least monthly until disease progression. Disease assessments (bone marrow and quality of life evaluations) will also be performed at screening and at least once every approximately 12 weeks starting at the end of cycle 3. Additional hematologic or disease assessments may be conducted if deemed necessary by the Investigator. The timing of the hematologic and disease assessments should be maintained as much as possible independently of potential treatment cycle delays. Determination of RBC TI and disease response will be performed by the Investigator according to the MDS/MPN International Working Group (IWG) criteria. Similarly, disease progression will also be determined based on the MDS/MPN IWG criteria . Upon disease progression, all subjects in the study will be followed approximately every 12 weeks for survival and the use of subsequent therapy until either death or 12 months after accrual of the study has been completed, whichever occurs first. Information on survival and subsequent anticancer therapy may be collected by phone. Subjects who terminate treatment for reasons other than death or disease progression will be assessed at regular intervals for disease progression and leukemic transformation (monthly blood count and approximately every 12 weeks bone marrow aspirate and symptom assessment). These assessments will continue until disease progression, withdrawal of subject's consent to study procedures or initiation of another anticancer therapy</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject is at least 18 years of age. Documented pathological evidence of MDS as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria Must have transfusiondependent anemia that meets the following criteria: 1. Average transfusion requirement of ≥ 2 units per 28 days of packed RBCs confirmed for a minimum of 112 days immediately preceding Cycle 1 Day 1. 2. No consecutive 56 days that was RBC transfusionfree during the 112 days immediately preceding Cycle 1 Day 1. 3. Hemoglobin levels at the time of or within 7 days prior to transfusions must have been ≤ 9.0 g/dL for the transfusions to qualify as required for the purpose of providing evidence of transfusiondependent anemia. Must be unresponsive or refractory to erythropoiesisstimulating agents (ESA), based on one of the following: 1. Transfusiondependence in subjects previously treated with an ESA (requires a minimum ESA trial of &gt; 40,000 U/week recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) x 8 weeks or equivalent dose of darbepoetin or other erythropoietin agent), or 2.
