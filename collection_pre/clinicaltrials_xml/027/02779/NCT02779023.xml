	<brief_summary>This study investigates the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of adding Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) to the standard care received at the Integrative Cardiac Health Project (ICHP) on insomnia symptoms and severity. ICHP is an established cardiovascular disease prevention program to reduce cardiovascular disease risk through the adoption of lifestyle changes related to improvements in diet, stress, sleep, and exercise. The study will be conducted among patients with insomnia who are already enrolled in the ICHP cardiovascular risk prevention program. This is a single-center study, prospective, randomized, controlled, interventional trial within ICHP at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC). To conduct both phases of the study, up to 64 total male and female patients enrolled in ICHP who meet criteria for insomnia will be recruited. Participants who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria for this study, and consent to participate, will be randomized to one of two conditions: (1) ICHP, or (2) ICHP + CBT-I treatment. CBT-I treatment will consist of four in-person appointments and two telephone appointments.</brief_summary>
