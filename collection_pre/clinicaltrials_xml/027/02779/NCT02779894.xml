	<brief_title>Sleep Apnoea Management by a Communication Based Technology (ICT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) is a prevalent disease with significant morbidity resulting in long waiting lists and high health care costs. Therefore, alternative cost-effective approaches are urgently needed. A possible procedure is telemedicine based on ICT. The design of the study is prospective, randomized, controlled, open and parallel. A ICT-based out of hospital management of SAHS is implemented to be compared with the classical in-hospital management. The main objectives were the evaluation of both groups and the analysis of efficacy and cost effectiveness of two SAHS management programs. This is a 3 month randomized, with parallel groups study. Participants will be patients with suspicion of SAHS derived to the Investigators' Sleep Unit. Patients are randomized in two groups; 1) classical in-hospital group: polysomnography or home respiratory polygraphy (HRP), CPAP titration and treatment and hospital follow-up; and 2) ICT group: 3 consecutive HRPs, automatic CPAP treatment and control by phone/video conferences and data transmission by using a custom designed platform.</detailed_description>
