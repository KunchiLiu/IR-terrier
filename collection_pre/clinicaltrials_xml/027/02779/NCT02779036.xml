	<brief_title>Optimizing Walking Function of Stroke Survivors by a Task-Oriented Home Exercise Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The majority of stroke individuals unable to reenter their previous community life after they have had a stroke. Reintegration of community life by optimizing walking function is a major goal of stroke rehabilitation. Because not widely available inpatient rehabilitation, discharged with incomplete recovery, limited numbers of technically trained physical therapists, financial saving, and transportation difficulty, home-based stroke rehabilitation setting has been interested in many developing countries. Task- oriented exercise is well known and accepted approach to optimize walking function with underlying principles of motor control and motor learning theories. This approach has been used in the clinical setting with close supervision, but identification of appropriate protocol in the community environment is on progress. To date, no proper home exercise program based on task-oriental principle with minimal supervision for improving walking competency after stroke has been proposed in stroke rehabilitation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a structured, progressive, task- oriented home exercise program on walking competency in individual post stroke.</detailed_description>
