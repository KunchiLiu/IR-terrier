	<brief_summary>Randomized, double-blinded, cross-over and placebo controlled clinical trial to evaluate the association between genetic polymorphism of CYP4F2 with cardiovascular adverse effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Two groups were included according the CYP4F2 V433M genetic polymorphism (control - MM, N=7 vs. VV or VM variants, N=13). According the sample size planned, a mean difference of total body water delta between groups (control vs. polymorphic) of at least allow 10% could be observed.</brief_summary>
