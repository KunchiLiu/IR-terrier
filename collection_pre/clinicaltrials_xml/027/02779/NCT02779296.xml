	<brief_summary>Surgical Site Infections (SSI) represents a significant complication in plastic surgery. Infections can result in a prolonged recovery and impair long-term cosmetic appearance. One potential method to reduce infection is by applying a thin layer of dermal glue over the sutures at the site of incision immediately after the surgery. Conventional closures, such as sutures or staples, leave the site vulnerable until epithelialization occurs in 24 to 48 hours. In contrast, dermal glue provides an instant, waterproof barrier and it has been shown to have intrinsic bacteriostatic properties. The glue is supplied as a liquid enclosed in a vial and when applied, polymerizes rapidly in an exothermic reaction in the presence of moisture to form a solid adhesive. 2-Octylcyanoacrylate (2-OCA)-based glue is formulated to be more flexible than previous preparations. The application of dermal glue is rapid, simple and requires no specific follow-up as it naturally sloughs off overtime. The purpose of this study is to determine if 2-OCA-based glue can reduce the rate of surgical site infection following surgery. Patients undergoing breast surgery will be recruited and randomized to either a group receiving a layer of glue over sutures following surgery or no treatment. Patients will be followed up at 30 days and at 8 months for signs of infection, additional complications and the visual appearance of the scars. The cost of treating and infection will be calculated to determine if using dermal glue to prevent infection is economically feasible. This research has the potential to find a method to reduce surgical site infection, which can be applied to other surgeries.</brief_summary>
