	<brief_summary>There are no studies specifically examining the effects of coenzyme Q (CoQ) treatment on echocardiographic indices of diastolic function in elderly patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF). In previous studies the only echocardiographic parameters studied were ejection fraction (EF) and chamber size. The objective of the proposed current study is to examine the effect of 16 weeks of ubiquinol therapy on diastolic function assessed by echocardiography in patients over the age of 50 with a clinical diagnosis of HFPEF. Ubiquinol (Kaneka Pharma), the reduced form of CoQ will be utilized for this study as it has been shown to have superior bioavailability when compared to oxidized CoQ.</brief_summary>
