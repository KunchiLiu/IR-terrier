	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if an oncolytic virus called Talimogene laherparepvec (a modified herpes simplex 1 virus that can specifically destroy cancer cells while leaving normal cells alone) injected directly into the tumor during chemotherapy prior to surgery can enhance the elimination of triple negative breast cancer tumors. The natural herpes simplex 1 virus typically causes cold sores around the mouth, but the talimogene laherparepvec version of the herpes virus has been changed to prevent it from reproducing in normal tissue. However, it can still attack and break open cancer tissue which is why it is used as a treatment for cancer. It is thought that this virus can also help recruit the participant's immune system to attack the cancer cells during their treatment and possibly destroy the tumor tissue more effectively than chemotherapy alone. This virus is already FDA approved to treat melanoma skin tumors, so investigators want to determine if this virus can achieve a similar benefit in women with triple negative breast tumors.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Must have histologically or cytologically confirmed clinical stage T23 N02 triple negative (estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor &lt;1% human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) 01 by ImmunoHistoChemistry (IHC) or unamplified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)) invasive ductal carcinoma. Must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt;10 mm with spiral CT scan. As well, participants must have primary tumor able to be visualized on ultrasound and amenable to direct injection. No prior history of an invasive breast cancer Adults ages 1870 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 01 Must have normal organ and marrow function as outlined in protocol Sexually active women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document T4 tumors, known metastatic disease, recurrent disease, inflammatory breast cancer, multicentric disease, and/or synchronous bilateral breast cancer A second active malignancy, exceptions are localized nonmelanoma skin cancers or prior in situ carcinoma Receiving any other investigational agents or are unable to be treated with doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to talimogene laherparepvec or other agents used in the study Known active or prior herpes simplex virus infections (HSV), prior complications from HSV infections such as encephalitis, or require systemic antiviral therapy at the time of study enrollment Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, known active hepatitis B/C infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Women who are pregnant or nursing Immunocompromised patients may be at increased risk of herpetic infections when treated with talimogene laherparepvec. Therefore, HIVpositive patients, patients with acquired or congenital immunodeficiency conditions, those on chronic systemic immunosuppressants (requiring &gt; 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent/day), Those with active autoimmune disease are excluded from the study.</criteria>
