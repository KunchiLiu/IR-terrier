	<brief_title>Effect of BIA 3-202 on the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Warfarin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design and methodology: This was a single-centre, open-label, randomised, two-way crossover study in healthy young male and female volunteers. The study consisted of 2 treatment periods separated by a washout period of 14 days or more. In one period, subjects received nebicapone 200 mg thrice-daily (tid) for 9 days, and a warfarin 25 mg single-dose concomitantly with the morning dose of nebicapone on Day 4. In the other period, a warfarin 25 mg single-dose was administered alone. Warfarin pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles were characterised following warfarin dosing.</detailed_description>
