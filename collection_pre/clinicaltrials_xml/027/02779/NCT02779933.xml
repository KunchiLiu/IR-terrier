	<brief_summary>A retrospective, observational study compiled data from all consecutively admitted patients older than 18 years at ICU University Hospital in Olomouc in the period from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2015 who fulfilled the criteria of HAP. The aim was to determine the severity of the specific risk factors of early and late HAP. Risk factors were divided into factors from the patient and from the hospitalization. Furthermore, an assessment of their relationship to mortality.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary outcome was to evaluate the relationship between risk factors and the development of early/late onset HAP. Another outcome was assessed to evaluate the relation of risk factors early/late onset HAP and mortality. The crucial time for evaluating the presence of risk factors was their presence from hospital admission to the moment of fulfilling the criteria for pneumonia. Risk factors were divided into two groups, on factors of the patient (uncontrollable) and by the hospitalization (controllable). Factors of the patient were: gender (male/female), age at enrollment (years), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, multi-organ failure presence (MOF), hypertension, ischemic heart disease (IHD) chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), continual use of renal replacement therapy (CRRT), acute renal insufficiency (ARI), diabetes mellitus (DM), Chronical Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), immunosuppression or leukopenia &lt;1.5x109/l, impaired consciousness with Glasgow coma scale (GCS) &lt;8 tracheotomy, head trauma/neurosurgery, abdominal surgery-thoracotomy. Side factors hospitalization were: aspiration into the lungs, urgent intubation, reintubated, sedation, bronchoscopy, nasogastric intubation, enteral feeding continuously/intermittently intolerance of enteral nutrition, physiotherapy, repeated transport of the patient from the ICU, length of hospital stay, length of mechanical ventilation, 30-day mortality.</detailed_description>
