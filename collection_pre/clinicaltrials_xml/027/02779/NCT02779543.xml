	<brief_summary>This study seeks to validate three new commercial sleep monitoring devices: Fitbit, Jawbone UP, and Microsoft Band by comparison against concurrent polysomnography (PSG), which is considered the gold standard for sleep assessment. This research is being done because if proven to accurately analyze sleep,these devices may make conducting in-home sleep studies easier and more affordable in the future.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Validation of New Commercial Sleep Monitoring Devices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study seeks to validate three new commercial sleep monitoring devices: Fitbit, Jawbone UP, and Microsoft Band by comparison against concurrent polysomnography (PSG), considered the gold standard assessment for sleep physiology. The investigators emphasize here that the commercial sleep monitoring devices (Fitbit, Jawbone UP, and Microsoft Band) are used in addition to PSG and not in place of it. Subjects will be recruited from those patients attending a regularly scheduled overnight PSG sleep study at the Weill Cornell Medical College Center for Sleep Medicine. Willing subjects, after providing informed consent, will be fitted with one of the three aforementioned sleep monitoring devices (randomly assigned) on the wrist of their non-dominant hand when prepared for the sleep study by a technician. Subjects willing to wear more than one sleep monitoring device may be fitted with two different sleep monitoring devices, e.g., a Fitbit and a Jawbone UP or a Fitbit and a Microsoft Band. Sleep monitoring device(s) will be removed from the subject's wrist in the morning at the conclusion of the sleep study. Data will be transferred from the sleep monitoring device(s) for later statistical analysis and comparison with scored polysomnogram. Device(s) will be cleaned (using antiseptic wipes), reset,recharged, and otherwise prepared for reuse.</detailed_description>
