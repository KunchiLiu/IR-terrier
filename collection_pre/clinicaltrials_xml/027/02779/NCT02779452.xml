	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using a quantitative EEG method to evaluate neurodevelopment in newborns and to evaluate whether subtle neurodevelopmental deficits can be detected in newborns from mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) compared to control newborns. The second purpose of this study is to determine whether cord blood concentration in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid, is similar in neonates of well-controlled mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) compared to control mothers, and to evaluate whether this contributes to neonates neurodevelopment status.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Maternal weight is measured close to delivery and BMI is calculated. Birth weight, length, head circumference, Apgar score and glycaemia are recorded at birth. An EEG are performed on the newborn within 48 hrs after birth.A maternal blood sample is collected at admission to measure maternal glycated hemoglobin (A1C). Cord blood samples are collected in the umbilical vein after delivery.</detailed_description>
