	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to examine the effect of RIPC on physiological parameters in non-valvular paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Furthermore the study will provide a unique bio-date base for further analysis of molecular and genetic mechanisms responsible for observed results. The potential effect of RIPC on AF inducibility and/or prothrombotic activity might be implemented as additional treatment component to reduce AF burden and minimize thromboembolic risk. Interim Analysis will be done after 73 patients.</brief_summary>
