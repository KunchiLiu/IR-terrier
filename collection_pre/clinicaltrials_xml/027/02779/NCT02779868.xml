	<brief_summary>Cancer cachexia is a complex metabolic process affecting up to 80% of patients suffering from an advanced-stage cancer. Moreover, 20 to 40% of all cancer deaths are caused directly by cachexia. Recently, omega-3 fatty acids have gained interest for their beneficial effects in cancer cachexia. Moreover, nutritional supplementation enriched with omega-3 could potentially maintain body weight in cancer patients undergoing intensive treatment. The investigators aims in this study is to evaluate the effect of omega-3 supplementation on body composition, functional capacity, inflammatory profile and quality of life in cervix cancer patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy.</brief_summary>
