	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Evaluating the Efficacy of Ultra Low Dose of Decitabine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To develop a highly effective and safe protocol, a multi-center, prospective clinical trial was conducted in China, with aims to evaluate the grade III and IV hematologic toxicity and clinical efficacy of subcutaneous injection of ultra-low-dose decitabine (5 to 7 mg/m2) for treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), while decitabine at a dose of 20 mg/m2 as a control.</detailed_description>
