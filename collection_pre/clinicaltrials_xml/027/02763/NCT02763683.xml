	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to use a brain imaging method called Pittsburgh B (PIB) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Vesicular Cholinergic Transport (VAT) PET to determine dementia subtypes in patients with Parkinson's disease. The ultimate goal of this project is to be able to identify individuals with PD who are at risk of developing dementia, and to distinguish the underlying cause of dementia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to use a brain imaging method called PIB PET and VAT PET to determine dementia subtypes in patients with Parkinson's disease. The ultimate goal of this project is to be able to identify individuals with PD who are at risk of developing dementia, and to distinguish the underlying cause of dementia. The investigators will be including both PD and normal subjects in this study. This a long term study and we are considering including a total of 320 participants in this protocol.</detailed_description>
