	<brief_summary>This study aims to analyze effects of three types of cardiac rehabilitation protocol on fuctional capacity, inflammatory markers, pulmonary function and clinical outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients with left ventricular disfunction. Patients will be randomized and allocated in three groups according to type of exercise protocol: 1. walk; 2. cycle; 3. functional electrical stimulation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Several studies have been demonstrated beneficial effects of exercise to minimize impact of CABG. However, there is no consensus on what kind of exercise is safe and effective for patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Walking</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Coronary artery disease proven by coronary angiography; Elective CABG; No acute or chronic pulmonary disease; Patients after surgery, keep in spontaneous ventilation on first postoperative day; Absence of neurological, neuromuscular, musculoskeletal and osteoarticular incapacitating; Consent form signed for participation in the survey. Inability to perform spirometry; Presence of acute lung disease or chronic; Surgical indication of urgency; Morbid obesity; Hemodynamics instability at the time of spirometry or during six minutes walking test; Intraoperative death or until the sixth postoperative day; Patients remaining in mechanical prolonged ventilation for more than 12 hours; Severe cardiac arrhythmia during application of assessment protocols and exercises (ventricular tachycardia, atrioventricular block second or degree) any other condition the investigator's discretion put the patient at increased risk with beginning of the year; Any change that may lead to failure of proposed protocols.</criteria>
