	<brief_summary>The current study will assess the clinical Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) 20 response to Secukinumab and evaluate to which extent concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment can be reduced in patients treated with Secukinumab or placebo following an initial run-in phase of stable NSAID therapy. In case of a positive outcome concerning the NSAID reduction this study could trigger the development of a guidance concerning NSAID reduction applicable for all Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) patients starting a biologic treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Multicenter Study of Secukinumab (AIN457) to Examine the Clinical Efficacy and the Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug (NSAID)-Sparing Effect of Secukinumab Over 16 Weeks in Patients With Ankylosing Spondylitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study will assess the clinical Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) 20 response to Secukinumab and evaluate to which extent concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment can be reduced between Week 4 and Week 12 in patients treated with Secukinumab 150 mg or placebo following an initial run-in phase of 4 weeks on stable NSAID therapy. Two different time points of NSAID tapering initiation will be evaluated in this study: 1. a delayed tapering approach in which NSAID will be tapered following 4 weeks of Secukinumab treatment at stable NSAID therapy. 2. an early tapering approach in which NSAID will be tapered immediately after initiation of Secukinumab treatment. These two approaches will be evaluated compared to placebo in order to assess whether the early or delayed NSAID tapering is superior to placebo in terms of clinical ASAS20 response and extent of reduction in NSAID intake. As a patient-reported outcome, pain is a major patient-relevant efficacy parameter in clinical practice in Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS). This study will therefore monitor overall neck, back and hip pain on a continuous basis. It will be recommended that NSAID should be tapered if the patient reports an improvement in back pain or a level below a certain threshold. It is anticipated that the results of this study may provide guidance for the systematic adjustment of concomitant NSAID treatment in AS patients based on their initial response to Secukinumab, thereby leading to optimization of the therapeutic strategy with Secukinumab.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key Diagnosis of active AS with prior documented radiologic evidence fulfilling the Modified New York criteria for AS Active AS assessed by total BASDAI ≥ 4 (010) at baseline Spinal pain as measured by BASDAI Question 2 ≥ 4 cm on a 010 cm numeric rating scale at baseline Total back pain as measured by VAS ≥ 40 mm (0100 mm) at baseline Patients should have been on at least 2 different NSAIDs at the highest recommended dose for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization, with an inadequate response or failure to respond, or less if therapy had to be reduced due to intolerance, toxicity or contraindications Patients must report regular intake of NSAIDs of at least 50% of the highest recommended dose at Screening. Patients with prior TNFα inhibitor therapy must report regular intake of NSAIDs of at least 50% of the highest recommended dose at baseline after the appropriate washout Patients are required to be on a stable dose of NSAIDs for at least 2 weeks before randomization Patients who have previously been on a TNFα inhibitor will be allowed entry into study after an appropriate washout period prior to randomization Patients who have been on a TNFα inhibitor (not more than two) must have experienced an inadequate response to previous or current treatment given at an approved dose for at least 3 months prior to randomization or have been intolerant to at least one administration of an antiTNFα agent. Patients taking MTX or sulfasalazine are allowed to continue their medication and must have taken it for at least 3 months and be on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization Key Chest Xray or MRI with evidence of ongoing infectious or malignant process. Previous exposure to Secukinumab or any other biologic drug directly targeting IL17 or IL17 receptor Patients previously treated with any biological immunomodulating agents, except those targeting TNFα Patients who have taken more than two antiTNFα agents Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women. History of ongoing, chronic or recurrent infectious disease or evidence of tuberculosis infection. Patients who are intolerant to NSAIDs Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
