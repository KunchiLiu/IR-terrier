	<brief_summary>The objectives as stated in the study protocol were as follows: - To investigate the safety and tolerability of three multiple dose regimens of BIA 3-202 (50 mg twice a day, 100 mg twice a day and 200 mg twice a day in healthy young male volunteers). Part A - To characterise the steady state pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of BIA 3-202 in healthy young males. Part A - To investigate the safety and tolerability of a single multiple dose regimen (dose to be determined from Part A) of BIA 3-202, in healthy elderly volunteers. Part B - To characterise the steady state pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of a single multiple dose regimen (dose to be determined from Part A) of BIA 3- 202 in healthy elderly volunteers. Part B</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This was designed as a single centre, phase I, double-blind, randomised, placebocontrolled study of three multiple rising doses in three sequential groups of 8 young male healthy volunteers (Part A) and a single group of healthy elderly volunteers (Part B). In Part B, 12 healthy elderly volunteers were to be enrolled. Ten were to be randomly allocated to BIA 3-202 and two to placebo.</detailed_description>
