	<brief_title>An Extension Study of PEAK Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PEAK trial is now undergoing (Multicenter, randomized, double blind, three-arm parallel group study to evaluate efficacy and safety of Alogliptin and Pioglitazone combination therapy on glucose control in type 2 diabetes subjects who have inadequate control with Metformin monotherapy in Korea, Takeda No. ALO-IIT-012). Duration of combination treatment is 24 week in the PEAK trial. Long-term efficacy and safety of alogliptin + pioglitazone + metformin combination therapy is not defined in Korea yet. Thus, extension of the PEAK trial for the longer treatment upto 1 year has been planned. PEAK trial will be followed by another 28 week open-label treatment of the same drug as initial randomization (total duration of treatment as randomized 52 week), and followed by 2 year of observation. During observation period, any antidiabetic medication can be added/changed when HbA1c of the subject is off target 7% with clinician's clinical decision. After 3 years of initial randomization, durability of glucose control will be assessed between 3 treatment group.</detailed_description>
