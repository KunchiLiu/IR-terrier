	<brief_summary>These days many studies are conducted testing the symbiosis between the bacteria population to the human body's functioning. The research of the connection between the skin condition and the bacteria population is in its early stages. There is a characterization of different bacteria for different body areas depending on their composition, humidity etc. In addition, there are preliminary findings of biological receptors that react to the contact with bacteria on the surface of the skin and turn on the immune system, awakening it to cope with the new invader. Based on the above information, the investigators hypothesis is that there is a connection between the degrees of sun exposure of individuals to the growing of beneficial bacteria populations on the surface of the skin. The study will compare between the bacteria population on the skin of Israeli subjects, divided to two groups, one with an excessive exposure to the sun on a daily basis, (such as agricultural workers, lifeguards, construction, etc.), and the other of the office worker who spend most of the day in a closed shaded room.</brief_summary>
