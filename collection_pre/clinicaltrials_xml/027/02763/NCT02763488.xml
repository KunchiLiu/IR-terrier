	<brief_title>Blood Flow Restriction Training Following Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be enrolled preoperatively in order to measure preoperative functional measures. They will then be followed at predetermined intervals post-operatively. All subjects will begin the study related physical therapy 6 weeks post-operatively and continue for 12 sessions. At the conclusion of 12 sessions, subjects will be retested to determine improvement. Subjects will then be followed for two years post-operative.</detailed_description>
