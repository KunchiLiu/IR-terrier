	<brief_title>Pseudophakic Astigmatic Reduction With Verion-LenSx Arcuate Incisions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of corneal arcuate incisions when they are performed with a femtosecond laser system on subjects who have had previous cataract surgery. The procedure to be used would not be different from that employed during cataract surgery, except that the only corneal incisions made would be the partial-depth arcuate incisions at the laser.</detailed_description>
