	<brief_summary>There is a lack of data analyzing the influence of Cardio-vascular Diseases (CVD) risk factor control on graft survival disparities in Black transplant recipients. Studies in the general population indicate that CVD risk factor control is poor in Black patients, leading to higher rates of renal failure and CV events. However, with the exception of hypertension, there is paucity in data demonstrating similar results within transplant recipients. Recent analyses conducted within our transplant program, indicate that CVD risk factors, especially diabetes, are poorly controlled in Black recipients, which likely impacts graft loss. Since these data were collected in a retrospective manner, larger analyses are needed to validate these exploratory findings. This pilot study is to: 1. Determine if the study is feasible, as measured by the proportions of enrolled to approached and completed to enrolled. 2. Measure and compare, at baseline versus the end of the intervention, the medication safety events, including the number of medication errors, medication non-adherence and medication side effects, in patients enrolled in the study 3. Measure and compare, at baseline versus the end of the intervention, CVD risk factor control, including hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia, in patients enrolled in the study 4. Measure and compare, at baseline versus the end of the intervention, patient reported survey results, in patients enrolled in the study 5. Determine if the impact of the intervention is more pronounced in Black recipients, as compared to non-Black recipients</brief_summary>
