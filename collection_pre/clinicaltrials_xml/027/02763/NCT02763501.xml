	<brief_title>Comparing a Randomised Controlled Intervention With Observational Data.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomised controlled trials (RCT) are "golden standard" for assessing interventions in medical science. Due to ethical or practical reasons, RCTs may however not always be feasible. The study objective was to test if the results from the RCT differ from observational data in a setting with a complex surgical intervention. Using the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry database we intend to compare patients operated with laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery within a register based RCT from May 1st 2010 until Nov 14th 2011, with all patients operated with the same procedure registered in the database during the same period of time. Primary end-point measures are severe complications within 30 days (safety outcome) and surgery for small bowel obstruction (efficacy outcome) within 4 years.</detailed_description>
