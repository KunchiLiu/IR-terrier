	<detailed_description>Gastric cancer is still one of the most common malignant tumors, and gastric antrum cancer is still common. Radical surgery is the only way to treat gastric antrum cancer, surgical procedures and reconstruction are closely related with the prognosis and quality of life, the choice is crucial. Gastrojejunostomy after distal gastrectomy may affect the quality of radical surgery, and postoperative diet, nutritional status and quality of life. More and more centers tend to choose Billroth II anastomosis, but patients prone to have a variety of complications, including reflux gastritis and bile reflux, malnutrition, seriously affecting the quality of life and so on. According to preliminary pilot study found that, uncut Roux-en-Y anastomosis way can keep the continuity of nerve-muscle function of the reconstruction of digestive tract, and closes the input in order to reduce the incidence of reflux, for improving the nutritional status and reducing complications and improve quality of life. Therefore, the investigators intend to conduct multi-center randomized controlled study to find if Uncut Roux-en-Y anastomosis to the distal gastric cancer patients after radical D2 can reduce the long-term complications, affect the quality of life, and improve the prognosis.</detailed_description>
