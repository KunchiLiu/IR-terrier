Cohort B HL, brentuximab vedotin (BV) treatment failure or unable to tolerate BV. Cohort C PTLD, rituximab treatment failure. 2. Presence of active lymphoma or active PTLD, based on imaging performed within the previous 3 months. 3. Tumor positive for EBV encoded RNA (EBER) based on report from certified laboratory. 4.
