	<brief_summary>This randomized, Phase I/III, multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab (anti-programmed death ligand 1 [anti-PD-L1]) in combination with carboplatin plus (+) etoposide compared with treatment with placebo + carboplatin + etoposide in treatment-naive participants with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either atezolizumab + carboplatin + etoposide or placebo + carboplatin + etoposide on 21 day-cycles for 4 cycles in the induction phase followed by maintenance with atezolizumab or placebo until disease progression (PD) as assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Treatment can be continued until persistent radiographic PD or symptomatic deterioration.</brief_summary>
