	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the effect of body suspension and tilting exercises (performed in Chordata apparatus) on the balance and mobility of subjects with Parkinson disease. Half of patients will perform the exercise protocol while the other half will receive passive muscle stretching and maintain the usual routine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Body Suspension and Tilting Exercises in Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Body suspension and tilting exercises performed in the Chordata equipment might be an effective option to improve trunk muscles activation and to facilitate functional balance and mobility control in Parkinson's disease (PD). To evaluate this hypothesis, subjects will be randomized into control group or intervention group. Intervention group will receive 30-minute session of body suspension and tilting exercises on the Chordata equipment (PI: 0804871-1 and BR 10 2012 009901-2) twice a week for eight weeks, while the control group will receive passive muscle stretching and maintained their usual routine during the same period. Both groups will be assessed at baseline and immediately after the intervention protocol. Finally, a follow-up evaluation will be performed 8 weeks after the protocol ending (to verify possible long-lasting effects of this exercise protocol).</detailed_description>
