	<brief_summary>The vaginal microbiota is an important biological barrier for host against pathogens or opportunistic pathogens. Undermining the balance of the vagina is closely related to infectious diseases and tumors. The vaginal microbiota of child-bearing women of age is dominated by Lactobacillus species, including major four species: Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus iners, followed by obligate anaerobes such as Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Mobiluncus curtisii, and Prevotella . Currently, There are almost 99% bacteria can not to be found with bacterial culture. Based on microscopy and conventional culture method to obtain vaginal microflora information have a variety of deviation. For this reason, The in-depth study of complex vaginal flora and the correct understanding of disease faces a serious obstacle. With the development of High-throughput sequencing technologyï¼Œ metagenomics can get all the composition and distribution of microorganisms from the sample which traditional knowledge may not be with microorganism culture method. Therefore, Re-evaluation of existing microflora diagnostic criteria for clinical diagnosis of the disease is necessary. In this study, the investigators use high-throughput sequencing technology to detect women of childbearing age vaginal microflora of metagenomic distribution. Including bacteria, fungi, viruses, protozoa, and other microorganisms. Based on the study results of metagenomic, the investigators want to re-cognition the"normal flora"of women of childbearing age ,and develop vaginal microflora microscopic evaluation of the integrity of the reference standard.</brief_summary>
