	<brief_title>Comparative Evaluation of Clinical Outcome of Degenerative Disc Disease Treated With the GelStix GelStix Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD) is one of the most common spinal pathologies, affecting up to 10-15 % of adults. The degeneration is associated with diminished water-binding capabilities of the nucleus pulpous leading to disc dehydration, volume reduction, changes in cellular activity, biomechanical changes and painful symptoms. Patients are initially treated with non-surgical pain-management techniques, such as anti-inflammatory medications and physical therapy, but these therapies often provide only temporary relief. When non-surgical intervention fails, fusion or total disc arthroplasty are often prescribed, both of which are highly invasive surgeries with significant associated morbidity. Clearly, a meaningful solution for the treatment gap existing between conservative care and invasive surgical intervention is needed. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with the GelStix™ device in a patient population that had no benefit from conservative care. The primary objective of this study is to quantify the reduction in lumbar pain in a GelStix™ treatment group compared with a control group receiving a saline solution injection as placebo. The secondary objectives are to assess: 1. the impact of treatment with GelStix™ on disability compared with the control group 2. the impact of treatment with GelStix™ on health related quality of life compared with the control group 3. the impact of treatment with GelStix™ on reliance on medication to relieve the pain compared with the control group 4. the acute and long-term safety of the GelStix™ device and implant system The total expected number of patients to be randomized is 72. Taking into account a relevant difference of 1.5 between groups on the NRS, with an SD of 2, 30 patients per group (60 patients in total) will be required to detect a statistically significant difference with a power of 80% at an alpha of 5% (two-tailed) for unpaired Student's T test. Taking into account a 20% drop out rate, 72 patients are expected to be randomized for this study. The estimated duration for the investigational plan (from start of screening of first participant to end of follow-up of last participant) is 24 months.</detailed_description>
