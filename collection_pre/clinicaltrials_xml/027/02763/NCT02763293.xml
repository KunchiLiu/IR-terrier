The participants were allocated independently of their disease status (outbreak or remission). An experimental study carried out during a period of four weeks in order to explore the effect of the specific treatment on the following outcomes: global quality of life, quality of life in CD and pain. The participants, in the EG were treated in three sessions, that lasted 45 minutes, during the study duration (1 session each 9-10 days).
