	<brief_summary>Gastric stromal tumor is a gastrointestinal mesenchymal tumor with malignant differentiation potential, the incidence increased year by year. The surgical resection is the primary treatment for it. Although laparoscopic GIST resection has many benefits，due to in lack of the delicate sense of touch, it could lead to the incomplete resection and disorders of digestion. More than 33% of postoperative patients have the gastric dysfunction. Laparoscopic endoscopy combined surgery is different from the past technology. It is a new radical resection of GIST presented by Japanese scholars. LECS resects the tumor completely by laparoscopy with the help of the precise positioning and guidance of endoscopy .This method conforms to the idea of the modern minimally invasive surgery, and avoids many problems，such as incomplete resection and disorders of digestion caused by excessive tissue resection. our team will spearhead the GIST treatment of LECS. First of all, the investigators will collect 120 cases of GIST patients, randomly assigned for the laparoscopic group, the LECS, single-arch the LECS surgical treatment. Secondly, to analyzing the basic treatment and follow-up data, including the operation time, blood loss, the number of transfer laparotomy, the number of cut edge positive, the distances of cut edge away from the tumor edge, the cases of anastomotic fistula bleeding, stenosis, average such confinement, the meal time, cost of treatment, tumor recurrence rate, the presence of residual stomach, upset stomach and frequency, reflux esophagitis, bile reflux gastritis and other indicators.The purpose of this subject is to observe the effectivity and safety of LECS and single-arch the LECS, invent serval LECS equipment patents and provide some references for LECS applying to the minimally invasive surgery of the digestive tract tumor and multidisciplinary treatment mode .</brief_summary>
