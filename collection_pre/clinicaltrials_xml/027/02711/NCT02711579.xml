	<brief_summary>the purposes of this study are to evaluate the acute electrophysiological response in brain cortex to single oral dose of celecoxib (400mg once) in healthy volunteer and the electrophysiological alteration in brain cortex by long-term treatment of celecoxib (200mg twice-daily for 7 days) in healthy volunteer</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inflammatory response is considered as defense mechanism against physical or infectious insults and also prevails within the central nervous system. Following certain kinds of brain injuries (i.e trauma, ischemia, hypoxia and seizure), innate immunity and subsequent adaptive immunity subserve the robust inflammatory cascades, leading to excitatory synaptic networks. Cellular elements, such as neuron, microglia as well as inflammatory molecules (cyclooxygenase2, interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, etc) play essential roles in enhancing this process. In line with these, compelling evidences in animal studies in epilepsy field indicate that celecoxib (COX-2 inhibitor) has anticonvulsant actions, although its mechanisms are not fully understood. Thus, oral administration of Celecoxib in human has a high potential to suppress the neuronal excitability. As a milestone for the big picture, current study is going to prove the changes of cortical excitability evoked by transmagnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalographic properties revealed by EEG in healthy volunteer, given that power spectral analysis of EEG and several parameters of TMS , can detect the small changes of neuronal activities by celecoxib.</detailed_description>
