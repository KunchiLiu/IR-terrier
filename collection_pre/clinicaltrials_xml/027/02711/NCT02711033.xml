	<brief_title>Laparoscopic-assisted Total Gastrectomy Versus Open Total Gastrectomy With Splenic Hilum Lymph Nodes Dissection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For advanced proximal gastric cancer, total gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy is the standard surgical therapy. Apparently, lymph nodes (LNs) dissection along the splenic artery (No.11) and the splenic hilum (No.10) is recommended by the Japanese Gastric Cancer Treatment Guidelines. Nevertheless, complete removal of the No. 10 and No. 11d LNs is technically challenging due to the tortuous splenic vessels and the high possibility of injury to the parenchyma of the spleen and pancreas. Recently, the application of minimally invasive surgery for advanced gastric cancer is gaining popularity. However, laparoscopic-assisted total gastrectomy (LATG) with standard D2 lymphadenectomy was still not widely performed, because pancreas- and spleen-preserving splenic hilum lymph node dissection were mainly challenging manipulations for laparoscopic surgeons. Herein, we aim to investigate the safety and feasibility of LATG with spleen-preserving splenic hilum lymph node dissection for proximal advanced gastric cancer and compares the early results of this procedure with open total gastrectomy (OTG).</detailed_description>
