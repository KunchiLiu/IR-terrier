	<criteria>Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Have a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of nonresectable, recurrent, or metastatic biliary tract adenocarcinoma (intrahepatic or extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder cancer, or Ampulla of Vater) . Have measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Have adequate biliary drainage. Have adequate organ function. Males and females are sterile, postmenopausal, or compliant with a highly effective contraceptive method. Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to first dose. Are willing to provide blood/serum/plasma and tumor tissue samples for research purposes. Submission of blood/serum/plasma and tumor tissue samples is mandatory for participation in this study, unless restricted per local regulations. Previous systemic therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease is not allowed. Have a history of or have current hepatic encephalopathy of any grade, or ascites of Grade &gt;1, or cirrhosis with ChildPugh Stage B or higher. Have ongoing or recent (≤6 months) hepatorenal syndrome. Have had a major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury including nonhealing wound, peptic ulcer, or bone fracture ≤28 days prior to randomization. Anticipate having a major surgical procedure during the course of the study. Has documented brain metastases, leptomeningeal disease, or uncontrolled spinal cord compression. Within 6 months prior to randomization, have had any arterial thrombotic event, including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, cerebrovascular accident, or transient ischemic attack. Have an uncontrolled arterial hypertension with systolic blood pressure ≥150 or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) despite standard medical management. Have a previous malignancy within 5 years of study entry or a concurrent malignancy. Have a history of gastrointestinal perforation and/or fistulae within 6 months prior to randomization. Have a known allergy or hypersensitivity reaction to any of the treatment components. Have a history of uncontrolled hereditary or acquired thrombotic disorder. Have uncontrolled metabolic disorders or other nonmalignant organ or systemic diseases or secondary effects of cancer that induce a high medical risk and/or make assessment of survival uncertain. Have mixed hepatocellular biliary tract cancer histology. Have a corrected QT interval &gt;470 milliseconds as calculated be the Fredericia equation.</criteria>
