	<detailed_description>Chronic prostatitis is a common disease in men with the following typical symptoms decreasing the ability to work and quality of life: pain, urination disorders, copulatory dysfunction. Professional societies recommend diagnosing and treating patients with chronic prostatitis on the basis of determination of belonging to classification categories proposed by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the National Institutes of Health in the USA . According to the recommendations of European Association of Urologists, in chronic bacterial inflammation of the prostate and in nonbacterial (inflammatory syndrome of chronic pelvis pain), the performance of antibacterial therapy during four - six weeks is efficient. The first-line drugs are fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) as along with good tolerance they easily penetrate into the zones of the prostate inflammation and are highly efficient in respect of prostatitis pathogens . Although the treatment with levofloxacin promotes more evident decrease in clinical symptoms and demonstrates better parameters of eradication of pathogen in comparison with ciprofloxacin administration, it is used less common, possibly due to insufficient awareness of physicians of its high efficacy in chronic prostatitis .</detailed_description>
