	<brief_title>Comparison of Post-operative Complications of Bone Augmentation at Anterior of Maxilla After Periosteal Releasing Incision With Two Techniques Diode Laser and Scalpel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Guided bone regeneration (GBR) is a well established method to augment excessive alveolar bone loss before and at the time of implant placement. Primary closure of soft tissue is a prerequisite for successful bone augmentation procedures. Adequate flap advancement is a key factor for tension free primary wound closure. The tension free flap is usually attained by incising the buccal flap using scalpels. However, this procedure, especially in cases with major flap advancement, results in increased patient morbidity after surgery. Swelling and hemorrhage during the first week after surgery have a negative effect on patient's quality of life. Currently, lasers are widely used as a tool for soft tissue management and diode laser appears to be an effective tool for incision and excision of the soft tissue. The major advantageous property of lasers is ablation of tissue together with effective hemostasis, minimal swelling and virtually no pain.</detailed_description>
