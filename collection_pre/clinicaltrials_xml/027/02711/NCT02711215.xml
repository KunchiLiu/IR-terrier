	<brief_summary>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) raise serotonin (5-HT) in the synaptic cleft and are the current first line of pharmacological antidepressive treatment. Yet, there is a missing link between this first molecular step in their mechanism of action and observed clinical improvement. We have determined to establish a framework combining genuine molecular and functional imaging, i.e. hybrid pharmaco-PET/MR imaging, of the human serotonergic system in order to predict antidepressant treatment response. Objectives: 1. To predict antidepressant treatment response from data obtained using hybrid PET/MR with acute pharmacological challenge. 2. To discriminate healthy from depressed subjects using this paradigm. 3. To establish models connecting regional changes in occupancy of serotonin transporters (5-HTT) following citalopram infusion, with changes in brain activation and connectivity of major resting-state hub networks. Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over mono-center study. Materials and methods: 40 major depressed (MDD) and 40 healthy subjects will undergo 2 PET/MR scans on a 3T SIEMENS mMR Biograph scanner: 1. challenge with citalopram 8mg 2. placebo (saline). After structural imaging, functional MRI will be continuously acquired. [11C]DASB will be applied using a bolus + constant infusion paradigm to probe 5-HTT binding potentials and monitor 5-HTT occupancy with drug challenge, applied after 70min, in a single session. Scanning will be terminated 80min after challenge. MDD patients will receive subsequent escitalopram treatment with repeated evaluation of response for 3 months.</brief_summary>
