	<brief_title>Femoral Artery Crossover Rates of 1000 Consecutive Radial (or Ulnar) Artery Procedures in the Cardiac Cath Lab for Diagnostic Cardiac Catheterizations and/or Percutaneous Coronary Interventions.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A retrospective review of 1000 consecutive Radial or Ulnar Cardiac Catheterizations and/or Percutaneous Coronary Interventions performed in our Institute by one single operator could provide us with the cross over rates to femoral interventions. In this manner these rates could be compared to the published rates of other institutions benchmarking our techniques with the outcomes for such interventions.</detailed_description>
