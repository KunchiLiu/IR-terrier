	<brief_summary>This study is conducted to investigate whether the efficacy of single-dose triple therapy (Esomeprazole 40 mg, Tinidazole 1 g, and Levofluxacine 500 mg) for 14 days is superior to double-dose lansoprazole 30 mg, amoxicillin 1 g and clarithromycin 500 mg for 14 days in the treatment of H pylori infection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Daily Single Dose Triple and Conventional Triple Therapies for Helicobacter Pylori Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple regimens have been evaluated for H. pylori therapy in randomized controlled trials The treatment regimen that is selected must be effective, but considerations such as cost, side effects, and ease of administration should also be taken into account. Despite the number of studies, the optimal therapeutic regimen has not yet been defined. The regimen most commonly recommended for first line treatment of H. pylori is triple therapy with a PPI, amoxicillin and clarithromycin for 14 days. However, the multi-drug application is associated with remarkable side effects and it is not uncommon not to be able to complete a treatment course. Thus, treatment failure is associated with H. pylori strains that are resistant to the commonly used antibiotics. This study is conducted to investigate whether the efficacy of single-dose triple therapy (Esomeprazole 40 mg, Tinidazole 1 g, and Levofluxacine 500 mg) for 14 days is superior to double-dose lansoprazole 30 mg, amoxicillin 1 g and clarithromycin 500 mg for 14 days in the treatment of H pylori infection.</detailed_description>
