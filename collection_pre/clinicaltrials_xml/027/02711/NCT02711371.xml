	<brief_summary>The aim of this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study is to find out whether and how social and emotional brain function are altered in dependent cannabis users relative to healthy non-using control subjects after a 28 supervised abstinence period. Previous research in cannabis users has predominantly focused on cognitive functions. Moreover, studies have implicated that observed deficits in cannabis users may regenerate after a prolonged abstinence period. Findings might provide important information with respect to relapse vulnerability.</brief_summary>
