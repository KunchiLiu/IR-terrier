	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, dose-escalation/dose-expansion study of INCB057643 in subjects with advanced malignancies. Part 1 will determine the maximum tolerated dose of INCB057643 and/or a tolerated dose that demonstrates sufficient pharmacologic activity. Part 2 will further evaluate the safety, preliminary efficacy, PK, and PD of the dose(s) selected in Part 1 in select tumor types.</brief_summary>
