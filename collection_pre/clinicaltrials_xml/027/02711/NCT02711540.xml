	<brief_summary>Retrospective analysis of all patients receiving TAVI in the United Kingdom (UK). Stroke rates following TAVI are roughly 3%. There are several device and procedure related characteristics which may increase the risk of stroke. We will examine if there is a signal in the UK registry. This will be important is TAVI is to be extended down to lower risk patient cohorts.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Retrospective analysis of all patients receiving TAVI in the UK. Stroke rates following TAVI are roughly 3%. There are several device and procedure related characteristics which may increase the risk of stroke. We will examine if there is a signal in the UK registry. This will be important is TAVI is to be extended down to lower risk patient cohorts. Factors to be examined include (but not limited to): need for Pre-procedure Balloon aortic Valvuloplasty (BAV) Need for two valves need for post-dilatation need for rapid ventricular burst pacing</detailed_description>
