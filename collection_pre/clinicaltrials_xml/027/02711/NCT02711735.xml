	<brief_summary>Prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled clinical phase IIa trial to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of RUTI® vaccine in Multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients favourably responding to standard MDR-TB treatment. Time point of vaccination starts at 16 weeks upon start of standard MDR-TB treatment (cohort A), and if clinically safe as evaluated by an independent panel of experts (DSMB), another cohort of patients will be vaccinated at 12 weeks upon start of standard MDR-TB treatment (cohort B). All the patients will be followed up 8 weeks after vaccination.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>females and males aged ≥ 18 females of nonchildbearing potential: at least 2 years postmenopausal or surgically sterile (e.g. tubal ligation) females of childbearing potential (including females less than 2 years postmenopausal) must have a negative pregnancy test at enrollment and must agree to use highly effective methods of birth control (i.e. diaphragm plus spermicide or male condom plus spermicide, oral contraceptive in combination with a second method, contraceptive implant, injectable contraceptive, indwelling intrauterine device, sexual abstinence, or a vasectomized partner) while participating in the study and for 30 days after end of the study for each group. males must agree to use a double barrier method of contraception (condom plus spermicide or diaphragm plus spermicide) while participating in the study and for 30 days after end of the study for the respective group; or the male patient or his female partner must be surgically sterile (e.g. vasectomy, tubal ligation) or the female partner must be post menopausal The patient must provide written informed consent The patient must be willing and able to attend all study visits and comply with all study procedures, MDRTB patients with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (or Mycobacterium africanum) by culture, at least also present in sputum; Diagnosed with active MDRTB, and therefore managed with second line TB drugs; Having successfully completed 16 or 12 weeks (depending on the cohort) of MDRTB treatment, fully supervised, and with beneficial initial response to therapy, evidenced by clinical response criteria: in patients initially presenting with three classical symptoms (weight loss, chronic cough, fever or night sweats), clinical improvement should be recorded in at least two of three symptoms at least 4 weeks apart; in patients with only two of these symptoms present initially, patients should show improvement in at least one symptom, at least 4 weeks apart; and in addition, patients should not develop clinical deterioration i.e., ongoing weight loss, or increased cough, or newonset fever or night sweats. In addition, the attending physician should ascertain an overall clinical beneficial response to treatment. Transient deterioration of chest radiographic abnormalities might be explained by a paradoxical inflammatory response, and this may therefore not necessarily be interpreted as treatment failure; such decision depends on consensus with the Data Safety Monitoring Board; evidence of improvement on chest xray. Microbiological response criteria: as evidenced by improvement in at least 2 measurements at least 4 weeks apart, using Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube (liquid culture microbiological assay read at 10 days) Inability to provide written informed consent Women reported, or detected, or willing to be pregnant during the trial period; Severity of illness precluding full evaluation: expected early death, evidenced by respiratory failure, low blood pressure, WHO performance score 34; Central Nervous System involvement of TB (TB meningitis, intracranial tuberculomas) as there is too little evidence for effective drug penetration for secondline TB drugs; Major comorbid conditions precluding full evaluation, i.e., active lung cancer, acute coronary syndrome, heart failure exceeding New York Heart Association class 2; a diagnosis of metastasized malignancy; renal failure in excess of creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mls/min calculated by the CockcroftGault formula, which would severely complicate administration of aminoglycosides and capreomycin, considered as the major secondline TB drugs; obesity (Body Mass Index &gt;30 kg/m2); chronic liver disease ChildPugh class C; Any of the following laboratory parameters: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) total bilirubin &gt; 2 x ULN Neutrophil count ≤ 500 neutrophils / mm3 Platelet count &lt; 50,000 cells / mm3 Receiving or anticipated to receive a daily dose of ≥ 10 mg of systemic prednisone or equivalent within the period starting 14 days prior to enrolment. Note: patients are allowed to receive an acute, short course of methylprednisolone or prednisone or equivalent for management of an acute exacerbation of COPD or reactive airway disease in asthmatics Cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the previous 3 months HIV coinfection, if CD4 count &lt; 350 copies/mL; those with &gt;350 copies/mL are expected to be able to mount a sufficient cellular immune response and will therefore be eligible Blood transfusion in the last three weeks prior to the trial Documented allergy to TB vaccines, notably, to the RUTI® vaccine.</criteria>
