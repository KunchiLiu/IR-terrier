Following the last subject Day 28 visit from the first two single dose cohorts (Cohorts 1 and 2), all available data inclusive of Day 28 will be evaluated for PK, immunogenicity, safety and tolerability. FDA review and agreement to move forward will take place before the remaining single dose cohorts and the multiple dose phase (Cohorts 3 to 11) can be initiated. A total of up to approximately 82 subjects are anticipated to be enrolled in the study. The duration of dosing in the multiple dose cohorts would be 4 weeks and the regimen may include weekly (total of 5 doses), every 2 weeks (total of 3 doses) or monthly dosing (total of two doses).</brief_summary>
