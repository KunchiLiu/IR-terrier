	<brief_summary>Background: Clopidogrel, an antiplatelet prodrug, is widely used for prevention of the recurrent cardiovascular events. CYP2C19 is one of the crucial enzymes for the activation of clopidogrel. Recent studies, mostly done in cardiovascular patients, showed association of the CYP2C19 genotypes with recurrent cardiovascular events. However, prospective data on the impact of the genetic variants in stroke patients are limited. Methods: Five hundred and eighteen Japanese non-acute stroke patients treated with clopidogrel were registered at 14 institutions. Three CYP2C19 variants (CYP2C19*2, *3, *17) were genotyped and the patients were classified into three clopidogrel metabolizer groups inferred from the CYP2C19 genotypes: extensive (EM: *1/*1), intermediate (IM: *1/*2 or *1/*3), and poor (PM: *2/*2, *2/*3, or *3/*3). The CYP2C19*17 carriers were excluded from the analysis. The antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel were assessed by Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) -induced platelet aggregation and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation, expressed as VASP index. The endpoint was the composite incidence of stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, revascularization, other thromboembolic disease, or cardiovascular death during 2 years of follow-up.</brief_summary>
