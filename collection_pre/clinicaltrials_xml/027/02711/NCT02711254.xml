	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate improvement in pain and function following implantation of a new device, called the Phantom Knee System, in patients needing unloading of the medial compartment of the knee</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phantom Knee System Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm, first in human (FIH) study. Patients will be asked to participate in the study and follow up for a 6 month (Polish sites) or 24 month (South African site) period following implantation of the study device.</detailed_description>

Has continued target knee pain despite 6 months of conservative treatment prior to surgery 5. Has pain in the target knee as demonstrated by a minimum score of 40 (scale 0100) on the KOOS pain domain questions 6. Knee flexion ≥90⁰ to ≤140⁰ 7. BMI 2435 kg/m² 8. Weight ≤ 110 kg 9. Willing and able to give and have given voluntary written informed consent to participate in this clinical investigation 10. Prepared to consent to the transfer of his/her information to third parties 11. Willing to undertake the required investigational procedures and willing to return for the required followup evaluations 1. Active infection, sepsis, osteomyelitis or history of septic arthritis in any joint. 2. Rheumatoid arthritis or other forms of inflammatory joint disease. 3. Significant OA in the lateral compartment of the study knee, defined as KellgrenLawrence grade of &gt; 2 as assessed by the investigator using Xray. 4. Significant OA in the patellofemoral compartment of the study knee, defined as KellgrenLawrence grade &gt; 3 as assessed by the investigator using Xray. 5. Contralateral knee has radiographic evidence of OA (KL grade&gt;2) AND clinical findings of OA symptoms that interfere with activities of daily living or require the use of an assist device 6. Previous joint modifying surgery in the target knee within 12 months prior to planned surgery date such as ligament reconstruction or meniscus repair, cartilage transplantation, and microfracture a) Arthroscopic surgeries for joint lavage, meniscectomy, chondral debridement, and loose body removal are excluded if within 3 months prior to planned surgery date 7. Previous lateral meniscectomy &gt;30% of the target knee 8. Previous patellar surgery in the target knee 9. Previous osteotomy or failed knee joint replacement in the target knee 10. Tibialfemoral valgus alignment &gt;0⁰ as measured using mechanical axis on a long standing AP view xray 11. Tibialfemoral varus alignment &gt;7⁰ as measured using mechanical axis on a long standing AP view Xray 12. Hyperextension &gt;5⁰ 13. Flexion deformity greater than 10⁰ 14. Ligamentous laxity, or meniscal instability as assessed by the investigator 15. Cruciate ligament instability with Lachman test, grade 2 or higher 16. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus 17. Current smoker or stopped &lt;1 year prior to enrollment 18. Known or suspected diagnosis of Osteoporosis 19. Paget's Disease of the bone 20. Other metabolic disorders that may impair bone formation (must specify in records) 21. Concomitant immunosuppressive therapy 22. Known or suspected diagnosis of Osteomalacia 23. Known or suspected diagnosis of Osteonecrosis 24. Infections which may spread to the implant site from distant foci 25. Rapid joint destruction, marked bone loss or bone resorption apparent on xray 26. Vascular insufficiency, muscular atrophy, neuromuscular disease 27. Any significant medical condition (e.g., cancer, HIV, chronic pain management for conditions such as neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia, significant psychiatric or neurological disorders, active alcohol/drug abuse, etc) or other factor (e.g. planned relocation, uncooperative patient) that the Investigator feels would interfere with study participation/completion 28. Pregnancy or lactation or planning to become pregnant 29. History of litigation for workers benefits for musculoskeletal injuries 30. Currently enrolled in another clinical investigation that may influence the followup or may confound the outcome of this study 31. Prisoners</criteria>
