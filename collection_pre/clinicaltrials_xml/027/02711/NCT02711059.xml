	<brief_summary>The aims of this study is to analyse if insulin resistance in primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is normalised after parathyroid adenomectomy and if glucose tolerance test may be useful as a diagnostic tool by predicting potential improvement of insulin sensitivity after biochemical cure of pHPT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Insulin Resistance in Primary Hyperparathyroidism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To be conducted at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm. Patients with fb-glucos &gt;6.1 and HbA1c without medical treatment will be included after informed consent and randomised to parathyroidectomy (PTX) within three months or not. The groups will be examined 4 ±4 weeks before and 12±2 weeks after PTX, similar for the control group. The number of participants will be estimated by power calculations based on a pilot study including 20 patients. The test protocol includes glucose load with control of glucose and insulin, (0, 30, 60 and 120 min) together with measurement of markers of oxidative stress and inflammation.</detailed_description>
