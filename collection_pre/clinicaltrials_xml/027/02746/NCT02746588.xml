	<brief_summary>To be diagnosed with recurrent miscarriages, a couple might have a child, however experiences three or more miscarriages, primarily this happens during the first trimester. These miscarriages often needs medical evacuation or a D &amp; C. Surgery or retained tissue increases the risk of complications as infection and/or adhesions, known as asherman syndrome, which may result in subfertility. Recently chronic infection in the endometrium has been proposed to contribute to the condition, as protocols including treatment with antibiotics have led to birth at term for some of these women. Using the very minimal invasive office hysteroscopy, the investigators aim to describe the uterine cavity in patients diagnosed with recurrent miscarriages regarding both abnormalities in the endometrium and chromic infection.</brief_summary>
