	<brief_summary>The study is designed to examine whether curriculum, designed in partnership with teachers at Moreland Elementary school in West St. Paul and Mayo Clinic InSciEd Out scientists, is able to influence the behavior and health literacy of students. This information will be collected in surveys before and after the students are given the curriculum during the school day.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The research will implement a short battery of two survey inventories to measure student outcomes under InSciEd Out Fitness and Nutrition curriculum that is currently administered in 3rd and 4th grade at Lincoln K-8 Choice School. One is a grade-level adapted version of the National Youth Physical Activity and Nutrition Survey (NYPANS) authored by the United States Center for Disease Control (CDC). The other is a grade-level adapted version of the Newest Vital Sign (NVS) health literacy assessment authored by Pfizer and adapted by Dr. Linda Aldoory at the University of Maryland. These assessments will help inform the health promotion activities of the InSciEd Out partnership within Lincoln K-8 Choice in Rochester, Minnesota (MN) and Moreland Elementary in West St. Paul, MN who originally wrote the curriculum. These assessments will be key to curricular revision and expansion to other schools that partner with InSciEd Out. As such, this study is a single cohort, internally controlled pre-post assessment of an existing behavioral intervention. Pending pilot study success, future follow-up studies are projected to be parallel-group, nonrandomized clinical trials of a treatment school versus a control school with grade levels expansion. This study will inform activities within the InSciEd Out network inside Rochester Public Schools (RPS), where grades Kindergarten through 2nd and 5th through 8th curricula is currently being built. Previously RPS-approved Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board (IRB) #13-003263 describes the format of InSciEd Out programming in detail, but the general framework of this study operates upon an established partnership between InSciEd Out researchers and Lincoln K-8 Choice/Moreland Elementary administrators, teachers, students, and parents.
