	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to show that the systematic use of a prognostic score as early as possible after the initiation of dialysis in patients over 70 years of age and with a good prognosis at 3 years of dialysis results in an increase in the number of entries on a kidney transplant waiting list at 12 months after the initiation of dialysis. This prospective assessment is carried out as part of a historico-prospective before-after study in parallel with a survey of changes in national practices over the same time period via a here-elsewhere type study. Historical data (i.e the. "before" period) will include incident dialysis cases during the calendar years 2013, 2014 and 2015 before the start of the prospective phase (i.e. "after" period, which is represented by the current declaration); since a preliminary study demonstrated that the data are comparable from 2011 to 2013, we will use the average of data thus obtained. Historical data will be retrieved from the REIN (The French Renal Epidemiology and Information Network) registry data and will be validated by investigators at each center.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives are: A. To show that the systematic use of the score at the initiation of dialysis can shorten the registration delay on a kidney transplant waiting list; to evaluate the time between initiation of dialysis and registration on a national waiting list for kidney transplants, while assessing the duration of the pre-transplant assessment. B. To identify barriers to registration on the kidney transplant waiting list as well as the related time delay in this population (medical and non-medical factors), the rates and causes of patient refusal for registration and the possible evolution this refusal over time. C. To evaluate the economic impact of the introduction of the renal transplant clinical prognostic score.</detailed_description>
