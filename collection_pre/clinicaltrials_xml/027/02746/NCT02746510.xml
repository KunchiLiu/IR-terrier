	<brief_summary>Background: Nowadays, despite a large number of studies about schizophrenia and genetics, clinical red flags for syndromic forms of schizophrenia remain poorly documented.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation of a Clinical Screening Grid for Syndromic Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods: This study aims to validate a short clinical screening grid for syndromic forms of schizophrenia linked to a pathogenic Copy Variation Number (CNV). The investigators plan to include 150 patients with defined (DSM V) schizophrenia and aged 15 years and more. The clinical grid will be prospectively fulfilled for every patients on the basis of his/her medical history and clinical examination. Array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH-a) will be performed on jugal mucosae sample to detect precisely syndromic forms of schizophrenia linked to the presence of a pathogenic Copy Number Variation (CNV). Outcomes: The presence or the absence of each clinical criteria from the grid will be correlated to or presence of a pathogenic CNV detected by the CGH-a. Conclusions: the investigators hope that this study will help to enhance the clinical red flags suggesting a syndromic schizophrenia linked to a pathogenic CNV.</detailed_description>
