	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to validate a set of signatures, based on a panel of proteomic markers, that discriminate BDI, BDII, and MDD in people seeking treatment for a depressive episode.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bipolar Proteomic Assay Validation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a hypothesis-driven confirmatory study to validate the diagnostic signature (model) for distinguishing BDI from MDD that also aims to optimize the models to discriminate BDII from MDD and BDI. A binary classification model, using linear discriminant analysis and based on 13 a priori-defined proteomic markers will aim to distinguish BDI from MDD. An alternative binary classification model based on multiple logistic regression and using 10 a priori -defined proteomic markers will aim for the same result. To improve the predictive performance of the signatures, items from self-report mood rating scales and treatment-emergent changes in proteomic markers will be analyzed. In addition, the study will examine if baseline or early treatment-emergent changes in proteomic markers predict treatment response.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosed with BDI, BDII, or MDD, confirmed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM5 (SCID). Currently depressed for ≥4 weeks and ≤104 weeks, without psychotic features, MADRS score ≥ 20 (consistent with at least moderatelysevere depression) YMRS score ≤ 8 (consistent with the absence of hypomanic symptoms) At high risk for suicide, defined as a score ≥4 on item 10 of the MADRS Current depression has psychotic features, diagnosed with the SCID Meeting criteria for substance use disorders, as defined by DSM5, in the past 3 months, except for caffeine or nicotine. (Limited substance use, not meeting criteria for substance use disorders, is not exclusionary). A positive drug screen at both the screening and baseline visits will also be exclusionary. Diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, diagnosed with the Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder. Medical conditions with neurological sequelae (eg. stroke, brain cancer, multiple sclerosis, loss of consciousness &gt; 30 min, HIV) Severe chronic pain requiring treatment with opiate analgesics Receiving treatment with highpotency immunemodulating medications, such as corticosteroids, chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies, or diseasemodifying agents for arthritis, multiple sclerosis Any acute unstable medical illness (at the discretion of the site investigator) In MDD patients: strong risk factors for bipolarity, including 1) short (13 day) mood elevations not meeting DSM5 time criteria for hypomania; 2) a family history of BDI or BDII in a firstdegree relative; and 3) a history of antidepressantinduced symptoms suggestive of bipolarity, particularly antidepressantinduced hypo/mania.</criteria>
