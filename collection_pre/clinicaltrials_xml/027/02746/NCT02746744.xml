	<brief_title>RItuximab Versus FUmarate in Newly Diagnosed Multiple Sclerosis.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective randomised phase 3 study comparing a novel treatment protocol of Rituximab with a present first line disease modifying drug regarding both clinical, radiological and biochemical parameters. This will be measured via clinical investigations, MRI and Cerebrospinal fluid analyses. Each patient will have one treating physician responsible for all ongoing medical questions and decisions regarding continuation in the study and one examining physician performing the blinded Expanded Disability Status Scale examination and assessments of exacerbations. The coordinating nurse will administer the study-related tests and administer the rituximab infusions. In order to keep the examining physician blinded the patients receiving disease modifying drug will receive infusions with sodium chloride solution at the same interval as the rituximab arm is receiving. In both instances an opaque cover bag will shield the content of the infusion solution. In this case the examining physician will not be able to identify rituximab patients in case of accidental meetings on the neurology unit. Randomisation will be performed via a randomisation module in the national Swedish MS registry. The patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio and receive their treatments in accordance with clinical practice. Thus, the study will mimic the real-life situation in which the treatments will be administered which involves both positive and negative consequences. As positive consequence the result of the study will have a high degree of validity in relation to expected outcome in clinical practice. As negative consequence there may be psychological effects of knowing which medication one is receiving. Since both drugs probably are perceived as positive treatment options in MS today it is unlikely that there will be a predominant placebo effect of either of the treatment options.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of Relapsing Remitting MS according to the revised McDonald criteria OR one demyelinating episode in conjunction with at least two asymptomatic high intensity T2 lesions with size and location compatible with MS Untreated OR treated with firstline injectables (interferon or glatiramer acetate) Between the age of 18 and 40 years (inclusive) of age No more than five years of disease duration During the previous year, clinical or radiological disease activity defined as at least one of the following: ≥ 1 relapse ≥ 2 T2 lesions ≥ 1 Gd+ lesions Expanded Disability Status Scale: 0 5,5 (inclusive) In fertile females, willing to comply with effective contraceptive methods. These include birth control pills, surgical sterilization of patient or partner or intrauterine device. Nonfertile women is defined as more than 12 months of amenorrhea without an alternative medical cause or, in case of ambiguities, an follicle stimulation hormone level in the postmenopausal range. Diagnosis of Progressive MS Pregnant or lactating women: human chorionic gonadotropin (sHCG) will be tested on all women at screening, before each studyrelated infusion and in any situation where there is a reason to suspect pregnancy during the trial, eg delayed menstrual period more than five days above expected time. Patients having contraindication for or otherwise not compliant with MRI investigations Simultaneous treatment with other immunosuppressive drugs Active, severe infections Signs of infections are assessed before inclusion and each studyrelated infusion through clinical examination and further evaluated by laboratory and other relevant investigations in case of suspected ongoing infection. Hepatitis serology (HBsAg and antiHBc) will be evaluated before treatment onset. Severe cardiac disorder, eg signs of congestive heart failure or coronary artery disease. This will be evaluated through clinical assessment before inclusion. Vaccination within 4 weeks of first dose of study medication. Documented allergy or intolerance to any of the investigational products. Severe psychiatric condition</criteria>
