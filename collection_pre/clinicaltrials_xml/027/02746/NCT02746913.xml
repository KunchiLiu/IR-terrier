	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare two methods for assessing patients with pelvic organ prolapse for occult stress urinary incontinence. Urodynamic testing is the most widely accepted and well-studied method for diagnosing occult stress urinary incontinence preoperatively, but an ambulatory pessary trial is a less expensive option that is available to a wider group of practitioners and evaluates patient while they are engaged in their daily activities.</brief_summary>
