Body Mass Index (BMI): 18.530 kg/m2 inclusive. 4. Vital signs: systolic blood pressure 100139 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure 5089 mmHg, heart rate 5090 bpm, measured after 5 min at rest (sitting position). 5. Full comprehension: ability to comprehend the full nature and purpose of the study, including possible risks and side effects; ability to cooperate with the Investigator and to comply with the requirements of the entire study. 6. Sexual abstinence: agreement to sexual abstinence during the study. 7. Contraception and fertility: women of childbearing potential, even if sexually abstinent during the study as required by the study inclusion criteria, must be using at least one reliable method of contraception, as follows: 1. hormonal oral, implantable, transdermal, or injectable contraceptives for at least 2 months before the screening visit; 2. a nonhormonal intrauterine device [IUD] for at least 2 months before the screening visit; 3. a male sexual partner who agrees to use a male condom; 4. a vasectomised sexual partner. Female participants of nonchildbearing potential will be admitted. For all female subjects, pregnancy test result must be negative at screening and on day 1. 8. PAP test: negative PAP test result (i.e. normal PAP test result without atypical cells) at screening. 1. ECG (12leads, supine position): clinically significant abnormalities. 2. Physical findings: clinically significant abnormal physical findings which could interfere with the objectives of the study as judged by the Investigator. 3. Laboratory analyses: clinically significant abnormal laboratory values indicative of physical illness. 4. Allergies: ascertained or presumptive hypersensitivity (including allergies) to the active ingredients (econazole nitrate and/or benzydamine HCl) and/or formulations' excipients or related drugs, e.g. other azoles; history of anaphylaxis to drugs or allergic reactions in general, which the Investigator considers may affect the outcome of the study. 5. Diseases: relevant history of renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, cardiovascular, respiratory, skin, haematological, endocrine or neurological diseases that may interfere with the aim of the study or affect the subject's safety. 6. Genitourinary diseases: presence of any specific genitourinary symptoms detected at visit 2 with the relevant questionnaire (genitourinary symptoms questionnaire). 7. Infection history: history of bacterial urinary tract or bacterial or fungal vaginal infections for 3 weeks before the screening visit. 8. Systemic and/or local infections: bacterial or fungal infections that may interfere with the aim of the study or affect the subject's safety. If the results of the microbiological analyses concerning Ureaplasma/Mycoplasma and Actinomyces are positive, the subject can be enrolled only if asymptomatic and without any clinical evidence (gynaecological visit, PAP test and vaginal pH measurement) of vaginal infections. 9. Gynaecological findings: clinically significant abnormal findings at the gynaecological visit performed by the study Gynaecologist. 10. Mucosa conditions: altered mucosa conditions affecting the site of insertion (e.g. open lesions or other). 11. Habits: use of vaginal detergents, soaps and washes that, in the Investigator's opinion, may have an influence on vaginal pH and/or change the vaginal flora. 12. Medications: any medication (topical or systemic), including over the counter, herbal medication, topical drugs on the application area, and anticoagulants, such as warfarin, acenocoumarol and rivaroxaban, for 2 weeks before the start of the study. Hormonal contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapies are allowed. Paracetamol will be allowed as a countermeasure for adverse events, on a case by case basis, if deemed appropriate by the Investigator. 13. Investigative drug studies: participation in the evaluation of any drug for 3 months before this study, calculated from the first day of the month following the last visit of a previous study and the first day of the present study (date of the informed consent signature). 14. Blood donation: blood donations for 3 months before this study. 15. Drug, alcohol, caffeine, tobacco: history of drug, alcohol (&gt; 1 drink/day, defined according to USDA Dietary Guidelines 2010), tobacco (â‰¥ 10 cigarettes/day) or caffeine (&gt; 5 cups coffee/tea/day) abuse. 16.

Noncompliance: subjects suspected to have a high potential for noncompliance to the study procedures according to the Investigator's judgement, including noncompliance to sexual abstinence during the study. 19. Drug test (cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, cannabinoids, opiates and ecstasy): positive result at the drug test at screening. 20.
