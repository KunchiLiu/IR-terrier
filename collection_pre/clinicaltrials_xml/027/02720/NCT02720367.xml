	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if GemRIS, an investigational drug-delivery system is safe and tolerable in patients with recurrent low or intermediate risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) between diagnosis and transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBT)</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A documented history of histologicallyconfirmed low or intermediate risk urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, excluding carcinoma in situ (pTis), pathologic stage pT1 (invasive into lamina propria) and highGrade disease, judged not to be muscle infiltrating (pT2 or greater) and accessible for resection. Adequate laboratory parameters. Screening urinalysis showing no clinically significant abnormalities except those attributable to bladder cancer. Not undergoing active treatment in last 3 months for prior or concurrent neoplastic disease and have fully recovered from treatment effects. Patients undergoing concurrent hormonal therapy treatment for prostate cancer will be allowed to enroll. Exposure to BCG therapy and/or any other intravesical. chemotherapeutic agent less than 1 year prior to enrollment, except single postoperative instillations. Absence of visible tumor at Screening. Any previous exposure to intravesical gemcitabine instillations within the past 12 months. Presence of any bladder or urethral anatomical feature that in the opinion of the investigator may prevent the safe placement, indwelling use or removal of GemRIS (i.e. bladder diverticula, complete incontinence). Patients with a highGrade urine cytology at recurrence. Currently receiving other systemic or intravesical chemotherapy. Pelvic radiotherapy administered within 6 months prior to enrollment. Patients who received radiotherapy â‰¥ 6 months prior to enrollment must demonstrate no cystoscopic evidence or clinical symptoms of radiation cystitis. Bladder PostVoid Residual Volume (PVR) of &gt; 250mL. Active, uncontrolled urogenital bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, including urinary tract infection. Patients must not have a UTI within one month prior to the GemRIS Insertion Visit, Study Day 0. Skin/nail fungal infections are not exclusionary. Patients with active shingles (varicella zoster infection) will be excluded from the study. History or presence of any significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, gynecological, endocrine, immunological, dermatological, neurological or psychiatric disease or disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicates participation. Concomitant immunosuppressive medications, such as methotrexate or TNF inhibitors, within 2 weeks of Study Day 0. Female subject who is pregnant (as verified by urine test at time of screening) or lactating, or of childbearing potential and not using acceptable methods of contraception. Unwilling or unable to provide informed consent or comply with the requirements of this protocol, including the presence of any condition (physical, mental or social) that is likely to affect the subject's return for scheduled visits and followup. Other unspecified reasons that, in the opinion of the investigator or TARIS, make the patient unsuitable for enrollment.</criteria>
