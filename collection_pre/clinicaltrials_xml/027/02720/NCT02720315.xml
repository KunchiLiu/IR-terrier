	<brief_summary>Acute musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries, including strains, sprains or contusions, are a common reason patients seek emergency care. Pain control is an essential component of treatment. Within the orthopedic literature, there is robust body of research supporting the use of cryotherapy for post-operative patients and injured athletes. However, within the emergency department (ED), studies have been focused on pharmacologic analgesia. The absence of evidence on optimal method or impact of ice therapy for acute MSK injuries contributes to inconsistent practice patterns that may impede symptom control or increase narcotic usage. The specific aim of the ICED investigation is to evaluate the effectiveness of intensive cryotherapy for the treatment of pain due to acute MSK injuries treated in the ED. Secondary outcomes include length-of-stay (LOS), patient satisfaction, and narcotic usage.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Acute musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries, including strains, sprains or contusions, are a common reason patients seek emergency care. Pain control is an essential component of treatment. Within the orthopedic literature, there is robust body of research supporting the use of cryotherapy for post-operative patients and injured athletes. However, within the emergency department (ED), studies have been focused on pharmacologic analgesia. The absence of evidence on optimal method or impact of ice therapy for acute MSK injuries contributes to inconsistent practice patterns that may impede symptom control or increase narcotic usage. Objectives The specific aim of the ICED investigation is to evaluate the effectiveness of intensive cryotherapy for the treatment of pain due to acute MSK injuries treated in the ED. Secondary outcomes include length-of-stay (LOS), patient satisfaction, and narcotic usage. Methods Adults younger than sixty-six years-old presenting to the ED with acute MSK pain are enrolled through a process of informed consent, unless one or more of the exclusion criteria are met. Crushed ice is double-bagged and applied at the site of injury, where it is wrapped in place for twenty minutes. Pain scores are measured using a visual analog scale (VAS) when the ice is applied, at 20 minutes, at 60 minutes, and at 48 hours +/- 12 hours via a follow-up text message, at which time patient satisfaction is measured using two applicable questions from the Press-Ganey survey: pain control; likelihood to recommend. Treating physicians do not alter their management. Data on LOS and use of pharmacologic analgesics are obtained through chart review. Results Change in VAS will be analyzed with regression analysis and analysis of variance. Patients are grouped into categories of pharmacologic analgesic usage. Patient satisfaction scores and narcotic usage will be analyzed using a Chi Square test, while LOS data compared with an unpaired two-tailed t-test.</detailed_description>
