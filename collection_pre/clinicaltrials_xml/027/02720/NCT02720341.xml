	<brief_title>VIT-ARMin Virtual, Intensified and Patient-tailored Robotic Arm Therapy With the Exoskeleton Robot ARMin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neurological patients (e.g., after stroke) need long-term neurorehabilitative therapy of the arm with often limited, unsatisfactory outcome. Robots became a promising supplement or even alternative for neurorehabilitative training. Investigators aim at developing a unique intensified and patient-tailored robot-aided training strategy of the arm. The exoskeleton robot ARMin will be further developed to adapt software components accordingly. The goal is to enhance treatment efficacy to an extent that the improvement in motor function is meaningful for the individual patient. It can be intensified by different strategies that will be evaluated alone and in combination. These strategies include: strength training an error-amplification strategy increased number of repetitions multisensory feedback multiplayer approach</detailed_description>
