	<brief_summary>Patients with recurrent or metastatic sarcoma will be consented to develop a patient derived xenograft (PDX or TumorGraft) model of their tumor to perform drug sensitivity testing. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the accuracy of the patient derived xenograft (PDX) model in predicting patient clinical response to the same drug treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>15 years of age or older Patients with metastatic sarcoma who have had no more than one prior systemic treatment for metastatic disease Patients with recurrent sarcoma at relapse Patients with confirmed histological diagnosis of sarcoma or suspected diagnosis of sarcoma. Some specific subtypes of sarcoma are NOT eligible (Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST), carcinosarcoma, sarcomatoid mesothelioma, and metastatic phyllodes tumor) If initial suspected diagnosis of sarcoma, must have sarcoma diagnosis confirmed prior to proceeding with PDX drug sensitivity testing Must have measureable disease for computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation following biopsy or surgery to obtain tissue for PDX development. No plan for concurrent chemoradiation, for target lesions that will be used for drug treatment correlation with PDX Fresh tumor tissue available for PDX development Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 01 Life expectancy exceeds 6 months Plan to receive systemic therapy Informed consent</criteria>
