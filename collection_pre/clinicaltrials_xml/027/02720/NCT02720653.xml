	<brief_summary>Olfactory dysfunction is a cardinal symptom of chronic rhinosinusitis, a disease which affects 12.5% of the adult population across all racial and ethnic groups. Previous research has documented olfactory deficit in 68% of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and 20% with complete anosmia, suggesting that olfactory dysfunction affects over 25 million individuals in the United States with chronic rhinosinusitis. This proposed investigation will be used to predict olfactory outcomes following treatments for chronic rhinosinusitis and gain insights into mechanisms of olfactory dysfunction in this population.</brief_summary>
