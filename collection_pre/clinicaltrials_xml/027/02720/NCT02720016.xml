	<brief_summary>Untreated posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a costly condition associated with impairment in functioning across a host of psychosocial domains including occupational and academic functioning, marital and family functioning, parenting, and socialization. Impairment is not limited to Veterans with PTSD because the entire family is affected, particularly the Veteran's intimate partner. PTSD symptoms can produce negative effects on both members of the dyad. Despite the need for treatment, many Veterans and their families do not access PTSD-related services due to a number of barriers to accessing care (e.g., living in rural or remote areas where no specialty services exist, concerns about stigma around using mental health services, limited clinic hours to accommodate patient schedules). The objective of this study is to assess whether providing Cognitive-Behavioral Conjoint Therapy, in which PTSD symptoms and intimate relationship functioning are addressed, to Veterans and their romantic partners in their homes via clinical video teleconferencing leads to better outcomes compared to office based treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Anticipated Impact on Veterans' Healthcare: This project addresses the mental health and functioning needs of Veterans and their families by increasing the access to an established treatment using telemental health technology. Project Background: Veterans and their families experience the deleterious effects of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and associated negative sequelae. PTSD is related to a variety of comorbid mental health symptomatology and psychosocial impairment, including high rates of intimate relationship problems which impact Veterans' recovery and functioning. Despite available couple-based interventions, barriers to care such as stigma regarding mental health treatment, travel time to receive care, and transportation costs, make it difficult for Veterans and their families to access specialty PTSD treatments necessary for rehabilitation. Home-based clinical video teleconferencing (CVT) delivers specialized mental health treatments to clients in the ease of their own home, which allows clinicians to directly observe the client's home environment and family milieu. Cognitive-Behavioral Conjoint Therapy (CBCT), a couple-based treatment designed to target PTSD symptoms and improve individual and relationship functioning, has shown evidence of improvements in clinical symptom outcomes in research conducted with Veterans and their partners. Project Objectives: This is a 4-year randomized controlled trial. The primary objective of this study is to compare the clinical efficacy (PTSD symptoms, relationship distress, and functional impairment) of CBCT delivered via an office-based (CBCT-OB) or a home-based CVT (CBCT-HB) delivery modality to the PTSD Family Education control condition (PFE). In addition, this study will estimate and compare the difference in clinical efficacy between CBCT delivered via an office-based (CBCT-OB) or a home-based CVT (CBCT-HB) delivery modality if indicated by results of the primary objective. This study will also compare process outcomes (therapeutic alliance, enrollment and dropout rates, and treatment satisfaction) for CBCT-OB, CBCT-HB, and PFE. Project Methods: Participants will be 180 intent-to-treat couples in which one partner is a PTSD-positive Veteran. Couples will be randomly assigned to receive treatment through one of the three treatment delivery modalities: CBCT-OB, CBCT-HB or PFE. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, mid- and post-treatment, and 3- and 6-months post-treatment. The primary outcome variables of clinical efficacy will be measures of PTSD symptom severity, relationship distress and functional impairment. Secondary process outcomes will include measures of treatment retention, attendance, therapeutic alliance, and treatment satisfaction. The results will provide evidence that can be used to further increase the clinical efficacy, ease of access to, and utilization of specialty PTSD treatment to Veterans and their families.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Be a Veteran (age 18 or older) with a current DSM5 diagnosis of PTSD (as assessed by the CAPS) no less than 3 months after the index trauma occurred (to allow for potential natural recovery) Be on a stable psychoactive medication regimen for at least 2 months (if eligible) Be an intimate partner (age 18 or older) who is willing to participate in the intervention. Be randomized into any of the three treatment conditions Have assessment and treatment sessions audio recorded Agree not to receive other individual or conjoint psychotherapy for PTSD during the treatment portion of the study Consistent with homebased clinical trials and actual clinical practice Participants enrolled into the study will need to have access to internet via DSL or a cable provider in case they are randomized into the homebased condition. The frequency of occurrence of no internet service will be tracked If the PTSDpositive Veteran is currently receiving treatment at the VA, study staff will consult with their primary clinician prior to their inclusion in the study Current substance dependence in either member of the couple not in remission for at least 3 months, as assessed by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)108 and Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST) Any current uncontrolled psychotic disorder in either member of the couple Imminent suicidality or homicidality in either member of the couple Any severe cognitive impairment in either member of the couple Any perpetration of severe physical or sexual relationship aggression in the past year (as assessed by the CTS2). Participants who do not meet study criteria will be offered referrals to alternate services, as well as assistance in contacting the referral sites as needed</criteria>
