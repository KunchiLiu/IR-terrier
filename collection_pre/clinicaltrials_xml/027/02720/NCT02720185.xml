	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To determine if dasatinib, an inhibitor of the Src family kinases, can prevent the nuclear translocation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in operable, nuclear EGFR positive, triple negative breast cancers (TNBC). Secondary Objectives: 1. To examine the safety and tolerability of dasatinib in patients with operable TNBC 2. To explore potential intracellular mechanisms which impact dasatinib effect on cellular localization of EGFR in operable TNBC.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>nEGFR positive ECOG performace status ≤1 Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below: leukocytes ≥3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL platelets ≥150,000/mcL total bilirubin &lt;1.25x institutional upper limit of normal AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation and for 30 days after the final dose. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents Patients not able to swallow oral medications or with gastrointestinal conditions that may impact absorption of dasatinib. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to dasatinib. Patients receiving any medications or substances that are moderate or strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, medications should be reviewed by the UW Pharmacy Research Center for any contraindicated medications. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new overthecounter medicine or herbal product. H2 antagonists and proton pump inhibitors are not allowed Anticoagulants (ie. Coumadin, heparin, antiXa inhibitors) and antiplatelet agents (ie. aspirin) are not allowed. NSAIDS and acetaminophen are allowed on study. Medications known to prolong QTC are not allowed (See Appendix B) No history of prolonged QTC or cardiomyopathy unless normal QTC and ejection fraction confirmed within 1 month prior to study entry. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because dasatinib is a pregnancy category D agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with dasatinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with dasatinib and not resumed until at least 2 weeks after the final dose. HIVpositive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with dasatinib. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrowsuppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.</criteria>
