	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Injectable Cabotegravir Compared to Daily Oral Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate/Emtricitabine (TDF/FTC), For Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis in HIV-Uninfected Cisgender Men and Transgender Women Who Have Sex With Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the injectable drug cabotegravir (CAB LA), for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in HIV-uninfected cisgender men and transgender women who have sex with men (MSM and TGW). This study will enroll HIV-uninfected MSM and TGW at risk for acquiring HIV infection. Participants will remain in the study between 1.5 years to 4.5 years, depending on when they enroll in the study. This study will take place in three steps. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two arms: Arm A: Step 1: Participants will receive daily oral CAB tablets and daily oral TDF/FTC placebo tablets for 5 weeks. Step 2: Participants will receive an intramuscular (IM) injection of CAB LA at two time points 4 weeks apart and every 8 weeks thereafter and daily oral TDF/FTC placebo tablets. Arm B: Step 1: Participants will receive daily oral TDF/FTC tablets and daily oral CAB placebo tablets for 5 weeks. Step 2: Participants will receive daily oral TDF/FTC tablets and an IM injection of placebo at two time points 4 weeks apart and every 8 weeks thereafter. In Step 3, all participants (Arms A and B) will receive daily oral TDF/FTC tablets no later than 8 weeks after the last injection, for up to 48 weeks. Participants will attend up to 57 study visits throughout the study. Visits may include physical examinations, blood collection, urine collection, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and rectal swab collection. Some participants may have a bone mineral density-energy x-ray absorptimetry (DXA) scan at select visits. All participants will be transitioned to locally available HIV prevention services, including services for PrEP, if available, at the end of their participation in the study.</detailed_description>

More information on this criterion can be found in the protocol. Hemoglobin greater than 11 g/dL, Absolute neutrophil count greater than 750 cells/mm^3 Platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm^3 Calculated creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/minute using the CockcroftGault equation Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) Total bilirubin less than or equal to 2.5 times ULN Hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) negative Hepatitis C virus (HCV) Ab negative No Grade 3 or higher laboratory abnormalities No medical condition that, in the opinion of the study investigator, would interfere with the conduct of the study (e.g., provided by selfreport, or found upon medical history and examination or in available medical records) Willing to undergo all required study procedures One or more reactive or positive HIV test result at Screening or Enrollment, even if HIV infection is not confirmed Active or recent use of any illicit intravenous drugs ("recent" defined as in the 90 days prior to enrollment) Coenrollment in any other interventional research study or other concurrent studies that may interfere with this study (as provided by selfreport or other available documentation. Exceptions may be made if appropriate after consultation with the CMC.) Past or current participation in HIV vaccine trial. An exception will be made for participants that can provide documentation of receipt of placebo (not active arm). Clinically significant cardiovascular disease, as defined by history/evidence of symptomatic arrhythmia, angina/ischemia, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or any clinically significant cardiac disease Inflammatory skin conditions that compromise the safety of intramuscular (IM) injections, per the discretion of the Investigator of Record. Mild skin conditions may not be exclusionary at the discretion of the Investigator of Record (IoR) or designee in consultation with the CMC Has a tattoo or other dermatological condition overlying the buttock region which in the opinion of the IoR or designee, in consultation with the CMC, may interfere with interpretation of injection site reactions Current or chronic history of liver disease (e.g., nonalcoholic or alcoholic steatohepatitis) or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome, asymptomatic gallstones, or cholecystectomy) Coagulopathy (primary or iatrogenic) which would contraindicate IM injection (concomitant anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy use should be discussed with the CMC) Active or planned use of prohibited medications as described in the Investigator's Brochure or listed in the Study Specific Procedures (SSP) Manual (provided by selfreport, or obtained from medical history or medical records). In particular, future use of TDF/FTC at any point during the study. Known or suspected allergy to study product components (active or placebo), including egg or soy products (egg and soy products are contained in Intralipid) Surgicallyplaced or injected buttock implants or fillers, per selfreport. Contact the CMC for guidance regarding questions about individual cases. Alcohol or substance use that, in the opinion of the study investigator, would jeopardize the safety of the participant on study (e.g., provided by selfreport, or found upon medical history and examination or in available medical records).
