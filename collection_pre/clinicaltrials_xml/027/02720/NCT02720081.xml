	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to compare the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of adding MK-1029 to montelukast in adults with persistent asthma that is uncontrolled while receiving montelukast alone. Participants will have a specific genetic marker for clinical efficacy of MK-1029.</brief_summary>
