	<brief_summary>This study's primary objective is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of switching patients with inadequate relief on generic SSRIs to levomilnacipran versus adding a new treatment (quetiapine ER) to your existing treatment with people diagnosed with depression (major depression disorder). The secondary objective is to examine the response and remission rates following the switch from a generic SSRI to levomilnacipran ER and augmentation with quetiapine along with examining changes in neurocognitive and apathy measures after the switch.</brief_summary>
