	<brief_summary>The purpose of this single visit extension study is to explore immune status in RRMS patients treated for at least 48 months with fingolimod. Long-term changes in T cell counts will be compared to short-term changes in immune status (baseline to month 6) after treatment start with fingolimod as assessed in the original Biobank study (CFTY720DDE01).</brief_summary>
