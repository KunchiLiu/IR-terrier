	<brief_title>Prevalence of Genetic Polymporphism on RNF213 rs112735431 Gene in Non-cardioemboli Ischemic Cerebrovascular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an cross-sectional observational study in Chulalongkorn hospital, to determine the prevalence of genetic polymorphism on RNF213 rs112735431 gene in non-cardioembolic ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Patients who are potentially eligible for study participation will be identified through a chart review of patients who were admitted in Chulalongkorn Hospital for acute ischemic stroke treatment.</detailed_description>
