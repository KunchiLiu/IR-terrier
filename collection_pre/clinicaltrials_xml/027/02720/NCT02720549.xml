	<brief_summary>Ischemic reperfusion injury of cardiopulmonary bypass and postoperative renal dysfunction is a common problem which influence poor outcome in subjects undergoing valvular heart surgery. The incidence of postoperative renal dysfunction was reported as high as 7~8% in heart surgery using bypass, and is thought to be caused by ischemia/reperfusion injury. Remote ischemic postconditioning was also reported to be protective for ischemic/reperfusion injury in previous animal studies and stoke patients. Therefore, the investigators are trying to evaluate the clinical effect of remote ischemic postconditioning on postoperative renal dysfunction in subjects undergoing valvular heart surgery with bypass.</brief_summary>
