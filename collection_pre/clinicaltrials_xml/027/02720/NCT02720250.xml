	<brief_summary>Previous studies have shown that omega-3 fatty acid pills intake have beneficial effect on vascular health in overweight and/or hypertensive patients. However, there is a lack of studies showing the effect of everyday consumption of omega-3 fatty acids enriched food (not pills) on lipid profile and microvascular reactivity in healthy population. This study aimed to determine the effect of omega-3 enriched chicken eggs consumption on microvascular reactivity and lipid profile in young healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
