Male patient and their female spouse/partners who are of childbearing potential must be using 2 forms of highly effective birth control† (1 of which must be a barrier method‡) starting at screening and continue throughout the study period and for 90 days after the final study drug administration. †Highly effective forms of birth control include: Consistent and correct usage of established oral contraception Injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception Established intrauterine device or intrauterine system Bilateral tubal ligation Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments and complies with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. ‡Barrier methods of birth control include: Condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository Male patient must not donate sperm starting at screening and throughout the study period and for 90 days after the final study drug administration.

Patient has a negative urine drug screen for drugs of abuse at screening and check in. Female patient who has been pregnant within 6 months prior to screening assessment or breastfeeding within 3 months prior to screening. Patient has a known or suspected hypersensitivity to ASP4345 or any components of the formulation used. Patient has had previous exposure with ASP4345. Patient has a history of suicide attempt or suicidal behavior within 2 years prior to screening. Any suicidal ideation that meets criteria at a level of 4 or 5 by using CSSRS within the last 3 months or who is at significant risk to commit suicide at screening or at admission to the clinical unit (day 2) will be excluded. Patient has any clinically significant liver chemistry test result aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma glutamyl transferase, total bilirubin (TBL) or a result &gt; than 1.5 times above the ULN at screening or at admission to the clinical unit (day 2). In such a case, the assessment may be repeated once. Patient has any history of allergic conditions deemed clinically significant. Patient has any history or evidence of any clinically significant cardiovascular, gastrointestinal endocrinologic, hematologic, hepatic, immunologic, metabolic, urologic, pulmonary, neurologic, dermatologic, psychiatric (other than schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder), renal and/or other major disease or malignancy.
