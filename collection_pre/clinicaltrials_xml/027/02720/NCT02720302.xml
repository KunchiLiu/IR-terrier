	<brief_summary>The present study is a public health project with the aim to treat overweight in children 9-11 years of age. After the first consultation the children are randomized to either continue the treatment at The Child Obesity Clinic, Child Department or to have the following 2-3 consultations on distance with Lync.

	<detailed_description>This superiority study is a randomized trial with two independent treatment arms. The target for the enrollment is 50% in each of the two treatment groups. With 60 patients in each group, the study has 80% statistical power at 5% significance level to detect an average difference between the treatment groups in the intra-individual change in the BMI Z-score that is 0.51 x the standard deviation in the intra-individual change. Previous data from the investigators own group suggest that a reasonable estimate of the standard deviation in the intra-individual change in the BMI Z-score following intervention is 0.42. Thus, the study has 80% statistical power at 5% significance level to detect a difference in the intra-individual change in the BMI Z-score that is 0.51 x 0.42 = 0.21 on average. The study will with the present funding end its follow up in June 2017.</detailed_description>
