	<brief_title>K-001 Treatment of Advanced Pancreatic Cancer: Clinical Trial of Monotherapy's Tolerability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According to past experience to toxicology studies and clinical test, K-001 at a dose of 2700mg/day has a good safety profile for human body. Upon observation, pancreatic cancer patients receiving a medication at 2160mg/day (1080mg BID) have had good therapeutic efficacy, no sign of significant toxicity. Dosing regimen: Phase I clinical test: maximum dose of monotherapy at 2700mg/day. Four groups of repeated administration of monotherapy, at least 3 patients for each group. Group A: 2700mg/d (1350mg BID); Group B: 3240mg/d (1620mg BID); Group C: 3780mg/d (1890mg BID); Group D: 4320mg/d (2160mg BID). Twice a day, to be taken with warm water on an empty stomach; 4 weeks' administration for each group. In case of severe adverse reactions associated with the test drug, or if half of the participants show adverse reactions at Ⅲ level and above, the test should be terminated. The maximum dosage not causing the above-described situation shall be considered as the maximum tolerated dose or the biologically effective dose. After the test, continuous medication shall be given upon request from patients.</detailed_description>
