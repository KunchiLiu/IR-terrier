	<brief_title>Study of Phasix™ Mesh for VHWG Grade 3 Midline Hernia Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 85 subjects, at approximately 12 sites across Europe will be enrolled and treated to study the use of Phasix™ Mesh. All treated subjects will be followed for 2 years post-implantation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject must be diagnosed with incisional midline hernia. Subject has a VHWG Grade 3 hernia (as defined in the protocol). Size of hernia ≥ 10 cm2. Subject must be willing to undergo a planned retrorectus hernia repair (onlay allowed as an exception when retrorectus placement cannot be achieved; using absorbable suture) with or without Component Separation Technique. Subject with &gt; 4 previous repairs of the hernia under observation. Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 35 kg/m2. The subject is on, or suspected to be placed on, chemotherapy medications during any part of the study. The subject has peritonitis. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (if documented in the subject's record). The subject has cirrhosis of the liver and/or ascites. Subject is American Society of Anesthesiology Class 4 or 5. Complete removal of existing mesh from a prior hernia repair (in the same affected area) is not possible. The hernia repair requires more than a single piece mesh (with adequate overlap beyond the margins of the defect on all sides). Subject has intact permanent mesh adjacent to the current hernia to be repaired. Subject's hernia repair requires intraabdominal mesh placement. Surgical technique requires surgical bridge repair as the sole repair. Subject has any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude the use of the study device, or preclude the subject from completing the followup requirements. Subject is pregnant or has plans to become pregnant during the study period or is currently breastfeeding. Subject has an alcohol/substance abuse problem or has had a relapse within 12 months of the screening visit. Subject was involved in another interventional clinical study in the last 30 days prior to ICF signature. Subject is part of the site personnel directly involved with this study. Subject has a life expectancy of less than 2 years at the time of enrollment. Subject has a known sensitivity to Phasix™ Mesh or component materials (patients with known allergies to tetracycline hydrochloride or kanamycin sulfate should be avoided).</criteria>
