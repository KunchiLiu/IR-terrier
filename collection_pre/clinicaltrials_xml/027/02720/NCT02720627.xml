	<brief_summary>This study is designed to determine the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression potential and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of CB-03-01 Cream, 1%, applied every twelve hours for two weeks, in pediatric patients 9 to less than 12 years of age with acne vulgaris. Adrenal suppression effects and systemic safety are an important safety concern. The current study is designed to investigate these potential concerns under maximal use conditions.</brief_summary>
