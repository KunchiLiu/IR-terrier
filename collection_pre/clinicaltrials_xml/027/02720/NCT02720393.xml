	<brief_summary>Participants will be randomly assigned to either regular or no-carrageenan prepared diets to determine whether the no-carrageenan leads to improvement in glucose tolerance. Hemoglobin A1c is the primary outcome measure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of No-carrageenan Diet on Glucose Tolerance in Prediabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be randomly assigned to a diet. They will at onset have hemoglobin A1c values between 5.7% and 6.4%. Baseline glucose tolerance test will be performed, as well as measures of inflammation and fecal microbiome. Interim tests will be performed at six weeks. Subjects will participate for 12 weeks, at which time they will be re-evaluated.</detailed_description>
