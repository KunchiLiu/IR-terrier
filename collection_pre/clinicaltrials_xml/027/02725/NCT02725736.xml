	<brief_title>Tocolytic Therapy for Preterm Labor in Multiple Gestation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preterm birth remains the principal cause of early neonatal death. Infants born preterm (before 37 weeks' gestation) often suffer significant immediate morbidity and need lengthy stays in neonatal intensive care units. Moreover, there is a significant risk of long-term neurological morbidity in a proportion of the survivors. Patients with a multiple gestation are at significant risk for preterm labor and delivery as approximately 60% of all those pregnancies will be delivered preterm. A number of oxytocin receptor antagonists have been developed, and of these, three, atosiban, barusiban and retosiban have been investigated in humans as tocolytic agents. To date, only atosiban is in use outside of clinical trials. Atosiban is an oxytocin receptor antagonist which was specifically developed for the treatment of preterm labor. Early reports of the use of Atosiban for tocolysis showed promise both in vitro and in animal studies, and preliminary studies in pregnant and non-pregnant humans suggested a very low incidence of maternal side effects .</detailed_description>
