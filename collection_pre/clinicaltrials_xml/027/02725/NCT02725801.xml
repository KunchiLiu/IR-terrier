	<brief_title>Comparison of One-port and Two-port Tissue Expanders for Breast Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this study is to compare a traditional single port expander with a two-port expander for equivalency when used for breast reconstruction following mastectomy. Complication rates that will be tracked include seroma, mastectomy skin flap necrosis, infection, wound dehiscence, need for explantation of the expander. Management of seromas will be compared between the two groups. The investigators hypothesize that the AlloX2 expander will be as effective in achieving the final outcome of completion of the second stage of reconstruction with equal or improved complication rates. Study Design A prospective 1:1 randomized, single center, open label study will compare the traditional 1- port tissue expander with the AlloX2 2-port expander placed during immediate tissue expander breast reconstruction. Due to the nature of the surgery, the study cannot be blinded. Patients will be followed until completion of expansion and exchange for the permanent implant which typically takes 2 to 3 months. Risks factors that have been previously identified to be associated with increased postoperative complications include smoking, obesity, breast size, diabetes, radiation therapy, and expander fill volume will be identified. The final outcome is completion of expansion and exchange to permanent implant. Standard operative procedure and postoperative care will be done. Both groups will have the same two external drains placed which is standard operative procedure. Complications will be noted at each postoperative clinic visit and entered into a database. Complication rates will be compared between the two groups and associations with risk factors will be analyzed. There will be no cross-over into the other group in case of reconstructive failure. Treatment failures will be treated in the same fashion in the two groups.</detailed_description>
