	<brief_summary>Spinal stenosis is a prevalent diagnosis, which is handled in a heterogeneous manner by clinicians. Moreover, when using steroidal epidural injections, successful treatment is currently defined as the satisfaction of the patient from the treatments, a subjective and non-quantifiable indicator. In this experiment, the investigators aim to evaluate thermographic images as an objective method for assessing the efficacy of steroidal epidural injections, the most common invasive treatment for pain associated with spinal stenosis</brief_summary>
