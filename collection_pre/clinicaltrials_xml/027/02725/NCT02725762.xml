	<brief_title>Study of Photobiomodulation to Treat Dry Age-Related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The LumiThera LT 300® Light Delivery System is a stationary desktop instrument used to emit energy in the visible and near infrared spectrum. The LT-300® is designed for the ophthalmologist to use in the treatment of the eye with photobiomodulation (PBM), a process by which cellular mechanisms are induced by light. PBM is being utilized in many indications, such as wound healing, soft tissue injuries, joint pain, myofascial pain, nerve injuries, muscle fatigue for temporary improvement in blood flow and reduction in inflammation. The mechanism of PBM at the cellular level has been ascribed to the activation of mitochondrial respiratory chain components resulting in stabilization of metabolic function and initiation of a signaling cascade, which promotes cellular proliferation and cytoprotection. The LT-300® will provide a preset treatment of PBM to the subject's eye and retinal tissue through the open and closed eyelid. Approximately 30 subjects meeting the eligibility requirements of the study will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive standard of care treatment for Dry AMD plus PBM treatment with the LT-300 system, or standard of care treatment for Dry AMD plus Sham treatment with the LT-300 system. Subjects randomized to each group will receive two 3-week treatment sessions (9 treatments per session) and follow-up visits extending to one year. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PBM with respect to visual and anatomical outcomes of subjects with Dry AMD.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients of both gender Patients must have dry macular degeneration in the study eye Best corrected visual acuity between 20/40 and 20/200 Patients must be competent to sign and have signed a consent form before study entry Visually significant cataracts. Presence of a visually significant posterior capsule if prior cataract surgery has been performed. Any visually significant disease process in any ocular structure that would affect vision unrelated to macular degeneration. A patient can be enrolled if only one of their eyes meets the criteria. The other eye may be treated but not included in the study; for example advanced geographic atrophy. Patients with severe clinically significant disease or unstable medical disorders including cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, neurological, endocrine, gastrointestinal, CNS or life threatening disease or current malignancy at the discretion of the investigators Patients who are nonambulatory or bed ridden Female patients who are pregnant or of childbearing potential as effects of PBM on the developing human fetus are unknown. Patients with a history of Epilepsy Patients with a history of alcohol, drug or substance abuse in the past 6 months Patients deemed uncooperative or non compliant with the requirements of the protocol. Patients who have received any investigational drug or treatment within 30 days prior to study entry. Patients who are not competent to understand and sign consent form.</criteria>
