Currently on diet and exercise and a stable dose of metformin (at least 1000 mg daily) for a minimum of 8 weeks, or stable dose of insulin for a minimum of 8 weeks, or a stable combination of metformin (at least 1000 mg daily) and insulin for a minimum of 8 weeks prior to screening 6. FPG &lt;=255 mg/dL (&lt;= 14.2 mmol/L) obtained at screening visit 1. Previous diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes 2. Diabetes ketoacidosis (DKA) within 6 months of screening 3. Current use of the following medications for the treatment of diabetes, or use within the specified timeframe prior to screening for the main study: Eight weeks: sulfonylureas, alpha glucosidase inhibitors, metiglinide, or injectable incretins or incretin mimetics or other antidiabetes medications not otherwise specified Sixteen weeks: thiazolidinediones Any previous history or current use of an SGLT2 inhibitor, including dapagliflozin 4.

History of unresolved vesicoureteral reflux 8. Replacement or chronic systemic corticosteroid therapy, defined as any dose of systemic corticosteroid taken for &gt; 4 weeks within 3 months prior to the Day 1 visit. Note: Topical, nasal, or inhaled corticosteroids are allowed 9. Abnormal renal function, which is defined in subjects &lt; 18 years of age as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated by the Schwartz Formula &lt; 80 mL/min/1.73 m2 (1.33 mL/s), and in subjects &gt;= 18 years as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated by the MDRD Formula &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (1.33 mL/s) 10. Presence of either: antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) or protein tyrosine phosphataselike protein antibodies (IA2) 11. An abnormal TSH value at screening will be further evaluated for free T4. Subjects with abnormal free T4 values will be excluded 12. Hematuria (confirmed by microscopy at screening) with no explanation as judged by the investigator up to randomization 13. Anemia of any etiology defined as hemoglobin &lt;=10.7 g/dL (107 g/L) for females and &lt;= 11.3 g/dL (113 g/L) for males. Subjects who are considered to have anemia according to local guidelines should be excluded 14. Volumedepleted subjects. Subjects at risk for volume depletion due to coexisting conditions or concomitant medications, such as loop diuretics, should carefully monitor their volume status</criteria>
