	<brief_title>By Using Adoptive Transfer of Autologous NK Cells to Prevent Recurrence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma After Curative Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>No adjuvant therapy has been shown to extend the survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma receiving curative treatment.We investigated whether injections of NK cells prolongs recurrence-free survival of patients after curative therapy.</detailed_description>

(refer to the attached file 10). Hepatocellular carcinoma should be shown by radiological test; on dynamic CT, dynamic MRI or on angiography. 4. ChildPugh Score should be less than 6 5. No matter how the patient has been treated before, his (her) tumor should be totally removed by curative resection (RFA or operation). (based on the agreement date for written consent) 6. Patients must have adequate cardiac function(no cardiac disease, LVEF≥40% ), adequate pulmonary function as indicated by room air oxygen saturation of &gt;94%, and adequate renal function(Cr≤133umol/L). 7. Patient's remaining lifetime should be expected at least more than 3 months. 1.
