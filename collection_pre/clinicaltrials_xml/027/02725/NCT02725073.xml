	<brief_title>Photodynamic Therapy in Locally Advanced Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a way of producing tissue necrosis with light after prior administration of a photosensitizing agent. The most important advantages include the possibility of combining PDT with other target therapies and repeat the process as needed with a favorable outcomes. The combination of diverse therapeutic modalities is one of the new strategies to enhance oncologic treatments for pancreatic cancer. In order to overcome the limitations of each treatment modalities and to prevent the development of resistance, the application of PDT combined with target therapies, without increasing the toxicity for the patient, is being widely investigated. PDT has been only extensively studied for the treatment of various superficial skin cancers in the Europe but not available in the United States and Japan due to the overlapping treatment fields. In Korea, the use of first-generation and second-generation photosensitizers are part of the study of Gastroenterology, Dermatology, Otolaryngology, and Gynecology. Recently, although the investigators have introduced PDT using novel photosensitizers has not yet been used for the treatment of pancreatic cancers. This study aim to determine the safety and efficacy of photodynamic therapy with a novel photosensitizer in locally advanced hilar cholangiocarcinoma.</detailed_description>
