	<brief_summary>The interferon-free combination regimen of Paritaprevir/r - Ombitasvir with or without Dasabuvir (ABBVIE REGIMEN) ± Ribavirin (RBV) for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) has been shown to be safe and effective in randomized controlled clinical trials with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria under well controlled conditions. This observational study is the first effectiveness research examining the ABBVIE REGIMEN ± RBV, used according to local label, under real world conditions in Greece in a clinical practice patient population.</brief_summary>
