	<detailed_description>The goal of the research was to examine the association between weight and the barriers and facilitators to meeting the DGA in a multi-site study using a cross-sectional survey. 836 caregiver-child dyads enrolled and completed the HEALTH study questionnaire across six sites among three race/ethnic groups participating in the HEALTH Study. Barriers and facilitators to meeting the DGA were assessed using a validated questionnaire which was developed specifically for the HEALTH Study. Heights and weights were measured. A series of bivariate regression analyses were conducted to examine the association between the caregivers BMI or the children BMI z-score and the barriers and facilitators to meeting the DGA, adjusting for appropriate covariates in the models. Path analysis was used to examine the relationship of caregivers and children barriers and facilitators to their relative BMI.</detailed_description>
