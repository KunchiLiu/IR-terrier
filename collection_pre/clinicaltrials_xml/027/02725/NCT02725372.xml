	<criteria>1. Signed Informed Consent Form (and assent as appropriate) prior to the initiation of any study mandated procedures or assessments 2. A confirmed diagnosis of PAH Group 1 who have either idiopathic PAH (IPAH), heritable PAH, drug and toxininduced PAH, associated PAH (APAH) with connective tissue disease (CTD), APAH with repaired simple congenital systemic to pulmonary shunt (i.e., atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect and/or patent ductus arteriosus; complete repair at least 1 year prior to Screening), APAH with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or APAH with portal hypertension 3. Subjects receiving at least one PAH specific therapy (ERA or PDE5 inhibitor, or inhaled, subcutaneous, or intravenous prostacyclin or a prostacyclin analog) with the same type of therapy for at least 3 months with stable dosing 4 weeks prior to Screening. (Subjects should be receiving optimal therapy according to the disease severity) 4. Subjects using oxygen therapy by nasal cannula for at least 4 weeks prior to Screening 5. PAH diagnosis confirmed by RHC within the previous 5 years, according to the following definitions: PVR ≥ 400 dynes.sec.cm5 (5 Wood units) mPAP ≥ 25 mmHg PCWP or LVEDP ≤ 15 mmHg Subjects who otherwise meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria but have not undergone a RHC within the previous 5 years may be considered eligible for the study if they undergo a RHC and then meet the pulmonary hemodynamics criterion 6. 6MWD ≥ 100 meters and ≤ 450 meters prior to randomization 7. WHO Functional Class IIIV. Subjects with WHO Functional Class IV should be treated with prostacyclin or a prostacyclin analog (subcutaneous or intravenous), plus at least one additional PAH specific therapy (ERA or PDE5), if available to the subject and reimbursed by health insurance 8. Age between 18 and 80 years (inclusive) 9. Willingness to use INOpulse delivery device for at least 16 hours per day 10. Willingness to continue on study drug until last subject has completed Week 18 assessments (EOS) 11. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pretreatment pregnancy test (serum or urine). All female subjects should take adequate precaution to avoid pregnancy. 1. Subjects with known HIV infection who have a history within the past 3 months of any opportunistic pulmonary disease (e.g., tuberculosis, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, or other pneumonias) at the time of Screening 2. PAH associated with untreated thyroid disorders, glycogen storage disease, Gaucher's disease, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, hemoglobinopathies, myeloproliferative disorders or splenectomy 3. Subjects with pulmonary conditions that may contribute to PAH including, but not limited to, chronic bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, or other pulmonary condition that the Investigator may deem to contribute to the severity of the disease or impair the delivery of iNO due to airway disease 4. Subjects receiving riociguat 5. Subjects receiving oral prostanoids as monotherapy 6. Any subject with unrepaired congenital heart disease or repaired congenital heart disease other than the simple congenital to systemic shunts specified in the inclusion criteria, i.e., PAH associated with noncorrected simple congenital systemictopulmonary shunts, corrected simple congenital systemictopulmonary shunt with residual shunt post repair, or complex systemictopulmonary shunts, corrected or noncorrected, or any other complex congenital heart disease, corrected or noncorrected 7. PAH associated with significant venous or capillary involvement, known or suspected pulmonary venoocclusive disease, or pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis 8. Any subject with WHO PH Groups 2, 3, 4 or 5 9. Subjects with any of the following cardiac abnormalities: 1. Underlying cardiomyopathy or aortic or mitral valve disease 2. Left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), i.e., left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 40% or left ventricular shortening fraction (LVSF) &lt; 22%, as determined by local reading 3. Current symptomatic coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction within 1 year, or any coronary artery interventions within 6 months 10. Systemic hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt; 160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt; 100 mmHg persistent at Screening after a period of rest (treated or untreated) 11. Subjects with a history of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism/infarction or prothrombotic disorder must have had chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) excluded by ventilation/perfusion lung (V/Q) scan 12. Moderate to severe obstructive lung disease defined as both a forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) &lt; 70% and FEV1 &lt; 65% of predicted value 13. Moderate to severe restrictive lung disease: total lung capacity (TLC) &lt; 60% of predicted; if TLC 60% to 70% predicted, a high resolution CT scan showing diffuse disease or more than mild patchy disease 14. Any subject who develops or has developed a PCWP &gt; 20 mmHg during acute vasodilator testing (AVT) 15. Systemic hypotension defined as SBP &lt; 90 mmHg persistent at Screening after a period of rest 16. Moderate to severe hepatic impairment, i.e., ChildPugh Class B or C 17. On dialysis 18. Acute or chronic physical impairment (other than dyspnea due to PAH) that would limit the ability to comply with study procedures or adherence to therapy (i.e., 6MWT), including carrying and wearing the pulsed delivery device per study protocol, or medical problem(s) likely to preclude completion of the study 19. Pregnant or breastfeeding females at Screening 20. Administered Larginine within 1 month prior to Screening 21. Known concomitant lifethreatening disease with a life expectancy less than 1 year 22. Atrial septostomy within 3 months preceding randomization 23. Any subject who requires the use of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), or any other positive pressure devices 24. Use of investigational drugs or devices within 1 month prior to Screening (other than acute vasodilator testing with iNO) 25. Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, makes the subject an unsuitable candidate for the study 26. Any subject who has been enrolled in any previous clinical study with inhaled NO administered through pulse delivery. Additional Criteria to Continue to Treatment Phase from Runin Period (Week 0 to Week 2): 1. Subjects must demonstrate an average daily usage of the INOpulse device of ≥ 16 hours (rounded to the nearest hour) with no more than 2 days of usage &lt; 8 hours per day, during the initial 2 weeks of study. 2. If a subject experiences clinical worsening during the Screening or Runin period, the subject will not be eligible to enter into the treatment phase of the study. 3. Subjects who have been randomized at baseline and found not to meet all Inclusion criteria and/or who meet Exclusion criteria during the Runin period will be withdrawn from the study. Additional subjects will be enrolled to meet total target enrollment</criteria>
