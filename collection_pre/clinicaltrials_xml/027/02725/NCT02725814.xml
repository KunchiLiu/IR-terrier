	<brief_summary>Recent studies show that babies in hospital undergo an average of 4 to 5 painful procedures, such as heel lances, every day. Sucrose (sugar water) has been shown to be effective for reducing babies' pain during painful procedures. Unfortunately, sucrose is not used as often as it could be to reduce babies' pain. This may be due to lack of certainty about the least effective amount of sucrose to use and concerns about the long-term effects of repeated use of sucrose on infant development. Factors within the hospital units where babies receive care may also influence caregivers' decisions to use sucrose. In this research the investigators will conduct two main studies. In the first study the investigators determined the lowest amount of sucrose needed to manage babies' pain effectively. In the second study the investigators will explore (a) if this amount of sucrose can manage pain when it is used repeatedly for all painful procedures while the baby is hospitalized and (b) whether consistent use of sucrose influences the development of babies when they are 18 months old. During the second study, the investigators will also examine the hospital units where the babies receive care. They will look at staff support for research, time and resources and other factors that promote and prevent sucrose use. The results of these studies will be used to determine the best management of babies' pain during painful procedures in hospitals to achieve the best outcomes.</brief_summary>
