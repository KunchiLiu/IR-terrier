	<criteria>Patients with a diagnosis of SLE as defined by the ACR criteria Patients have a history of a (+) ANA, (+) ENA or a (+) antidsDNA serology documented within one year prior to randomization Investigator has assessed the patient and in their judgment, the SLE disease activity is not organ threatening Both investigator and patient agree that it is acceptable to discontinue their current immunosuppressant SLE medications and receive a brief course of IM steroid therapy If patients are on oral steroids, they must be on the equivalent of ≤15 mg/day of prednisone to enter screening, and must be able to taper to ≤10 mg/day by randomization History or evidence of a clinically unstable/uncontrolled disorder, condition or disease, other than SLE that, in the opinion of the investigator would pose a risk to patient safety or interfere with the study evaluation, procedures or completion Patients who have organ threatening manifestations of SLE including active Class 3 or 4 lupus nephritis requiring induction or maintenance therapy or any other disorder for which stopping SLE therapy is contraindicated Active CNS lupus such as seizures or psychosis that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation Unstable hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia Patient is pregnant or breast feeding, or planning to become pregnant while participating in the study Use of any biologic therapy (including belimumab) within 6 months of randomization, or prior exposure to a monoclonal antibody directed to CD20 (such as rituximab) within 12 months of randomization</criteria>
