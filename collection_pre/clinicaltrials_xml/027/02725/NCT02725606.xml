	<brief_title>Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics of GW003 in Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an single-center, open-label, randomized, active-controlled phase I study evaluating tolerability and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of single subcutaneous injections of GW003 in the breast cancer patients.GW003 is recombinant human serum albumin/human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor(I)fusion protein .It is a long-acting G-CSF(Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor). In this study, participants will be administered a single dose of GW003. Every subject will only accept one dose. In addition to tolerability and safety, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, preliminary efficacy and immunogenicity of GW003 will be evaluated as well.</detailed_description>
