	<brief_summary>This is a randomized,phase II,open-label study, The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal treatment for patients with locally advanced Gastric/Gastroesophageal Cancer according to their Her-2 expression status. The primary endpoint of this study: pathology response rate the second endpoints of this study:pathology complete response rate R0 resection rate Progression-free survival ( PFS) Disease -free survival (DFS) Overall survival(OS) Objective response rate(ORR) Adverse event(AE)</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>(human epidermal growth factor receptor-2,HER2) positive patients: After 4 weeks of SOX±Trastuzumab Neoadjuvant therapy, those who show CR(complete response) or PR(partial response) by Resist evaluation will continue with D2 surgery , then 4cycles of SOX±Trastuzumab Adjuvant chemotherapy, and 4cycles of Trastuzumab as maintenance therapy; those who do not response to former therapy or progress, will be treated with surgery,concurrent chemoradiotherapy,or 2th line chemotherapy. (human epidermal growth factor receptor-2,HER2) negative patients： After 4 weeks of DOS or SOX regimen as neoadjuvant therapy, those who show CR(complete response) or PR(partial response) by Resist evaluation will continue with D2 surgery , then 4cycles of SOX adjuvant chemotherapy, those who do not response to former therapy or progress, will be treated with surgery,concurrent chemoradiotherapy,or 2th line chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
