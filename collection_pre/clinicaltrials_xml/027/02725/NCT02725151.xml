	<brief_summary>Known before diagnosed heart failure and used diuretic therapy patients will be admitted in this study.The objective of this work is whether the Inferior Vena Cava Ultrasound can be used for management of Acute Heart failure therapy. And investigators will calculation correlation of extracted urine amount with Inferior Vena Cava diameter change. Researchers will not interfere to standard recommended treatment protocol, researchers will correlated the urine amount and changed vital signs with therapy with Vena cava inferior diameter.</brief_summary>
