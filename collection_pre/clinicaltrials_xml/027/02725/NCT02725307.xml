	<brief_summary>This study evaluates a novel noninvasive method to dynamically monitor the effect of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty on arterial pulse wave</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-invasive Peri- and Postoperative Monitoring of Femoral Artery Balloon Angioplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with stenosis of superficial femoral artery referred for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty are monitored before, during and after the procedure and pulse wave analysis is conducted.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Cardiovascular Diseases</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. The patient has been clinically examined at policlinic of vascular surgery 2. The patient has undergone measurement of anklebrachial index (ABI) and toebrachial index (TBI) at policlinic of vascular surgery and exhibits abnormal ABI&lt;0.9 or ABI&gt;1.3 3. The patient is considered to have an indication for vascular procedure (critical limb ischemia, intermittent claudication) 4. The patient has been examined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRA) 5. The patient has been considered a candidate for superficial femoral artery percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA) and/or stenting 1. Pacemaker 2. Measurement disturbs or risks the subject's treatment process Withdrawal: 1. Emergency cases 2. By subject's denial 3. Inability to detect signals</criteria>
