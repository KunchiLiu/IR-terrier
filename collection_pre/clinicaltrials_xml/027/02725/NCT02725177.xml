	<brief_summary>Treatment with ACTHAR Gel will result in a reduction of ocular inflammation in patients with active ocular sarcoidosis that requires systemic immunosuppressant therapy (hypothesis)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ocular Sarcoidosis Open Label Trial of ACTHAR Gel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The initial treatment of ocular sarcoidosis usually relies on a combination of topical glucocorticoids and oral glucocorticoids, both of which are associated with significant ocular and systemic toxicities. Steroid-sparing therapies are limited by variable and unpredictable efficacy, prolonged time until clinical response, medication intolerance, and difficulties obtaining payor approval. As a result, it is not uncommon that treating physicians must choose between excessive glucocorticoid toxicity versus poor control of ocular inflammation. Ongoing ocular inflammation, in turn, leads to eventual visual loss and occasionally blindness. There is a need for a more reliable, expeditious therapy that can be used as an alternative to glucocorticoids in sarcoidosis uveitis. Adrenocorticotropic hormone, through activation of melanocortin receptors on leukocytes, can dampen immune responses through non-glucocorticoid dependent mechanisms. The proposed study will aim to define whether there is effectiveness for ACTHAR gel in these patients, delineate an effect dosing regimen, and provide information about the safety of this approach for moderate to severe ocular sarcoidosis. ACTHAR is a 39-amino acid peptide natural form of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) that was initially approved in 1952 by the FDA. It has since been approved for 19 indications including respiratory sarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis, and infantile spasms.</detailed_description>
