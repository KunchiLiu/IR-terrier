	<brief_title>Effects of Sleep Deprivation on Diaphragm Command During an Inspiratory Endurance Trial in Healthy Volunteers.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleep in intensive care unit is altered and few studies have suggested that sleep deprivation (SD) could impact respiratory muscle endurance. A lack of inspiratory endurance could lengthen weaning from invasive ventilation. The purpose of this study is to confirm whether SD alters inspiratory endurance and to identify brain mechanisms involved in SD-induced decreased endurance. A group of 16 male healthy subjects will perform an inspiratory load trial after a normal sleep night and after a sleepless night. Electrophysiological parameters (EEG, motor evoked potentials) of the inspiratory motor command and sensory perceptions will be assessed before, during and after each trial.</detailed_description>
