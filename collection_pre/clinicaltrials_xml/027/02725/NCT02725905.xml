This is a five-year randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to compare the efficacy of two approaches to learning weight management counseling: 1)traditional education (TE) and; 2) multi-modal educational intervention (MME).

	<detailed_description>Eight U.S. medical schools are matched and then randomized to one of two educational interventions, MME or TE. Schools randomized to TE represent "usual care" and will continue the current curriculum. The MME arm will build upon the traditional usual curriculum at the medical school. The MME is a multi-modal educational intervention of a series of interactive learning components focused on integrated weight management counseling. This MME intervention for weight management counseling uses the 5As model based on the updated American Heart Association (AHA) /American College of Cardiology (ACC) /The Obesity Society (TOS) and updated NHLBI guidelines.</detailed_description>
