	<brief_summary>Combining Vigil™ with Durvalumab (MEDI4736) will allow Vigil™ to increase the infiltration of activated T cells into tumors, and in addition, to enhance PD-L1 (programmed cell death ligand 1) expression. Consequently, the response rate of historically unresponsive PD-L1 negative cancer to Durvalumab (MEDI4736) will reach a level similar to that achieved in PD-L1 positive cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study of Durvalumab (MEDI4736) in Combination With Vigil™ in Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label pilot study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the combination of Vigil™ autologous tumor cell immunotherapy and Durvalumab (programmed cell death ligand 1) inhibitor in patients with PD-L1 negative locally advanced or metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), regardless of the number of prior therapies. PD-L1 negative tumor status is defined as &lt; 1% membranous PD-L1 staining with antihuman PDL1 rabbit monoclonal antibody SP263 (Ventana, Tucson, AZ) of neoplastic cells. Patients undergoing a standard surgical procedure (e.g., tumor biopsy, palliative resection, thoracentesis of malignant pleural effusion) will have tumor tissue procured for manufacture of Vigil™ vaccine. This will be a 2 part study. The first part will be a safety run-in comprised of 2 cohorts that will use a 3 + 3 design to determine the Vigil™ dose in Part 2. Cohort 1 will receive a low dose of Vigil™ (1x10^6 cells/intradermal (ID) injection) in combination with Durvalumab (1500 mg (if &gt; 30 kg) IV over 60 minutes) every 4 weeks. Cohort 2 will receive Vigil™ at 1x10^7 cells/ID injection and Durvalumab (1500mg (if &gt; 30 kg) IV over 60 minutes) every 4 weeks. If needed, Cohort -1 will be used which will receive Vigil™ at 1x10^5 cells/ID injection and Durvalumab (1500mg (if &gt; 30 kg) IV over 60 minutes) every 4 weeks. The enrollment of the first two patients in each Cohort of Part 1 will be staggered by 2 weeks, In Part 2 of the study, patients meeting study eligibility criteria will receive Vigil™at the dose determined in Part 1 and Durvalumab (1500mg (if &gt; 30 kg) IV over 60 minutes) every 4 weeks. Three to six weeks after tissue procurement has occurred eligibility will be reconfirmed by the study site. Subjects must begin the study regimen within 6 weeks of tissue procurement. Radiological assessment of tumor response should be performed at screening, Cycle 3 and every 2nd cycle thereafter, and end of treatment (EOT) using RECIST 1.1 and investigator assessment. Tumor biopsy for correlative studies including scoring of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) and PD-1 and PD-L1 expression analysis should be obtained at tissue procurement and at Cycle 3. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for correlative studies should be obtained at pre-procurement, and prior to study regimen administration at Cycle 1, Cycle 3, Cycle 5 and EOT. Patient survival will be followed for 1 year after treatment initiation.</detailed_description>

Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) that is locally advanced or metastatic for which the projected response rate to Durvalumab is 10% or less. Female patients age ≥ 18 years No prior Vigil immunotherapy No prior PD1 or PDL1 inhibitor therapy including Durvalumab ECOG Performance Status ≤ 1 Estimated survival ≥ 6 months Planned standard of care surgical procedure (e.g., tumor biopsy or palliative resection or thoracentesis) and expected availability of a cumulative mass of ~1030 grams tissue ("golfball" size) or pleural fluid estimated volume ≥ 500mL (must be primary tap) for immunotherapy manufacture. One lesion not previously irradiated nor intended for vaccine manufacture, which can be biopsied with minimal invasion and measurable at baseline as per RECIST 1.1 guidelines (performed prior to biopsy) or 2 lesions not previously irradiated nor intended for vaccine manufacture, one of which can be biopsied with minimal invasion and the other of which is measurable at baseline as per RECIST 1.1 guidelines. If the only such target lesion has previously been irradiated it must have shown unequivocal evidence of disease progression following completion of radiation therapy. Provision of tumor tissue sample (archived or fresh) to allow for PDL1 expression analysis Study Enrollment Successful manufacturing of at least 4 vials of Vigil™.

If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a negative serum test will be required for study entry.
