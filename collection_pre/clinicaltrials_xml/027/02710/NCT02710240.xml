	<brief_summary>A specific aim is to determine if Indocyanine Green (ICG) administered pre-operatively, then imaged intraoperatively using our camera will aid in the identification of suspected central nervous system (CNS) tumors. A secondary aim is to understand if the use of ICG during surgery correlates to MR imaging findings including elevated Cho/Cr ratio, rCBV, Ktrans and contrast enhancement.</brief_summary>
