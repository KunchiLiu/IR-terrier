	<brief_summary>The use of dehydrated human amnionic membrane allograft improves erectile function recovery (as measured by (Sexual History Inventory for Men (SHIM) score) at 12 months after robotic assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) compared to a control group with no allograft.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Miami Membrane for Potency (MMEP) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 2 prospective randomized trial investigating the impact of amniotic membrane placement over the neurovascular bundles after bilateral nerve sparing robot assisted radical prostatectomy on potency. The study will have a control arm that will follow standard of care surgery, without placement of any membranes. 140 men will be allocated to each arm. Randomization of study patients will be done in equal proportion to Arm I (membrane placement) and Arm II (no membrane placement, standard of care surgery) using a permuted block design stratified by baseline SHIM score (&lt;17 vs. &gt;=17), and use of ANY erectile aids (Yes vs. No) in the last 3 months. Patients will be followed up every three months for a total of one year. This follow up schedule meets the current standard of care after radical prostatectomy. At each follow up a serum PSA will be assessed for recurrence on prostate cancer. To investigate primary and secondary endpoints a self-reported validated questionnaire will be provided assessing measures of potency. Finally, the use of pads for urinary leakage will be assessed at each time point. The research study will end at 12 months from radical prostatectomy of the last enrolled patient</detailed_description>
