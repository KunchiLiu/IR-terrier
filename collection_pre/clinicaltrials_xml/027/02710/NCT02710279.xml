	<brief_summary>Suicide is a major health problem that causes annually a million death worldwild. In the stress-vulnerability model, suicidal behavior (SB) results from the interaction between an individual's predisposition and stressful condition. We hypothesized that the sensitivity to social exclusion may represent a core component of the suicidal vulnerability Recent evidence also suggest that inflammatory mediators plays a critical role in SB. Furthermore, social stressors are particulary strong and specific triggers of inflammatory response. To sum up, patients carrying a suicidal vulnerability are expected to present greater responses to social rejection in terms of inflammatory activity and psychological pain. The aim of the study is to evaluate the psychological and inflammatory responses to a social stressor validated, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) . We will also investigate the moderating effect of childhood abuse, attachment, trait rejection sensitivity and social isolation. In the second part of the study, we will also investigate the prospective association between inflammatory responses induces by laboratory paradigms of social rejection and the occurrence of social distress, suicidal ideation and psychological pain in response to social exclusion events in real life (using ecological momentary assessment).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Over one year, we will recruit 140 female outpatients suffering from a major depressive episode with (n=70) and without any history of suicide attempt (n=70) from a specialized clinic for mood disorders and SB. First visit: clinical, biological and neuropsychological assessment Second visit: The TSST is a standardized laboratory psychosocial stress protocol that involves public speaking, role play, and mental arithmetic tasks in front of a panel of confederate judges. Blood samples will be obtained before the introduction to the TSST and immediately after and at + 30, + 60, + 90, and + 120 min. Self-ratings of emotional states, anxiety, anger and psychological pain will be completed at the same times. Third visit: Participants will be instructed to carry a smartphone with them for one week, and to record at each alarm signal daily life events, negative emotions, psychological pain, suicidal ideas, and specific attributions to these events. Participants will be signalled five times a day during the period. Subjects will be contacted by telephone halfway through the assessment period to monitor and encourage compliance.</detailed_description>
