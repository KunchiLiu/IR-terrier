	<brief_summary>The goal for this pilot study is to assess the acceptability of two online self-guided programs for migraines. The programs are part of the investigators' collection of "my Wireless Headache Interventions" (myWHI). The Specialized Program for Headache Reduction (SPHERE) is a program that teaches cognitive and behavioural skills/techniques to help manage headaches. The PeRsonalized Intervention for Self-Management of Migraine (PRISM) helps users to discover their headache triggers and provides recommendations for managing them. This pilot will also assess the feasibility of the study protocol to inform a full scale randomized controlled trial (RCT).</brief_summary>
