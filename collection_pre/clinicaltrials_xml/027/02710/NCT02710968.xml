	<brief_summary>Despite advances in prenatal diagnosis and postnatal therapies, including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), inhaled nitric oxide therapy, and ventilator strategies that minimize ventilator-induced lung injury, morbidity and mortality rates for babies with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) remain high. The survival relates to the degree of prenatal lung compression and the subsequent impairment of pulmonary function following delivery. Prenatal assessment by ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging allows to estimate the severity by relating the circumference of the lung contralateral to the hernia to the fetal head circumference (Lung to head ratio (LHR) and by noting the degree of upward herniation of the liver. Based on the observed to expected lung to head ratio (O/E LHR) prenatally diagnosed congenital diaphragmatic hernia can be prognostically assessed. While overall survival of congenital diaphragmatic hernia is approximately 60%, an O/E LHR &lt;25% is associated with survival between 11-24%. The rationale for fetal therapy in severe congenital diaphragmatic hernia is to restore adequate lung growth for neonatal survival. Prenatal tracheal occlusion obstructs the normal egress of lung fluid during pulmonary development leading to increased lung tissue stretch, increased cell proliferation, and accelerated lung growth. European colleagues have developed intrauterine endoscopic techniques (fetoscopy) to position and remove endoluminal tracheal balloons in utero (fetoscopic endotracheal occlusion = FETO). Recently, the Belgium group published summary results of FETO showing an improved survival in 175 patients with isolated left CDH from 24% to 49%. The goal of this pilot study is to study the feasibility of implementing FETO therapy in the most severe group of fetuses with left congenital diaphragmatic hernia (O/E LHR &lt; 25%).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>4. Study Procedures The FETO feasibility study is an un-blinded non-randomized single arm pilot study being conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Pregnant women will be screened for protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria and recruited based on these. Comprehensive fetal evaluations will be completed at the Johns Hopkins Center for Fetal Therapy to confirm eligibility. This includes an ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, a fetal echocardiogram and fetal genetic studies to identify cases with isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Once eligibility is confirmed, participation for FETO treatment will be offered. The voluntary nature of participation will be stressed throughout. Willingness and logistics of the participant to remain under supervision of the Center for Fetal Therapy at Johns Hopkins Hospital, while the fetal airway is occluded, will also be discussed in detail. Informed written consent will be obtained prior to any study related procedures. 1. Study design: Participants will undergo FETO with standardized preoperative, intraoperative, post-operative care and delivery. The procedure will be performed under local anesthesia with intravenous sedation or regional spinal/epidural (as done currently for shunts and laser procedures). Prophylactic tocolysis using indomethacin will begin preoperatively. Fetal analgesia and immobilization will consist of fentanyl, atropine and vecuronium. A 10 Fr cannula, 1.3 mm fetoscope within a 3.3 mm sheath (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany), and a detachable balloon occlusion (BALTACCI-BDPE, Balt, Montmorency, France) system will be used. Participants will receive intravenous magnesium sulfate for breakthrough labor and may be discharged on oral nifedipine to treat post intervention contractions. Serial ultrasound measurements of lung volume and LHR will begin within 24-48 hours following surgery and continue weekly. Amniotic fluid level and membrane status will also be monitored at weekly intervals. Ultrasonography for fetal growth will be performed every four weeks. All discharged participants and their support person need to remain within 30 minutes of the surgery center until delivery to permit standardized postoperative management. The social worker at the Center for Fetal Therapy will serve as the participant advocate and assist families in identifying subsidized appropriate accommodation as required. Participants will be on modified bed rest for the first 2 weeks post discharge, but subsequently allowed to graduate to moderate activity if the uterus is quiescent. Postoperative surveillance of fetal well-being will be performed weekly beginning at 28 weeks. At 34+0 to 34 weeks 6 days, participants will undergo removal of the tracheal balloon. Balloon retrieval can be either by in utero puncture by ultrasound-guided percutaneous needling or fetoscopic retrieval. Uncomplicated retrieval patients will be managed as an outpatient with weekly fetal monitoring until delivery. In the event there is a need for emergent balloon removal prior to 34 weeks due to the development of preterm labor, shortening of the cervix, preterm rupture of membranes, abnormally vigorous lung response or development of fetal hydrops, delivery by EXIT or cesarean section will be performed. If percutaneous puncture of balloon is unsuccessful prior to delivery, immediate bronchoscopy and establishment of airway will be performed. Maternal corticosteroids (betamethasone 12 mg intramuscularly and repeated once at 24 hours) will be administered 48 hours prior to fetoscopic balloon removal (due to risks of preterm delivery associated with instrumentation) or for impending preterm delivery. Timing for induction of labor at 37 weeks 0 days to 39 weeks 0 days will depend upon favorable status of the cervix. Cesarean section will be based upon standard obstetrical indications. In regards to postnatal care, a resuscitation team from neonatology and pediatric surgery will be present at delivery. A standardized protocol will be utilized for postnatal care, using lung protection strategy. While the primary end-points of the study are the demonstration of the feasibility and safety of FETO and neonatal survival at discharge continued follow-up of children until age 2 is planned as the current standard of care. These follow ups may include bronchoscopy, brain imaging, audiology examination, pulmonary function testing, chest radiograph and developmental assessment. 2. Study duration and number of visits: The feasibility study will be conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Recruitment will stop when approximately 20 families (mother, father/partner and child) have enrolled. It is expected that approximately 10 to 15 families (mother, father/partner and child) will be enrolled to produce 5 to 10 families available for evaluation. The study duration per mother and child will be up to 877 days, with up to 82 days screening, up to 55 days in the intervention phase, and 744 days in delivery and follow-up. The following details the standard of care and research procedures at each phase of the study. Screening Visit Potential subjects (pregnant women) will be screened for protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria. Standard of Care Procedures: - Comprehensive obstetrical ultrasound examination, including documentation of cervical length, gestational age, biometry, liver herniation, hepatic vasculature, sonographic lung volume, amniotic fluid level, membrane status, and LHR calculation - Fetal Echocardiogram to rule out structural abnormalities - Maternal MRI to confirm fetal liver herniation as required - Demographics/Medical History - Physical Examination including vital signs and maternal height &amp; weight - Laboratory tests including karyotyping and comparative genome hybridization to asses for fetal genetic syndromes. - Social evaluation to identify family support and possible confounding social issues - Patient Education including: CDH description, prenatal and neonatal development, general expected outcomes and management options Once evaluation confirms eligibility, the family will be offered enrollment.Informed consent will be obtained prior to any study related procedures begin. Research Procedures: No study procedures will be performed prior to obtaining voluntary informed consent. The social worker designated for the Center for Fetal Therapy has experience in accompanying the care of patients with a wide range of fetal anomalies that are referred to the Center for Fetal Therapy. She will serve as the patient advocate in this study. - Informed Consent. - Description of study rationale and design - Focused interview by the PI or designee to afford potential pregnant women the formal opportunity to examine what they have learned about the research study in the course of their evaluation and discuss how they feel about enrolling in the research study - Review of Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria - Clearance for surgery by anesthesia and the obstetrical staff Study Procedures following the screening visit The study procedure phase includes FETO surgery, and removal of the balloon: FETO Surgery (All Procedures are part of this research study) - FETO will be completed at 27 weeks 0 days - 29 weeks 6 days gestation. The procedure will be completed under ultrasound guidance along with maternal sedation, local anesthesia, and prophylactic tocolysis. Fetal analgesia and immobilization will consist of fentanyl, atropine and vecuronium. - A 10 Fr cannula, 1.2 mm fetoscope within a 3.0 mm sheath (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany), and a detachable balloon occlusion (BALTACCI-BDPE, Balt, Montmorency, France) system will be used. - The expected hospital course is 23-48 hours; however, it is possible that the patient will be hospitalized for complications or preterm labor. The patient will then be discharged to a nearby accommodation. - Assess possible adverse events - Physical examination of the mother including weight, vital signs - Laboratory tests - Preparation for surgery - Transvaginal ultrasound (within 24 hours of FETO balloon insertion procedure) It is standard of care to have all patients receiving fetal therapy that require delivery at Johns Hopkins Hospital transfer prenatal care to the Center for Fetal Therapy. For this study, pregnant woman will transfer care prior to the FETO procedure and social work will facilitate relocation to a radius of 30 minutes from Johns Hopkins Hospital while the balloon is in place and the fetus has an occluded airway. Pregnant women are expected to have a support person with them and will be instructed to travel by car or taxi directly to Johns Hopkins Hospital in the event of onset of labor or suspected preterm rupture of membranes. Weekly Check-ups (Balloon Insertion to Delivery) Standard of Care Procedures: - Medical record review - Fetal Surveillance by Doppler studies, assessment of amniotic fluid, growth and LHR measurement, fetal echocardiography. - Physical Exam, weight, vital signs, maternal urinalysis for proteinuria - Biophysical profiles (weekly beginning at 28 weeks) - Maternal MRI (Targeted MRI to assess the progress and growth of lung tissue prior to balloon removal) Research Procedures (Only performed while the balloon is in place): - Assess possible adverse events (performed at all Weekly check-ups) - Medical record review Removal of Balloon (All Procedures are part of this research study) - Removal of the balloon occlusion will be performed at 34 weeks 0 days to 34 weeks 6 days. - Physical examination, weight, vital Signs - Laboratory tests - Assess possible adverse events - Preparation for surgery - Clearance for surgery by anesthesia and the obstetrical staff. Anesthesia regional (spinal or epidural) in preparation for possible emergent delivery. - Maternal corticosteroids will be administered 48 hours prior to removal of balloon occlusion - Tocolysis nifedipine 20 mg preoperatively and then every 6 hours for 48 hours. Breakthrough contractions treated with increased dose of nifedipine or Magnesium sulfate. - Procedure - attempted percutaneous needle puncture followed by fetoscopic removal of balloon only if this is unsuccessful. Delivery Planned delivery will occur after 37 weeks. Timing for induction of labor at 37 weeks 0 days to 39 weeks 0 days will depend upon favorable status of the cervix. Cesarean section will be based upon standard obstetrical indications. Standard of Care Procedures: - For preterm labor before the balloon has been removed, pregnant woman will be admitted for tocolysis and attempt to prolong pregnancy. - For preterm labor that cannot be controlled before balloon removal, delivery by Ex Utero Intrapartum Therapy (EXIT), if maternally safe, may be performed. Emergent EXIT algorithms are in place and are currently used for fetuses with obstructed airways. These algorithms will be activated for mothers presenting in labor prior to planned EXIT delivery at Johns Hopkins Hospital. - For precipitous preterm labor or maternal indications when EXIT cannot be performed, cesarean delivery may be performed followed by immediate bronchoscopy and establishment of airway. - Delivery - Standard postnatal care Research Procedures: • Assess possible adverse events relating to FETO Follow-up Phase Follow-up will be conducted from birth to 24 months of age at which time the study will conclude. Consent to obtain information about the clinical course after the neonatal period will be obtained after birth. A resuscitation team from neonatology and pediatric surgery will be present at delivery. A standardized protocol will be utilized for postnatal care. Follow-up will may include bronchoscopy, brain imaging, audiology exams, pulmonary function testing, chest radiographs, and developmental assessment per the current standard of care for infants with CDH at Johns Hopkins Hospital.</detailed_description>
