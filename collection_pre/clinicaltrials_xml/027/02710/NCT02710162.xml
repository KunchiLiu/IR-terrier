	<brief_summary>Individuals with th Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis are at high risk for swallowing impairment (dysphagia) which leads to malnutrition, decreased pulmonary health, aspiration and aspiration pneumonia. These sequelae necessitate timely identification of at risk individuals to ensure optimal management of oral intake and pulmonary function. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the discriminant ability of several non-invasive screening tools at detecting swallowing impairment in individuals with ALS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Accurate Screening Tools for Dysphagia in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study is being performed to determine how accurate different screening tools or tests are at identifying swallowing problems associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). As a participant one evaluation will be performed at the University of Florida Swallowing Systems Core laboratory located at Shands Hospital, Gainesville will take place. This will take approximately two-hours. During this evaluation an videofluoroscopy (X-ray of swallowing), cough tests, tongue function test and questionnaires will be completed.</detailed_description>
