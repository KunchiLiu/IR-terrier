	<brief_title>The Pharmacogenetics of Optimal Warfarin Therapy in Chinese Patients After Heart Valve Replacement.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The dosing algorithm published by the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium hadn't been verifying by a standard randomized prospective study in Chinese patients after heart valve replacement. And, warfarin will affect people's coagulation, so that probably increase the drainage. We'll analyse the interaction of patients' PT-INR or drainge and oral warfarin dosing.</detailed_description>
