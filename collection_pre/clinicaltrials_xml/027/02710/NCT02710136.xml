	<brief_summary>This research is being done to look at the body's response to cockroach extract, an allergen, when sprayed into the nose. The spraying of the cockroach extract into the participant's nose is called Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a intranasal cockroach extract given to participants with asthma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cockroach Nasal Allergen Challenge Pilot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi‐center, open label pilot study to assess the safety and determine the feasibility of cockroach nasal allergen challenge in children with asthma. This pilot study will occur in two phases: - Phase 1 will enroll 10 cockroach sensitive adults with asthma who will undergo a nasal allergen challenge with increasing doses of cockroach allergen. Phase 1 will consist of two parts, Phase 1a and Phase 1b. In Phase 1a, participants will undergo a nasal allergen challenge. In Phase 1b, participants will undergo a repeat nasal allergen challenge to assess reproducibility of the NAC with cockroach allergen in a population with asthma. The data from Phase 1a will be used to identify a range of doses that is safe and elicits a threshold of nasal symptoms (TNSS ≥8). - Phase 2 will enroll 25 cockroach sensitive children with asthma ages 8‐14 years who will undergo a nasal allergen challenge using the dose range identified in Phase 1a. Study mandated procedures include: blood draws (venipuncture); pulmonary function testing (PFTs); nasal allergen challenge (NAC); allergen skin testing; and peak expiratory flow.</detailed_description>

Subjects who meet the following criteria are eligible for enrollment as study participants in Phase 1b after completion of Phase 1a: 1. Their asthma must be well controlled as defined by: 1. A FEV1 ≥ 80% predicted. 2. An Asthma Control Test (ACT) score ≥ 20. 2. The subject tolerated the Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC) during Phase 1a with no adverse events grade 2 or higher as determined by "Guidance for Industry: Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials (published September 2007) for local reactions to study procedures." Subjects not eligible for enrollment as study participants in Phase 1b after completion of Phase 1a if any of the following criteria are met: 1. Are pregnant or lactating. 2. Have an asthma severity classification of severe persistent, using the NAEPP classification, as evidenced by at least one of the following: 1. Require a dose of greater than 500 mcg of fluticasone per day or the equivalent of another inhaled corticosteroid. 2. Have received more than 2 courses of oral or parenteral corticosteroids within the last 12 months or one course within the last 3 months. 3. Have been treated with depot corticosteroids within the last 12 months. 4. Have been hospitalized for asthma within the 12 months prior to their participation in Phase1b. 5. Have had an emergency room visit for asthma within the 3 months prior to their participation in Phase 1b. 6. Have had a life‐threatening asthma exacerbation that required intubation, mechanical ventilation, or that resulted in a hypoxic seizure within 2 years prior to their participation in Phase 1b. 3. Have received allergen immunotherapy (SLIT or SCIT) in the last 12 months prior to their participation in Phase 1b. 4. Have previously been treated with anti‐IgE therapy in the 12 months prior to their participation in Phase 1b. 5. Are currently receiving oral or nasal antihistamines, nasal corticosteroids, nasal decongestants, nasal anticholinergics or cromolyn, which cannot be suspended for the required washout periods prior to the nasal allergen challenge in Phase 1b. 6. Have received an investigational drug in the 30 days prior to their participation in Phase 1b. 7. Have past or current medical problems or findings from physical examination or laboratory testing that are not listed above, which, in the opinion of the investigator, may pose additional risks from participation in the study, may interfere with the subject's ability to comply with study requirements or that may impact the quality or interpretation of the data obtained from the study. 8. Meet any of the Participant Stopping Rules and Withdrawal Criteria during Phase 1a The participant elected to withdraw consent from all future study activities, including followup.
