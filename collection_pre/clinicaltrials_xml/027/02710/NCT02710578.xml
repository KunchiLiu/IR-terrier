	<brief_title>Alcohol Effects on Driving-related Skills of Young Drivers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will examine the effects of an intoxicating dose of alcohol on driving-related skills among young drivers using driving simulator technology. This study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled mixed design study, including randomized between-subjects comparison of the effects of alcohol intoxication and both between- and within-subjects examination of acute and residual effects at approximately 24 and 48 hours following one-time alcohol administration. Initial contact with potential participants will be made by telephone, where study personnel will conduct a telephone screen for eligibility. Those telephone screened as eligible will attend CAMH for an eligibility assessment. Enrolled participants will complete four sessions on consecutive days: a practice day, an alcohol administration day, and a 24-hour and 48-hour post-alcohol session.</detailed_description>
