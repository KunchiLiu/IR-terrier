	<brief_summary>In Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) there is an imbalance between the levels of calcium and sodium in the muscles cells which is thought to be important in the damage which occurs overtime. Sodium/proton type 1 exchanger (NHE-1) inhibition is an innovative pathway that has proved to efficiently prevent the accumulation of muscle damage (inflammation and fibrosis) in animal models of muscular dystrophies and heart failure. Based on prior safety and efficacy results in animal and humans, NHE-1 inhibition with Rimeporide represents a new therapeutic approach with no restriction on age and on genetic subtypes which could be combined to other treatments that restore or augment dystrophin.This study examines the safety and tolerability and effects on the muscles of rimeporide, in patients aged 6 to 14 years with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rimeporide in Patients With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed as a phase Ib, multicenter, european, open label study to evaluate the safety and tolerability and biomarkers of a new drug, rimeporide, in boys aged 6 to 14 years with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Rimeporide will be taken orally for 4 weeks, three times a day. Dose will be adapted to body weight. The study will enrol 20 patients with DMD, aged 6 to 14 years. 4 dose levels will be tested, in 4 different cohorts with 5 patients taking the drug at each dose level. During the study, there will be 6 visits in the Hospital over a maximum of 10 weeks. At each visit, patients will undergo safety examinations including vital signs, physical and neurological examinations, ECG, safety and hematology, biochemistry and urinalysis, concomitant treatments review, and any symptoms and side effects review. In addition, blood samples will be withdrawn for the evaluation of Rimeporide in plasma. Finally, additional blood &amp; urine samples will be collected to explore efficacy markers. Patients will also undergo 2 NMR (at screening and End of study) to develop non invasive biomarkers for further investigations in DMD patients. The decision to progress to the next higher dose will be made after safety and tolerability data are reviewed for the preceding dose for 5 patients by SMC and determined that it is safe to proceed to the next dose level.</detailed_description>
