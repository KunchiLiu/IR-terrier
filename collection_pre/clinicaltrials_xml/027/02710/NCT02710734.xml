	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate a bladder preserving approach for patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer using neoadjuvant accelerated Methotrexate, Vinblastine, Doxorubicin, and Cisplatin (AMVAC) followed by chemoradiation with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and Mitomycin C. Patients will have maximal transurethral resection, followed by three cycles of AMVAC. Once AMVAC is complete, patients will have a second maximal transurethral resection, then chemoradiation with IMRT and 5-FU and Mitomycin C, followed by a third maximal transurethral resection. Tolerability and efficacy will be evaluated with physical exams, adverse event assessments, quality of life questionnaires, labs, and CT/bone scans. Patients will be followed until 5 years status post completion of therapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female patients ≥18 years. Primary urothelial or predominantly urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Histologic evidence of muscularis propria invasion. AJCC27 clinical stage T2T4a . No radiographic evidence of lymph node positivity (N0) or metastatic disease (M0). Clinical lymphadenopathy on staging CT greater than 1.5 cm in short axis must be biopsy proven negative. ECOG performance status 0, 1, or 2. Left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 50% by MUGA or ECHO within 6 months of study entry. Normal organ and bone marrow function as defined: Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL Total bilirubin ≤ institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X institutional ULN Creatinine Creatinine Clearance ≥ 50 mL/min (calculated using the CockroftGault formula or measured with 24 hour urine collection) Any component of small cell histology. Prior pelvic radiation therapy or patients who have undergone prior radiation to greater than or equal to 25% of the bone marrow within the past year are excluded due to risk of life threatening myelosuppression Prior systemic chemotherapy; patients who have received any previous systemic chemotherapy or radiation therapy for urothelial carcinoma or cytotoxic chemotherapy for another malignancy within 1 year of study entry are ineligible. Prior or concurrent malignancy of any other site except for nonmelanoma skin cancer, unless disease free interval ≥ 5 years. Patients who have received experimental agents within 4 weeks of study entry. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to Methotrexate, Vinblastine, Adriamycin or Cisplatin or other agents used in the study Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection (defined by current oral or intravenous antibiotic therapy), symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Pregnant women are excluded from this study due to the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Known HIVpositive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with cytotoxic chemotherapy. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrowsuppressive therapy. Patients with hydronephrosis that has not been addressed with an intervention such as placement of a stent. Pregnancy &amp; Women of Childbearing Potential</criteria>
