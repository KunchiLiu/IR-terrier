	<brief_summary>Duavee is a hormone receptor modulator that has been approved for the treatment of menopausal symptoms in menopausal women. The goal of this 8-week randomized, double blind, placebo controlled pilot study, is to determine whether this medication alleviates menopausal symptoms in women with MS. The investigators will secondarily determine whether addressing menopausal symptoms ameliorates MS symptoms and, on MRIs, is not triggering worsening inflammation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A TSEC for Symptom Management in Menopausal Women With Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Menopause in MS. Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects 3 times more women than men, and before age 50 in about 90% cases, i.e. prior to menopause. There is broad evidence for hormonal regulation of MS in animal models and in clinical cohorts. Around menopause, many clinical patients report symptom worsening associated with hot flashes, sleep disturbance or mood changes. Additionally, individuals at MS may be at increased risk of developing osteoporosis. Longer-term, an age-related decline in gonadal steroids might represent one sex-specific influence on the known age-related increases in disability and conversion to progressive course, which is marked by accelerated brain volume loss and neurodegeneration. Recent data suggest that MS disease severity may worsen after menopause. - Hormone therapy (HT). In healthy women, after the abrupt decline in estradiol occurring with early oophorectomy, there is an increased risk for cognitive decline and dementia and gray matter (GM) loss in functionally important regions (e.g. hippocampus). Hormonal therapy (HT), when taken within a perimenopausal "window of opportunity" (5 years), may protect against neurodegeneration. Despite the benefits of HT (menopausal symptoms, bone density), very few women (&lt;30% of our cohort) are currently taking HT for menopausal symptoms; this is a result of risks such as (1) breast and endometrial cancer, and (2) stroke in older women in the Women's Health Initiative. To date, there are no objective assessments of the impact of HT on MS disease course. - Study Drug. Duavee, a tissue selective estrogen complex (TSEC), combines conjugated estrogens (CE) with the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) bazedoxifene (BZA). BZA offsets estrogenic stimulation of endometrial and breast tissue, and CE 0.45mg/BZA 20mg is approved for menopausal symptom (hot flash) relief and osteoporosis prevention, with a favorable tolerability and safety profile. Additionally, two recent randomized clinical trials of estrogenic compounds in MS [estriol (Voskuhl et al) and of ethinylestradiol 40 μg and desogestrel 125 μg (Pozzili et al 2015) found either a neutral or beneficial effect on inflammatory outcomes. Altogether, these findings suggest that CE+BZA may be a promising and safe agent in MS. In the current study, 24 women with MS and who are experiencing bothersome menopause symptoms will be enrolled and randomized to receive either 8 weeks of Duavee or 8 weeks of placebo. Visits will be: eligibility, baseline, and 2 month visit.</detailed_description>
