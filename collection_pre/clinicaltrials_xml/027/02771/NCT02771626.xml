	<brief_title>Study CB-839 in Combination With Nivolumab in Patients With ccRCC and Other Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is an open-label Phase 1/ 2 evaluation of CB-839 in combination with nivolumab in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and non-small cell lung cancer. During Phase 1, patients will be enrolled into escalating dose cohorts to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). In Phase 2, patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and non-small cell lung cancer will be enrolled into separate cohorts. All patients will be assessed for safety, pharmacokinetics, biomarkers and tumor response.</detailed_description>
