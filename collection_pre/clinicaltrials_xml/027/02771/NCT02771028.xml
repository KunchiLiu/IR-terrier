	<brief_summary>In this trial the investigators aim to establish whether Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) can reduce cognitive complaints in cancer survivors. All consenting patients aged 18 years or above, who have been diagnosed with a solid tumour of hematologic malignancy and who have completed or are in the late phase of a chemotherapy, radiotherapy, anti-hormonal or targeted therapy treatment, can participate in this trial. Patients should suffer from subjective cognitive complaints based on a score of 43 or more on the Cognitive Failure Questionnaire (CFQ). These patients will be randomly assigned to either the control or intervention group. Patients in the intervention group will be scheduled to receive an 8-week EFT intervention program. Other patients will be placed on an 8-week wait list after which patients will also start the EFT program.</brief_summary>
