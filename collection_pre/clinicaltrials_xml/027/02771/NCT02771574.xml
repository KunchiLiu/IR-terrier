	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous exendin (9-39) in subjects with post-bariatric hypoglycemia. Development of this subcutaneous formulation of exendin (9-39) would represent a targeted therapeutic approach for this rare disease with unmet clinical need.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Subcutaneous Exendin (9-39) in Patients With Post Bariatric Hypoglycemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-Bariatric Hypoglycemia (PBH) is a rare, but increasingly reported disease occurring after bariatric surgery, characterized by severe hypoglycemic episodes accompanied by symptoms of hypoglycemia. At the moment, no medical therapies have been developed for this disorder, but the clinical need is great. The major contributory factor is thought to be an exaggerated secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) due to altered nutrient transit after bariatric surgery. GLP-1 is an incretin hormone secreted primarily by the distal ileum that contributes to postprandial glucose regulation. Exendin (9-39) is a specific GLP-1 receptor antagonist, that when given via continuous IV infusion, has been shown to effectively prevent postprandial hypoglycemia and reduce symptoms of hypoglycemia in patients with PBH. This study is designed to assess the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic profile of a novel subcutaneous formulation of exendin (9-39).</detailed_description>
