	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, randomized, open-label, parallel-group comparative, exploratory study to evaluate the effect of trelagliptin administered at a dose of 100 mg once weekly or alogliptin administered at a dose of 25 mg once daily for 4 weeks on glycemic variation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Exploratory Study to Evaluate the Effects of Trelagliptin and Alogliptin by CGM on Glucose Variability for One Week With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of trelagliptin administered orally at a dose of 100 mg once weekly or alogliptin administered orally at a dose of 25 mg once daily for 4 weeks on glycemic variation in an exploratory manner and as preliminary to examine the influence of the once-weekly administration and blood glucose fluctuations due to the difference in the daily administration in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</detailed_description>
