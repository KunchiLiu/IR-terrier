	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test experimental human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccines that use an adenovirus vector. The adenovirus vector may help the vaccines stimulate an immune response. Researchers want to see how the immune system will respond to these vaccines as well as if they are safe to give to people. Participants cannot get HIV from these vaccines. However, researchers also want to see if the vaccine's adenovirus is contagious. Adenoviruses cause cold symptoms or mild eye infections, therefore household and intimate contacts will be asked to participate as well.</brief_summary>

NonHIV experimental vaccine(s) received within the last 5 years in a prior vaccine trial. Exceptions may be made for vaccines that have subsequently undergone licensure by the FDA. For volunteers who have received control/placebo in an experimental vaccine trial, the HVTN 110 PSRT will determine eligibility on a casebycase basis.
