	<brief_summary>AML is the most common acute leukemia in adults. Most patients can undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation as a possible cure; however, many patients are not candidates for allogeneic transplant due to age, overall health, psychosocial factors, and/or lack of available donors. Therefore, these patients are unable to receive the therapeutic benefits of the "graft-versus-leukemia" effect of donor immune cells. The aim of this study is to hopefully break immune tolerance to AML cells to provide better outcomes in patients with non-favorable risk AML.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lymphodepletion and Anti-PD-1 Blockade to Reduce Relapse in AML Patient Not Eligible for Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-favorable risk AML patients will undergo a preparative regimen of lymphodepletion of Flu/Mel followed by autologous transplantation. Anti-PD-1 therapy of pembrolizumab will begin on Day +1 following stem cell transplantation and will be administered every 3 weeks for a total of 8 doses. According to the literature, the risk of 2-year relapse is estimated to be 60-80% in patients with non-favorable risk AML in CR-1. With this protocol, investigators hypothesize that following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and pembrolizumab, the 2-year relapse risk will decrease to less than or equal to 35%. The one-sided Wald test at 5% significance level will be used to test the hypothesis. The size of 20 patients yields the power of 90.5% assuming that the actual 2-year leukemia-free survival is 60%.</detailed_description>
