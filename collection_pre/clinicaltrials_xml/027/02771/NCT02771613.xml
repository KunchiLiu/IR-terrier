	<brief_summary>After implementing a French version of a trigger tool validated for computerized detection of adverse events in patient's medical record, the study will be performed in three parallel randomized arms of three identical departments (each steaming from 6 types of medical, surgical or obstetrical departments with a total of 18 departments involved). This three arms will be: no intervention, education of department's staff by multi professional in situ simulation (adapted to the discovered adverse events), or simple but large diffusion of results and decisions of Morbidity Mortality Reviews. The interventions will be performed during a two-years period.</brief_summary>
