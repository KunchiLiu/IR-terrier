	<brief_summary>People with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) often take several medicines to control HIV. Dolutegravir and darunavir boosted with cobicistat are HIV medicines that people may take. They may also need to take medicines for an infection called latent tuberculosis (TB). Researchers think a once-weekly treatment for latent TB would be easier for people with HIV to take. This once weekly treatment consists of two drugs: rifapentine and isoniazid. However, they need to see how TB drugs and HIV drugs interact. Objective: To learn how anti-HIV and anti-TB drugs affect each other so that people taking these drugs together can be treated safely. Eligibility: Healthy adults ages 18 65. Design: Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will have vital signs taken and give a blood sample. Women will have a pregnancy test. Participants cannot take any other medicines during the study, including vitamins. Only occasional, infrequent use of acetaminophen (Tylenol , max 2000 mg/day), ibuprofen (Motrin or Advil ), naproxen (Aleve ), loperamide (Imodium ), and/or antihistamines (such as Benadryl , Zyrtec , Claritin , etc.) will be allowed. Participants will be assigned to one of three groups. Each group will take a different study drug, once or twice a day, for 19 23 days. At the baseline study visit, they will get a supply of the study drug tablets and instructions for taking them. Participants will keep a medicine diary to serve as a memory aid for taking medicine and reporting any side effects that they may experience. Participants will have 8 or 9 study visits over about 40 days. The number of visits depends on which group the person is assigned to. All visits will take place at the NIH Clinical Center. Participants will fast before study visits. The baseline visit will last about 2 3 hours. There will be 3-4 long visits that will last for about 12 hours. The other 4-5 visits will last about 1 hour. During all study visits, screening procedures will be repeated. During long visits, an intravenous (IV) line will be inserted into an arm vein with a needle. It will be used to take blood.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Once-Weekly Rifapentine and Isoniazid on the Steady State Pharmacokinetics of Dolutegravir and Darunavir Boosted With Cobicistat in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rifapentine (RPT) is a long-acting rifamycin that can be used weekly with isoniazid (INH) as a first-line regimen in the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Although this regimen offers several potential benefits, the use of weekly RPT plus INH is not currently recommended in adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) due to limited evidence on drug interactions with antiretrovirals (ARVs). Dolutegravir (DTG) and darunavir boosted with cobicistat (DRV/c) comprise parts of first-line and alternative treatment regimens, respectively, recommended for the treatment of HIV. However, drug interactions between these ARV agents and RPT are of concern. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the effects of concomitant RPT and INH administration on the steady state PK of DTG and DRV/c. This is an open-label, fixed sequence, intrasubject drug-drug interaction study designed to evaluate the steady state PK of DTG and DRV/c with coadministration of once weekly RPT and INH given at doses used to treat LTBI. Up to three study arms will be examined: DTG once daily (Arm A), DRV/c once daily (Arm B), and DTG twice daily (Arm C). Arm B will begin recruitment following the completion of Arm A. Arm C will only be conducted if Arm A results reveals that it may be necessary. Arms A and B will be comprised of two phases: (1) DTG or DRV/c once daily alone (days 1-4) and (2) DTG or DRV/c once daily + (RPT and INH) once weekly (days 5-19). Arm C will be comprised of three phases: (1) DTG once daily alone (days 1-4), (2) DTG twice daily alone (days 5-8), and (3) DTG twice daily + (RPT and INH) once weekly (days 9-23). Participants in Arms A and B will undergo periodic serial ARV PK blood draws on days 4, 14, and 19, with a single trough draw on Day 17 or 18. Arm C participants will have PK blood draws on day 4, 8, 18, and 23, with a single trough draw on Day 21 or 22. DTG and DRV/c PK parameters will be determined using non-compartmental methods. Cobicistat levels will only be assessed if DRV concentrations are significantly decreased in Arm B. The following PK parameters will be compared between phases: area under the curve over the dosing interval, maximum plasma concentration, time to maximum plasma concentration, terminal half-life, apparent oral clearance, and minimum plasma concentration. Adverse events will be graded and recorded.</detailed_description>
