	<brief_summary>Prolonged extracorporeal circulation (ECC) for cardiac surgery results in coagulation abnormalities, most of which related to the direct, time dependent effect of the polymer tubing and the pump rollers on the thrombocytes. Significant evidence demonstrates the effect of the duration of cardiopulmonary bypass on thrombocytes number and function, as well as on postoperative coagulopathy</brief_summary>
