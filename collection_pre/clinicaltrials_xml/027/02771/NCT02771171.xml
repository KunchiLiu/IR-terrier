	<brief_summary>CT and MRI based measurements of the pediatric airway has changed the age-old cone shape concept of the pediatric airway and define airway shape as elliptical structure. The cone shape was based on the cadaveric measurements done by Bayeux in 1897 and described later by Eckenhoff in 1951. The present study is based on three-dimensional CT images of the airway column replicating the cylinders used by Bayeux for his cadaveric measurements. The purpose of this study was to determine the cone shape of the pediatric airway.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a retrospective review of three-dimensional CT air column images of 60 children aged 1 month to 8 years undergoing radiological evaluation unrelated to airways symptomatology. The CT scans will be evaluated in children either sleeping naturally or sedated throughout the study period. Volumetric analysis of the air-column was done at the level of cricoid, subglottis and trachea Exclusion Criteria: Patients with a tracheostomy or endotracheal tube in place, tracheo-esophageal fistula, pulmonary collapse or atelectasis, mediastinal mass, diaphragmatic hernia, extrapulmonary and intrathoracic mass, preterm infants, and patients with genetic syndromes and primary lung diseases. Patients with poor image quality were also excluded from the study.</detailed_description>
