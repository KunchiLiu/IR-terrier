	<brief_summary>Introduction Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a severe complication to hip arthroplasty for femoral neck fractures (FNF). Debridement, antibiotics and implant retention (DAIR) is recommended in early PJI in association with stable implants. Few studies have evaluated the outcome of DAIR in this fragile population.The purpose of this study was to analyze risk factors for PJI and the short-term outcome of DAIR in FNF patients treated with a hip arthroplasty. Methods A consecutive series of patients had been treated with either a total hip arthroplasty or a hemi hip arthroplasty for a displaced FNF at our institution. Data were retrospective analysed.</brief_summary>
