	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate efficacy, including effects on inflammation by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessments, of secukinumab on Achilles tendon enthesitis for up to 1 year with a primary focus at Week 24, in patients with active Psoriatic Arthritis and axial Spondyloarthritis despite current or previous non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and/or disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Patients with Psoriatic arthritis: Diagnosis of Psoriatic arthritis as per the Classification criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR criteria) with symptoms for at least 6 months and active Psoriatic arthritis as assessed by &gt; 1 tender joints out of 78 and &gt; 1 swollen joints out of 76 at Baseline (dactylitis of a digit counts as one joint each). Patients with Axial Spondyloarthritis: Diagnosis of Axial Spondyloarthritis as per the classification of the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society axial Spondyloarthritis (ASAS) criteria and objective signs of inflammation at Screening (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or definite radiographic sacroilitis and/or abnormal CReactive Protein) and active disease assessed by total Bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index (BASDAI) ≥ 4 (010) at Baseline. Diagnosis of Achilles tendon enthesitis according to swelling and tenderness at the insertional site of the Achilles tendon into the calcaneus. Onset of heel pain ≥ 1 month up to 5 years at Baseline. Heel enthesitis that is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)positive according to the investigator`s judgement. Patients who are Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitornaive. Key Chest Xray or chest magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with evidence of ongoing infectious or malignant process. Previous exposure to secukinumab or other biologic drug directly targeting Interleukin (IL)17 or Interleukin (IL)17 receptor. Ongoing use of psoriasis treatments / medications (e.g. topical corticosteroids, ultraviolet (UV) therapy) at randomization. Patients who have previously been treated with Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors (investigational or approved). Patients who have ever received biologic immunomodulating agents (investigational or approved). Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women. History of ongoing, chronic or recurrent infectious disease or evidence of tuberculosis infection. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
