	<brief_summary>Cerebral energy metabolism declines with advanced aging, and is implicated in age-related cognitive decline, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and other forms of neurodegenerative disease (Parkinson's disease). In addition, age-associated increase in systemic and neuroinflammation is associated with a higher likelihood for development of Alzheimer's disease and neurodegenerative disease in older adults. Furthermore, decreased cerebral energy metabolism and increased neuroinflammation are both associated with deficits in cognitive function, even in the absence of neurodegenerative disease. In older adults, decreased cognition is strongly associated with the development of AD, increased rates of hospitalization, loss of functional independence, and increased mortality rate. Novel methods for preventing cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases in older adults are needed the world's aging population. Current research suggests that nutrients in fruits and vegetables produce strong anti-oxidant and anti-proliferative effects. Most Americans are not consuming the minimum recommendations of fruits and vegetables per day to receive these benefits. Whole food-based nutritional products, such as Fermented Papaya Product (FPP), may provide a healthy alternative for individuals. FPP, which is made by bio-fermentation of Carica papaya, has been found to enhance antioxidant protection and to decrease DNA damage in healthy older adults. Furthermore, if FPP increases cerebral energy metabolism and down-regulates neuroinflammation, with resulting effects on cognition, dietary supplementation with FPP may have preventative benefits for age-related cognitive conditions, including MCI, AD, Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficient Brain Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The design of this research study is to conduct a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study to determine whether FPP improves cerebral energy metabolism, neuroinflammation, systemic inflammation, cognitive function, fatigue, and health-related quality of life in older adults. Potential participants will participate in a brief 10 minute phone screening that will describe the study. If participants meet initial inclusion/exclusion criteria on the phone screen, they will be scheduled for an in-person screening visit. Participants will attend five (5) in person visits including one Screening Visit performed individually for each potential study participant, and four Assessment Visits (V1-V4). Participants will be asked to provide a fasting blood sample that will be utilized to evaluate clinical laboratory parameters at the Screening visit and all four assessment visits. The participants will complete both a treatment and a placebo condition; therefore, a cross-over design will be used. After eight (8) weeks on each of these regimens, participants will be asked to complete post-treatment outcome assessments at the University of Florida's Institute on Aging - Clinical and Translational Research Building (IOA - CTRB). Following the first post-treatment test day (V2), participants will complete a six (6) week washout period and will then return to the IOA - CTRB to complete the other study arm. The order the participants receive FPP and placebo will be determined through randomization</detailed_description>
