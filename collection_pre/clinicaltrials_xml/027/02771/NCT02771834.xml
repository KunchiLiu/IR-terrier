	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Association Between Osteoporosis and Postural Balance in Postmenopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall objective of this study is to evaluate bipodal postural balance in postmenopausal women with and without lumbar osteoporosis. The specific objective is to determine the relationship between the degree of thoracic kyphosis and dosing of 25 OH vitamin D with postural balance in postmenopausal women with lumbar osteoporosis. One hundred and twenty-six postmenopausal women between 55-65 years of age were evaluated and separated into two groups according to the bone mineral density values of their lumbar spine: the osteoporosis group and the control group. Functional mobility was evaluated through the Timed Up and Go Test. Postural balance was evaluated using a AccuSway® model portable force platform, in standard standing position, with eyes open and closed, for 60". Data were collected, stored, and processed by the Balance Clinic® program, configured to 100 Hz frequency, with a frequency cut-off filter at 10 Hz. Muscle strength was evaluated via a Biodex® isokinetic dynamometer in the concentric/concentric knee extension mode at 60o/s. Dosing of 25 OH vitamin D and thoracic spine x-rays to determine the degree of kyphosis measured by the Cobb angle were performed in the osteoporosis group.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>absence of impairment of the vestibular, proprioceptive, auditory or neurological system, and/or any mental disturbances or disorders; no use of medications that might compromise postural balance; absence of lesions, surgery or disease that might have caused lowerlimb joint limitations over the previous six months; absence of lowerlimb dysmetria; presence of clinically normal gait, without claudication. the presence of pain or inability to complete any of the tests along with occurrences of blood pressure increase before the strength evaluation.</criteria>
