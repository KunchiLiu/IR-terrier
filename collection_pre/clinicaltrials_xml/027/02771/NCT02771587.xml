	<brief_summary>The main objective of the project is to assess whether there is an interaction between the effects of ethanol and energy drinks on driving performance. Secondary objectives include: to evaluate subjective effects (drunkenness) after administration of alcohol and energy drinks, to assess pharmacokinetics of alcohol, caffeine and taurine after alcohol and energy drinks administration and to assess if there is an increased risk of bleeding when both drinks are taken together.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interaction of Alcohol With Energy Drinks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consumption of energy drinks improve psychomotor performance and alertness. These drinks contain mostly caffeine, taurine and vitamins. Its consumption associated with ethanol may reduce feelings of drunkenness as the stimulant effects of caffeine could counteract the depressing effects of ethanol on the central nervous system. Reducing the perception of intoxication may predispose the intoxicated person to engage in risky behaviors such as driving under the influence of ethanol and therefore can increase the risk of a traffic accident. Furthermore, the combination of both beverages may increase the risk of bleeding in case of injury as anticoagulant effects have been described for ethanol while antiplatelet effects have been described for caffeine and taurine. A randomized clinical trial will be performed in healthy volunteers administering 4 treatment conditions: alcohol+energy drink, alcohol+placebo of energy drink, placebo of alcohol+energy drink and placebo of alcohol+placebo of energy drink. A multiple dose will be administered separated by 1 hour.</detailed_description>

Single doses of symptomatic drugs taken during the week before the experimental session will not constitute an exclusion criterion if it can be assumed that it has been completely eliminated on the day of the experimental session Smokers of &gt;5 cigarettes/day Consumption of &gt;20 g/day of alcohol (females) or of &gt;40 g/day (males) Daily consumption of more than 5 coffees, teas, cola drinks or other stimulant or xanthinecontaining beverages in the 3 months prior to inclusion in the study Hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency viruspositive individuals Pregnant or lactating women, or those using hormonal or unreliable contraceptive methods during the study period.
