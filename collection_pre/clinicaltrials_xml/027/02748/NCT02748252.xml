	<brief_summary>With aging of the persons living with HIV, cardiovascular diseases now account for substantial mortality and morbidity. Stroke frequency grows exponentially with aging and its incidence doubles every decade over 55 years of age. The prognosis of ischemic stroke depends mainly on the care in Stroke Units in the acute phase of the disease (thrombolysis/thrombectomy). It is important that HIV patients are referred to these units in the first hours of a stroke and not to their infectious disease units which is a loss of chance. It would also be important to know whether HIV patients need specific protocols for stroke emergency management. The study aims to compare the functional prognosis after the first occurrence of an ischemic stroke, in patients admitted to a Stroke Unit, whether they are infected or not infected by HIV.</brief_summary>
