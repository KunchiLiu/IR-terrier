	<brief_title>Application of Two Anti-angiogenesis Drugs Combined With Chemotherapy in Advanced Colorectal Cancer Under the Background of Precision Medical</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endostar have anti-tumor activity by against vascular endothelial growth factor. Thalidomide is a therapeutic for insomnia and vomiting. It is also used for tumor treatment as an Anti-angiogenesis drug and immune regulator in recently years. 1. Evaluated the therapeutic effects and survival benefits of ACRC treatment by using the Endostar and Thalidomide combined with XELOX regimens. (including the RR, DCR, PFS, and QOL); 2. Evaluated the security and tolerance by treating with Endostar and Thalidomide (the occurrence of adverse reaction, the degree, the regularity and control measures, etc.); 3. Detected the histological markers (VEGF/VEGFR, PDGF/PDGFR, BFGF/FGFR, cox-2, Her-2, K-Ras and p53) before the patients into the group. Make a retrospective analysis of individual molecules indicators to guide significant therapy of ACRC.</detailed_description>
