	<brief_title>Congenital Cataract Morphological Classifications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lens opacities in congenital cataracts have a wide range of presentations.Therefore, it is important to find a method of recording, classifying and monitoring cataract morphologies that is feasible and safe in a large cohort of children with congenital cataracts, including uncooperative children. Photography is considered as one of the most important means to promote evidence-based medical practice in pediatric ophthalmology. In this study, the investigators studied congenital cataract morphological classifications and monitoring using slit-lamp-adapted anterior segmental photography and evaluated its safety and feasibility in pediatric cataract patients registered in the Childhood Cataract Program of the Chinese Ministry of Health.</detailed_description>
