	<brief_title>Implementation Study of Enhanced Medication Therapy Management in Primary Care Practice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aim of this study is to implement a Medication Therapy Management (MTM) service in primary care that is enhanced by the incorporation of pharmacogenomics (PGx) and medication risk mitigation (MRM) factor technology and is standardized by a systematic approach to evidence- and personalized-based medicine. The primary objective is to implement the systematic approach to delivering an enhanced MTM service in a primary care setting. Secondary objectives include: determine how successful the communication between prescriber and pharmacist is within implementing the service, determine how PGx testing can be incorporated into primary care prescribers' daily work flow, determine if patients are receptive to PGx testing, determine how satisfied prescribers are with an enhanced MTM clinical service and their confidence to conduct on their own, and determine if enhanced MTM optimizes or changes drug therapy for patients.</detailed_description>
