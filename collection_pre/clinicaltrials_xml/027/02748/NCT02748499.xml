	<brief_title>Healthy Beat Accupunch (HBA) Exercise Program for Community Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I: A cluster randomized controlled trial will be used to test the effects of a six-month, instructor-led Healthy Beat Accupunch (HBA) exercise program on the perceived health status and sleep quality of the community-dwelling older adults. Through the use of convenience sampling strategy, eight community care stations with approximately 240 older adults in Kaohsiung will be recruited and randomly assigned based on their community care stations to a HBA experimental group or a wait-list control group. Participants in the experimental group will receive the HBA exercise program led by trained and certified instructors, three times per week, 40 minutes per practice for six months; participants in the wait-list control group will continue with their regular daily activities. One pre-test and two post-tests, three months apart, will be conducted. Phase II: Using the same method as in the phase I, participants from the phase I will continue practicing the HBA exercise program, but guided by a DVD, for another six months. The feasibility, compliance, and effectiveness of the DVD-led HBA exercise program on the community-dwelling older adults will be tested, and another two post-tests, three months apart, will be conducted on the same outcome measurements as in the phase I.</detailed_description>
