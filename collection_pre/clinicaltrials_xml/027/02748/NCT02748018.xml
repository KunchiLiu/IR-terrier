	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the Hybrid Closed Loop system (HCL) in adult and pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes in the home setting. A diverse population of patients with type 1 diabetes will be studied. The study population will have a large range for duration of diabetes and glycemic control, as measured by glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C). They will be enrolled in the study regardless of their prior diabetes regimen, including using Multiple Daily Injections (MDI), Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) or Sensor-Augmented Pump therapy (SAP)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-center Trial in Adult and Pediatric Patients With Type 1 Diabetes Using Hybrid Closed Loop System at Home</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 6 month, multi-center, randomized, parallel, adaptive study in type 1 diabetes with a 6 month continuation period. The study will have three periods: 1. Run-in Period: The run-in period can be up to 60 days during which time a blinded CGM sensor will be worn for two weeks. 2. Study Period: There will be a 6 month randomized study period with two arms: The HCL system and Control. 3. Continuation Period: There will be a 6 month continuation period during which time all subjects will use the HCL system with Auto Mode. Up to 1500 subjects will be enrolled in order to have 1000 subjects complete the study. Up to 70 investigational Centers in the US and Canada, as well as in the Medtronic EMEA region, that is comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, will be enrolled.</detailed_description>

Subjects who are determined by the investigator to be psychologically sound in order to successfully participate in this study 5. Subject has been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for at least three months Note: Determination of classification for diabetes will be based on American Diabetes Association Clinical Practice Guidelines accounting for several patient characteristics such as: age of onset, patient's weight or BMI, history of diabetic ketoacidosis, history of therapy management, and medical records if available. 6. Subject must be on one of the following management therapies: Multiple daily injections defined by use of rapid analogue with meals and long acting analogue (i.e. detemir or glargine), without CGM Insulin pump therapy with or without CGM 7.

Subject must be able to speak and be literate in English 12. If subject has celiac disease, it has been adequately treated as determined by the investigator 13. Subject with the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass surgery, coronary artery stenting, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, angina, congestive heart failure, ventricular rhythm disturbances or thromboembolic disease, within 1 year of screening, will be included in the study with the consent of the subject's cardiologist 14.

Humalog® (insulin lispro injection) 2. NovoLog® (insulin aspart) 1. Subject is on MDI with concurrent CGM therapy for at least 3 months prior to Screening 2. Subject participated in any Closed Loop study in the past. 3. Subject is unable to tolerate tape adhesive in the area of sensor placement 4. Subject has any unresolved adverse skin condition in the area of sensor placement (e.g., psoriasis, rash, Staphylococcus infection) or area of infusion set placement 5. Women of childbearing potential who have a positive pregnancy test at screening or plan to become pregnant during the course of the study 6. Subject is being treated for hyperthyroidism at time of screening 7. Subject has an abnormality (out of upper reference range, as processed by Central Lab) in creatinine at time of screening visit 8. Subject has an abnormality (out of reference range, as processed by Central Lab) in thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH) at time of screening visit 9. Subject has taken any oral, injectable, or IV steroids within 8 weeks from time of screening visit, or plans to take any oral, injectable, or IV steroids during the course of the study. (Subjects may be rescreened after 1 month if they fail this exclusion criteria) 10. Subject is actively participating in an investigational study (drug or device) wherein he/she has received treatment from an investigational study drug or investigational study device in the last 2 weeks 11. Subject has been hospitalized or has visited the emergency room in the 6 months prior to screening resulting in a primary diagnosis of uncontrolled diabetes (i.e. diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) except if this is related to a new diagnosis. 12.
