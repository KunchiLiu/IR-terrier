	<brief_summary>This will be a single-center, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group study to investigate the platelet inhibition of Ticagrelor versus Clopidogrel with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) as background therapy in approximate 40 patients with stable coronary artery disease (SCAD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) after recent successful elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) by evaluation of the P2Y12 reaction unit (PRU) by VerifyNow P2Y12 assay at 2-4 hours after the first study drug dose on treatment day 15±2.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Platelet Inhibition of Ticagrelor Versus Clopidogrel in Type 2 Diabetic Patients After Elective Percutaneous Coronary Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will consist of a screening period, a 15±2 day treatment period, and a 7 day follow-up period. The screening period will be up to 7 days. Once each patient has signed the informed consent, the eligibility of the patient will be determined at screening, and laboratory assessments will be taken (Visit 1). During the treatment period, patients participating in the study will be randomized to receive either Ticagrelor with ASA, or Clopidogrel with ASA for 15±2 days. The final dose of study medication will be administered at the study site in the morning of day 15±2. Study visits at the beginning (Visit 2) and the end of the treatment period (Visit 4) will allow assessment of platelet function. At 7±1 days after Visit 2, a telephone visit (Visit 3) will be carried out for collection of information on concomitant medication, adverse events (including vascular events), and safety end point events. After the platelet function tests at Visit 4 are finished, patients in both groups will discontinue their study medication (end of treatment, EOT). A follow-up period will begin at 1 day after Visit 4 and continue for 7 days. During the follow-up period, patients in Ticagrelor group will take Clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose on the first day, followed by Clopidogrel 75 mg maintenance dose from the second day for 6 days; patients in Clopidogrel group will continue taking Clopidogrel 75 mg maintenance dose for 7 days. Both adverse events (including vascular events) and safety end point events will be collected at the safety visit (Visit 5), which will occur 7 days after Visit 4. The study will last approximately 4 weeks per patient. After the informed consents are signed by the patients, all adverse events (including vascular events), safety end point events and concomitant medications will be recorded at each visit.</detailed_description>

Taking acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg daily treatment for at least 7 days or taking ASA 100 mg daily dose for less than 7 days but with 300 mg ASA loading dose before PCI. 9. Females with childbearing potential (i.e., females who are not postmenopausal or surgically sterile) must: have a negative urine or blood pregnancy test at enrolment and prior to randomization; currently be using a hormonal contraceptive and agree to continue its use in addition to using doublebarrier local contraception (i.e., intrauterine device plus spermicidal and condom for male partner) from screening through study completion. 1. Patients who had acute coronary syndrome (ACS) within 12 months of screening. 2. Occurrence of myocardial infarction (MI) related to index elective PCI (type 4a MI) or myocardial infarction related to stent thrombosis (type 4b MI) according to the Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction. 3. Use of parenteral antithrombotic agents, e.g., glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPIs), bivalirudin, unfractionated heparin, enoxaparin or fondaparinux within 24 hours of screening. 4. Use of any oral antithrombotic agents, with the exception of Clopidogrel and ASA, within 30 days of screening. 5.
