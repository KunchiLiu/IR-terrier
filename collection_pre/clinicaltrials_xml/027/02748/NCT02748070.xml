	<brief_summary>While oral steroids have been shown to be effective in the management of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps, its role in treating chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps (CRSsNP) is ambiguous. Despite a lack of strong clinical evidence to suggest a benefit in this disease state, steroids are often prescribed as a component of post-operative care after sinus surgery for patients without polyps. Oral steroids carry with them significant adverse effects, and should be prescribed thoughtfully. The aims of this study are to determine if oral steroids in the peri-operative period improves patient outcomes in CRS without polyps.</brief_summary>
