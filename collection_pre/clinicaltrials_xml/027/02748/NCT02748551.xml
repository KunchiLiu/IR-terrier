	<brief_summary>Nowadays, the proportion of patients with locally advanced gastric cancer is estimated up to 90 percent of all gastric cancer cases in Russian Federation. Surgical procedure with D2 Lymphadenectomy is the main option for treatment. Conventional open approach is still the current standard for advanced gastric cancer. Laparoscopic procedures for gastric cancer as minimally invasive surgery has gained popularity for the treatment of early gastric cancer in East Asia. Several studies indicated that laparoscopic procedures both total and subtotal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy is a technically feasible and safe procedure by experienced surgeons in high-volume specialized hospitals. However, lack of solid evidence on the oncologic efficacy. Starting clinical trials for evaluate safety of oncology laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy for locally advanced gastric cancer. Aim of this trial is show safety, feasibility and oncologic efficacy of Laparoscopic radical surgical procedures both total and subtotal gastrectomy for treatment gastric cancer.</brief_summary>
