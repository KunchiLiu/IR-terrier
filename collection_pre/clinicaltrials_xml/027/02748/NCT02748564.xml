	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies the best dose of aldesleukin when given together with pembrolizumab to see how well they work in treating patients with stage III-IV melanoma. Aldesleukin may stimulate white blood cells to melanoma cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving aldesleukin and pembrolizumab may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aldesleukin and Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Stage III-IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine an optimal tolerated dose (OTD) of aldesleukin (interleukin [IL]-2) that is effective and tolerable in combination with pembrolizumab. II. To characterize the efficacy of the OTD of IL-2 in combination with pembrolizumab. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To characterize the safety of IL-2 in doses ranging up to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)- approved dose when administered in combination with pembrolizumab. II. To characterize clinical endpoints, including overall survival, progression-free survival, and complete response rate. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To characterize immune parameters in the blood and tumor microenvironment and cellular and molecular features of the tumor tissue that correlate with response to combination therapy for study as potential predictive biomarkers. OUTLINE: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 every 3 weeks and aldesleukin IV every 8 hours for up to 14 doses at weeks 4, 7, 16, 19, 28, and 31 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months up to 10 years.</detailed_description>

for this protocol, measurable disease is defined as at least one evaluable tumor that is at least 10 mm in longest dimension Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance scale Patients must have a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) (with and without contrast) that is free of active metastases; metastases that have been treated with radiation or surgical resection, are stable for at least 4 weeks and do not require steroids are eligible Normal cardiac function; patients who have a history of heart disease, or who are over the age of 50 years must have a normal cardiac stress test within the prior 90 days Normal lung function; patients who have extensive pulmonary metastases or any chronic pulmonary disease history must have pulmonary function testing demonstrating forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) &gt;

2.5 X ULN OR =&lt; 5 X ULN for subjects with liver metastases Albumin &gt;= 2.5 mg/dL International normalized ratio (INR) or prothrombin time (PT) =&lt; 1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) =&lt; 1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication; if the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication; subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy Subject meets institutional requirements for IL2 therapy Has primary ocular melanoma Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic immunosuppressive steroid therapy or any other form of systemic immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment; exception: physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency is not considered systemic immunosuppressive steroid therapy Has received previous high dose IL2 therapy, any programmed death (PD)1 blocking antibody (e.g. pembrolizumab, nivolumab), or any programmed death ligand (PDL)1 blocking antibody in the metastatic setting; prior therapy with any PD1 blocking antibody is allowed if given in the adjuvant setting and the last dose was &gt; 6 months prior to study entry; prior therapy with ipilimumab is allowed (in the adjuvant or metastatic setting);

grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to study day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., =&lt; grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent Note: subjects with =&lt; grade 2 neuropathy and/or alopecia are exceptions to this criterion and may qualify for the study Note: if subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment; exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis;
