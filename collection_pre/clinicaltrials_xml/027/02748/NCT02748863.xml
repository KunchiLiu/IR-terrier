Chronic plaquetype psoriasis present for at least 6 months and diagnosed before Randomization. 4. Moderate to severe psoriasis as defined at Randomization by: PASI score of 12 or greater, and IGA mod 2011 score of 3 or greater (based on a scale of 0 4), and Body Surface Area (BSA) affected by plaquetype psoriasis of 10% or greater. 5. Candidate for systemic therapy. This is defined as a subject having moderate to severe chronic plaquetype psoriasis that is inadequately controlled by Topical treatment and/or Phototherapy and/or Previous systemic therapy 1. Forms of psoriasis other than chronic plaquetype (e.g., pustular, erythrodermic and guttate psoriasis) at Screening or Randomization. 2. Ongoing use of prohibited treatments. Washout periods detailed in the protocol have to be adhered to. Subjects not willing to limit UV light exposure (e.g., sunbathing and/or the use of tanning devices) during the course of the study will be considered not eligible for this study since UV light exposure is prohibited. Note: administration of live vaccines 6 weeks prior to Randomization or during the study period is also prohibited. 3. Previous exposure to secukinumab (AIN457) or any other biologic drug directly targeting IL17 or the IL17 receptor. 4. Use of other investigational drugs at the time of enrollment, or within 5 halflives of enrollment, or within 30 days until the expected pharmacodynamic effect has returned to baseline, whichever is longer; or longer if required by local regulations. 5. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive hCG laboratory test. 6. History of lymphoproliferative disease or any known malignancy or history of malignancy of any organ system treated or untreated within the past 5 years, regardless of whether there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases (except for Bowen's disease, or basal cell carcinoma or actinic keratoses that have been treated with no evidence of recurrence in the past 12 weeks; carcinoma in situ of the cervix or noninvasive malignant colon polyps that have been removed). 7.
