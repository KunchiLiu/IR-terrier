	<brief_title>Exploratory Study of Efficacy and Safety of Ingenol Mebutate 0.05% Gel for Common Warts on the Hands.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label exploratory study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ingenol mebutate 0.05% gel for the treatment of verruca vulgaris. The study will be conducted at one site with one investigator, all subjects will receive active drug. Prior to the application of the investigational product (IP) on Day 1, the individual warts will be pared down with a 15 blade up to obtain debridement of intact skin to maximize exposure and allow for effective penetration of therapy into the lesion. Subjects can be screened for the study up to 45 days before Visit 1. During screening, the study requirements will be reviewed, written informed consent obtained, and eligibility confirmed. If applicable, qualified subjects can washout from prohibited medications or treatments prior to Visit 1 once they have been consented. These procedures may be combined with Visit 1. There will be one treatment arm, all subjects receive active ingenol mebutate 0.05% gel once daily for two consecutive days to lesions. Each subject will be screened for inclusion. The treatment will be applied to the entire wart lesion(s) and 0.5 cm margin around the lesion(s). All treatments will be applied in the clinic. A minimum of two (2) and a maximum of five (5) warts will be treated. In addition, one of the two warts will be identified for treatment with occlusion with a bandage each day for 24 hours after each application. The subjects will be evaluated at Day 1 and Day 2 when the consecutive applications of investigational product will be applied, then at Day 8, 29 and 57 to evaluate anticipated efficacy outcomes (lesion size, clearance, etc.) as well as assess for adverse events/SAEs. The wart that is identified for occlusion will be treated with investigational product and occluded for 24 hours after each application of IP. Subjects will be instructed to avoid excessive exposures to water or other potential contactants or irritants after application of the IP for the following 48 hours to avoid transfer of the IP.</detailed_description>

Subject used any topical agents (including dry powder, bland emollients, nonmedicated lotions, etc.) within a 3 cm border of the area to be treated within 14 days prior to entry into the study. 9. Subject has used topical medications such as corticosteroids, alphahydroxyacids greater than 5% (e.g., glycolic acid, lactic acid, etc.), betahydroxyacids greater than 2% (e.g., salicylic acid), urea greater than 5%, or topical retinoids (e.g., tazarotene, adapalene, tretinoin) adjacent to or within a 3 cm border around the area to be treated within 28 days prior to entry into the study. 10. Subject has used cryotherapy to lesions adjacent to or within a 3 cm border around the area to be treated within 2 weeks prior to entry into the study. 11. Subject has used systemic steroid therapy (e.g., methylprednisolone, predinisone) or NSAIDs within 7 days from Visit 1/Day 1 or initiation during the study. *Subjects may use Tylenol (Acetaminophen) for pain relief, as needed, throughout the study. Subjects may use low dose aspirin (81mg) for cardiac prophylaxis throughout the study.* 12. Subject has used chemotherapeutic agents, immunosuppressive agents, or retinoids within 4 weeks prior to entry into the study. 13. Subject has applied topical treatment such as 5FU, imiquimod, diclofenac sodium, sinecatechins ointment, or other treatments either indicated or offlabel for warts to lesions adjacent to (within a 3 cm border around the Treatment Area) or within the selected Treatment Area within 90 days prior to entry into the study. 14. Subject has had any prior intralesional treatment of the warts including injection of candida antigen, 5FU, and bleomycin. 15. Subject has any condition in the Treatment Area that would impact the treatment or proper assessment of the outcome (e.g. scarring, marked dermatitis, etc.) in the opinion of the investigator.</criteria>
