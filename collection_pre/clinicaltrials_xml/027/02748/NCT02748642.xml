	<brief_summary>This single-center, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, single and multiple ascending-dose study will be conducted in two parts to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of BITS7201A. Part A will be an ascending, single-dose, sequential-group study where participants will be randomly assigned to active drug or placebo. Part B will be an ascending, multiple-dose, sequential-group study where participants will be randomized to active drug or placebo. Total length of the study is anticipated to be approximately 12 months.</brief_summary>
