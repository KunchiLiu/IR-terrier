	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, crossover study with two 2-week treatment periods separated by a 2-week wash-out period. Subjects will participate in up to eight study visits and have a follow up phone call approximately a week after the last clinic visit. Visits 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 are evening visits that will be conducted between 5PM and 11PM. Visit 4 and Visit 7 are also evening visits that will begin between 5PM and 11PM and continue over a period of approximately 24 hours. Subjects will be required to attend three clinic visits during this 24-hour period. An exercise challenge (using a treadmill) will be conducted at Visit 2, Visit 3 and Visit 6 (after 23 hours of the first treatment dose in each Treatment Period); and at 12 and 23 hours post evening dose at Visits 4 and 7. Spirometry will be conducted at specified visits and prior to and after each exercise challenge. Subjects with symptomatic allergic rhinitis at Visit 1 (screening) may be treated for up to four weeks with intranasal corticosteroids followed by a repeat screening visit to determine eligibility prior to entry into the study. Eligible subjects at visit 1 will complete a 4-week single blind run-in on FP 250 microgram (mcg) twice daily (BID), followed by 2-week double-blind Treatment Period 1 on randomized treatment, a 2-week single blind washout period on FP 250 mcg BID, 2-week double-blind Treatment Period 2 receiving the alternative treatment, and follow-up contact approximately 7-days after completing Treatment Period 2. The total duration of study participation is approximately 11 weeks; and up to 15 weeks for subjects with Symptomatic Allergic Rhinitis. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the protective effect of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI) 100/25 mcg once-daily compared with fluticasone propionate (FP) 250 mcg twice-daily against exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in adolescent and adult subjects aged 12 to 50 with persistent asthma.

	<criteria>Informed consent: Subjects must give their signed and dated written informed consent to participate prior to commencing any study related activities. Age Range: 12 to 50 years of age, inclusive, at Visit 1 (Screening). Diagnosis: A diagnosis of asthma, as defined by the National Institutes of Health for at least 12 weeks prior to Visit 1. Asthma Severity: Subjects must have a prebronchodilator FEV1 of &gt;=70 percent of the predicted normal value. Predicted values will be based upon Global Lung Function Initiative equations for spirometry reference values. Evidence of EIB: Subjects must answer "Yes" to at least 2 of the following 3 questions reflecting on the previous 12 months: Are you short of breath during exercise or other physical exertion? Do you wheeze after exercise or other physical exertion? Do you cough after exercise or other physical exertion? Concurrent AntiAsthma Therapy: Subjects must be taking low to moderate dose inhaled steroids for 12 weeks prior to Visit 1 in order to participate with no change in dose for the 4 weeks prior to Visit 1. Gender: Subjects may be male or an eligible female. A female is eligible to enter and participate in the study if she is of: Nonchild bearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant, including any female who is postmenopausal or surgically sterile).Surgically sterile females are defined as those with a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation. Postmenopausal females are defined as being amenorrhoeic for greater than 1 year with an appropriate clinical profile, e.g., age appropriate, &gt; 45 years, in the absence of hormone replacement therapy. OR Child bearing potential, has a negative pregnancy test at screening, and agrees to acceptable contraceptive methods approved in their local country, when used consistently and correctly (i.e., in accordance with the approved product label and the instructions of the physician for the duration of the study screening to followup contact). Albuterol/salbutamol Use: All subjects must be able to replace their current shortacting beta2agonist with albuterol/salbutamol, to be used only on an asneeded basis for the duration of the study. Each subject must be judged capable of withholding albuterol/salbutamol for at least 6 hours prior to performing spirometric evaluations. Physical Capacity: Each subject must be physically able to perform the exercise challenges on a treadmill when bronchodilators have been withheld. Intermittent Asthma, Seasonal Asthma, or ExerciseInduced Bronchoconstriction Only: Subjects with only intermittent or seasonal asthma or only exerciseinduced asthma are excluded from participation in this study. History of Lifethreatening Asthma: Defined for this protocol as an asthma episode that required intubation and/or was associated with hypercapnia, respiratory arrest or hypoxic seizures within the last 10 years. Asthma Exacerbation: Any asthma exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids within 12 weeks of Visit 1 or that resulted in an overnight hospitalization requiring additional treatment for asthma within 6 months prior to Visit 1. Symptomatic Allergic Rhinitis: Subjects with symptomatic allergic rhinitis at Visit 1 may be treated for up to four weeks with intranasal corticosteroids followed by a repeat screening visit to determine eligibility prior to entry into the study. Subjects that continue to be symptomatic after up to four weeks of treatment will be excluded. 12Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG): A subject is not eligible if he/she has an abnormal, clinically significant ECG as determined by the investigator at the Screening Visit. Pregnancy: Women who are pregnant or lactating or are planning on becoming pregnant during the study. Respiratory Infection: Culturedocumented or suspected bacterial or viral infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract, sinus or middle ear that is not resolved within 4 weeks of Visit 1 and led to a change in asthma management or, in the opinion of the investigator, is expected to affect the subject's asthma status or the subject's ability to participate in the study. Concurrent Respiratory Disease: A subject must not have current evidence of: 1. Atelectasis 2. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia 3. Chronic bronchitis 4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (current or past diagnosis including asthma/COPD overlap) 5. Pneumonia 6. Pneumothorax 7. Interstitial lung disease 8. Or any evidence of concurrent respiratory disease other than asthma. Other Concurrent Diseases/Abnormalities: A subject must not have any clinically significant, uncontrolled condition, or disease state that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through study participation or would confound the interpretation of the efficacy results if the condition/disease exacerbated during the study. Investigational Medications: A subject must not have used any investigational drug within 30 days prior to Visit 1 or within five halflives (t1/2) of the prior investigational study, whichever is longer of the two periods. Allergies: 1) Drug Allergy: Any adverse reaction including immediate or delayed hypersensitivity to any beta2agonist, sympathomimetic drug, or any intranasal, inhaled, or systemic corticosteroid therapy, or excipients used with FF/VI 100/25 or FP 250 (i.e., drug, lactose or magnesium stearate). 2) Milk Protein Allergy: History of severe milk protein allergy. 3) Latex Allergy: History of allergy or sensitivity to latex that in the opinion of the investigator contraindicates the subject's participation in the study. Concomitant Medication: Administration of prescription or nonprescription medication that would significantly affect the course of asthma, or interact with study drug. Immunosuppressive Medications: A subject must not be using or require the use of immunosuppressive medications during the study. Compliance: A subject will not be eligible if he/she or his/her parent or legal guardian has any infirmity, disability, disease, or geographical location which seems likely (in the opinion of the investigator) to impair compliance with any aspect of this study protocol. Tobacco/Marijuana Use: Current tobacco smoker or has a smoking history of &gt;=10 packyears (20 cigarettes/day for 10 years). A subject may not have used inhaled tobacco products or inhaled marijuana within the past 3 months (e.g. cigarettes, cigars, electronic cigarettes, or pipe tobacco). Affiliation with Investigator's Site: A subject will not be eligible for this study if he/she is an immediate family member of the participating investigator, subinvestigator, studycoordinator or an employee of the participating investigator.</criteria>
