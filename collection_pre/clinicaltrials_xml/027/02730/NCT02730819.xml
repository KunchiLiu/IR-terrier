	<brief_title>Topical Composition Therapy (2013-MCN-333) for the Treatment of Melasma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects with moderate to severe melasma will apply 0.5 grams (pea-sized) amount of Illuminate Cream topically to affected areas for 20 weeks. The change in Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI) score will be evaluated a baseline and Weeks 4, 12, and 20. The MASI score is a validated test, calculated by subjective assessment of 3 factors: Area (A) of involvement, Darkness (D), and Homogeneity (H), with the forehead, right malar region, left malar region, and chin, corresponding to 30%, 30%, 30% and 10% of the total face, respectively. The area of involvement in each of these 4 areas is given a numeric value of 0 to 6 (0 = no involvement; 1 = &lt;10%; 2 = 10%-29%; 3 = 30-49%; 4 = 50-69%; 5 = 70-89%; and 6 = 90-100%). Darkness and homogeneity are rated on a scale from 0 to 4 (0 = absent; 1 = slight; 2 = mild; 3 = marked; and 4 = maximum). The score is calculated by adding the sum of the severity ratings for darkness and homogeneity, multiplied by the value of the area of involvement, for each of the 4 facial areas.</detailed_description>
