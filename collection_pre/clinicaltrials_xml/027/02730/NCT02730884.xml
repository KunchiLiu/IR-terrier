	<brief_title>Single-Arm Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Oral Rigosertib in Patients With Myelofibrosis (MF) and Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take rigosertib capsules by mouth 2 times each day (1 morning dose, 1 afternoon dose) for 48 weeks. You will take your morning dose on an empty stomach. Your afternoon dose should be taken at about 3:00 pm (±1 hour), at least 2 hours after lunch. You will fast for at least 1 hour after each dose. You should drink at least a ½ gallon of water each day. Rigosertib should be refrigerated. You will also be given a study drug diary. You should write down each dose of study drug that you take, when you take it, and if you miss or vomit any doses. If you miss or vomit a dose of rigosertib, you should not make up the dose. You should take the next scheduled dose as planned. Every 3 weeks for 12 weeks, then every 6 weeks thereafter, you should bring any leftover rigosertib capsules and your study drug diary with you to the clinic. Study Visits: You will need to fast before each blood draw you have while on study. The doctor will tell you for how long you need to fast. On Cycle 1 Day 1: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing about 1 hour after your dose of study drug. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points. - You will complete a questionnaire about your quality of life. It should take about 10-15 minutes. - If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to check the status of the disease. Each week, blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If the study doctor approves it, you may have these weekly blood draws at a local lab closer to your home. The results from these routine tests will be sent to the study doctor. On Day 1 of Week 4, blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for PK testing before and 1 hour after your dose of study drug. At Weeks 24 and 48 (± 1 week): - You will have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy performed to check the status of the disease. This sample may also be used for cytogenetic testing. - If you had a CT/MRI scan performed during Week 1, you will have another CT/MRI scan to check the status of the disease. - If you can become pregnant, urine will be collected for a pregnancy test. Every 4 weeks until Week 12 and then every 8 weeks after that: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. - You will complete a questionnaire about your quality of life. Length of Study: You may continue taking the study drug for up to 48 weeks. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. If the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you may be able to continue taking the study drug after 48 weeks. The study doctor will discuss this with you. Your participation on the study will be over after the end-of-study visit. End-of-Study Visit: About 4 weeks after your last dose of study drug, you will have an end-of-study visit. At this visit: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. You will need to fast before this blood draw. The study doctor will tell you for how long you need to fast. This routine blood and urine collection will also include a pregnancy test if you can become pregnant. This is an investigational study. Rigosertib is not FDA-approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work. Up to 35 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. &gt;/= 18 years of age; 2. Diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis (PMF) or postpolycythemia vera (postPV) MF or postessential thrombocythemia (postET) MF based on the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria or the IWGMRT criteria, which must be confirmed by BM aspirate and/or biopsy within 6 weeks prior to Screening. Measurement of JAK2 V617F allele burden in BM samples, if not done within 6 months prior to Screening, must be provided with the Screening BM biopsy/aspirate report (patients are eligible regardless of JAK2 mutation status); 3. Anemia or RBCtransfusion dependence defined as follows: a) Anemia: defined for the purpose of this protocol as 1) a hemoglobin level &lt;10 g/L on every determination over 84 days before studyentry, without RBCtransfusions, or 2) a hemoglobin level &lt;10 g/L on a patient that is receiving RBCtransfusions periodically but not meeting criteria for transfusiondependent patient as defined below. The baseline hemoglobin value for these subjects is the lowest hemoglobin level during the antecedent 84 days; b) RBCtransfusiondependence: RBCtransfusionfrequency of &gt;/=2 units PRBC/28 days averaged over 84 days immediately prestudyentry. There must not be any consecutive 42 days without an RBCtransfusion during this interval. 4. ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2; 5. Willing to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions specified in this protocol (Notation: the subject's willingness to adhere to prohibitions and restrictions must be clearly communicated in the onstudy note); 6. The patient must signed an informed consent form (ICF) indicating that s/he understands the purpose of, and procedures required for, the study and is willing to participate. 1. Ongoing clinically significant anemia due to factors such as known iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiencies, autoimmune or hereditary hemolysis, or gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding; 2. Serum ferritin &lt; 50 ng/mL; 3. Any active malignancy within the past year, except basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast; patients with history of prior malignancies should be free of disease for at least 3 years to be eligible for this study. 4.

Active infection not adequately responding to appropriate therapy; 6. Direct bilirubin &gt;/= 2.0 mg/dL not related to hemolysis or Gilbert's disease; 7. Alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST)&gt;/= 2.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN); 8. Serum creatinine &gt;/= 2.5 mg/dL; 9. Ascites requiring active medical management including paracentesis; 10. Hyponatremia (defined as serum sodium level &lt; 130 mEq/L); 11. Female patients who are pregnant or lactating; 12. Patients of childbearing potential (ie, women of childbearing potential and men with female partners of childbearing potential) who are unwilling to follow strict contraception requirements (including 2 reliable methods in combination: 1 nonhormonal, highlyreliable method [diaphragm, condoms with spermicidal foam or jelly, or sterilization] plus 1 additional reliable method [birth control pills, intrauterine device, contraceptive injections, or contraceptive patches]) before entry and throughout the study, up to and including the 30day nontreatment followup period; 13. Female patients of childbearing potential who have a positive blood or urine pregnancy test at Screening; 14. Major surgery without full recovery or major surgery within 3 weeks of Screening; 15. Uncontrolled hypertension (defined as a sustained systolic pressure &gt;/= 160 mmHg and/or a diastolic pressure &gt;/= 110 mmHg); 16. New onset seizures (within 3 months prior to Screening) or poorly controlled seizures; 17. Any other concurrent investigational agent or chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy; 18.
