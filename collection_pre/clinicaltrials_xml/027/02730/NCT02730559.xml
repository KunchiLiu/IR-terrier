	<brief_summary>The primary focus of this proposal is to address growing concern of overweight/ obese adolescents with hyperlipidemia. The proposed study is a 2-arm randomized controlled clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of Motivational interviewing (MI) interventions with the parent and adolescent dyad versus adolescent (10-17yr) alone. The patients will be recruited from the Lipid clinic at Sick Kids. The study hypothesis is that parent child dyad will have more success due to the possible synergetic effect compared to adolescents alone. The study's primary outcome is cholesterol levels (Triglycerides/HDL ratio) and secondary outcomes include overall improvement in their lifestyle and their responses to the MI intervention.</brief_summary>
