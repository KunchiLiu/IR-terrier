	<brief_summary>This study will determine the bioavailability of anthocyanins and phenolic compounds from two purple wheat products, i.e. bran-enriched wholegrain purple wheat crackers and bran-enriched wholegrain purple wheat granola bars. Crackers are an example of a baked/ processed product. The purple wheat granola bars are an example of a food product that requires much less intensive preparation and cooking, compared to the crackers. A comparison of bioavailability between these two products should provide insights about how different processes and food matrix influence anthocyanin bioavailability and metabolism.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will determine the bioavailability of anthocyanins and phenolic compounds from two purple wheat products, i.e. bran-enriched wholegrain purple wheat crackers and bran-enriched wholegrain purple wheat granola bars. Crackers are an example of a baked/ processed product. The purple wheat granola bars are an example of a food product that requires much less intensive preparation and cooking, compared to the crackers. A comparison of bioavailability between these two products should provide insights about how different processes and food matrix influence anthocyanin bioavailability and metabolism. The study is a crossover investigation with 8 men and 8 women who will adhere to a low anthocyanin and low phenolic diet for the duration and complete 2 postprandial study visits where, in random order, they will consume either the crackers or granola bars. Blood and urine will be collected at baseline and postprandially for the analysis of anthocyanins and their metabolites and phenolic acids and determination of antioxidant capacity.</detailed_description>
