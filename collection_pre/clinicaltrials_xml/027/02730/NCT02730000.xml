	<brief_summary>Given the clinical damage caused by errors commonly made during the dosage and handling of glass ionomer cement (GIC) of high viscosity powder-liquid type, the use of encapsulated ionomer has been recommended for final restorations. However, the initial cost of the encapsulated MIC is higher when compared to the material handled manually. The objective of this randomized study is to (1) reveal cost-effective in the long run, the encapsulated CIV Riva Self Cure and Equia used as a restorative material in atraumatic restorations (Atraumatic Restorative Treatment), (2) assess whether the type of cavity (occlusal and occlusal-proximal) influences the longevity of atraumatic restorations using encapsulated IC, (3) assess whether the child's caries experience influences the longevity of atraumatic restorations with GIC encapsulated. Children, ages 3 and 7, will be selected in the Tietê-SP municipality. Randomization will be performed in a stratified manner by the conditions: type of cavity and caries experience. 122 ART restorations are performed using encapsulated CIV - Riva Self Cure - SDI and Equia -CG Corp. The restorations will be evaluated after 6, 12 and 18 months by two trained examiners blind to the groups (intra- and inter-rater agreement above 0.7). To verify the survival of the restorations will be used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank test. To evaluate the association between longevity and variable Cox regression test will be applied. For the cost analysis will be used analysis of variance.</brief_summary>
