	<brief_title>Furosemide Stress Test Guiding Initiation of Renal Replacement Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective is to determine if early initiation of renal replacement therapy guided by positive furosemide stress test has an impact on 7-day fluid balance in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age older than 18 years old and admission in an ICU Acute kidney injury (defined by serum creatinine increase ≥ 0.3 mg/dL or urine output ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/hour according to KDIGO criteria) Informed consent provided by the patient or person with decisional responsibility Indwelling bladder catheter Documented cause of acute kidney injury from acute tubular necrosis e.g. presence of granular or epithelial casts on urine sediment, FeNa more than 1%, Feurea more than 50%, urine or plasma neutrophil gelatinaseassociated lipocalin (NGAL) more than 150 mg/dL Opinion of the treating clinical team that patient was well resuscitated and sufficiently clinically stable for the intervention or by noninvasive or invasive measurements i.e. fluid accumulation at least 5% plus at least one of the following e.g. chest radiography, central venous pressure ≥ 8 mmHg, pulse pressure variation &lt; 13%, inferior vena cava collapsibility index &lt; 50% in spontaneously breathing patients or distensibility index &lt; 18% in mechanically ventilated patients Baseline serum creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dL (male) and ≥ 1.5 mg/dL (female) within 3 months Evidence of volume depletion at the time of furosemide administration or active bleeding Evidence of obstructive uropathy, renal vein thrombosis or renal artery stenosis, thrombotic microangiopathy, glomerulonephritis, tumor lysis syndrome History of renal allograft Known pregnancy Allergy or known sensitivity to loop diuretics Need for emergency renal replacement therapy at randomization or evaluation by the clinical team that the renal replacement therapy should be deferred Patient is moribund with expected death within 24 hr or whom survival to 28 days is unlikely due to an uncontrollable comorbidity (cardiac, pulmonary or hepatic endstage disease; hepatorenal syndrome; poorly controlled cancer; severe postanoxic encephalopathy; etc.) Patients with advance directives issued expressing the desire not to be resuscitated Prior treatment with RRT within 30 days</criteria>
