	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to assess the clinical effects of natalizumab versus placebo in acute ischemic stroke on clinical measures of functional independence and activities of daily living. The secondary objective of the study is to explore dose and exposure response and the clinical treatment effects of natalizumab versus placebo in acute ischemic stroke on the following: measures of independence, activities of daily living, neurologic function, quality of life, cognition, and safety and tolerability</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Clinical diagnosis of supratentorial acute ischemic stroke defined by LKN ≤24 hours prior to study treatment initiation. Score of 5 to 23 points, inclusive, on the NIHSS at Screening for subjects initiating treatment ≤9 hours from LKN. Note: NIHSS eligibility must be confirmed within 60 minutes prior to randomization. Score of 5 to 15 points, inclusive, on the NIHSS at Screening for subjects initiating treatment &gt;9 to ≤24 hours from LKN. Note: NIHSS eligibility must be confirmed within 60 minutes prior to randomization. Prior to index stroke, patient was able to perform basic activities of daily living without assistance: dressing, eating, walking, bathing, and using the toilet. For those subjects who underwent a cranial MRI, there is at least 1 acute infarct with a diameter of ≥2 cm on baseline brain diffusionweighted imaging. Key Lacunar or isolated brainstem or cerebellar stroke based on clinical assessment and available acute imaging studies performed under the standard of care. Presence of acute intracranial hemorrhage on acute brain CT or MRI. However, petechial hemorrhages of ≤1 cm are not exclusionary. Severe stroke. Seizure at the onset of stroke. Known history of prior treatment with natalizumab. Known history of active viral hepatitis B or C. Signs and symptoms of active or acute infection. NOTE: Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
