	<brief_title>Effect of High Altitude Exposure, Acclimatization and Re-exposure on Nocturnal Breathing Pattern in Lowlanders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Respiratory polygraphies will be performed in Santiago de Chile, 520 m, over the course of 3 days. Participants will then travel by commercial airline (5 h flight) and by bus (3 h ride) to the ALMA base camp located at 2900 m near San Pedro de Atacama, northern Chile. Participants will stay there for the next 7 nights and respiratory polygraphies will be performed on night 1 and 6. They will be spend the days (6-8 h daily) at the telescope station at 5050 m while undergoing physiological testing. Daily transports from 2900 to 5050 m will be by car (1 h ride, one way). After the first 8 day altitude sojourn participants will return to the Santiago area (520 m) for a 6 day recovery period. A second altitude sojourn with an identical schedule as the one described above and a final low altitude stay of 3 days will follow.</detailed_description>
