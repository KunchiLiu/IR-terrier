	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well pioglitazone hydrochloride and tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy works in treating patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) that has come back after a period of improvement (relapsed) after a first TKI discontinuation. TKI may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking certain enzymes need for cell growth. Although TKI therapies are effective against CML, there are residual cancer cells called leukemia stem cells that are able to hide from TKIs. Pioglitazone hydrochloride is a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat diabetes and has been shown in laboratory studies to increase CML stem cell death when given together with TKI therapy. Giving pioglitazone hydrochloride with TKI therapy may be effective in treating patients with CML.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess safety of the combination of pioglitazone hydrochloride (PIO) and TKI in CML subjects who experience a loss of major molecular response (MMR) following a first TKI discontinuation. II. To assess survival without loss of MMR following a second TKI discontinuation in subjects who achieve or maintain &lt; molecular response (MR)^4.5 with the combination PIO and TKI administered for at least 6 months. OUTLINE: Patients receive pioglitazone hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Patients also start or continue the same TKI therapy at the pre-discontinuation doses. Courses repeat every 28 days for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every month for 3 months, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 4 years.</detailed_description>
