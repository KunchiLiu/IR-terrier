	<brief_summary>The subjects who take part in this clinical research study have advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has been previously treated with other drugs. If they join this study, they would receive ramucirumab (Cyramza ®) in combination with nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®). Ramucirumab given with nab-paclitaxel is considered an investigational drug combination to use in this type of cancer because giving these two drugs together has not been approved by any regulatory authority like the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for NSCLC cancer. Ramucirumab works by slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells. Nab-Paclitaxel works by blocking the ability of cancer cells to break down the internal 'skeleton' that allows them to divide and multiply. With the skeleton still in place, the cells cannot divide and they eventually die.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of the Safety and Efficacy of the Addition of Ramucirumab to Nab-paclitaxel in Previously Treated Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ramucirumab is a human IgG1 (Immunoglobulin G) monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular domain of VEGFR-2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor). A recent double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluated the addition of ramucirumab to docetaxel compared with docetaxel and placebo in patients with Stage IV squamous and non-squamous NSCLC in the 2nd-line treatment setting. This study demonstrated a superior overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall response rate (ORR) with the combination therapy compared with docetaxel with placebo. This effect was seen across histologic subtypes, in the absence of excess toxicity in patients with squamous cell histology. This finding is intriguing, as prior study of bevacizumab in patients with NSCLC of squamous cell histology was associated with excess pulmonary hemorrhage. This provides the rationale for further investigation of ramucirumab in patients with squamous cell NSCLC. nab-Paclitaxel is a formulation of paclitaxel complexed with albumin that is readily soluble in saline and allows administration of paclitaxel without the use of lipid-based solvents and the need for corticosteroid and antihistamine premedication. nab-Paclitaxel was approved for the 1st line treatment of NSCLC based on a trial which demonstrated a superior ORR with the addition of nab-paclitaxel to carboplatin compared with carboplatin/paclitaxel in patients with advanced and metastatic NSCLC, as well as prolonged PFS and OS without statistical significance. The subgroup analysis by tumor histology demonstrated a statistically significant advantage for nab-paclitaxel/carboplatin in terms of best overall response rate (41% vs 24%, p&lt;0.001), and numerically better PFS and OS in squamous NSCLC. [3] This is a single-arm phase II clinical trial, in which patients with previously treated NSCLC will be treated with ramucirumab/nab-paclitaxel until disease progression, unacceptable treatment-related toxicity or withdrawal of consent with the primary endpoint of progression-free survival. A minimum of 40 patients with squamous cell histology will be required for determination of the co-primary endpoint. The investigators hypothesize that the addition of ramucirumab to nab-paclitaxel is well-tolerated and associated with a superior PFS compared with single agent taxane-based therapy.</detailed_description>

Received at least one prior platinumbased chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Prior bevacizumab as 1st line and/or maintenance therapy is allowed. Prior nivolumab is allowed. Age ≥18 years. ECOG performance status ≤2 Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks. Adequate liver function Adequate hematologic function Not have cirrhosis at a level of ChildPugh B (or worse) or cirrhosis (any degree) with a history of hepatic encephalopathy or clinically meaningful ascites resulting from cirrhosis. Adequate renal function Urinary protein of ≤1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis (UA). Adequate coagulation function. Treated and clinically stable brain metastases are allowed. Adequate contraceptive use. &lt; Grade 2 preexisting peripheral neuropathy. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. Patients previously treated with taxanes are excluded, unless the taxane therapy was part of an initially curative regimen and was completed &gt;12 months from study enrollment. Patients with previous intolerance to ramucirumab. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to ramucirumab or nabpaclitaxel. Patients with untreated CNS metastases. Patients with significant bleeding disorders, vasculitis, or who experienced Grade 3/4 gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding within 3 months prior to enrollment. History of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or any other significant thromboembolism during the 3 months prior to enrollment. Any arterial thromboembolic events, within 6 months prior to enrollment. History of uncontrolled hereditary or acquired thrombotic disorder. Uncontrolled or poorlycontrolled hypertension. A serious or nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture within 28 days prior to enrollment. Major surgery within 28 days prior to enrollment, or subcutaneous venous access device placement within 7 days prior to enrollment. Chronic antiplatelet therapy, including aspirin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, naproxen, and others), dipyridamole or clopidogrel, or similar agents. Oncedaily aspirin use (maximum dose 325 mg/day) is permitted. Elective or planned major surgery scheduled during the course of the clinical trial.

Patients receiving prophylactic, lowdose anticoagulation therapy are eligible provided that the coagulation parameters defined in the inclusion criteria (INR ≤1.5 or PT ≤1.5 x ULN and PTT/aPTT ≤1.5 x ULN). Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.
