	<brief_summary>Apart from objective criteria for the evaluation of oral health (CAO, CPIâ€¦), there are no scales to evaluate the oral health of patients with schizophrenia. The only scales that do exist are for the population at large, children or the elderly. Given the severely deteriorated oral health in these schizophrenic populations, it is important to have a tool to evaluate their perception of the quality of their oral health so as to better orientate prevention programmes. The aim of this study is to validate a tool to measure the perception of oral health in patients with schizophrenia. To do this, patients will be invited to complete a series of self-questionnaires relative to the concept of oral health.</brief_summary>
