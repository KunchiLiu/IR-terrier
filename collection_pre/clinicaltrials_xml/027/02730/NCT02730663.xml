	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness and Safety of EUS-guided Transluminal Drainage With 'Niti-S SPAXUS Stent'</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>'Niti-S SPAXUS Stent' is a newly designed lumen-apposing fully covered self-expandable metal stent. It is indicated for use in patients with pancreatic pseudocyst.
