	<brief_title>Value-based Emotion-focused Educational Programme to Reduce Diabetes-related Distress</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients experience many psychosocial problems related to their diabetes, as well as social- and work-related relationships. These often lead to emotional disorders such as distress, stress, anxiety and depression. Without proper care, these patients use more often negative coping strategies and more frequently expect that their diabetes will negatively affect their future. A cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted in 10 public health clinics (HC) in Malaysia. These clusters are eligible if they are providing standard diabetes care according to national clinical practice guidelines, not involved in similar trial and having nurses to be trained to deliver the VEMOFIT educational programmes. Pre-stratification by cluster size and geographic areas of the HCs will get randomised five HCs to the VEMOFIT group (VG) and attention-meetings group (AG), respectively.</detailed_description>
