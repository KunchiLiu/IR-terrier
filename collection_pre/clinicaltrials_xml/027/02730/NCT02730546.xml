	<brief_summary>This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best way to give pembrolizumab with combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy before surgery and to see how well it works in treating adult patients with gastroesophageal junction or gastric cardia cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue and can be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving pembrolizumab, combination chemotherapy, and radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab, Combination Chemotherapy, and Radiation Therapy Before Surgery in Treating Adult Patients With Locally Advanced Gastroesophageal Junction or Gastric Cardia Cancer That Can Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab when combined with radiotherapy plus carboplatin and paclitaxel in locally advanced gastroesophageal junction (GEJ)/cardia adenocarcinoma. (Phase Ib) II. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab when combined with oxaliplatin, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil (mFOLFOX6) (without radiation) in locally advanced GEJ/cardia adenocarcinoma. (Phase Ib) (re-initiated) III. To evaluate the pathological complete response (pathCR) rate of pembrolizumab when combined with radiotherapy plus carboplatin and paclitaxel in locally advanced GEJ/cardia adenocarcinoma. (Phase II) IV. To determine the 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate of pembrolizumab when combined with mFOLFOX6 (without radiation) in locally advanced GEJ/cardia adenocarcinoma. (Phase II) (only if Phase Ib is re-initiated) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine progression-free survival (PFS), determine time to relapse (TTR), disease-free survival (DFS), R0 rate, and overall survival (OS) of pembrolizumab when combined with radiotherapy plus carboplatin and paclitaxel. II. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS), pathCR rate, time to relapse (TTR), disease-free survival (DFS), R0 rate, and overall survival (OS) of pembrolizumab when combined with oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and fluorouracil (FOLFOX) chemotherapy. (only if Phase Ib is re-initiated) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To identify tissue and/or circulating biomarkers that are associated with pathCR, DFS, and other clinical outcomes in patients with locally advanced GEJ/cardia adenocarcinoma treated with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based therapy. II. To determine differences in pre-treatment vs post-treatment tissue expression of immune markers, including programmed death ligand (PDL)1 and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (cluster of differentiation [CD]8+, forkhead box P3 [FOXP3]+ regulatory t cells [Tregs], CD45RO, granzyme B), in patients treated with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based therapy. III. To identify immune markers in pretreatment tissues that correlate with pathCR and long-term outcome in patients treated with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based therapy. IV. To explore whether an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated tumor molecular profile is associated with pathCR and long-term outcome in patients treated with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based therapy. V. To explore whether a microsatellite-unstable (MSI) tumor molecular profile is associated with pathCR and long-term outcome in patients treated with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based therapy. OUTLINE: NEOADJUVANT TREATMENT: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 22, and 43 and carboplatin IV and paclitaxel IV over 1-96 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29. Patients also undergo radiation therapy once daily (QD) 5 days per week for 4 weeks and 3 days (23 fractions). Patients with progressive disease receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes, paclitaxel IV over 1-96 hours, and carboplatin IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2-4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. NEOADJUVANT TREATMENT (RE-INITIATED): Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 22 and oxaliplatin IV over 2-6 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 15 minutes to 2 hours, and fluorouracil IV over 46-48 hours on days 1, 15, and 29. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with progressive disease receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 22, oxaliplatin IV over 2-6 hours, leucovorin calcium over 15 minutes to 2 hours, and fluorouracil IV over 46-48 hours on days 1, 15, and 29. Treatment repeats every 41 days (6 weeks) for 1-3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. SURGERY: Within 5-8 weeks after completion of radiation therapy or 3-6 weeks after completion of chemotherapy for patients receiving chemotherapy alone, patients undergo curative-intent surgery. ADJUVANT TREATMENT: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes every 21 days. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 1 year.</detailed_description>
