	<brief_summary>This study will be a prospective study of patients who undergo platelet-rich therapy (PRT) for facial rejuvenation at NYU Langone Medical Center. PRT has been increasingly used for wound healing, fat grafting, hemostasis as well as facial enhancement. PRT involves injection of patient's own platelets and fibrin, and has evolved as a less invasive technique for facial rejuvenation compared to more traditional techniques. Through the use of pre and post treatment photos, in addition to the FACE-Q Questionnaire and a clinician assessment, it is our hope that we will confirm the rejuvenating capabilities of PRT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Platelet Rich Therapy for Facial Rejuvenation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To assess patient-reported satisfaction of using platelet rich therapy for facial rejuvenation using a validated questionnaire (the FACE-Q scale). This is a prospective study of patients who will undergo platelet-rich therapy for facial rejuvenation at NYU Langone Medical Center. Platelet rich therapy (PRT) has been increasingly used for wound healing, fat grafting, hemostasis as well as facial enhancement. PRT involves injection of patient's own platelets and fibrin, and has evolved as a less invasive technique for facial rejuvenation compared to more traditional techniques. However, while platelet rich therapy for facial enrichment continues to gain popularity; little evidence exists to support its use in the current literature. Therefore, this study sets out to determine patient satisfaction as well as quality of life following PRT for facial rejuvenation. PRT has been previously used successfully in facial plastic surgery and is being offered as an option as part of standard of care for facial rejuvenation (Sclafani). Subjects will be identified by the principal investigator as they present to the office for facial rejuvenation and are interested in an alternative to soft tissue fillers. All such patients will be given PRT as an alternative option for facial rejuvenation and any patient who agrees to this therapy will be enrolled in the study. Subject enrollment will continue until a total of 30 subjects are recruited.</detailed_description>
