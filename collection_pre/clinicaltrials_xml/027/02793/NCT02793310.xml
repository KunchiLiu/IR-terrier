	<brief_title>DMEK Versus DSAEK Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>FECD is a progressive, multifactorial and irreversible disease characterized by accelerated loss of corneal endothelial cells in the innermost layer of the cornea that leads to vision impairment and potential blindness if left untreated. FECD is responsible for more than 50% of the 1.300 annual corneal transplantations in the Netherlands. Corneal transplantation improves vision and quality of life in patients with corneal disease. Currently, the standard of care for patients with Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy (FECD) is Descemet Stripping Automated Endothelial Keratoplasty (DSAEK), in which only the posterior layers of the cornea are transplanted. However, visual recovery following DSAEK is suboptimal. Descemet Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty (DMEK), the latest technique in corneal transplantation involves transplantation of only a monolayer of corneal endothelium and Descemet's membrane providing the thinnest endothelial graft possible. DMEK has been suggested to result in faster and better visual recovery compared to DSAEK. While the economic burden, both medical and social, from this disease has not been assessed to date, costs associated with corneal transplantation reach $ 110 million dollars yearly for the 47.000 transplantations in the USA. The objective of this project is to assess the effects and costs of DMEK vs. DSAEK in order to determine whether the new technique is effective and cost-effective over the standard technique. The primary outcome measure is best-corrected visual acuity. Secondary outcome measures are contrast acuity, astigmatism, quality of vision, endothelial cell loss, incidence of graft rejection, primary graft failure, cornea donor loss due to preparation, and generic and vision-related quality of life.</detailed_description>
