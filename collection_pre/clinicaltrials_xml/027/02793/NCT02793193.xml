	<brief_summary>The gut-brain axis is described as being important in both, gut functions and central nervous system (CNS) functions. The microbiota in the gut plays an important role in this axis through neural, immune and endocrine systems. Previous studies have found altered gut microbiota (GM) composition could change the CNS functions in animals and humans. Probiotics were shown having positive effect on improving stress response in animals and stress related psychiatry in humans. The current study will investigate if probiotics can improve response to social stress in healthy participants and patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which is a stress-related disease, and whether this probiotic action can be counteracted by the locally acting antibiotic, Rifaximin. The investigators will use the Cyberball paradigram to induce social stress and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to record neural responses related to the social stress. The administration of the probiotics will be a new strategy for both the mental health management and treatment of gastrointestinal (GI) disorders in the future.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Probiotics on Central Nervous System Functions in Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying the experience of social stress may help to prevent the development of IBS and to help people to maintain their mental health. Social distress has been examined with the Cyberball paradigm in developing peers and children with autism spectrum disorders, people with social anxiety disorder and with borderline personality disorder. These studies provided researchers the clinical evidence and validity of the paradigm in patients . Here the investigators will examine the neural response of IBS patients to acute stress induced by the Cyberball game and if acute intervention with probiotics for 4 weeks can alleviate the stress response. The study will be firstly conducted on healthy volunteers whose GM will be disturbed by an antibiotic Rifaximin as to simulate IBS patients, to see their neural response to the social exclusion and the effect of the probiotic Bifidobacterium longum 1714 (Study 1). The second study will be conducted as a clinical trial on IBS patients who meet the diagnosis based on Rome I, II, or III criteria (Study 2). Study 1 &amp; 2 will be a randomized, double blind, double dummy design, during which the participants will visit the laboratory for 3 times (M1, M2, M3): measurement at baseline and after each of the 2 periods of intervention (P1, P2). Each period lasts for 4 weeks, resulting in duration of the study of 8 weeks in total. Group 1 will take B.longum 1714 for 4 weeks at beginning and then Rifaximin for 4 weeks, to test the effect of B.longum 1714 and also if Rifaximin could block the effect of B.longum 1714. Group 2 will also take B.longum 1714 in the first 4 weeks, to test the effect of B.longum 1714. In the second 4 weeks, participants will take placebo, for comparison with Group 1. Group 3 will take Rifaximin for 4 weeks and placebo for 4 weeks, to test the pure effect of Rifaximin. Group 4 will take Rifaximin at the beginning and B.longum 1714 after, to test if B.longum 1714 can normalize the central function impaired by Rifaximin. 1 week of placebo will be added after 3 weeks of Rifaximin and before 4 weeks of B.longum 1714 as a washout period to avoid Rifaximin directly killing B.longum 1714. Group 5 will only take placebo in two 4-weeks periods as a control group. Participants will be not allowed to eat certain kinds of food. As mentioned in the exclusion criteria, participants will not eat probiotic/prebiotic containing food supplements, or potentially immune-enhancing dietary supplements either. The food to be avoided will be summarized on a list of probiotic/prebiotic containing food. Also, participants will be asked to record the food they take on each day during the intervention, by taking photos. Nutritional information about the food taken by the participants will be analyzed by using an online tool http://nutritiondata.self.com/. Before the intervention period, each participant will need to complete questionnaires including a demographic questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The PHQ is for excluding those healthy participants who suffer from psychiatry disorder(s) and for further analysis. The HADS, which will also be completed after each intervention period, aims to study the effect of the probiotic on anxiety and depression level in healthy participants and especially in IBS patients. Also, participants will receive a daily online questionnaire via email, including the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Scales, and questions about their level of stress, consumption of the study capsules, hours of sleep, IBS symptom and quality of life (QoL) (the last two are only for patients), etc. Through questionnaires, the investigators will record menstruation information of female participants for controlling confounders. Also, gender and age between healthy and patient groups will be matched as much as possible, since these factors could have an effect on the GM composition and the CNS functions. Stool samples will be collected on the day participants come to a lab visit for measurements. The stool sample should be as fresh as possible, ideally collected in the morning of the visiting day. Fresh samples will be stored in RNA synthesis stabilization buffer at the time of collection. A centrifuged fecal pellet will be stored at -80°. Blood sample (10cc) will also be taken by a doctor from the University Hospital Tübingen after participants finish the experiment. The sample will be immediately sent to centrifuge at 3500rpm for 10 mins to separate serum. The sample then will be stored at -80° until analysis. During the Magnetoencephalography measuring, before the Cyberball game, there will be a resting state session for 5 minutes. In this session participants will be studied in supine position. Participants will be instructed to move as little as possible and remain awake, while keeping their eyes closed. After the resting state recording the Cyberball game will start. The task of the game will be projected on a screen and participants will be asked to fixate the screen and hold a response box to get ready for the task. Magnetic fields will be measured with a 275-channel whole head magnetometer at a sampling rate of 1200 Hz. In order to overlay the brain activity derived from MEG on anatomical scans, a high-resolution (1 mm, isotropic) T1-weighted structural MR image will be acquired with an MPRAGE sequence with a 3-T MR scanner (University Hospital Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany). Seventeen participants will be needed in each experimental group, resulting in at least 85 in each of the study (study 1 &amp; 2). The recruitment of participants will be organized by the MEG center under the responsibility of Prof. Dr. Christoph Braun. The study will be announced on black boards in the Tübingen University Clinic and the campus of the University. Further announcements will be done via the University mailing list and the local newspaper. Each participant will be provided with detailed information about the aims of the investigation, the tasks and measurements. Participants will be informed about the possibility to cancel the examination at any time without cause or prejudice for her person. Investigation will be carried out only when written consent from the participants is obtained.</detailed_description>
