	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, single arm Phase II study of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched unrelated bone marrow transplantation donors and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy), sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis in patients with hematologic malignancies.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Age ≥ 15 years and &lt; 71 years at the time of signing the informed consent form 2. Partially HLAmismatched unrelated donor: HLA typing will be performed at high resolution (allele level) for the HLAA, B, C, and DRB1 loci; a minimum match of 4/8 at HLAA, B, C, and DRB1 is required 3. Product planned for infusion is bone marrow 4. Disease and disease status: 1. Acute Leukemias or T lymphoblastic lymphoma in 1st or subsequent complete remission (CR): Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)/T lymphoblastic lymphoma; acute myelogenous leukemia (AML); acute biphenotypic leukemia (ABL); acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL) 2. Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), fulfilling the following criteria: Subjects with de novo MDS who have or have previously had Intermediate2 or High risk disease as determined by the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). Current Intermediate2 or High risk disease is not a requirement; Subjects must have &lt; 20% bone marrow blasts, assessed within 60 days of informed consent; Subjects may have received prior therapy for the treatment of MDS prior to enrollment 3. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) in CR if RIC is to be used; in CR or partial response (PR) if FIC is to be used 4. Chemotherapysensitive lymphoma in status other than 1st CR 5. Performance status: Karnofsky or Lansky score ≥ 60% (Appendix A) 6. Adequate organ function defined as: 1. Cardiac: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at rest ≥ 35% (RIC cohort) or LVEF at rest ≥ 40% (FIC cohort), or left ventricular shortening fraction (LVFS) ≥ 25% 2. Pulmonary: diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO), forced expiratory volume (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) ≥ 50% predicted by pulmonary function tests (PFTs) 3. Hepatic: total bilirubin ≤ 2.5 mg/dL, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) &lt; 5 x upper limit of (ULN) (unless disease related) 4. Renal: serum creatinine (SCr) within normal range for age (see table 2.3). If SCr is outside normal range for age, creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt; 40 mL/min/1.73m2 must be obtained (measured by 24hour (hr) urine specimen or nuclear glomerular filtration rate (GFR), or calculated GFR (by CockcroftGault formula for those aged ≥ 18 years; by Original Schwartz estimate for those &lt; 18 years)) 7. Subjects ≥ 18 years of age must have the ability to give informed consent according to applicable regulatory and local institutional requirements. Legal guardian permission must be obtained for subjects &lt; 18 years of age. Pediatric subjects will be included in age appropriate discussion in order to obtain assent. 8. Subjects with documentation of confirmed HIV1 infection (i.e. HIVpositive), and a hematologic malignancy who meets all other eligibility requirements must: 1. Receive only RIC regimen (i.e. Regimen A) 2. Be willing to comply with effective antiretroviral therapy (ARV) 3. Have achieved a sustained virologic response for 12 weeks after cessation of hepatitis C antiviral treatment (in HIVpositive subjects with hepatitis C) 1. HLAmatched related or 8/8 allele matched (HLAA, B, C, DRB1) unrelated donor available. This exclusion does not apply to HIVpositive subjects who have a CCR5delta32 homozygous donor. 2. Autologous HCT &lt; 3 months prior to the time of signing the informed consent form 3. Females who are breastfeeding or pregnant 4. HIVpositive subjects: 1. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) related syndromes or symptoms that may pose an excessive risk for transplantationrelated morbidity as determined by the Treatment Review Committee (see Appendix D). 2. Untreatable HIV infection due to multidrug ARV resistance. Subjects with a detectable or standard viral load &gt; 750 copies/mL should be evaluated with an HIV drug resistance test (HIV1 genotype). The results should be included as part of the ARV review (described in Appendix D). 3. May not be currently prescribed ritonavir, cobacistat and/or zidovudine 5. Current uncontrolled bacterial, viral or fungal infection (currently taking medication with evidence of progression of clinical symptoms or radiologic findings) 6. Prior allogeneic HCT 7. History of primary idiopathic myelofibrosis 8. MDS subjects may not receive RIC and must be &lt; 50 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent form 9. Subjects may not be eligible for inclusion in Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) 1101 protocol</criteria>
