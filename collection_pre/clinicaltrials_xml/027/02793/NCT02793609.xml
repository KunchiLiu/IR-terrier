	<brief_title>Outpatient Versus Inpatient Balloon Catheter Induction of Labor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to describe labor outcomes in women with double balloon induction catheter of labor. Participants included are women with uncomplicated singleton pregnancy of ≥37- ≤41+5 weeks of gestation. Patients are randomized to two groups: one hundred are randomized to the inpatient and one hundred to the outpatient group. The main outcome measure is the pain evaluated by VAS at one, five, nine and 13 hours after the placement of double balloon induction catheter. The total hospital stay and induction to delivery interval time is measured. Also the mode of birth as well as maternal and neonatal morbidity and patient satisfaction are recorded.</detailed_description>
