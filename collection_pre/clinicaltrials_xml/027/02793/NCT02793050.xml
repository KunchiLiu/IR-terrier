	<brief_title>Retrospective Study of Trabectedin in Soft Tissue Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a national, multi-centre observational retrospective and prospective chart review study of treatment patterns and clinical outcomes in a subset of patients with Soft Tissue Sarcoma who received trabectedin as per licensed indication. In the absence of availability of existing databases, a retrospective chart review design was selected. It is anticipated that the medical charts will contain the information required to answer study objectives. This chart review study will be conducted in 25 sites in Italy An estimated total of 900 charts will be abstracted. This study requires no intervention or interference with standard medical care, and thus it will not affect patient treatment. The study is sponsored by Italian Sarcoma Group Charts of patients who initiated trabectedin as part of the approved treatment for a Soft Tissue Sarcoma , will be identified by site staff. Each identified chart will be assigned a unique study identification number. Site staff will review the medical charts for all identified patients to determine patient eligibility. Those patients who meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled into the final study cohort as subject. Data from subject medical charts will be abstracted by local site study staff and entered at the site into an electronic data capture (EDC) system. The system will also facilitate the monitoring of the completeness and quality of study data as the study data accrue.</detailed_description>
