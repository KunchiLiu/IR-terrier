	<brief_title>Reliability of Waveform Analysis as an Adjunct to Loss of Resistance for Obstetrical Epidural Blocks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After loss of resistance, 5 mL of normal saline will be injected through the epidural needle; the latter will then be connected to a pressure transducer (leveled with the heart) using a rigid tubing. A pressure recording of the epidural waveform will be saved for future assessment by a blinded observer. After the recording of the waveform, the rigid tubing will be disconnected from the epidural needle. A 4 mL bolus of lidocaine 2% with epinephrine 5 µg/mL will be injected through the latter. An epidural catheter will be advanced 3-4 cm past the tip of the needle inside the epidural space. The needle will then be removed and the catheter secured to the skin in the usual fashion. Fifteen minutes after the injection of the local anesthetic bolus, a blinded observer will apply ice to the T1-L5 dermatomes and assess the epidural block.</detailed_description>
