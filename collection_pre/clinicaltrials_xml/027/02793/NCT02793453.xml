	<brief_summary>Periodontal diseases are complex chronic pathologies presenting a high prevalence worldwide. Etiopathological process involved in initiation and progression of these multifactorial diseases are not well understood, explaining the huge clinical forms variability and the complexity of the currently used classification of periodontal diseases. Recently, the implication of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been suggested as potential track of explanation for periodontal diseases pathogeny. The here presented study explore the level of expression of genes coding those peptides by studying periodontal smears obtained from healthy and periodontitis patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antimicrobial Peptides in Periodontitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study explore the level of expression of genes coding those peptides by studying Messenger RNA (mRNA) purified from periodontal smears obtained from healthy and periodontitis patients by "Masterpure©" protocol.After reverse transcription (RT-PCR), in-silico design of primers and specificity and efficiency calculation, Complementary DNA (cDNA) are quantified by a semi-quantitative method (delta-delta CT) vs a Housekeeping gene. Wilcoxon-Mann &amp; Whitney tests and Chi² tests are performed to check the significativity of the results between groups.</detailed_description>
