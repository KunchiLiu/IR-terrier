	<brief_summary>Shoulder pain is frequently mentioned in recent literature following laparoscopic operations. Several pain relief strategies have been proposed to decrease shoulder tip pain post laparoscopic surgeries. This study will be conducted to compare the Superficial cervical nerve block vs. NSAIDs in terms of shoulder tip pain relief after laparoscopic surgeries.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Superficial Cervical Nerve Block vs NSAIDs for the Relief of Shoulder Pain After Laparoscopic Surgeries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be conducted in the operating room and post anesthesia care unit (PACU) at Makassed General Hospital. This is a prospective double blind randomized clinical trial that will be conducted between June 2016 and June 2017 at Makassed General Hospital. Following the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, written informed consent will be obtained from patients. Patients will be randomly assigned using the sealed envelope technique into 2 groups. Group I will receive superficial cervical nerve block and intravenous saline. Group II will receive saline superficial cervical block and intravenous NSAID (Profenid). All patients will receive general anesthesia. General anesthesia is induced with 1 μg/kg fentanyl, 1.5-2 mg/kg propofol and 1-2 mg midazolam. Then, endotracheal intubation is facilitated by 0.15 mg/kg nimbex. Anesthesia is maintained by 1-1.5% sevoflurane, 0.5 μg/kg/h fentanyl, 0.05 mg/kg/h nimbex, 60% nitrous oxide and 40% oxygen. Any hemodynamic change of 25% results in a gradual increase or decrease of the sevoflurane concentration.</detailed_description>
