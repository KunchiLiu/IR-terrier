	<brief_title>Risk of Ectopic Pregnancy and Variation of Luteal Estradiol and Progesterone Levels in IVF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a retrospective cohort study of 578 patients who had no risk of EP (672 fresh transfer IVF cycles) between January 2005 and December 2014. Few studies have reported the relation between hormonal levels and ectopic pregnancy (EP) in IVF. Investigators describe EP incidence according to estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) levels on hCG day and seven days later (hCG+7) or their variation between both days.</detailed_description>
