	<brief_summary>Introduction: Native magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is recommended to assess the thoracic aorta during pregnancy, avoiding the risks of ionising radiation and contrast agent administration. This guidance is however, based only on consensus opinion supported by limited case reports (level of evidence C). Aim: To evaluate the feasibility of performing native 3D steady-state free-precession (SSFP) MRA in pregnant subjects with inherited aortopathy to guide timing and mode of delivery.</brief_summary>
