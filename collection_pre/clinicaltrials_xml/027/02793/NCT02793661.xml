	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Use of RenalGuard to Protect Patients at High Risk of AKI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Strength Trial is a randomized, international (France and Germany) and multicentre (7) trial. The patients population targeted is suffering from kidney insufficiency (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) between 15 to 40 ml/min/m2) need to go through a complex cardiovascular intervention.. This is a population of patients at high risk to develop AKI following contrast media administration and complex cardiovascular interventions require a high amount of contrast. Standard treatment is hydration but with risk of hyper and hypohydration for this population of patients. RenalGuard insure the replacement of the urine output by infusion of a matched volume of sterile replacement solution to maintain patients' intravascular fluid volume. The patients are randomized to be protected from contrast-induced nephropathy with the use of RenalGuard or by standard hydration treatment and will be followed-up during 12 months.</detailed_description>
