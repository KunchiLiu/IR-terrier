	<brief_title>Efficacy of CROWN in Repair and Maintenance of the Intestinal Mucosa in Patients With CD Receiving Anti-TNF Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an orally administered medical food (CROWN) in subjects with Crohn's Disease (CD) to support Standard Of Care (SOC) treatment in the repair and maintenance of the intestinal mucosa over a 24 week period. SOC is defined as completion of induction therapy with an anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) agent within 24 weeks of its initiation.</detailed_description>
