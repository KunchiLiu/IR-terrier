	<brief_summary>This is a diagnostic efficacy study to evaluate a set of biomarkers in human breath indicative of an acute malaria infection. The investigators plan to enroll 75 malaria patients and 175 febrile non-malaria patients in Ethiopia. Upon enrollment, blood for malaria RDT, microscopy and PCR will be collected as well as a breath sample to assess the presence of biomarkers at a reference center. Malaria patients identified by microscopy are revisited at day 2 and 7 to collect a further samples. G6PD testing will be performed concurrently to identify prevalent G6PD variants.</brief_summary>
