	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of standard care, versus standard of care plus antimicrobial therapy (co-trimoxazole or doxycycline), on clinical outcomes in patients diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CleanUP IPF for the Pulmonary Trials Cooperative</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, un-blinded, phase III, multi-center clinical trial of an antimicrobial therapy strategy in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients. Our overall hypothesis is that reducing harmful microbial impact with antimicrobial therapy will reduce the risk of non-elective, respiratory hospitalization or death in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to either receive a prescription drug voucher for oral antimicrobial therapy in the form of one double strength 160 milligrams (mg) trimethoprim/800mg sulfamethoxazole (double strength co-trimoxazole) twice daily plus folic acid 5 mg daily OR doxycycline 100mg once daily if weight &lt; 50 kilograms (kg) or 100mg twice daily if weight &gt; 50 kg. Patients randomized to receive antimicrobial therapy will be given co-trimoxazole unless they have an allergy, contraindication to co-trimoxazole, renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 30 milliliters (ml)), are hyperkalemic (potassium &gt; 5 milliequivalents(mEq)/liter(L)), or are concomitantly taking an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), or potassium sparing diuretic in which case they will receive doxycycline. Participation in this study will be between 12 months and 42 months depending on time of enrollment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. â‰¥ 40 years of age 2. Diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) by enrolling investigator 3. Signed informed consent 1. Received antimicrobial therapy in the past 30 days 2. Contraindicated for antibiotic therapy, including but not exclusive to: 1. Allergy or intolerance to both tetracyclines AND trimethoprim, sulfonamides or their combination 2. Allergy or intolerance to tetracyclines AND known potassium level &gt; 5 mEq/L in the past 6 months. If the enrolling physician feels the potassium level has normalized, documentation to that effect must be provided. 3. Allergy or intolerance to tetracyclines AND concomitant use of angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACEI), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), or potassium sparing diuretic 4. Allergy or intolerance to tetracyclines AND known glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency 5. Allergy or intolerance to tetracyclines AND untreated folate or B12 deficiency 6. Allergy or intolerance to tetracyclines AND known renal insufficiency (defined as a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 30 ml within the previous 6 months) If the enrolling physician feels the renal dysfunction has resolved, documentation to that effect must be provided. 3. Pregnant or anticipate becoming pregnant 4. Use of an investigational study agent for IPF therapy within the past 30 days.</criteria>
