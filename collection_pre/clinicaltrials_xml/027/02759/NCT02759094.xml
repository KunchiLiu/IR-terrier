	<brief_title>Evaluation of Safety and Effectiveness of the RefluxStop Device in the Management of GERD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective, open-label, multi-centre, single arm treatment only trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of RefluxStop for the treatment of GERD. The used medical device "RefluxStop" is an implantable single use sterile device to ensure maintenance of gastro oesophageal junction (GEJ) in an intra-abdominal position to reduce or eliminate GERD. The study plan will include a screening/baseline visit, a surgical procedure phase with hospital stay until discharge, and follow-up visits at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after device implantation. The study will include a part A (20 patients followed for 6 weeks) and a part B (the first 20 patients assessed at 3 months and 6 months, and the remaining 30 patients assessed at weeks, 3 months, and 6 months). An independent Safety Monitoring Board (SMB) will review the results of the first 20 patients after 6 weeks. The Board will also meet one month prior to the anticipated inclusion of 50 patients in order to recommend whether an increase of the sample size will be needed for safety documentation purposes.</detailed_description>
