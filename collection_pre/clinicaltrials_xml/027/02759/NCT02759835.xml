	<brief_summary>Background: Some non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC) have a mutation in a gene that makes a protein called EGFR. This particular cancer can be treated with certain drugs such as Erlotinib (Tarceva), Gefitinib (Iressa) and Osimertinib (Tagrisso). But many tumors become resistant to these drugs because of a second mutation. Researchers want to test if adding local ablative therapy (LAT) extends the benefits of the drug, Osimertinib. LAT can include techniques such as surgery, radiofrequency ablation, cryotherapy or radiation therapy. Objective: To test if re-taking osimertinib after LAT is safe, tolerable, and effective for people whose NSCLC has progressed after initial treatment with osimertinib. Eligibility: Adults ages 18 and older with certain types of NSCLC. Participants will be divided into various groups as described below. Design: Participants will be screened with: Medical history Physical exam Blood, urine, and heart tests Tumor scans Eye exam Review of tumor sample. Participants will take the study drug by mouth once a day. They will continue until they can no longer tolerate it or their disease worsens. They will keep a dosage diary. All participants will start each 21-day course with physical exam; blood, urine, and saliva tests; and electrocardiogram. They will have scans every 6 weeks and echocardiogram every 3 months. Groups 1 and 2 will: Start osimertinib right away. Have LAT if their disease gets worse and is suitable for LAT. If LAT cannot be performed or LAT consists of a procedure other than surgery, a tumor biopsy will be performed. Re-start osimertinib after LAT, or other treatments if not suitable for LAT. Group 3 will: Have LAT. If LAT consists of a procedure other than surgery, a tumor biopsy will be performed. Start osimertinib after LAT. After participants stop taking the drugs, they will have a final visit. This will include: Medical history Physical exam Heart and blood tests Participants will be called every year for follow-up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Local Ablative Therapy for Treatment of Oligoprogressive, EGFR-Mutated, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer After Treatment With Osimertinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: - EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have significantly improved the response rate (RR) and survival in patients with tumors harboring EGFR-sensitizing mutations. - An invariable consequence of treatment with EGFR-TKIs is the development of acquired resistance. The most common mechanism of resistance observed in approximately 50% of all cases is the emergence of a secondary mutation (T790M) in exon 20. - Osimertinib is a third-generation EGFR-TKI designed to target the T790M mutation, which has shown impressive responses in both first- and second-line settings. - Despite these developments, it is almost certain that selection pressure will lead to the emergence of newer clones that are resistant to treatment with osimertinib. In fact, a newly identified EGFR mutation (C797S) that results in acquired resistance to osimertinib has been reported recently. - The use of local ablative therapies for patients who develop limited metastatic disease oligoprogressive disease) on EGFR-TKI therapy is promising. - We hypothesize that following local ablative therapy to treat oligoprogressive disease after emergence of resistance to AZD9291, osimertinib can be resumed safely and reinitiation of osimertinib results in additional progression-free survival benefits. Objectives: - Determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy (as assessed by PFS) of re-initiation of osimertinib following local ablative therapy (LAT) for patients with oligoprogressive disease after treatment with osimertinib - Assess mechanisms of acquired resistance to osimertinib Eligibility: - Histologically confirmed advanced lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR-sensitizing somatic mutations or a germline T790M mutation and no prior EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy or progressive disease after 1st or 2nd generation EGFR TKI therapy harboring somatic T790M mutation or patients with progressive disease after treatment with osimertinib who are eligible for local ablative therapy. - Presence of measurable disease per RECIST version 1.1 - ECOG performance status 0-2 - Adequate end organ function - If patients are not eligible for LAT, they will be referred for standard of care chemotherapy as per treating physicians discretion. These patients may also be considered for other clinical trials. Design: - This is a single-arm, single-institution, open-label phase II trial of osimertinib. - Eligible patients not previously treated with osimertinib will be treated with osimertinib daily until disease progression. At the time of progression, patients with oligoprogressive disease (no more than 5 sites of progressive disease) will be assessed for LAT. - If patients are eligible for LAT, osimertinib will be resumed after LAT and they will be followed for second progression on osimertinib (PFS2). - If patients progress at the same site where LAT has been performed before, the progression will be considered to be a result of inadequate ablation and they will be considered for repeat LAT and again re-challenged with osimertinib if clinically feasible. - Tumor samples will be obtained at baseline by a mandatory biopsy. At the time of first progression on osimertinib if a patient is eligible for surgery as a form of LAT, then a tissue sample will be obtained for genomic and proteomic studies to identify mechanisms of acquired resistance. For patients who are not eligible for LAT or a form of LAT that is not surgery (radiation, radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation), then a mandatory biopsy will be performed, if clinically safe, to obtain tissue for above studies.</detailed_description>
