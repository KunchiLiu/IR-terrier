	<brief_summary>Nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC), Venous occlusion Plethysmography (VOP) and inflammatory biomarkers have been used to study endothelial function in patients with resistant hypertension, stages 1 and 2 hypertension and normotensive.

	<brief_title>Microcirculation and Inflammatory Markers in Patients With Resistant, Stages 1/2 Hypertension and Normal Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Microcirculation determines peripheral resistance contributing to increased blood pressure. The nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC), Venous occlusion Plethysmography (VOP) and biomarkers can be used to evaluate the microcirculation in arterial hypertension (AH). The objective of this study is to analyze the behavior of serum inflammatory markers and study the microcirculation by nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC) and Venous Occlusion Plethysmography in patients with resistant hypertension (RH), with stages 1 and 2 hypertension (MMH ) and normotensive (CG). A cross-sectional study with 75 patients has been performed: 25 with resistant hypertension (RH), 25 with stages 1 and 2 hypertension (MMH) and 25 normotensive (CG). All underwent anamnesis, dosage serum markers and conducting NVC, VOP. Hypertensive patients without statin use and with controlled or uncontrolled blood pressure were also analyzed. For the statistical analysis were used: Kruskal -Wallis ANOVA, Dunn test and ANCOVA for correction of confusion factors such as age and BMI.</detailed_description>
