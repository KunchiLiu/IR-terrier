	<brief_summary>Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder experienced by a subset of individuals following life-threatening trauma, such as sexual and physical assault, natural disasters, and military combat. Despite there being a number of treatments for PTSD, there is a need to help people who have treatment-resistant PTSD and do not benefit from these treatments as many individuals continue to experience marked PTSD symptoms following treatment. In response to overwhelming demand, several U.S. states have passed laws allowing the medical use of cannabis (marijuana) by individuals with PTSD. Unfortunately, there has been very little scientific evidence on suitability of cannabis as an alternative therapy for PTSD. The purpose of this study is to find out if cannabis can reduce PTSD symptoms in 76 military veterans with treatment-resistant PTSD. Four different types of smoked cannabis will be evaluated using a "triple-blind" cross-over placebo controlled design. Study participation will last 8.5 months. Participants will select a community observer, a friend or relative who can be contacted by the researchers, who will report on the participant's health and well-being throughout the study. After screening and meeting study requirements, participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of four types of cannabis that vary based on THC and CBD content. During the study, each participant will smoke two of the four types of cannabis, up to 1.8 grams per day, for a 3-week period. Participants can smoke their daily 1.8g cannabis at any time, using as much as they need. After each 3-week cannabis use period, they will stop smoking marijuana/cannabis for two weeks where no cannabis use will be allowed. Study findings will help researchers better understand the risks and benefits associated with cannabis use among veterans with PTSD, information that can be used to aid in shared decision-making among people with PTSD and their doctors or therapists.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Four Different Potencies of Smoked Marijuana in 76 Veterans With Chronic, Treatment-Resistant PTSD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), characterized by an inability to recover from a stress reaction to a traumatic event, is a widely prevalent disorder within the U.S. and across the world. Currently, several psychotherapies are empirically-supported for the treatment of PTSD. However, because of treatment refusal due to treatment type, non-response, and dropout, many individuals continue to experience severe symptoms and meet criteria for PTSD following treatment. Emerging observational and early clinical evidence suggest that cannabis (marijuana) may have the potential to reduce or ameliorate a number of symptoms experienced by those with PTSD, including sleep difficulty and anxiety. Indeed, some evidence has suggested that delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) may serve to reduce nightmares among those with PTSD, while other studies have shown anxiolytic effects of cannabidiol (CBD). However, there have been no randomized controlled trials of cannabis, in any form, for PTSD. The present triple-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial aims to examine the safety and efficacy of four types of cannabis (i.e., high THC, low CBD; high CBD, low THC; equal ratio THC/CBD; and placebo) among 76 military veterans with treatment-resistant PTSD. Participants will be recruited from one study site, the Scottsdale Research Institute (Phoenix, AZ). After giving written informed consent, participants will undergo screening for initial eligibility. Potential participants will be required to stop using non-study medical cannabis for two weeks during screening, and for the duration of the study if enrolled. After the two-week washout, a blinded independent rater will administer the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5) to assess presence and severity of PTSD symptoms. Self-report measures will also be completed. Eligible participants will then be enrolled and randomized. In the active portion of the study, participants will receive two of four different types of cannabis during two stages (Stage 1 and Stage 2), each lasting three weeks, with crossover and re-randomization at Stage 2. Prior to each stage, participants will complete two introductory sessions where they will be trained on cannabis self-administration. During each stage, participants will be provided 1.8 grams of cannabis daily to smoke ad libitum. Each stage will be followed by a two-week cessation. To reduce the risk of diversion, after the second cessation period, participants will have the option to complete a third stage of the study where they can request the remaining unused cannabis from either Stage 1 or 2. All participants will complete a six-month follow-up after completion of the experimental portion of the study. Study outcomes will be assessed objectively, behaviorally, via self-report, and by a third-party rater. Specifically, blood and urine will be collected to confirm cannabis use status throughout the study, participants will be required to video record self-administration of cannabis, and any unused cannabis from each weekly allotment will be returned to the investigator or designee to be weighed and accounted for prior to dispensing of the next weekly supply. Sleep will be measured via self-report and tracked with actigraphy, clinical interviews will be conducted by blinded independent raters, and a participant-identified community observer will provide an independent rating of participant behavior. Participant suicidal ideation will be assessed weekly with the C-SSRS, and daily if results indicate development of suicidal ideation. Weekly evaluations will include measures of symptoms of PTSD, depression, anxiety, sleep quality, general functioning, and responses to cannabis. During each evaluation, actigraph data will also be downloaded and a urine-dip EtG test will be performed. Analysis of blood/urine cannabinoids will be conducted after cessation periods, in addition to weekly urine drug screening for substances other than cannabis. At Baseline and end of Stage 1, Cessation 1 and end of Stage 2, additional blood samples will be collected for analysis of inflammation markers. At the end of Stage 1 and 2, endpoint measures will be administered; an independent rater will evaluate symptoms of PTSD on the CAPS-5 via telemedicine, and self-reported symptoms of anxiety, depression, withdrawal, sleep quality, and psychosocial functioning will be assessed.</detailed_description>
