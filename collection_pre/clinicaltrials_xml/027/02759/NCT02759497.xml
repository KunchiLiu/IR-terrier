	<brief_summary>One of the most common and serious complications in decompensated cirrhotic patients (DCPs) is bacterial infection.The most common infections in DCPs are cases of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which account for 40% 70% of cases, followed by urinary tract infections, pneumonia and cellulitis. Serum amyloid A (SAA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are acute-phase proteins predominantly produced and secreted by hepatocytes. Other cells including lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages can also produce these proteins. The induction of SAA and CRP synthesis is triggered by a number of cytokines, chiefly IL-6, which is released from a variety of cell types, but mainly from macrophages and monocytes at inflammatory sites</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Serum Amyloid A in Early Diagnosis of Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increased serum CRP and SAA levels have been found in a number of disorders, including bacterial infections, malignancies tissue injuries and tissue rejection. Therefore, new studies of early diagnosis, prevention and treatment are needed to improve clinical outcomes.</detailed_description>
