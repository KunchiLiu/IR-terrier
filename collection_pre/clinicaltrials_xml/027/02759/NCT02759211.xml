	<brief_summary>There have been no published studies to date on the effects of backwards walking in persons with MS. Thus it is important that the investigators explore different methods for treatment to help improve balance and gait and prevent injury in persons with MS with gait disturbances and balance impairments.The overall goal of this research is to collect pilot data on the effectiveness of backwards walking as a therapy for improving spatiotemporal, clinical gait and balance assessments in persons with Multiple Sclerosis compared to forward walking.</brief_summary>
