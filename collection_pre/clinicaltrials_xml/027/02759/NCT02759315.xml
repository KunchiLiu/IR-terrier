	<brief_summary>The study is a single-center, multiple-arm investigation of co-administration of MK-3682 450 mg and Ruzasvir (MK-8408) 60 mg in participants with chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Genotype (GT)1, GT2, GT3, GT4, GT5, or GT6. The impact of the study treatment regimen on Sustained Virologic Response (SVR)12 (undetectable HCV ribonucleic acid [RNA] 12 weeks after ending study treatment) for each HCV Genotype will be evaluated in cirrhotic participants and non-cirrhotic participants.</brief_summary>
