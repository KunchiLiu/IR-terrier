	<brief_summary>It is a single-center, prospective, randomized and controlled study focused in microsurgical autologous breast reconstruction. It involves applying indocyanine green (ICG) angiography for the study of the vascularization of DIEP flaps. The aim of the study is to determine whether there are differences in complications and aesthetic results when ICG is used to discard the poorly vascularized areas of the flap. The study includes adult women undergoing unilateral DIEP flap breast reconstruction. The calculated sample size is 60 patients. There are two groups. In group 1, the investigators use the usual clinical criteria to discard the poorly vascularized areas of the flap. In group 2, the investigators use the ICG to shape the flap.</brief_summary>
