	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if an avatar-based depression self-management intervention (eSMART-MH) once a week for the duration of the participant's radiation treatment will significantly reduce depressive symptoms. Investigators also seek to explore how women with breast cancer describe their mood using prompted and unprompted speech through electronic social media and interviews. Participants will be randomized into the eSMART-MH group or the theater testing (attention control) group. In addition to the assigned interventions, participants will be asked to complete questionnaires and interviews with the study staff.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine if an avatar-based depression self-management intervention (eSMART-MH) once a week for the duration of the participant's radiation treatment will significantly reduce depressive symptoms. Investigators also seek to explore how women with breast cancer describe their mood using prompted and unprompted speech through electronic social media and interviews. Participants will be randomized into the eSMART-MH group or the theater testing (attention control) group. In addition to the assigned interventions, participants will be asked to complete questionnaires and interviews with the study staff. Participants will be enrolled within two weeks of radiotherapy. A preliminary depression survey (IDS-SR) will be given to assess depression. There will be a total of three routine study assessments, one within two weeks prior to the beginning of radiotherapy, one the last week of radiotherapy and one 5 - 7 weeks after radiotherapy is completed.</detailed_description>
