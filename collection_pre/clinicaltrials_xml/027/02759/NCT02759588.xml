	<brief_title>GL-ONC1 Oncolytic Immunotherapy in Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ovarian cancer (OC) remains the most lethal gynecologic malignancy owing to late detection, intrinsic and acquired chemo-resistance and remarkable heterogeneity. There is an unmet medical need to develop new therapy modalities. In preclinical studies, GL-ONC1, has shown the ability to preferentially locate, colonize and destroy tumor cells in more than 30 different human tumors, including ovarian cancer. GL-ONC1 has been investigated in early stage clinical trials in the United States and Europe via systemic delivery as monotherapy and in combination with other therapies, and via regional delivery as monotherapy. GL-ONC1 treatment was well tolerated across different malignancies, routes of administration, and monotherapy as well as combination therapy protocols. The ability of GL-ONC1 to infect tumor tissue and kill tumor cells was demonstrated. In addition, virus-induced immune activation and favorable anti-tumor immune response have been observed. Evidences of anti-tumor efficacy and clinical benefits have also been documented.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Signed, written informed consent. Highgrade serous (including Malignant Mixed Mullerian Tumor (MMMT) with metastasis that contains high grade epithelial carcinoma), endometrioid, or clearcell ovarian cancer which includes: (1) platinumresistant (recurrence or progression in &lt; 6 months) or (2) platinumrefractory (progression while on platinumbased therapy); patient must have failed either at least 2 consecutive therapies or are not eligible for additional cytotoxic therapies. Intermediate platinumsensitive patients (recurrence of disease 6 to 12 months from last platinum compound treatment): Recurrent ovarian carcinoma with at least four prior individual treatment regimens including at least two separate platinumbased therapies with recurrence from the last platinumbased regimen less than 12 months, who are unwilling or unable to undergo additional platinumbased cytotoxic therapy. Performance status ECOG is at 0 or 1, and life expectancy of 6 months Has either measurable disease in the peritoneal cavity as defined by RECIST 1.1 or has nonmeasurable disease in the peritoneal cavity and can be confirmed by laparoscopy and/or elevated CA125. Patients who have nonmeasurable disease that is not identifiable by PET/PETCT scan, but who have elevated CA125, and/or ascites, with visible disease confirmed by laparoscopy are also eligible. Able to undergo IP injection. Adequate renal, hepatic and bone marrow functions. Tumors of mucinous subtypes, or nonepithelial ovarian cancers (e.g., Brenner tumors, Sexcord tumors). Unresolved bowel obstruction. Known central nervous system (CNS) metastasis. Known seropositivity for HIV, hepatitis. History of thromboembolic event within the last 3 months. Pregnant or breastfeeding women. Smallpox vaccination within 1 year of study treatment. Clinically significant cardiac disease. Received prior gene therapy or therapy with cytolytic virus of any type. Receiving concurrent antiviral agent active against vaccinia virus. Have known allergy to ovalbumin or other egg products. Have clinically significant dermatological disorders (e.g., eczema, psoriasis, or unhealed skin wounds or ulcers) as assessed by the Investigator.</criteria>
