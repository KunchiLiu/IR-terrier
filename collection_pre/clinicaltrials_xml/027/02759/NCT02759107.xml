	<brief_summary>The main purposes of this study are to determine: - The safety of LY3298176 and any side effects that might be associated with it. - How much LY3298176 gets into the bloodstream and how long it takes the body to get rid of it. - How LY3298176 affects the levels of blood sugar. This study includes 3 parts (A, B and C). Part A involves a single dose of LY3298176 taken as a subcutaneous (SC) injection just under the skin and will be approximately 10 weeks in duration, including screening. Parts B and C involve 4 doses of LY3298176 taken once weekly (over 4 weeks) as a SC injection just under the skin and is approximately 12-14 weeks in duration, including screening. Each participant will enroll in only one part. This study is for research purposes only, and is not intended to treat any medical condition.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy participants (Parts A and B) and participants with T2DM diagnosed at least 1 year before enrollment (Part C) Have a screening body mass index (BMI) of greater than 18.5 and less than or equal to 40.0 kilograms per meter squared (kg/mÂ²), inclusive Participants with T2DM (Part C only): have T2DM controlled with diet and exercise alone or are stable on a single oral antidiabetic medication (metformin for at least 30 days or sulfonylureas). Participants receiving sulfonylureas may participate only if this treatment is stopped for at least 6 weeks before dosing with study drug Have known allergies to LY3298176, glucagonlike peptide (GLP)1 analogs, or related compounds Have an abnormality in the 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at screening that, in the opinion of the investigator, increases the risks associated with participating in the study Have a history or presence of pancreatitis (history of chronic pancreatitis or idiopathic acute pancreatitis), elevation in serum amylase or lipase (greater than 2fold the upper limit of normal [ULN]) or gastrointestinal (GI) disorder (for example, relevant esophageal reflux or gall bladder disease) or any GI disease which impacts gastric emptying (for example, gastric bypass surgery, pyloric stenosis, with the exception of appendectomy) or could be aggravated by glucagonlike peptide1 (GLP1) analogs or dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)IV inhibitors Participants with T2DM (Part C only) Have had more than 1 episode of severe hypoglycemia, as defined by the American Diabetes Association criteria, within 6 months before entry into the study or has a history of hypoglycemia unawareness or poor recognition of hypoglycemic symptoms All Study Participants (Parts B and C only) have known allergies to LY3298176, GLP1 analogs, or related compounds, or acetaminophen</criteria>
