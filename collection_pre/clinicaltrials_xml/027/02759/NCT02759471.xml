	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, multi-center, subject-masked, bilateral wear, one month dispensing study comparing the clinical performance of the subjects' habitual comfilcon A sphere lens (control) following a refit with comfilcon A asphere lens (test). After the dispensing visit, subjects will return for follow-up evaluations after 2 weeks, and 1 month.
