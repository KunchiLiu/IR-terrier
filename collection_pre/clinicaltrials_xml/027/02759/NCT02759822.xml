	<detailed_description>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the most effective treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), with the lowest rates of relapse. Fertility rate in Brazil is falling, and only 25% of people born today will have a matched sibling donor. On the other hand, currently donor non-related to about 50% of patients enrolled in Brazilian Receptor Registry (REREME). Consequently, at least 35% of patients won't have a matched donor. The haploidentical transplantation is defined as a partially matched hematopoietic cell transplantation, using a partially matched family donor (parent, sibling or child). Haploidentical transplantation activity is growing worldwide, with results comparable matched unrelated donors. The objective of this study is to test the feasibility of haploidentical transplantation with post transplant cyclophosphamide for acute leukemias in a Brazil.</detailed_description>
