	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and receive a fully executed copy of the form. 2. The subject must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in this clinical protocol. 3. The subject must be between (and including) 18 and 39 years of age. 4. The subject must be an adapted wearer of spherical soft contact lenses in both eyes. That is, the subject must wear their habitual lenses at least five (5) days per week and eight (8) hours per day, worn for at least 30 days immediately preceding the study. 5. Have vertexcorrected distance refraction that allows a plano overrefraction with the available contact lens powers of 1.00 to 6.00 Diopters (D) in each eye. 6. Have refractive astigmatism, if present, of less than or equal to 1.00 D in each eye. 7. The subject must have best corrected visual acuity of 20/25 or better in each eye. 1. Currently pregnant or breastfeeding (subjects who become pregnant during the study will be discontinued). 2. Any ocular or systemic allergies or diseases that may interfere with contact lens wear. 3. Any autoimmune disease or use of medication, which may interfere with contact lens wear. 4. Entropion, ectropion, extrusions, chalazia, recurrent styes, glaucoma, history of recurrent corneal erosions, or aphakia. 5. Any previous, or planned, ocular or interocular surgery (e.g., radial keratotomy, photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), laserassisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), etc.). 6. Any grade 3 or greater slit lamp findings (e.g., edema, corneal neovascularization, corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival injection) on the FDA classification scale, any previous history or signs of a contact lensrelated corneal inflammatory event (e.g., past peripheral ulcer or round peripheral scar), or any other ocular abnormality that may contraindicate contact lens wear. 7. Any ocular infection. 8. Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact lens wear. 9. Monovision, multifocal, toric, or extended wear contact lens correction. 10. Participation in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 14 days prior to study enrollment. 11. History of binocular vision abnormality or strabismus that is likely to affect successful contact lens wear. 12. Any infectious disease (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis) or contagious immunosuppressive diseases (e.g., HIV) by selfreport.</criteria>
