	<brief_summary>Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) has been used in the treatment of several types of malignant tumors, including malignant melanoma, high-grade gliomas, and advanced head and neck cancers. Theoretically, it represents a more precise radiotherapy in that it could spare normal cells while destroy malignant ones. However, its value is largely restricted by the fact that it could only be performed in the nuclear research reactors, the only neutron source at the time. In 2010, the world's first in-hospital neutron irradiator (IHNI) had been constructed in Beijing, China, and this study aims to evaluate whether IHNI has the potential to serve as an effective in-hospital neutron source for BNCT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>In-hospital Neutron Irradiator (IHNI)-Based Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) in the Treatment of Malignant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single BNCT-facility, non-randomized, non-comparative, open-label, phase I to II clinical trial to determine the value of IHNI in the performance of BNCT. Before patients are recruited in this study, they must have been confirmed as malignant melanoma by biopsy and pathological analysis. Then they will receive a boron bio-distribution test, only patients whose boron concentration in tumor tissue is &gt;1.5 times that in the blood will be enrolled. Before patients being irradiated in IHNI, they will be infused Boronophenylalanine (BPA)-fructose solution intravenously at a dose of 350mg/kg over 90 minutes, and then blood will be withdrawn from the patient at different time points to measure boron concentration. The start point and duration of irradiation will be determined based on the boron concentration in blood and the boron bio-distribution curve. IHNI locates in Fangshan District, Beijing, China. The recruitment of patients, and their evaluation and medical care before and after BNCT will be done in the Third Xiangya Hospital, Changsha, China. All patients will be evaluated for response by biopsy and pathological analysis, Positron Emission Computed Tomography (PET-CT), Computed Tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</detailed_description>
