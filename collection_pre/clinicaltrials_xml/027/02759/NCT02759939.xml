	<brief_summary>Right For Me is a study that aims to improve the conversations patients and health care providers have about birth control. Right For Me will test two different strategies for improving these conversations. The first strategy is to give patients a video to watch that encourages them to ask three specific questions in their health care visit, as well as a prompt card that reminds them of the three questions. The second strategy is to give health care providers a set of decision aids that describe available birth control methods, as well as training in how to use them with patients during the health care visit. Right For Me will test whether introducing one or both of these strategies leads to better conversations than providing health care as usual.</brief_summary>
