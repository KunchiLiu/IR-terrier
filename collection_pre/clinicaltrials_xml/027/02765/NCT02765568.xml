	<brief_summary>Coronary revascularization improves survival for patients with coronary artery disease. However,many patients are left with poor physical and mental health. Traditional cardiac rehabilitation involves moderate intensity continuous exercise (MICE). Alternatives to traditional cardiac rehabilitation programming may however provide superior understudied benefits to patients with poor physical and mental health. Nordic walking (NW) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) are two examples of alternative programs for cardiac rehabilitation, which may provide superior physical and mental health benefits when compared to traditional MICE. The main purpose of this project is, therefore, to determine the short and long term physical and mental health benefits of alternative cardiac rehabilitation modalities, including NW and HIIT on exercise capacity, quality of life and depression after a 12-week program.</brief_summary>
