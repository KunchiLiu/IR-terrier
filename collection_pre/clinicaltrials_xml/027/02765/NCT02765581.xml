	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of verum acupuncture (VA) for the prevention of migraine without aura compared to non-penetrating sham acupuncture (SA) and usual care alone (UC). This study also aims to determine whether the intensity of deqi sensations and psychosocial factors (including patient expectations, patient personality traits, patient-doctor relationship, traditional Chinese medicine constitution, depression, anxiety, sleep quality, etc.) are associated with clinical outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Acupuncture in the Prevention of Migraine Without Aura</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trail consists of three periods: baseline period before treatment and randomization (week-4 to week 0), treatment period (week 1 to week 8), and follow-up period (week 9 to week 20).A total of 150 participants will be randomly assigned to verum acupuncture(VA)group, sham acupuncture(SA)group, and usual care(UC) group in a ratio of 2:2:1. The primary outcome measures are the change of migraine days and migraine attacks in a cycle of 4 weeks compared to baseline. The secondary outcome measures are the proportion of responders, headache intensity, intake of acute medication, and the change of life quality and sleep quality. Deqi sensations will be measured by the Chinese version of the Massachusetts General Hospital Acupuncture Sensation Scale. Psychological outcome measures are Beck Depression Rating Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, NEO Five-Factor Inventory, Doctor-Patient Relationship Scale, and Difficult Doctor-Patients Relationship Scale. Participants will be asked to complete headache diaries from the baseline to follow-up period. The central randomization and data collection will be conducted by an electronic data management system.</detailed_description>
