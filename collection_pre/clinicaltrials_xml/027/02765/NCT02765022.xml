	<criteria>18 years and older Clinical indication of endoscopic mucosal resection for largesized (≥ 2cm) nonpedunculated colorectal lesions. Mediumhigh risk of delayed bleeding (DB risk score ≥ 4) Informed consent. Patients with colorectal nonpedunculated lesions without endoscopic mucosal resection indication. Lesions resected by endoscopic submucosal resection. Incomplete resections. Resections with suspected deep submucosal invasion. Mucosal defects treated with clips for known or suspected damage to the muscle layer. Lesions with low risk of delayed bleeding (DB risk score ≤3). Patients with any other medical, geographic or social condition, deemed by the Investigator to be likely to interfere with a patient's ability to sign informed consent, cooperate and participate in the study, or interfere with the interpretation of the results.</criteria>
