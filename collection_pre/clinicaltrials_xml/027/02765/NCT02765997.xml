	<brief_summary>This is an open label, interventional, randomized phase II trial comparing StemRegenin-1 (SR-1) cultured umbilical cord blood (experimental arm) to unmanipulated umbilical cord blood (standard of care arm) transplantation after a myeloablative CY/FLU/TBI conditioning. A 2:1 randomization will be employed with a higher chance of being assigned to the experimental arm.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Must have a partially HLA matched UCB unit with a precryopreserved TNC dose &gt;2.5 x 107 per kilogram recipient weight. HLA matching is initially based on 4 of 6 HLAA and B (at low or intermediate resolution by molecular typing) and DRB1 (at high resolution by molecular typing). Eligible Diseases Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) at the following stages: Intermediate to high risk leukemia in first complete remission (CR1) based on institutional criteria. Any second or subsequent CR. Secondary AML with prior malignancy that has been in remission for at least 12 months. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) at the following stages: High risk first remission. 1. Ph+ ALL, or 2. MLL rearrangement with slow early response at Day 14, or 3. Hypodiploidy (&lt; 44 chromosomes or DNA index &lt; 0.81), or 4. End of induction M3 bone marrow, or 5. End of induction M2 with M23 at Day 42. High risk second CR based on institutional criteria (eg, for children, bone marrow relapse &lt;36 months from induction or Tlineage bone marrow relapse or very early isolated central nervous system (CNS) relapse &lt;6 months from diagnosis, or slow reinduction (stage M23 at day 28 after induction) regardless of length remission. Any third or subsequent CR. Biphenotypic/undifferentiated leukemia in CR Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) excluding refractory blast crisis Myelodysplasia (MDS) IPSS Int2 or High risk (i.e. RAEB, RAEBt) or refractory anemia Other Inclusion Criteria Karnofsky score &gt;70% (16 years and older) or a Lansky play score &gt;70 (children &lt;16 years) appendix II Adequate organ function defined as: Renal: Serum creatinine within normal range for age, or if serum creatinine outside normal range for age, then renal function (creatinine clearance or GFR) &gt;70 mL/min/1.73 m2. Hepatic: Bilirubin â‰¤2.5 x mg/dL; AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase &lt;5 x upper limit of normal, Pulmonary function: DLCO, FEV1, FEC (diffusion capacity) &gt;50% of predicted (corrected for hemoglobin); if unable to perform pulmonary function tests, then normal O2 saturation on room air. Cardiac: Left ventricular ejection fraction at rest must be &gt;45% Available 'backup' HSPC graft (e.g, second partially HLA matched UCB unit, haploidentical related donor). Voluntary written consent signed (adult or parental) before performance of any studyrelated procedure not part of normal medical care Pregnant or breast feeding. The agents used in this study may be teratogenic to a fetus and there is no information on the excretion of agents into breast milk. Females of childbearing potential must have a blood test or urine study within 14 days prior to study enrollment to rule out pregnancy. Evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or known HIV positive serology. Active bacterial, viral or fungal infection (currently taking medication and progression of clinical symptoms). Prior autologous or allogeneic transplant within past 12 months. Other active malignancy. Inability to receive TBI 1320 cGy (e.g., extensive prior therapy including &gt;12 months alkylator therapy or &gt;6 months alkylator therapy with extensive radiation. Or prior Y90 ibritumomab (Zevalin) or I131 tostumomab (Bexxar), as part of their salvage therapy.</criteria>
