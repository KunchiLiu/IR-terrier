	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, parallel-group, single-dose study of the PK and safety of 400 mg pacritinib administered orally to patients with stable chronic liver disease and healthy control subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Determine Pacritinib Pharmacokinetics in Impaired Hepatic Patients and Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All study participants will undergo screening evaluations to determine eligibility for the study. All screening evaluations must be performed within 28 days of pacritinib dosing (Day 1). Assignment of patients to each hepatic impairment group will be defined by Child-Pugh Clinical Assessment Score at the time of Screening. Group 3 patients will not be dosed until at least 2 patients combined from Groups 1 and 2 have completed the study (Day 8). Healthy subjects will be enrolled after hepatic impairment accrual is complete to allow for age-, gender- and body mass index- (BMI) matching with the hepatic impairment population. Participants will be admitted to the study site on Day -1 (i.e., Check-in). On Day 1, upon receipt of all baseline safety evaluation results and confirmation of eligibility, study participants will be administered a single dose of 400 mg pacritinib orally under fasting conditions. Fasting will start 10 hours prior to pacritinib administration and continue for an additional 4 hours after administration. Following administration of pacritinib, participants will remain confined to the study site for 168 hours (8 days) after pacritinib dosing for collection of blood for PK and safety assessments.</detailed_description>

ChildPugh Clinical Assessment Score consistent with degree of hepatic impairment that is not attributable to any other underlying disease 10. Patients assigned to a hepatic impairment group must be evaluable and meet criteria for hepatic impairment per the ChildPugh Clinical Assessment Score Healthy subjects only 11. Healthy subjects will be identified after all hepatic impairment patients have been enrolled and the healthy subject group will have similar distributions of age (by hepatic impairment population quartiles), BMI (by hepatic impairment population quartiles) and gender 12.
