	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial. After a 2-week run-in period, eligible patients will be, based on the randomization codes kept in sealed envelopes, randomly assigned to receive usual care (mucolytics and/or chest physiotherapy) plus oxygen inahaltion (1 hr daily for 12 consecutive months) or hydrogen inhalation (1 hr daily for 12 consecutive months) provided by the sponsor. At 3 months after the end-of-treatment, a follow-up visit will be scheduled for all patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Hydrogen Inhalation on Bronchiectasis: A Randomized, Multi-center, Double-blind Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial. After 2-week run-in period, eligible patients will be, based on the randomization codes kept in sealed envelopes, randomly assigned to two groups.On the basis of usual care [ambroxool (30mg thrice daily), or N-acetylcysteine (0.2g thrice daily)/ serrapeptase (10mg thrice daily), or carbocisteine (500mg thrice daily) and/or chest physiotherapy (10 min, twice daily)], patients were randomized to receive either hydrogen (66.7%, 3L/min, 1 hr twice daily) inhalation or oxygen inhalation (3L/min, 1 hr twice daily) via nasal canula for 12 months. A follow-up visit at month 3 following end-of-treatment was also scheduled. The primary endpoint was the annual frequency of bronchiectasis exacerbations. Hospital visits were scheduled at baseline and months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15, respectively. At 3 months after the end-of-treatment, a follow-up visit will be scheduled for all patients.</detailed_description>
