	<brief_title>The Effect of Liraglutide Treatment on Postprandial Chylomicron and VLDL Kinetics, Liver Fat and de Novo Lipogenesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The well recognized dyslipidemia in people with type 2 diabetes consists of high fasting and non-fasting plasma triglycerides (TG), low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) -cholesterol and preponderance of small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles nominated as the atherogenic lipid triad. Humans are mostly in a postprandial rather than fasting state and therefore non-fasting TG values reflect more accurately the continuous exposure of arterial wall to triglyceride rich lipoproteins (TRLs) and more importantly, to substantial cholesterol load that these particles deliver. Postprandial lipemia is highly prevalent even in type 2 diabetes patients with normal fasting TG concentrations. Intestinal overproduction of chylomicrons (CMs) and the structural protein apolipoprotein (apo)-B48 has been identified as an integral feature of postprandial lipemia in type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. It is clinically important to elucidate the mechanism for delayed postprandial lipemia and the interactions between dysglycemia and dyslipidemia in type 2 diabetes patients.</detailed_description>
