	<brief_summary>This purpose of this study is to determine if tongue strength and tongue ultrasound measurements differentiates patients with untreated late-onset Pompe Disease (LOPD) from patients with acquires/hereditary myopathies or neuropathies. It is hypothesized that abnormalities in tongue function and structure in patients with LOPD may be useful in discriminating this condition from others that have similar presentations.</brief_summary>
