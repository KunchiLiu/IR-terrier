	<brief_title>Effects of Training Rhythmic and Discrete Aiming Movements on Arm Control and Functionality After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Seventy-five patients will be randomized into three groups to receive conventional therapy, consisting of a combination of mobility exercises joint, muscle stretching, strength training, motor coordination exercises, unilateral and bilateral motor tasks as well as oriented tasks training upper limb with a focus on functional tasks. The other groups will receive additional intervention consisting of aiming movement practice according two different protocols: discrete movements to targets placed in different directions and distances; and rhythmic movements also to targets placed in different directions and distances. Both additional interventional interventions will be conducted for 30 minutes over a 5 week-period (total: 10 sessions). Clinical outcomes (motor control), functional and kinematic will be collected at baseline and at five weeks. Functional results will be collected at the beginning, after 5 weeks and 3 months after randomization. Data will be collected by a blinded assessor on patients' allocation group. All statistical analyzes will be carried out following the principles of intention to treat analysis and differences between groups will be performed using linear mixed models.</detailed_description>
