	<brief_summary>Tourette syndrome is a complex neuropsychological disorder with both motor and vocal tics associated with multiple psychological co-morbidities. Apathy has not been widely studied in patients with Tourette syndrome. Apathy can result in decrease in self-care and disease control. In this study investigators will compare the occurrence of apathy in the adolescent Tourette syndrome population (at the UF center for movement disorders and Neurorestoration) to an age and gender matched control population. Investigators will also assess the role of commonly used medications in the Tourette population (neuroleptics and selective serotonin receptor inhibitors) in the occurrence of apathy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Apathy in Tourette Syndrome and Changes in Quality of Life</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tourette syndrome(TS) is a complex neuropsychological disorder with both motor and vocal tics associated with multiple psychological co-morbidities. The most common co-morbidities include obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and depression. Apathy has not been extensively studied in the Tourette syndrome population. Apathy is currently defined as reduced motivation, with symptoms in at least two of three domains of reduced initiative, reduced interest and/or reduced emotional responsiveness. A study assessed the prevalence of apathy in multiple movement disorders and reported that apathy is much more common in disorders associated with slowed movements like Parkinson disease while less common in disorders with increased movements like Huntington disease and Tourette syndrome in adults. However, no apathy studies in adolescent patients with Tourette syndrome are published. Disengagement from treatment may affect health outcomes in other disease states. Apathy has significant effects on the quality of life and health outcomes in many patients. Apathy can be a direct manifestation of the neuropsychological process (intrinsic to the disease) or can be secondary to medication side effects most notably anti-dopaminergic agents and some reports of selective serotonin receptor inhibitors (SSRI). Further attention to the prevalence and impact of apathy in the adolescent Tourette syndrome population is needed to explore if this may be a factor influencing TS management and ultimately Quality of life (QOL). Multiple psychotropic medications are used in the management of tics as well as the psychological co-morbidities. How these medications affect apathy prevalence in Tourette syndrome patients is not known.</detailed_description>
