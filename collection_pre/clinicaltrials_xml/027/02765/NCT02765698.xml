	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of PET/MRI (Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging) to give physicians preoperative information about specific sites in the body that the endometrial cancer may be present. If the PET/MRI is accurate and successful in providing this information, then women in the future may be able to have less extensive surgery for their endometrial cancer after evaluation with PET/MRI.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of PET/MRI in Detecting Metastatic Disease in Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PET/MRI has recently become available at the institution and reports of its sensitivity, specificity, NPV (Negative predictive value) , PPV (Positive predictive value), and accuracy in endometrial cancer are not found in the literature to date, to the best of the investigator's knowledge. The GE PET/MRI recently obtained here at Mayo, Rochester has the potential to improve the sensitivity of detection of metastatic disease, compared to other imaging modalities, because of its superior PET technology and updated Q Clear software. For these reasons it is reasonable to expect improved sensitivity to detect metastatic disease in endometrial cancer, possibly proving PET/MRI to be a superior modality for preoperative screening and potentially allowing for less morbid surgical management for patients with high risk endometrial cancer.</detailed_description>
