	<brief_summary>Pulmonary hypertension (PH) features symptoms related to a decreased cardiac autonomic response, pulmonary function and exercise capacity. Non-pharmacological interventions are low cost and can significant enhance outcomes in these patients. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) has been proposed as a viable therapeutic approach in patients with functional limitations, particularly those that present with difficulty to perform exercise protocols. Objective: to evaluate the impact of NMES on exercise capacity, spirometry values and quality of life of patients with PH. Material and methods: prospective randomized controlled study with a control group (GC, n9) and NMES goup (GE, n8). Quality of life and exercise capacity through the six-minute walk test (6MWT) were assessed before and after the NMES protocol. Results: the GE presented with a significant improvement in distance walked in the 6MWT, cycle ergometry, spirometry and quality of life in the areas of vitality, emotional and social aspects of the questionnaire Short Form Health Survey-36. Conclusion: NMES is a useful tool in the treatment of patients with PH, resulting in improved exercise capacity, quality of life and lung function testing.</brief_summary>
