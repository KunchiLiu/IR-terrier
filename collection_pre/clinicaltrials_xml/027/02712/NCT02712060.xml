	<brief_summary>Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of inherited connective tissue disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. EDS features such as genetically related cartilage defects, craniofacial abnormalities and increased pharyngeal collapsibility have been proposed to cause obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). There is evidence from studies based on questionnaires that EDS patients might be more frequently affected by OSA and sleep disturbances than the general population. However, the actual prevalence of OSA in children and adolescents with EDS is unknown. The primary objective of this study is to assess the prevalence of OSA in children and adolescents with EDS (25) compared to a matched control group (25). The secondary objective of this pioneer study is to assess the quality of life in children and adolescents in EDS in comparison to healthy children and adolescents.</brief_summary>
