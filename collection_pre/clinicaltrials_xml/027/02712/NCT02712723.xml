	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if ribociclib in combination with letrozole for 24 weeks as neoadjuvant endocrine therapy increases the proportion of women with Pre-operative Endocrine Prognostic Index (PEPI) score of 0 at surgery compared to patients treated with letrozole alone therefore allowing more patients excellent outcomes without chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Letrozole Plus Ribociclib or Placebo as Neo-adjuvant Therapy in ER-positive, HER2-negative Early Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be randomized (1:1:1) to either letrozole plus placebo vs. letrozole plus continuous dosing of ribociclib vs. letrozole plus intermittent dosing (3-weeks-on/1-week-off) of ribociclib. The difference in clinical, pathologic and radiologic response as well as Pre-operative Endocrine Prognostic Index (PEPI) scores across the three treatments arms will be examined. Subjects will also be followed for 5 years post-treatment to determine if ribociclib in combination with letrozole for 24 weeks results in improved 5 year Relapse Free Survival (RFS) compared to letrozole alone.</detailed_description>
