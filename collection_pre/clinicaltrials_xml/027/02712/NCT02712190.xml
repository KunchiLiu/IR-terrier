	<brief_title>Evaluation of Prolonged Apnea Supported by High Frequency Non-invasive Ventilation.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High frequency ventilation (HF-V) allows to ensure oxygen delivery and carbon dioxide clearance despite the absence of thoracic movement in anesthetized, invasively ventilated subjects. This same technique could be applied by a non-invasive interface (HF-NIV), allowing to obtain a prolonged apnea (absence of thoraco-abdominal respiratory movements) in awaken subjects. Such an application would be of interest for several clinical applications, e.g. lung imaging and radio-therapy treatment on lung cancer. The purpose of the study is to assess the effect of different HF-NIV setting on the apnea duration, carbon dioxide clearance and oxygen delivery in healthy subjets and patients with lung diseases.</detailed_description>
