	<brief_summary>Recent preclinical study has suggested a potential possibility that imatinib might promote tumor growth in the presence of secondary resistance mutations [10]. This result imply that intermittent dosing schedule of imatinib rechallenge might be better than continuous dosing schedule in terms of controlling tumors harboring secondary resistance mutations. In addition, in these heavily pretreated patients, even mild grade of toxicity may significantly impair quality of life, and intermittent dosing schedule may have an advantage in this context. Therefore, investigators hypothesize that intermittent dosing schedule of imatinib rechallenge might be feasible and effective in patients with TKI-refractory GISTs. This study will assess the feasibility of intermittent imatinib dosing schedule in patients with GISTs who had failures from both imatinib and sunitinib.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Intermittent Dosing Schedule of Imatinib in Patients With Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Refractory GISTs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be randomly assigned to an imatinib arm with either intermittent or continuous dosing schedule with a ratio of 1:1 by using a computer-based system. Imatinib will be administered at a dose of 400 mg/day, once a day with food, in the form of 100-mg tablets. Patients assigned to the continuous dosing arm will receive imatinib without off-schedule, and those assigned to the intermittent dosing arm will received imatinib with one-week on/one-week off dosing schedule. Four weeks of study treatment is considered as one cycle for both continuous and intermittent dosing schedules. In both arms, the imatinib treatment beyond multiple progressions defined by RECIST version 1.1 is permitted, unless treating physician decided that there is no clinical benefit with imatinib. Imatinib will be discontinued when unacceptable toxicity or patient's withdrawal of consent.</detailed_description>
