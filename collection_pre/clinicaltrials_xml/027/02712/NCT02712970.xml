	<brief_title>Staging System for Chronic Symptomatic Pilonidal Sinus Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The collected data of patients who underwent surgery for the treatment of pilonidal sinus disease prior to June 2011 were analyzed. Following this analysis, a staging system was defined based on morphological extent of disease (stage I to stage IV for primary disease, and stage R for recurrent disease). Specific surgical technique was used for each stage. "Pit-picking" technique was performed under local anesthesia on an outpatient basis in stage I and stage IIa patients. For stage IIb and stage III patients, the Bascom Cleft Lift /modified Bascom Cleft Lift techniques were performed. For stage IV patients, the rhomboid excision with the Limberg flap technique was used. Demographics, perioperative data, short-term and long-term outcomes were evaluated according to the disease stage.</detailed_description>
