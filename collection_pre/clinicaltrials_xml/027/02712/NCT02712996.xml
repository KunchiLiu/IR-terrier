	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to evaluate whether Vyvanse, a psychostimulant, can help children ages 6-16 with attention deficits due to traumatic brain injury (TBI). Vyvanse is currently approved for the treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity (ADHD). The exact effects this drug may have on adults with attention deficits caused by TBI have been investigated prior. The exact effects this drug may have on children with attention deficits caused by TBI are not known, but the investigators expect that Vyvanse will be of some help in treating this population as well.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)-Related Attention Deficits in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Symptoms of inattentiveness, impulsivity, and poor persistence have been observed in children following traumatic brain injury (TBI). These often are among the most prominent symptoms manifested and may contribute to interference in a variety of other functional domains. Although there has been some use of psychostimulant medication to treat TBI-acquired attention deficits, it remains a relatively uncommon clinical practice. This study, by highlighting mechanisms of action, could serve to promote the appropriate use of this type of treatment for the patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males and females ages 6 to 16 Closed head injury rated as mild/moderate/severe (based on Glasgow Coma Scale, estimated posttraumatic amnesia, indications of intracranial injury on CT scan, etc.) Sustained 436 months earlier Considered to be neurologically stable (absence of postacute symptoms of confusion, disorientation, etc.) Persistent (&gt; 4 months) problems with focused or sustained attention Problems with attention/concentration rated as among the most prominent cognitive changes Accompanying features may include diminished arousal/speed/stamina and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms. Preinjury history of diagnosed ADHD Preinjury history of other neurodevelopmental disorders including intellectual disabilities, communication disorders, autism spectrum disorder, specific learning disorders, etc. Unstable or serious psychiatric conditions, such as psychotic symptoms. Concurrent problems with depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic stress disorder may be present but are judged to be stable and not so severe as to require pharmacologic treatment Prior treatment with psychostimulant(s) Lifetime history of stimulant abuse or dependence. Other (nonstimulant) substance abuse within the past 6 months. Total lifetime drug cannot exceed five times each for substances such as amphetamine, methamphetamine, or cocaine. Tics or other contraindications for psychostimulant use including cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension or hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, agitation, use of an monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor within the past six weeks. Pregnancy would also be an exclusion for girls of childbearing age. Current treatment with other psychotropic medication(s) within the past 6 weeks (but eligible thereafter) Estimated intelligence quotient (IQ) &lt; 70 Sensory and/or motor impairment(s) seriously limiting testing options Neurological conditions including epilepsy, degenerative disorders, brain tumor, or stroke Physical condition affecting arousal, activity level, or stamina including uncontrolled thyroid dysfunction, severe or symptomatic anemia, autoimmune or metabolic disorders, untreated moderate/severe sleep apnea, etc.</criteria>
