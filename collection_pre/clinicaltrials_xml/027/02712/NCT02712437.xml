	<brief_summary>Women with early stage breast cancer may experience difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep. If this occurs for more than 4 weeks, these participants may have chronic insomnia. Chronic insomnia can lead to difficulty coping with stress, changes in mood, increased use of medications for sleep and an overall decrease in quality of life. The investigators have developed an internet-based website that is designed to help people manage symptoms typically experienced by breast cancer survivors, including insomnia, fatigue, pain and overall poor quality of life. The investigators want to learn whether this type of treatment can reduce chronic insomnia and improve the way subjects feel using both questionnaires and a special form of a wrist watch. This information may help the investigators better manage sleep difficulties in subjects who experience these symptoms after diagnosis of their breast cancer.</brief_summary>
