	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to support the selection of a safe and tolerable tobramycin inhalation powder (TIP) dose, and regimen that exhibits effective bacterial reduction of P. aeruginosa in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (BE) patients with P. aeruginosa colonization.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed. Male and female patients of ≥ 18 years of age at screening (Visit 1). Proven diagnosis of nonCF BE as documented by computed tomography or highresolution computed tomography At least 2 or more exacerbations treated with oral antibiotics OR 1 or more exacerbation requiring intravenous antibiotic treatment within 12 months prior to screening. FEV1 ≥ 30% predicted at screening (Visit 1). P. aeruginosa, must be documented in a respiratory sample at least 1 time within 12 months and also present in the expectorated sputum culture at Visit 1. Patients with a history of cystic fibrosis. Patients with a primary diagnosis of bronchial asthma. Patients with a primary diagnosis of COPD associated with at least a 20 pack year smoking history. Any significant medical condition that is either recently diagnosed or was not stable during the last 3 months, other than pulmonary exacerbations, and that in the opinion of the investigator makes participation in the trial against the patients' best interests. History of hearing loss or chronic tinnitus deemed clinically significant by the investigator. Patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis. Patients currently receiving treatment for nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) pulmonary disease. Patients who are regularly receiving inhaled antipseudomonal antibiotic (during the study inhaled antipseudomonal antibiotics are not allowed other than the study drug).</criteria>
