	<brief_title>Quality of Life in Patients With Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A cohort of adult (age ≥ 18) patients with a diagnosis of PSC will be identified. The patients will be approached about participating in the study while at their appointment, either by the investigators or someone else known to the patient. If the patient agrees, the investigators or other key personnel will then provide information about the study and obtain their informed consent to participate. The patients who consent to participate will be sent home from the clinic with a survey to complete and return via mail in a provided addressed, stamped envelope. The survey consists of the Short Form-36 (SF-36), the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ), questions from the PROMIS SexFs v2.0, questions regarding perceived risk for liver transplant, cholangiocarcinoma, and colorectal carcinoma, as well as perceived overall life expectancy, and questions regarding complementary and alternative medicine use. Demographic information and clinical data will also be obtained from the patient's electronic medical record. The study will be cross-sectional in nature, and there will be no follow-up with the subjects after the survey is completed.</detailed_description>
