	<detailed_description>Determine a bleeding threshold by measuring the blood volume in ml / kg / h collected in the drainage system to define moderate bleeding postoperative cardiac surgery and define the population. Secondary objectives: To evaluate the kinetics of moderate SPORT and its impact on anemia and postoperative transfusion. To evaluate the prognostic impact of the SPO moderate in terms of post-operative complications. Determine predictors of moderate SPO.</detailed_description>
