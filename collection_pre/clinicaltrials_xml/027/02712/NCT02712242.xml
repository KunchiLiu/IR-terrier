	<brief_summary>Backgroung: Various agents are used to reduce post-operative complications associated with palatal donor site surgery for free gingival graft (FGG) harvesting. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) on palatal wound healing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PRF for Accelerating Palatal Healing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>125 patients with isolated recessions were treated. The connective tissue graft was obtained by the de-epithelialization of a free gingival graft in both groups. Three different hemostatic treatments were randomized; PRF with cyanoacrilate adhesive (PRF group, n:42), cyanoacrilate adhesive alone (BC group, n:42) and sterile wet gauze compression (WG group, n:41). Immediate and delayed bleeding, pain, epithelialization, feeding habits and sensation scores were recorded for different time points.</detailed_description>
