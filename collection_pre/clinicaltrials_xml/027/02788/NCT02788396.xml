	<brief_title>The Impact of Post Stenting Balloon Dilatation on Coronary Microcirculation in STEMI Patients Undergoing PPCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Suboptimal stent deployment can lead to future stent failure. Thus, optimising stent deployment with non-compliant balloons (NC balloon) post dilatation (PD) at high pressures is an established strategy. In the context of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), PD has been correlated anecdotally with the no reflow phenomenon. This study aims to determine the impact of stent post-dilation (PD) with NC balloons at high pressures on coronary microcirculation during PPCI by measuring the index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) pre and post stent post-dilatation. Pre and post PD, an optical coherence tomography (OCT) study will be performed to assess stent deployment and identify parameters that predict the changes in IMR.</detailed_description>
