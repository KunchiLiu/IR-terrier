	<brief_summary>Introduction: Vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) is a potential modulator of immune response and is associated with clinical progression of many diseases. Our aim is to assess influence of baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and VDBP single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs4588 (C&gt;A) and rs7041 (G&gt;T), on baseline clinical parameters and response to interferon based therapy in chronic Hepatitis C patients in Egypt. Methodology: Genotyping will be performed by RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism) in treatment naïve Hepatitis C patients and healthy controls. Vitamin D levels will be assessed by ELISA. HCV RNA quantification will be performed by PCR to assess therapy outcome.</brief_summary>
