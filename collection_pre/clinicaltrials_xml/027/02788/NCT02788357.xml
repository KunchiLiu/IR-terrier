	<brief_title>Post-stroke Neural Plasticity With Atomoxetine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Extensive studies in laboratory animals and humans over the last ten years indicate that some medications, especially amphetamine, given with specific physical therapy may improve motor learning (and therefore recovery from stroke) more than physical therapy alone. However, the number of patients in clinical trials who have received physical therapy and amphetamine is very small, for two reasons: because amphetamine may interact with many other medications that stroke patients are already taking, and because its potential for addiction precludes its use on a daily basis. The investigators now wish to evaluate the effectiveness of a more selective medication, atomoxetine, known to have many fewer side effects and no potential for drug addiction. The proposed mechanism by which amphetamine enhances recovery is by increasing central levels of norepinephrine. While the investigators already know that this drug is more selective than amphetamine, the investigators would like to evaluate its effects on hand motor learning and motor recovery in chronic stroke patients in a clinical setting.</detailed_description>
