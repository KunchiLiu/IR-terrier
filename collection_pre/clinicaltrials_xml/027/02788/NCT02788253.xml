	<brief_summary>Mallampati score (classification of the visibility of oropharyngeal structures) should be performed in the sitting position, head in the neutral position, mouth widely open, and tongue protrudes, without phonation. However, phonation, and position modify the visibility of oropharyngeal structures and thus the Mallampati score. Furthermore, some patients cannot be evaluated in sitting position because (emergency, fractures, pain, supine position require for medical or surgical pathology...). We aimed at evaluating the predictive value of the best observable Mallampati score as compare to the recommended Mallampati score.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mallampati score (classification of the visibility of oropharyngeal structures) should be performed in the sitting position, head in the neutral position, mouth widely open, and tongue protrudes, without phonation. However, phonation, and position modify the visibility of oropharyngeal structures and thus the Mallampati score. Furthermore, some patients cannot be evaluated in sitting position because (emergency, fractures, pain, supine position require for medical or surgical pathology...). We aimed at evaluating the predictive value of the best observable Mallampati score as compare to the recommended Mallampati score. This is a single center prospective observational study comparing the Mallampati score in sitting position and supine position by 2 independent observers. The Mallampati score in sitting position is evaluated during anesthesia consultation. The Mallampati score in supine position is evaluated in the operating room before anesthesia procedure started. Data and variables concerning airway management during induction of general anesthesia are recorded on a specific record sheet.</detailed_description>
