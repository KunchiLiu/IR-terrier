	<brief_title>Prevention of Malaria With Dihydroartemisinine + Piperaquine for Forest Rangers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To assess the protective effect of 3-day DP regimen for forest rangers working for long-term in forest where malaria transmission is intense, all eligible forest rangers will be treated with a full course of DP + primaquine to eradicate all parasites which may survive in their blood while staying in non- malaria transmission areas. Just before returning back to the forest participants will be randomized to receive either Arterakine (dihydroartemisinine (DHA)/piperaquine) (intervention arm) or placebo (control arm). Participants will be assessed for parasitemia before and after the forest trip with high volume, ultrasensitive, PCR (HVUqPCR). The minimum time span between two forest trips should be 20 days so participants could complete the 14 day primaquine course and the Arterakine (dihydroartemisinine (DHA)/piperaquine). There is no limit in the duration between trips. Participants are tested for P.falciparum, P.vivax infection before they return to the forest. Each participant will be visited 2 weeks or later after returning home from the forest and examined. The rationale for the added two weeks is to detect blood stages of infections, which may have been inoculated towards the end of the forest visit. If found to be sick, the patient will be treated according to government treatment guidelines. A 4ml venous blood sample will be obtained for Hb and HVUSqPCR.</detailed_description>
