The aim is to look for any significant changes in the major vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) and body temperature) during specified dental procedures (scaling, simple restoration, and simple exodontia) and compare the changes between the 3 procedures.</brief_summary>
