	<brief_summary>This is a Phase III, multicenter, open-label, three-arm, randomized study in participants with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) who have received at least two prior regimens of cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic disease. The study compares regorafenib, a standard of care therapy in this setting, to cobimetinib plus atezolizumab and atezolizumab monotherapy.</brief_summary>

Participants requiring narcotic pain medication must be on a stable regimen at study entry Uncontrolled pleural effusion, pericardial effusion or ascites requiring repeated drainage more than once every 28 days. Indwelling drainage catheters (e.g., PleurXÂ®) are allowed Active or untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases are excluded Prior therapy with any cancer immunotherapy, MEK inhibitor, or regorafenib Participants with active malignancy (other than CRC) or a prior malignancy within the past 3 years are excluded. Participants with completely resected cutaneous melanoma (early stage), basal cell carcinoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, cervical carcinoma insitu, breast carcinoma insitu, and localized prostate cancer are eligible Unstable angina, new onset angina within last 3 months, myocardial infarction within last 6 months and current congestive heart failure New York Heart Association Class II or higher Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below institutional lower limit of normal or below 50%, whichever is lower Poorly controlled hypertension, defined as a blood pressure consistently above 150/90 millimeter of Mercury (mmHg) despite optimal medical management Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection Active tuberculosis infection Severe infections within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 Active or chronic viral hepatitis B or C infection History of or evidence of retinal pathology on ophthalmologic examination that is considered a risk factor for central serous retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, or neovascular macular degeneration Participants will be excluded if they currently have any of the risk factors as defined in the study protocol for retinal vein occlusion History of autoimmune disease History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing pneumonia, bronchiolitis obliterans, druginduced pneumonitis, or idiopathic pneumonitis History of organ transplantation including allogeneic bone marrow transplantation Inability to swallow medications Malabsorption condition that would alter the absorption of orally administered medications Pregnant, lactating, breastfeeding, or intending to become pregnant during the study Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks before randomization or anticipation of a live attenuated vaccine will be required during the study</criteria>
