	<brief_title>The Removing Port of the Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy Material</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is gold standard for gallstones. But there is no consensus about which port place is optimal for the removing of the cholecystectomy material from the abdomen. There are different port site infections rates in the literature. The minimal tissue damage of laparoscopic cholecystectomy suggests a lower risk of wound infection, but there are series with an infection range of 8 %. The investigators are investigating is there any difference at the port site infection rates when the cholecystectomy material removed from different ports from the abdomen at the laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</detailed_description>
