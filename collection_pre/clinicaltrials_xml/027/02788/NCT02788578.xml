	<brief_summary>The objective of the PRELUDE study is to describe the use of lanreotide Autogel® (LAN ATG) combined with Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) in the treatment of progressive neuroendocrine tumours located in the lung or in the digestive system as there is currently limited data on these treatments used together for these types of neuroendocrine tumours.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histopathologically confirmed metastatic well differentiated Neuroendocrine Tumour (NET) (Grade G1 or G2 according to the World Health Organisation 2010 classification): Gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) or Bronchopulmonary (BP) primary tumour, or tumour of unknown origin believed to be of GEP origin, if a primary tumour elsewhere was excluded by multiphasic computerised tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Disease progression radiologically documented with evaluable imaging (CT or MRI, digital or printout), performed within 12 months and within 6 months prior to the first PRRT/LAN ATG cycle Metastatic or locallyadvanced, hormonal functioning or nonfunctioning GEPNET or BPNET; Confirmed presence of Somatostatin Receptors (SSTRs) on all target lesions based on positive SSTR scintigraphy (Octreoscan®/99mTCtektrotyd) or 68Ga SSTR Positron Emission TomographyComputerised Tomography (PET/CT) imaging, i.e. Grade ≥2 respectively per the Krenning scale or per the modified Krenning scale Absence of information regarding LAN ATG treatment: dose received, start date, frequency of injections No CT or MRI within 12 months and within 6 months preceding the baseline, or at the end of the last PRRT/LAN ATG cycle Absence of information on cumulative activity of PRRT with 177 Lutetium (177Lu) DOTATOC or 177LuDOTATATE received (at least 500 mCi (equivalent to 18.5 GBq), for the entire therapy) PRRT prior to the first combination cycle of PRRT/LAN ATG</criteria>
