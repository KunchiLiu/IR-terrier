	<brief_summary>Identifying biomarkers to predict the clinical course and benefits of therapy early in the course of the disease remains one of the most urgent and relevant challenges to improve overall patient management, to prevent treatment delay or overtreatment. This study is conducted to examine the effect of nintedanib treatment on change in biomarkers indicative of extracellular matrix turnover which have been shown recently to correlate with disease progression. This study further aims to confirm the association of biomarker course during the first three months of treatment and disease progression.</brief_summary>
