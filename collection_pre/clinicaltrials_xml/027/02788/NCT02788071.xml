	<brief_title>Effect of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Irritable Bowel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most commonly diagnosed gastrointestinal condition. IBS is associated with a high use of health-care costs and can substantially reduce quality of life and work productivity. Several studies have demonstrated that the composition of the gut microbiota in IBS patients is different from healthy controls. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) could therefore be a treatment option for IBS patients by exchanging the microbiota of an IBS patient with the microbiota of a healthy donor.</detailed_description>
