	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common malignancies worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer-related death. Surgical resection is still the main radical approach for HCC, but the recurrence rate after hepatectomy is very high, which hampers the further improvement of prognosis of HCC patients. The conventional risk factors of recurrence including: huge tumor, multiple lesions, vessels invasion and tumor rupture. Recently, the microvessels invasion (MVI) has been recognized a novel risk factor of recurrence after hepatectomy. The investigators' previous study showed that the recurrence rate is more than 50% for the patients with &gt;5cm solitary tumor and MVI. The MVI was confirmed as the only independent risk factor for the overall and disease-free survival of HCC patients in multiple variables analysis. It is important to reduce the recurrence and prolong the survival of patients after hepatectomy with effective adjuvant therapy. TACE has been utilized as an adjuvant therapy after hepatectomy, but its significance is still unknown. Then, the investigators design the current prospective randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effect of adjuvant TACE to reduce the recurrence in HCC patients at high risk (&gt;5cm solitary tumor and MVI) after resection, compared to vigilant follow-up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjuvant TACE to Reduce the HCC Recurrence After Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patients with solitary tumor more than 5cm and microvessels invasion after radical hepatectomy were randomized to receive adjuvant TACEï¼ˆ1~2 cycles, 4~6 weeks) or follow-up. The main endpoint: overall survival (OS), disease-free survival(DFS), and safety were compared between this two groups.</detailed_description>
