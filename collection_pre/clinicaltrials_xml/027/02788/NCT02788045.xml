	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety/tolerability of the 2 different vaccine regimens of priming with trivalent Ad26.Mos.HIV and boosting with trivalent Ad26.Mos.HIV and Clade C gp140 plus adjuvant or priming with tetravalent Ad26.Mos4.HIV and boosting with Ad26.Mos4.HIV and Clade C glycoprotein (gp)140 plus adjuvant. Immune responses of the different vaccine schedules will be assessed.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Are negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection at screening Is healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, electrocardiogram (ECG), and vital signs measurement performed at screening Are willing/able to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions specified in the protocol and study procedures Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test (beta human chorionic gonadotropin [beta hCG]) at the Screening visit, and a negative urine pregnancy test predose on Day 1 Are assessed by the clinic staff as being at low risk for HIV infection Has chronic hepatitis B (measured by hepatitis B surface antigen test) or active hepatitis C (measured by hepatitis C virus [HCV] Ab test; if positive, HCV ribonucleic acid [RNA] PCR test will be used to confirm active versus past HCV infection), active syphilis infection, chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomonas . Active syphilis documented by serology unless positive serology is due to past treated infection Has had a thyroidectomy or active thyroid disease requiring medication during the last 12 months (not excluded: a stable thyroid supplementation) Has had major psychiatric illness and/or substance abuse problems during the past 12 months (including hospitalization or periods of work disability) that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation Has been in receipt of any licensed vaccine within 14 days prior to the first dose of study vaccine/placebo, plans to receive within 14 days after the first study vaccination, or plans to receive within 14 days before or after the second, third or fourth vaccination Is a recipient of a prophylactic or therapeutic HIV vaccine candidate at any time, or a recipient of other experimental vaccine(s) within the last 12 months. For participants who received an experimental vaccine (except HIV vaccine) more than 12 months ago, documentation of the identity of the experimental vaccine must be provided to the sponsor, who will determine eligibility on a casebycase basis</criteria>
