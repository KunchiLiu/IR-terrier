	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical efficacy of bismuth tripotassium dicitrate (De-Nol) in combination with pantoprazole versus pantoprazole monotherapy in subjects with NSAID-induced gastropathy in 14±2 days of treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study To Assess The Efficacy And Safety Of Bismuth Tripotassium Dicitrate (De-Nol) In Combination With Pantoprazole And Pantoprazole Monotherapy In Treatment Of Subjects With Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID)-Induced Gastropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study has a screening period (up to 3±2 days duration). Randomization will be held in each stratum (H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative) on the Visit 1. Treatment period will consist of 2 visits: Visit 2 (up to 14±2 days after Visit 1) in subjects with completely healed ulcer(s) and erosions after control esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGDS) and Visit 3 (up to 28±2 days after Visit 1) in subjects with not healed ulcers and erosions after control EGDS on Visit 2. The period of follow-up safety assessments will last 1 week after the end of the study treatment</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Verified diagnosis of NSAIDinduced gastropathy: Presence of gastric ulcer(s) and/or erosions (modified Lanza score greater than or equal to 5) based on EGDS findings at screening and; NSAIDs administration within 7 days before screening. Negative pregnancy test at screening and at Visit 1 (for females only using test strip to detect chorionic gonadotropin in urine), Subjects' consent to use a reliable contraception method starting from screening throughout the whole study and for 1 week after its termination. Severe complications of NSAIDgastropathy (bleedings, perforations, etc.) The subjects requiring concomitant therapy using the drugs specified in "Forbidden concomitant therapy". Ulcerative esophagitis grade C and higher according to LosAngeles classification. Expressed hepatic and renal impairment. Any esophageal and gastric surgery that can make subject ineligible for study participation. Abuse of psychoactive substances including alcohol which may interfere with the subject's participation and fulfillment of all the protocol requirements. Participation in other clinical studies within 30 days prior to Screening Visit. Administration of bismuth products less than 2 months prior to screening. Administration of PPIs or histamine Н2receptor antagonists less than 2 weeks prior to screening. Hypersensitivity to any of the components of the study drugs or contraindications to them. Pregnancy and lactation. Inability to perform followup EGDS after 2 and/or 4 weeks of the study. Any condition or concomitant disease and laboratory parameter abnormalities which renders the subject ineligible for the study.</criteria>
