At 0800 h of day 0, all subjects provided a basal blood sample immediately followed by a single intramuscular injection of hCG of 5000 IU. Further five visits were performed each of five following consecutive days after the hCG injection. A blood sample was taken at each visit after an overnight fast</brief_summary>
