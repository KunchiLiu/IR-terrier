	<brief_summary>The explanatory mechanism of the relationship between the volume of surgical procedures performed by individual hospitals and the occurrence of serious adverse events is not clear. Based on the " practice makes perfect " dogma, we will explore whether a learning effect can explain the volume-outcome relationship for complex surgical procedures using a nationwide dataset. Especially, we assume that increasing volume of procedures over time may be associated with improved outcomes.</brief_summary>
