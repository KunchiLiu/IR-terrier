	<brief_summary>This study aims to investigate the effects of an early intervention (joint observation and video feedback) on maternal parenting self-efficacy following a premature birth. Mothers who have given birth to a very premature baby will be randomly allocated to either the early intervention or usual care whilst the infant is still hospitalized. Participants will be followed up at one month and six months. It is predicted that participants who received the early intervention will report higher maternal parenting self-efficacy than those who are not.</brief_summary>
