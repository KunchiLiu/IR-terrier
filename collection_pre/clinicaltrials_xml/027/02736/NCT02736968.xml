	<brief_summary>This is a phase IIa, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blinded superiority treatment study to compare placebo to once daily doses of 6mg auranofin for adults with asymptomatic amebiasis or giardiasis. A sample size of 68 subjects enrolled with amebiasis (34 per arm) and 68 with giardiasis (34 per arm); Power based on 60 subjects with amebiasis and 60 with giardiasis completing the study. Primary objectives are 1) to compare the proportion of subjects with parasitological response (no detection of cysts or trophozoites of E. histolytica on microscopic exam or negative antigen detection) by Day 7 for E. histolytica infections and 2)to compare the proportion of subjects with parasitological response (no detection of cysts or trophozoites of G. lamblia on microscopic exam or negative antigen detection) by Day 5 for Giardia infections. The length of this study is set for 3.5 years; subject participation is 7 days treatment (amebiasis) and 5 days (giardiasis) with follow-up until day 28</brief_summary>

Secondary objectives for E. histolytica infections are 1) to compare the proportion of subjects with parasitological response (no detection of cysts or trophozoites of E. histolytica on microscopic exam or negative antigen detection) by Days 3 and 5, 2) to compare the rate of decrease of trophozoites/cyst load by qPCR in stools by Days 3, 5, and 7, 3) to compare the proportion of subjects with negative stool antigen tests by days 3, 5, 7, and 14, 4) to compare the proportion of subjects with sustained cure (no detection of cysts or trophozoites by microscopic exam or negative antigen detection) at 14 and 28 days, and 5) to compare the proportion of subjects with relapse (same strain) or re-infection (new strain) with positive stools at 14 and 28 days by genotyping the initial vs. subsequent strain. Secondary objectives for Giardia infections are 1) to compare the proportion of subjects with parasitological response (no detection of cysts or trophozoites of G. lamblia on microscopic exam or negative antigen detection) by Day 3, 2) to compare the rate of decrease of trophozoites/cyst load by qPCR in stools by Days 3 and 5, 3) to compare the proportion of subjects with sustained cure (no detection of cysts or trophozoites by microscopic exam or negative antigen detection) at 14 and 28 days, 4) to compare the proportion of subjects with relapse (same strain) or re-infection (new strain) with positive stools at 14 and 28 days by genotyping the initial vs. subsequent strain.

	<criteria>1. Provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures. 2. Able to understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available for all study visits. 3. Male or nonpregnant female 1865 years of age, inclusive. 4. Amebiasis or giardiasis identified by positive TechLab antigen test, positive wet mount or trichome (confirmed by PCR), and positive stool PCR for E. histolytica or Giardia. If a subject is infected with both E. histolytica and Giardia, they will be enrolled in the E. histolytica study arm. Once the Entamoeba study arm is fully enrolled, any subsequent dual infected subjects will be enrolled in the Giardia arm. . 5. In otherwise good health *Note: as determined by medical history and targeted physical examination, if indicated based on medical history, to evaluate acute or currently ongoing chronic medical diagnoses or conditions that would affect the assessment of eligibility and safety of subjects. Existing medical diagnoses or conditions (except those in the Subject Exclusion Criteria) must be deemed as stable chronic medical conditions. A stable chronic medical condition is defined as no change in prescription medication, dose, or frequency of medication in the last 3 months (90 days) and health outcomes of the specific disease are considered to be within acceptable limits in the last 6 months (180 days). Any change due to change of health care provider, insurance company, or that is done for financial reasons, as long as in the same class of medication, will not be considered a violation of this inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as determined by the site principal investigator or appropriate subinvestigator, will not be considered a violation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate subinvestigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety. Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications, vitamins, and contraceptives are permitted. 6. Vital signs (oral temperature, pulse, and blood pressure) are all within normal protocoldefined ranges. 7. Laboratory tests (blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, AST, ALT, white blood cells, platelets, and hemoglobin) are all within normal protocoldefined reference ranges. *Note: (The normal ranges for Icddr.b laboratory tests include (a) blood urea nitrogen (BUN) between 5 and 24 mg/dL, inclusive, (b) creatinine between 53 and 106 umol/L, inclusive, males and between 44 and 97 umol/L, inclusive, for females, (c) AST of 38 U/L or less for males and 32 U/L or less for females, (d) ALT of 41.0 U/L or less for males and 31 U/L or less for females, (e) WBC between 4.0 and 11.0 109/L, inclusive, (f) platelets between 150 and 450 109/L, inclusive, (g) hemoglobin between 12.5 and 17.5 gm/dL, inclusive, for males and 11.5 and 16.5 gm/dL, inclusive, for females. Subjects will be eligible for enrollment with the following laboratory values: blood urea nitrogen less than 30 mg/dL, creatinine less than 133 umol/L, AST or ALT less than 60.0 U/L, white cell count between 3.5 and 11.0 (109/L), platelets between 100 and 500 (109/L), hemoglobin between 11.0 and 18.0 gm/dL) 8. Urinalysis with no greater than trace protein. If a high protein is confirmed to be due to menstruation, it should be repeated. 9. Women of reproductive potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test within 72 hours of starting study medications. *Note: Female subjects who are surgically sterile via tubal sterilization, bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy or who have been postmenopausal for greater than 1 year are not considered to be of reproductive potential. 10. Female subjects participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy must agree to use highly effective contraception while receiving auranofin and for 15 weeks after. *Note: Highly effective methods of contraception are defined as having low failure rates (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly and may include, but are not limited to, abstinence from intercourse, monogamous relationship with a vasectomized partner, male condoms with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, intrauterine devices, and licensed hormonal methods.If an eligible female of childbearing potential is not using effective contraception, hormonal contraceptives will be supplied to female subjects and condoms will be provided for her partner while they are on the trial and for the followup period of 4 months total. Females on effective forms of birth control will continue while on the study and for the followup period of 4 months total and also be provided condoms for their partners. The method and compliance of birth control used will be confirmed and documented at all study visits. 1. Known intolerance of auranofin or gold compounds. 2. Pregnant or breastfeeding women or women who plan to become pregnant or breastfeed at any given time during the study or within 2 months of study completion. 3. Diarrhea (&gt; 3 loose stools/ 24 hours) within 7 days prior to starting study medications. 4. Anticipated travel of more than 50 km from study site planned in next month. 5. Current use of systemic antibiotics or metronidazole. 6. Has any condition that would, in the opinion of the site investigator, place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury or render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol. 7. Concurrent participation in other investigational protocols or receipt of an investigational product within the previous 30 days. 8. History of alcohol or drug abuse within the last five years.</criteria>
