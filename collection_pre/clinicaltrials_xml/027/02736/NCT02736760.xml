	<brief_summary>This study is a multicenter study investigating the clinical efficacy of repetitive daylight-PDT with MAL (Methylaminolevulinate) compared to cryosurgery in regard to prophylaxis and treatment of AKs (actinic keratoses) in the face. Patients will be randomly allocated to treatment groups. 5 PDT (photodynamic therapy) treatment sessions (visits 1-5) will be performed within 18 months. In the control group, cryosurgery will be performed at visit 1, and in case of non-cleared or newly occurred AKs at visits 2-5. In the PDT group the patients will apply a chemical sunscreen (SPF 50+) to the whole face and other light-exposed, unprotected areas of the skin. After at least 15 minutes a lesion preparation of AKs (removal of crusts) will be performed and MAL will be applied in a thin layer to the whole face. Within 30 min after MAL application patients expose themselves to daylight for 2 hours. In the control group, cryosurgery will be performed using liquid nitrogen spray in each AK lesion; this will be done at visit 1 and, if necessary, also at visits 2-5. At visits 2-6, the efficacy of the treatment will be evaluated by the observer by documenting all existing and newly appearing AKs in the face.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Daylight-PDT With MAL for AK and Photodamaged Skin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a multicenter study investigating the clinical efficacy of repetitive daylight-PDT with MAL compared to cryosurgery in regard to prophylaxis and treatment of AKs in the face. Patients will be randomly allocated to treatment groups. 5 PDT treatment sessions (visits 1-5) will be performed within 18 months. In the control group, cryosurgery will be performed at visit 1, and in case of non-cleared or newly occurred AKs at visits 2-5. Before application of the photosensitizer, an organic sunscreen (Actinica® lotion, LSF 50+) without mineral filters will be applied In the entire face. After an absorption time of approximately 15 minutes and before applying MAL (Metvix®), the surface of the AK lesions will be prepared gently with a curette or a scalpel to remove scales and crusts and roughen the surface of the AK-lesions. This is to facilitate penetration of the cream and light to the AK lesions. After lesion preparation, MAL (Metvix®) will be uniformly applied on the whole face in a thin layer. Within 30 min after MAL application the patients go outside and expose themselves for 2 hours to daylight. Daylight-PDT can be performed from March until October, during non-rainy weather with an outdoor temperature of at least 10° Celsius. Daylight exposure must start at least 3 hours before sunset. At the end of the exposure, residual photosensitizer is washed off and the patients spend the rest of the day indoors. Cryosurgery of AK lesions will be investigated as standard reference therapy. Single freeze-thaw cryosurgery is performed using an open spraying procedure with liquid nitrogen with nozzle size C. After formation of an ice-ball of the required size, freeze time starts. Freeze time should lie between 5 s and 10 s.</detailed_description>
