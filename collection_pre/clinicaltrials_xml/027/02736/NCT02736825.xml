	<brief_summary>Up to 260 subjects presenting with skin laxity on the face and neck will be randomized to one of two treatment groups. Subjects meeting all entrance criteria will receive study treatment, then complete two post treatment phone contacts and follow-up study visits at 90, 180 and 365 days post treatment. Study images will be obtained pre-treatment, immediately post-treatment, and at each follow-up visit for qualitative and quantitative assessments of efficacy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Simulines Non-Inferiority Pivotal Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized, double blinded, multi-center, parallel arm, non-inferiority, pivotal clinical trial to demonstrate that the safety and efficacy of a new transducer which delivers two simultaneous lines of treatment at the same treatment depth is not inferior to a standard transducer to improve jawline definition and submental skin laxity. Changes from baseline in quantitative measures of neck and submental lift will be assessed at study follow-up visits. Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale scores, Merz Jawline Grading Scale scores, 3D volumetric changes from baseline to post treatment, patient satisfaction and patient-reported improvement will be obtained.</detailed_description>
