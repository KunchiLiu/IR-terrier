	<mesh_term>Exotropia</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. To correspond the definition of IXT: monocular or binocular alternative exotropia, exodeviation at distance for 15 prism diopters at least, can control the normal ocular alignment, normal ocular movements. 2. Simultaneous perception and fusion point in synoptophore, but no normal function of fusion and stereopsis. 3. Age at from 5 to 18 years, sex unlimited. 4. No treatment for IXT previously (including surgical and nonsurgical treatment). 5. No amblyopia. 6. Signed informed consent form voluntarily. 1. Accompanied with ocular organic diseases. 2. Accompanied with systemic diseases (e.g. nervous system disease). 3. Unable to regular followup (e.g. from countryside and outlying district). 4. Investigators concluded that should be excluded.</criteria>
