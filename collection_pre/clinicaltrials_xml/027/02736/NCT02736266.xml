	<brief_summary>Patients with T2-T4a N0 urothelial bladder carcinoma (UBC) with residual disease after transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB, surgical opinion, cystoscopy or radiological presence) will receive 3 cycles of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) at the dose of 200mg 3 weekly prior to surgery (radical cystectomy). Cystectomy will be planned to be done within 3 weeks of the last dose (accounting for a total of 9 weeks). Computed tomography (CT) scan and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT scan will be done during screening and before surgery. After cystectomy, patients with the evidence of pathologic stage T3-4 (pT3-4) and/or pathologically node-positive disease will be managed according to local guidelines. Further anti programmed-death (PD)-1 or anti PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy will not be given post-operatively. PD-L1 status will be centralized and assessed on TURB specimen using an anti-PD-L1 antibody (Ab) and a prototype immunohistochemical (IHC) assay. PD-L1 positivity will be defined as any staining in the stroma or in ≥1% of tumor cells. Pathologic complete response (pCR) is the primary endpoint. All patients enrolled who receive at least 1 cycle of study drug will be includes in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. The alternative hypothesis (H1) is pCR ≥20% and null hypothesis (H0) pCR≤10%. A 2-stage design will be used to estimate the number of pts required. Out of 90 pts overall, with the first stage of 49 pts, ≥6 pCR will be required in the first stage, and ≥13 pCR in the whole study population (80% power and a 2-sided test of significance at the 10% level). Correlative research on tissue/blood samples will include immune-cell profiling in tumor and blood during Pembrolizumab, cytokine assessment, and molecular profiling of tumor samples.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Willing and able to provide written informed consent. 2. Ability to comply with the protocol. 3. Age ≥ 18 years. 4. Histopathologically confirmed transitional cell carcinoma. Patients with mixed histologies are required to have a dominant (i.e. 50% at least) transitional cell pattern. 5. Fit and planned for cystectomy (according to local guidelines). 6. Clinical stage T2T4a N0 M0 disease by CT (or MRI) + PET/CT (within 4 weeks of randomization by RECIST v1.1). 7. Residual disease after TURB (surgical opinion, cystoscopy or radiological presence). 8. Representative formalinfixed paraffinembedded (FFPE) tumor specimens (blocks preferred) or at least 15 unstained slides, with an associated pathology report, for testing at the study sponsor site and determined to be evaluable for tumor PDL1 expression prior to study enrolment; patients with fewer than 15 unstained slides available at baseline (but no fewer than 10) may be eligible following discussion with Merck representatives. 9. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1. 10. Adequate hematologic and endorgan function tests. Patients taking regular oral steroids, above the allowed limit of 10mg/day methylprednisolone or analogues, for any reason. Patients must not have had steroids for 28 days prior to study entry. Previously intravenous chemotherapy bladder cancer. Patients who have previously had radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiation would be eligible. Malignancies other than UBC within 5 years prior to Cycle 1, Day 1, with the exception of those with a negligible risk of metastasis or death and treated with expected curative outcome (such as adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, basal or squamous cell skin cancer, or ductal carcinoma in situ treated surgically with curative intent) or localized prostate cancer treated with curative intent and absence of prostatespecific antigen (PSA) relapse or incidental prostate cancer (Gleason score ≤ 3 + 4 and PSA &lt; 10 ng/mL undergoing active surveillance and treatment naive). Evidence of measurable nodal or metastatic disease. Evidence of significant uncontrolled concomitant disease that could affect compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results, including significant liver disease (such as cirrhosis, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, or superior vena cava syndrome). Pregnant female patients. All female patients of childbearing potential with a positive pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment will be excluded from the study.

Severe infections within 4 weeks prior to enrolment in the study including but not limited to hospitalization for complications of infection, bacteraemia, or severe pneumonia. Major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to enrolment or anticipation of need for a major surgical procedure during the course of the study other than for diagnosis.

Patients with a history of autoimmunerelated hypothyroidism, unless on a stable dose of thyroidreplacement hormone. Patients with uncontrolled Type 1 diabetes mellitus Uncontrolled hypercalcemia Patients with prior allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplantation. History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Positive test for HIV. Patients with active hepatitis infection Patients with active tuberculosis. Prior treatment with anti−programmed death−1 (PD1), or anti−PDL1 therapeutic antibody or pathwaytargeting agents. Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to enrolment or anticipation that such a live, attenuated vaccine will be required during the study Treatment with any other investigational agent or participation in another clinical trial with therapeutic intent within 28 days prior to enrolment History of severe immunerelated adverse effects from anti−CTLA4 (CTCAE Grade 3 and 4).
