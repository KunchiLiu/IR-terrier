	<brief_summary>Ewing's sarcoma characterized by the t(11; 22) (q24; q12) translocation at several but prioritized breakpoint sites, resulting in the EWS/FLI1 fusion gene is the second most frequently diagnosed primary malignant bone tumor in the US with an annual incidence, from birth to age 20, of 2.9 cases per million population. The survival rate for patients with high-risk recurrent disease (relapse &lt; 2 years) is &lt; 10% at 5 years. Moreover, of patients who progress after second line treatment, eighty percent do not achieve a second complete response and of these patients &lt; 10% survive one year. Refractory patients to both frontline and second line therapy have even worse prognosis. The EWS/FLI1 gene is well known as the driver gene of Ewing's sarcoma. We designed a novel pbi-shRNA™ EWS/FLI1 Type 1 LPX which has demonstrated sufficient specificity, safety and efficacy in animal testing to justify Phase I testing. Clinical safety (no ≥ grade 3 product related toxic effect) and target specific activity has been observed with other bi-shRNA products involving 147 cancer patients (698 separate dose administrations) (BB-IND 14205; BB-IND 14938). Moreover, safety has been observed with IV delivery of pbi-shRNA™ EWS/FLI1 Type 1 LPX in murine and swine testing via multidose IV administration. Study testing of pbi-shRNA™ EWS/FLI1 Type 1 LPX will involve patients (≥age 8) with advanced Ewing's sarcoma. The first 3 subjects enrolled onto the study as well as the first subject enrolled into each dose cohort must be 16 years of age or older. pbi-shRNA™ EWS/FLI1 Type 1 LPX will be given via intravenous infusion twice a week for 4 weeks (e.g. Mon and Thurs, preferred) for a total of 8 infusions of the product per cycle followed by a 2 week washout period. Patients will be accrued in 3-patient dose escalation cohorts using the following escalation schema (50% to 33% to 25% to 25% to 25%) at a starting IV dose of 0.04 mg/kg.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects will be eligible for registration if they meet all of the following inclusion criteria: 1. Histologically confirmed Ewing's Sarcoma Family of Tumors (ESFT). 2. Age ≥8 years. 3. Evidence of EWS translocation fusion by FISH or RTPCR or NGS. 4. Evidence of Type 1 fusion by molecular diagnostics. 5. Refractory or intolerant to standard of care. 6. ECOG performance status (PS) = 02, or Karnofsky PS ≥60% or Lansky PS ≥60%. 7. Normal organ and marrow function as defined below: Absolute granulocyte count ≥1,000/mm3 Absolute lymphocyte count ≥400/mm3 Platelets ≥100,000/mm3 Total bilirubin ≤ institutional upper limit of normal AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2x institutional upper limit of normal Creatinine &lt;1.5 mg/dL 8. Subject has recovered to CTCAE Grade 1 or better from all adverse events associated with prior therapy or surgery. Preexisting motor or sensory neurologic pathology or symptoms must be recovered to CTCAE Grade 2 or better. 9. If female of childbearing potential, has a negative urine or serum pregnancy test. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a negative serum test will be required for study entry. 10. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed protocol specific consent. Pediatric patients must sign an assent with a parent or legal guardian sign a written informed consent, per institutional guidelines. Subjects will NOT be eligible for study registration and enrollment if meeting any of the following criteria: 1. Anticancer chemotherapy, biologic therapy or immunotherapy within 3 weeks or radiation therapy within 2 weeks of first infusion. 2. Known history of other malignancy unless having undergone curative intent therapy without evidence of that disease for ≥ 3 years except cutaneous squamous cell and basal cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, in situ cervical cancer or other in situ cancers are allowed if definitively resected. 3. Brain metastases unless treated with curative intent (gamma knife or surgical resection) and without evidence of progression for ≥ 2 months. 4. History of or current evidence of any condition (including medical, psychiatric or substance abuse disorder), therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the Investigator. 5. Known HIV or chronic Hepatitis B or C infection.</criteria>
