	<brief_summary>Background Surgery for mid and low rectal cancer is associated with relative high rates of incomplete mesorectal excisions and high rates of circumferential resection margin (CRM) involvement resulting in significant number of local recurrences. Moreover, patients with mid and low rectal cancer suffer from high rates of morbidity, permanent colostomies and impairment of quality of life. The transanal TME (TaTME) has been developed to improve the quality TME in mid and low rectal cancer. Study design The COLOR III trial is an international multicentre randomised study comparing short- and long-term outcomes of TaTME and laparoscopic TME for rectal cancer. The study will include a quality assessment phase before randomisation to ensure required competency level and uniformity of the new TaTME technique and the laparoscopic TME. During the trial clinical data will be reviewed centrally to ensure uniform quality. Endpoints Primary endpoint is involvement of CRM. Secondary endpoints include morbidity and mortality, residual mesorectum (postoperative MRI), local recurrence, disease-free and overall survival, percentage of sphincter saving procedures, functional outcome and quality of life. Statistics In laparoscopic TME the percentage of involved CRM is estimated 7%. To detect a reduction to 3% with a two-sided level of significance of 5% and a power of 80% a total of 1098 patients is needed. Randomisation will be in a 2:1 ratio in favour of the TaTME procedure. It will be stratified for T-stage, preoperative radiotherapy, height of the tumour, gender and BMI. All analyses will be on intention-to-treat basis. Main selection criteria Patients with a histologically proved single mid or low rectum carcinoma (0-10cm from anal verge) on MRI, eligible for TME surgery with a curative intent, are included. Main exclusion criteria are T4 tumours, T3 tumours with a suspected involved mesorectal fascia (MRF) after neoadjuvant therapy, patients with concomitant metastases or other malignancies, with malignancies in their medical history or with signs of acute mechanical obstruction by the tumour. Hypothesis The hypothesis is that TaTME will result in a better mesorectum specimen quality with a lower rate of involved CRM and therefore lower rate of local recurrence. Furthermore, the TaTME procedure will potentially enable more sphincter saving procedures and will have positive effect on functional outcome and health related quality of life.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To improve oncological and functional outcomes of patients with rectal cancer new surgical techniques are being developed. The adoption of the TME technique has resulted in better oncological outcome in the last decades. The addition of neoadjuvant therapy has further improved oncological outcome. The minimal invasive laparoscopic resection of rectal cancer has shown to be safe and to result in improved short-term outcomes and reduced morbidity. Nevertheless, the laparoscopic resection of mid and low rectal cancer remains challenging due to the anatomy of the narrow pelvis and is associated with a relative high risk of resections with tumour involved CRM resulting in increased risk of recurrence. In attempt to improve the quality of the TME procedure in low rectal cancer and further improve oncological results the TaTME has been developed, in which the rectum is dissected transanally according to TME principles. First series have been described since 2010 and although randomised evidence is still lacking this new technique has shown to be feasible and safe. The rectum including the total mesorectum is mobilised transanally in a reversed way with minimally invasive surgery including high quality imaging techniques. The TaTME technique for mid and low rectal cancer has shown to have potential benefits: better specimen quality with less CRM involvement, less morbidity as result of avoiding extraction wounds in the majority of patients and more sphincter saving rectal resections without compromising oncological outcomes. The investigators propose to evaluate the TaTME technique compared with conventional laparoscopic rectal resection for patients with mid and low rectal cancer in an international randomised trial: the COLOR III trial.</detailed_description>
