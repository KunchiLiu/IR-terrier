	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research project is to examine whether short-term use of portable air pollution filtration can result in changes in indoor airborne pollutants and impact on cardiovascular and respiratory health outcomes of the inhabitants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Short-term Portable Air Purifier Use on Occupant Health Indicators</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will focus on evaluating the short-term benefits of a common portable air purifier technology in reducing air pollutant exposure and the anticipated concomitant health impacts. High ambient levels of various air pollutants in the Shanghai area serve as a useful model to test the portable air purifier intervention in a realistic setting. As most people using a portable air purifier would only be able to do so in their residences, the investigators have designed our study only to test residential air purifier use. Our hypothesis is that the reduction in pollutant concentrations in indoor air caused by the air purifier will result in measurable reductions in risk factors for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.</detailed_description>
