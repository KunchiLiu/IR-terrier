	<detailed_description>Therefore the present study intended to compare a probiotic denture cleaning protocol with the current protocols. It was aimed to examine, in institutionalized older individuals with removable complete dentures, if the microbial composition and C. albicans colonization of the denture biofilm differs when overnight stored in a probiotic cleaning product compared to water or a cleanser.
