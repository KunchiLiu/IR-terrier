	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well obinutuzumab works in combination with ibrutinib in treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma that has returned (relapsed) or that does not respond to treatment (refractory). Obinutuzumab binds to a protein called cluster of differentiation (CD)20, which is found on B cells and some types of leukemia and lymphoma cells and help the immune system kill cancer cells. Ibrutinib blocks a protein called Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), which may help keep cancer cells from growing. Giving obinutuzumab in combination with ibrutinib may kill more cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Obinutuzumab in Combination With Ibrutinib in Treating Patients With Relapsed Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Best overall response of complete response/partial response (CR/PR). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Toxicity defined as any adverse event (AE) grade 3 and higher. II. Progression free survival. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Gene expression profiling using Lymph5Cx test. II. Sequencing using the ion torrent platform (76 gene panel for known mutations in lymphoma). III. Sequencing of BTK to evaluate for BTK mutations. IV. Minimal residual disease testing (MRD by flow cytometry and targeted sequencing post treatment). OUTLINE: Patients receive obinutuzumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15 (course 1) and day 1 (courses 2-6). Patients also receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) beginning on day 1 (course 1). Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving partial response (PR) continue to receive obinutuzumab IV every 2 months and ibrutinib PO QD for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must have a diagnosis of relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma as follows: Diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) must include morphology and expression of either cyclin D1 in association with other relevant markers (eg, CD19, CD20, CD5) or evidence of t(11;14) as assessed by cytogenetics, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Relapsed or refractory disease is defined as no response or progressive disease to prior treatment if the prior treatment comprised any of the following: 1 regimen containing an antiCD20 antibody administered for &gt;= 2 doses, and/or &gt;= 1 regimen containing 1 cytotoxic agent (e.g., bendamustine, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin) administered for 2 cycles At least 1 measurable site of disease according to Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson Criteria); the site of disease must be greater than 1.5 cm in the long axis regardless of short axis measurement or greater than 1.0 cm in the short axis regardless of long axis measurement, and clearly measurable in 2 perpendicular dimensions Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%) Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1.0 K/cu mm; for subjects with ANC &lt; 1.0 K/cu mm due to significant marrow involvement by MCL, ANC must be &gt; .5 K/cu mm Platelets (plt) &gt;= 50 K/cu mm; for subjects with plt &lt; 50 K/cu mm due to significant marrow involvement by MCL, plt must be &gt; 25 K/cu mm Total bilirubin =&lt; 2.5 X institutional limits Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =&lt;

men must agree to not donate sperm during and after the study; for females, these restrictions apply for 12 months after last dose of obinutuzumab, or 1 month after the last dose of ibrutinib, whichever is later; for males, these restrictions apply for 12 months after the last dose of obinutuzumab or 3 months after the last dose of ibrutinib, whichever is later Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (betahuman chorionic gonadotropin [betahCG]) or urine pregnancy test at screening; women who are pregnant or breastfeeding are ineligible for this study Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Major surgery within 4 weeks of drug administration Known central nervous system lymphoma Diagnosed or treated for malignancy other than MCL, except: Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease present for &gt;= 2 years before randomization Adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer or melanoma in situ without evidence of disease Adequately treated cervical carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease Asymptomatic prostate cancer managed with "active surveillance" History of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage within 6 months prior to randomization Requires anticoagulation with warfarin or equivalent vitamin K antagonists (eg, phenprocoumon) Vaccinated with live, attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks of randomization Requires treatment with strong cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inhibitors Subjects who have had standard cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study or those whose adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier have not recovered to =&lt; grade 1; this excludes alopecia and hematologic adverse events Subjects who have received investigational or approved oral or "targeted" agents (such as spleen tyrosine kinase [SYK], phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase [PI3K], Bcell chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL]/lymphoma 2 [bcl2], BTK inhibitors) or lenalidomide within 1 week prior to entering the study or those whose adverse events due to agents administered more than 1 week earlier have not recovered to =&lt;

patients who are hepatitis B core antibody (Hep B cAb) positive may be eligible as long as there is no evidence of active infection with negative hepatitis B (Hep B) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR); in this case, Hep B PCR must be monitored monthly Any uncontrolled active systemic infection requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics Any lifethreatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction which, in the investigator's opinion, could compromise the subject's safety, interfere with the absorption or metabolism of ibrutinib capsules, or put the study outcomes at undue risk Patients previously treated with ibrutinib &gt;
