	<brief_summary>Diving disorders and particularly Decompression sickness (DCS) represent a major concern in recreational and occupational pressure-related activities. As a result of decompression from higher to lower ambient pressure bubbles which are formed in vascular flow and in tissues take part in embolism then resulting in DCS. Individual factors such as vascular or respiratory defects are now considered to increase the risk of this dysbarism disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decreases in Diffusing Lung Capacity for Carbon Monoxide (DLCO) in Occupational Divers and Their Impact on Decompression Sickness Risks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>2 groups of occupational divers will be separated after a fitness medical examination by regarding DLCO decrease or not. The divers will be evaluated before and 30, 60, 180 minutes after a 20 meters air dive. Venous bubbles will be detected by precordial Doppler 30 minutes after the dive. In association with this Doppler, Flow Mediated Dilation, blood samples analysing inflammatory and thrombotic factors and other biomarkers will be explored before and after the dive in order to know how vascular and respiratory tracts in this environment react.</detailed_description>
