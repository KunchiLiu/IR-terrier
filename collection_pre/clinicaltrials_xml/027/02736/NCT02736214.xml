	<brief_summary>Many women and men in fertile age are at risk for sexual transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancies, and have insufficient knowledge of health promoting lifestyle prior to conception. There is a need to increase awareness among people in fertile age about how sexual risk-taking and unhealthy lifestyle can negatively affect fertility and pregnancy outcomes. Previous studies on preconception health and care have mainly focused on women. The aim of our study was to investigate if Reproductive Life Plan-based counseling with a midwife could increase men's reproductive knowledge. The second aim was to evaluate men's experiences of the intervention.</brief_summary>
