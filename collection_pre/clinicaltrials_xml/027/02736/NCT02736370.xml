	<brief_summary>To evaluate the association of functional outcomes measures, return to work status, pain scores and hardware failure on early protected and unrestricted weight bearing versus delayed weight bearing in operatively repaired rotational Bimalleolar and Trimalleolar ankle fractures not requiring fixation of the syndesmosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Weight Bearing for Ankle Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized into two groups: early weight bearing and delayed weight bearing. Participants will receive standard of care treatment for fixation of their ankle fractures and will be discharged from the hospital as non-weight bearing. Participants in the early weight bearing group will be allowed to begin unrestricted, protected weight bearing in a Controlled Ankle Motion (CAM) Walker or a walking cast at the two week follow up visit. Participants in the delayed weight bearing group will allowed to begin unrestricted, protected weight bearing at the 6 week follow up visit. Follow up will occur at 2w, 6w, 3m, 6m, and 12m post-operatively and will include physical assessments and functional outcome surveys.</detailed_description>
