	<brief_summary>This is a 3-arm randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of three novel motivational approaches to weight loss with 18-25 year olds. Participants will be 18-25 year olds with a BMI of 25-45 kg/m2, randomized to: 1) Behavioral Weight Loss (BWL), 2) BWL + Autonomous Motivation (BWL+Aut) or 3) BWL + Extrinsic Motivation (BWL+Ext). All arms will receive a 6-month behavioral weight loss intervention, followed by a 6-month no-treatment follow up period.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A 3-arm randomized controlled trial will be conducted, the goal of which is to determine which group represents the most viable approach to behavioral weight loss treatment with 18-25 year olds. A total of 381 participants,18-25 years of age, with a BMI between 25 and 45 kg/m2 will be randomized to one of three groups: 1) Behavioral Weight Loss (BWL), 2) BWL + Autonomous Motivation (BWL+Aut) or 3) BWL + Extrinsic Motivation (BWL+Ext). All arms will receive a 24-week behavioral weight loss intervention, including personalized dietary, physical activity, and weight loss prescriptions. In addition, all arms will be followed for a 6 month no treatment follow-up period. Assessments of weight and secondary outcomes will occur in 0, 3, 6 and 12 months. The investigators will compare treatment effects, across all 3 arms at 6 months, and compare arms on weight loss maintenance at12 months. The investigators will also examine mediators of treatment outcomes consistent with the investigators theoretical framework.</detailed_description>

Report a heart condition, chest pain during periods of activity or rest, or loss of consciousness on the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PARQ), which will be administered during prescreen. Individuals endorsing joint problems, prescription medication usage, or other medical conditions that could limit exercise will be required to obtain written physician consent to participate. Report a history of, or current diagnosis of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, or any current compensatory behaviors (e.g., vomiting, laxative use, excessive exercise).
