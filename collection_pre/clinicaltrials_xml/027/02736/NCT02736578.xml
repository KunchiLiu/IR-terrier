	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of cetuximab-IRDye 800CW when used with intraoperative imaging and to see how well they work in finding pancreatic cancer in patients undergoing surgery. Cetuximab-IRDye 800CW may help doctors better identify cancer in the operating room by making the cancer visible when viewed through a special imaging device.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cetuximab-IRDye 800CW and Intraoperative Imaging in Finding Pancreatic Cancer in Patients Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the efficacy of cetuximab IRDye800 (cetuximab-IRDye 800CW) in intraoperatively identifying pancreatic cancer compared to surrounding normal pancreatic and extrapancreatic tissue, as measured by tumor-to-background ratio. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the tolerability of the cetuximab IRDye800 as an imaging agent in patients undergoing resection of pancreatic cancer. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive cetuximab-IRDye 800CW intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes to 1 hour on day 0. Within 2-5 days, patients undergo surgery with intraoperative imaging. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 10 and 30.</detailed_description>
