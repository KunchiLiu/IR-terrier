	<criteria>Willing and able to use the delivery device as directed by the study manual. Confirmed diagnosis of CF, defined as a sweat chloride value ≥60 mmol/L by quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis. Homozygous for the F508del CFTR mutation. If the CFTR screening genotype result is not received before randomization, a previous CFTR genotype lab report may be used to establish eligibility. Percent predicted FEV1 of ≥40 to &lt;90 percentage points adjusted for age, sex, and height according to the Global Lung Initiative (GLI) at the Screening Visit. Willing to discontinue physicianprescribed saline use. Female subjects of childbearing potential with a negative serum pregnancy test at the Screening Visit. History of any comorbidity, which in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose an additional risk in administering study drug to the subject. Any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities at the Screening Visit that would interfere with the study assessments or pose an undue risk for the subject. An acute upper or lower respiratory infection, pulmonary exacerbation, or changes in therapy (including antibiotics) for pulmonary disease within 28 days before Day 1 (first dose of study drug). A 12 lead ECG demonstrating QTcF &gt;450 msec at the Screening Visit. History of solid organ or hematological transplantation. Used diuretics or reninangiotensin aldosterone system antihypertensive drugs in the 28 days prior to Screening or an anticipated need for any of these medications during the study. Ongoing or prior participation in an investigational drug study within 30 days of the Screening Visit. Inability to withhold shortacting, longacting, or oncedaily, longacting bronchodilator use for 4, 12, or 24 hours prior to clinic visit, respectively. History of significant intolerance to inhaled saline, or intolerance to the single dose of saline at Screening Known hypersensitivity or history of intolerance to Orkambi. Pregnant and nursing females. Subjects who have participated in Parion Sciences Study NCT02343445.</criteria>
