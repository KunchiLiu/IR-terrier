	<brief_summary>This is a 12-month, widely inclusive, largely virtual, single-center, open-label pilot trial utilizing a historical control group. Participants will receive a Lunasin regimen and will be asked to register for an account of PatientsLikeMe website, where after the initial in-clinic visit, they will be asked to enter specific data.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ALS Reversals - Lunasin Regimen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary hypothesis is that a supplement regimen containing Lunasin (referred to as the Lunasin regimen) can decrease the rate of ALSFRS-S progression by 50% relative to matched historic controls. ALS is a devastating motor neuron disease that causes rapidly progressive muscle weakness, disability and premature death. In spite of a large number of attempted ALS trials, there are no significant disease-modifying therapies for this condition. It was recently reported that a patient with a validated diagnosis of ALS, had experienced dramatic objective improvement in speech, swallowing and limb strength while taking a supplement regimen containing Lunasin. Several other patients with ALS have also reported improvement on this Lunasin regiment, though records were not obtainable to validate these. The Lunasin regimen will consist of: - LunaRich X Capsules - Reliv NOW - a mixture of 'vitamins, minerals and super-powered antioxidants' - Pro-Vantage - a mixture of 'soy protein, medium chain triglycerides, creatine, CoQ10 and supercharged amino acids' Dosages will be titrated up to target over the first 6 days. The subject will take the highest tolerated dosing for the remainder of the 12-month study. There are 3 in-clinic visits which occur at screening/baseline, Month 1 and Month 12. For Months 2-11, participants will make "virtual visits" by measuring their own ALSFRS-R score and weight and will record it in the PatientsLikeMe website. They will also self-report any perceived efficacy, compliance, adverse events and changes in concomitant medications.</detailed_description>
