	<detailed_description>Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an essential nutrient. Our bodies make DHA from the foods we eat. If we eat foods with a lot of DHA, like fatty ocean fish, we have more DHA in our bodies. DHA is found in all cells of the body but is especially high in nerve cells of the brain and eye. Babies get DHA from the mother when they're in the womb. After birth, they can get DHA from breast milk or infant formulas. This study will enroll pregnant women and follow them and their baby until the baby is 12 months old. Changes in the development of the baby will be tracked. Half of the participants in this study will receive 200mg of DHA to take daily. The other half of participants will receive 800mg of DHA to take daily. Participants, along with the researchers, will not know which dose of DHA they are receiving.</detailed_description>
