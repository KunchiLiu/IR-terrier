	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in Brazil and surgical procedures to treat these disorders have grown dramatically in recent years. Since the first heart surgery in successful open field in humans, conducted in 1953 by John Lewis, many techniques have been used to improve the outcome of surgery and reduce their side effects. The low-level laser therapy (LBP) has been widely used in clinical practice for pain relief purposes, reducing inflammation and stimulating tissue healing. However, the effect of this therapy has been little elucidated in patients with cardiac disease. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of low level laser therapy on the inflammatory profile and cardiac tissue healing markers of patients in the postoperative period of CABG surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of the Low-level Laser Therapy on Inflammatory Profile of the Patients With Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be conducing in a large hospital that is reference in Cardiovascular diseases treatments. 38 patients will be randomized for placebo or 6J low-level laser therapy (LLLT). The inflammatory profile and cardiac tissue will be assessment before and after de LLLT.</detailed_description>
