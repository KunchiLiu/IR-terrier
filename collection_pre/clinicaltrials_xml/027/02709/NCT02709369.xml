	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to explore the functional and physiological effects associated with the use of High-resolution, relational, resonance-based, electroencephalic mirroring (HIRREM), as supplemental care, for symptoms of neurological, cardiovascular, and neuropsychological disorders. This is a non-randomized, open label, and unblinded before-and-after trial, evaluating the effect of HIRREM on an objective, physiological common denominator (heart rate variability, HRV), across a variety of relevant conditions, as well as changes in clinical symptoms inventories, to generate hypotheses and pilot data for investigation in future proposals.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male and female adults and children aged 11 years and older. Subjects who are over the age of 18 must be able to give informed consent. Children must be able to sign an assent form and have a signed parental permission form. Subjects must have the ability to comply with basic instructions and be able to sit still comfortably with the sensor leads attached. Subjects previously diagnosed with a neurologic, cardiovascular, or psychophysiological disease such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Asperger Syndrome, chronic pain, dyslexia, depression, insomnia, migraines, anxiety, PTSD, substance abuse disorder, traumatic brain injury, and others. Subjects who fail to meet inclusion criteria. Subjects who are unable, unwilling, or incompetent to provide informed consent, assent and/or parental permission. Subjects physically unable to come to the study visits. Subjects with a known seizure disorder. Subjects with severe bilateral hearing impairment (HIRREM requires the use of headphones). Subjects receiving ongoing treatment with opiate, benzodiazepine, antipsychotic or sleep medications, as well as some antidepressants or stimulants, except those cases deemed acceptable by the principal investigator. Subjects with anticipated and ongoing use of recreational drugs except when deemed acceptable by the principal investigator.</criteria>
