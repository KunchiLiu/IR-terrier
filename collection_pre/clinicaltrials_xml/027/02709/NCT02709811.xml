	<brief_summary>Electrochemotherapy (ECT) is a non-thermal tumour ablation modality. It consists of the local potentiation, by means of local reversible electroporation of tumour tissues, of the antitumor activity of non-permeant or poorly permeant anticancer drugs already possessing intrinsic cytotoxicity. ECT has proved to be effective in the treatment of various cutaneous tumour nodules of any origin. Mostly ECT is offered to patients in case of multiple cutaneous metastases, when they cannot be excised, due to their number or localization. This study investigate the application of ECT in the treatment of liver metastases from colorectal adenocarcinoma, for which other thermal cytoreductive methods would be risky compared to the supposed expected clinical benefits.</brief_summary>
