	<brief_summary>This study will compare the effects of sevoflurane, desflurane and total intravenous anaesthesia on pulmonary function tests in patients undergoing endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery of pituitary gland. Participants will be divided into three equal groups. The first group will receive sevoflurane, second grup will receive desflurane and third grup will receive total intravenous anaesthesia. Investigators are also going to evaluate blood gas analysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of The Effects of Sevoflurane, Desflurane and Total Intravenous Anaesthesia on Pulmonary Function Tests</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators are going to evaluate forced expiratory volume in 1st Second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC ratio, partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2), partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2), potential of hydrogen (pH), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), base excess (BE), bicarbonate (HCO3) and partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio to compare the effects of drugs.</detailed_description>
