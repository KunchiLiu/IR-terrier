	<brief_title>Provider Alerts to Reduce Unnecessary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>10 Clinics within Stanford Health Care are randomized to receive or not receive provider alerts for 5 commonly overused tests and treatments. Thus there will potentially be 50 clinics enrolled across the 5 tests/treatment categories. However, it is expected that some clinics will meet criteria to be one of the 10 clinics in more than test/treatment category. Thus the total number of clinics involved will be between 10 and 50. These 5 tests / treatments are taken from the Choosing Wisely list. All alerts will be provided using the electronic medical record and will be automated.</detailed_description>
