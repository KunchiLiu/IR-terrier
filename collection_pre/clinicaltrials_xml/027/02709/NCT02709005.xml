	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II, Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Multi-center Trial enrolling 120 subjects with Bacterial Vaginosis who will be randomized at a ratio of 2:1 to receive active test article (5% Monolaurin Vaginal Gel) or placebo (vehicle). The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of 5% Monolaurin Vaginal Gel compared to vehicle placebo gel (excipients only) and to assess the efficacy by clinical cure rate of 5% Monolaurin Vaginal Gel compared to vehicle placebo gel at Visit 2.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of 5% Monolaurin Vaginal Gel Administered Intravaginally for the Treatment of Bacterial Vaginosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a disease of the vagina caused by bacteria. The most common symptom of BV is an abnormal homogeneous off-white vaginal discharge (especially after sex) with an unpleasant smell. This is a Phase II, Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Multi-center Trial enrolling 120 women, 18-50 years old, with clinical evidence of bacterial vaginosis. Subjects will be randomized at a ratio of 2:1 to receive active test article (5% Monolaurin Vaginal Gel) or placebo (vehicle) as outpatient therapy. Subjects will be stratified by first time episode of bacterial vaginosis or recurrent bacterial vaginosis. The primary objectives of this study are: 1) To assess the safety and tolerability of 5% Monolaurin Vaginal Gel compared to Vehicle Placebo Gel (excipients only) and 2) To assess the efficacy by clinical cure rate of 5% Monolaurin Vaginal Gel compared to Vehicle Placebo Gel at Visit 2. The secondary objectives are : 1) To evaluate the therapeutic cure rate of 5% Monolaurin Vaginal Gel compared to Vehicle Placebo Gel at Visits 2 and 3, 2) To evaluate the clinical cure rate of 5% Monolaurin Vaginal Gel compared to Vehicle Placebo Gel at Visit 3, 3) To evaluate the changes in Nugent's criteria of vaginal bacterial flora at Visits 2 and 3. This study is expected to last for 13 months, with subject participation duration being 4 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Nonpregnant females between the ages of 18 and 50 years, inclusive. Women of childbearing potential (not surgically sterile via tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy or who have not been postmenopausal for &gt;/=1 year) must agree to practice reliable contraception for the 28day period before enrollment through 30 days following treatment. Note: Acceptable birth control methods for the purposes of this study may include, but are not limited to, abstinence from intercourse with a male partner, monogamous relationship with vasectomized partner, barrier methods to include condoms and diaphragms, intrauterine devices, and licensed hormonal methods. NuvaRing contraceptive use will be prohibited from this study since the device can alter vaginal secretions. Presenting with signs of bacterial vaginosis (as per Amsel Criteria). Subjects must meet any three of the four criteria for enrollment: presence of discharge, greater than or equal to 20% clue cells on wet prep, positive "whiff test" on KOH prep, vaginal pH of greater than 4.5 Not currently menstruating or expected to in the next 4 days. Able to understand and comply with planned study procedures. Willing to abstain from sexual intercourse, insertion of tampons, douches or other intravaginal medications or objects between Visit 1 and Visit 2 and 48 hours prior to Visit 3. Provide written informed consent before initiation of any study procedures and be available for all study visits. No known history of HIV. Subjects over age 21 must report a normal PAP smear within the past three years. Signs or symptoms of vaginal/cervical/pelvic infection on screening or clinical diagnosis of vaginal/cervical/pelvic infection in the past 14 days. *(including but not limited to yeast vulvovaginitis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomonas, genital ulcer disease, pelvic inflammatory disease). Selftreatment for presumed yeast vaginitis is not an exclusion if treatment was discontinued 14 days or greater prior to enrollment. Treatment for BV within the past 14 days. Vaginal/cervical dysplasia or cervical HPV related disease in the past year. Subject reports 6 or more episodes of vaginitis within the past year. History of undiagnosed vaginal bleeding. Use of a systemic, vaginal, or perineal antibiotic within 2 weeks prior to enrollment in this study. Use of an immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drug (such as &gt;0.5 mg/kg/day or &gt;/=20 mg total dose/day of prednisone orally or &gt;800 mcg of inhaled beclomethasone) for 2 or more consecutive weeks within 6 months prior to enrollment (nasal and nongenital topical steroids are allowed). History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to Monolaurin vaginal gel. Uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, active liver, kidney or autoimmune diseases, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Note: Subjects with diabetes or history of organ or marrow transplant are excluded. A history of thyroid disease will be permitted as long as the thyroid disease is now stable. Acute illness within 3 days before receipt of study product. Pregnant women and women who are planning to become pregnant within 30 days after the final study dose, or women who are breastfeeding. Immunosuppression as a result of an underlying illness or treatment or use of anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy (cytotoxic) within the preceding 36 months. Active neoplastic disease (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) or a history of any hematologic malignancy. Active neoplastic disease is defined as neoplastic disease or treatment for neoplastic disease within the past 5 years. Received an experimental agent (vaccine, drug, biologic, device, blood product, or medication) within 30 days before receipt of study product or expect to receive an experimental agent during the 1 month study period. Any condition that would place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury, render her unable to meet the requirements of the protocol, or that may interfere with successful completion of the study. A history of alcohol or drug abuse during the previous 1 year that in the opinion of the site investigator would interfere with study procedures. Note: For example, daily excessive alcohol use or frequent binge drinking as determined by the investigator, or daily marijuana use.</criteria>
