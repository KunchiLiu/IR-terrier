	<brief_title>A Study of the GI Sleeve for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was designed as a randomized, single blind, sham controlled, pilot efficacy study of subjects with Type 2 diabetes enrolled at 2 centers in Santiago, Chile. Subjects were enrolled at a 2:1 ratio (EndoBarrier to sham). Following implantation or sham procedure, subjects were treated for 24 weeks or 52 weeks. Following explant, subjects were followed for an additional 8-12 weeks. Subject evaluations included measurements of HbA1c, glucose, insulin, weight, changes in diabetic medications, and meal tolerance tests. Safety was monitored through the collection of clinical labs, physical assessments, endoscopy and adverse events.</detailed_description>
