	<brief_summary>Arterial pulse pressure variation induced by mechanical ventilation (ΔPP) is considered one of the best parameter to predict fluid responsiveness in patients under general anaesthesia. Pleth Variability Index (PVI) has been proposed as a less invasive alternative. However, the pneumoperitoneum has been recently seen suggested as a limitation to their interpretation. The aim of this observational study is to compare changes in ΔPP and PVI related to autotransfusion associated with a Trendelenburg manoeuver before and during laparoscopy in patients undergoing elective surgery.</brief_summary>
