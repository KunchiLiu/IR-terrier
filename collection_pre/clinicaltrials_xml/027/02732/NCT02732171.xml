	<brief_summary>This is a single center, prospective cross-sectional study of women who have completed therapy for primary breast cancer within 5 years of diagnosis and are at increased risk for relapse. Patients will undergo screening bone marrow aspirate to test for presence of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) Patients who harbor DTCs will be offered the opportunity for enrollment into a clinical trial of therapy targeting DTCs to prevent recurrence (separate protocols).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologicallyconfirmed primary invasive breast cancer within 5 years of study entry Pathologicallyconfirmed invasive breast cancer in axillary lymph nodes or tumor with triple negative subtype: negative estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and Her2overexpression by ASCOCAP guidelines or tumor with a Breast Cancer Recurrence Score of ≥ 25 per the Genomic Health Oncotype DX breast cancer test, or residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Completed all primary therapy (surgery, (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant radiation) for the index malignancy with No evidence of local or distant recurrent disease by physical examination, blood tests (CBC, LFTs, Alk Phos), or symptomdirected imaging, per NCCN guidelines. Normal coagulation studies: PT and PTT ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal per institutional laboratory range and for patients on warfarin, INR &lt; 3.0. For patients on therapeutic anticoagulants, medication must be clinically held periprocedure per standard clinical management. Willing to undergo bone marrow aspiration and blood specimen collection per protocol specifications Age 18 or over and able to give informed consent Patient has no evidence of meeting exclusion criteria for companion clinical trials. Concurrent enrollment on another investigational therapy Patients receiving chronic, high dose systemic treatment with corticosteroids defined as: chronic use of cortisone &gt;50mg; hydrocortisone &gt;40mg, prednisone &gt;10mg, methylprednisone &gt;8mg or dexamethasone &gt;1.5mg; or another immunosuppressive agent. Topical or inhaled corticosteroids are allowed. Patients who have any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other conditions that could affect their participation in the study such as: Symptomatic congestive heart failure of New York heart Association Class III or IV Unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within 6 months of start of study drug, serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia or any other clinically significant cardiac disease Severely impaired lung function with a previously documented spirometry and DLCO that is 50% of the normal predicted value and/or 02 saturation that is 88% or less at rest on room air Uncontrolled diabetes Active (acute or chronic) or uncontrolled severe infections Liver disease such as cirrhosis, chronic active hepatitis or chronic persistent hepatitis A known history of HIV seropositivity as reported by the patient Impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease (e.g., ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome or small bowel resection) Patients with an active, bleeding diathesis Female patients who are pregnant or breast feeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test. Patients who have received prior treatment with an mTOR inhibitor (sirolimus, temsirolimus, everolimus). Patients with a known hypersensitivity to Everolimus or other rapamycins (sirolimus, temsirolimus) or to its excipients A detailed assessment of Hepatitis B/C medical history and risk factors must be done at screening for all patients. HBV DNA and HCV RNA PCR testing are required at screening for all patients with a positive medical history based on risk factors and/or confirmation of prior HBV/HCV infection.</criteria>
