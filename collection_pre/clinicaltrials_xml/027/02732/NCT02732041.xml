	<brief_summary>Asynchrony during mechanical ventilation has been poorly described in patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome. The purpose of this study is to describe the frequency of asynchronies (ineffective efforts and double triggering) in these group and evaluate potential risk factors and prognosis implications.</brief_summary>
