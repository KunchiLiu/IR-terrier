	<brief_summary>By obtaining clinical specimens from participants with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), colorectal cancer (CRC) and other select tumor types to establish and profile as freshly implanted tumors in mice, the aim of this study is to identify agents with predicted activity in the host patient while also potentially providing them with personalized cancer treatment options</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Personalized Patient Derived Xenograft (pPDX) Modeling to Test Drug Response in Matching Host</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Personalized patient-derived xenografts (pPDX) are increasingly used as tools for drug development in pre-clinical settings, and have been shown to recapitulate the histology and behavior of the cancers from which they are derived. Although, they have been commonly used productively as pre-clinical disease models to study disease biology and drug response, they have not been used prospectively to inform clinical management. pPDX have been employed to inform clinical decision-making in small studies, which have shown high concordance between individual pPDX and patient responses to therapy. While encouraging, the role of this approach in breast, colorectal and other cancer populations and in the context of genomic drug matching strategies remains undefined. This has created an opportunity to evaluate the utility of pPDX as clinical predictors to direct the use of chemo- and targeted therapies in combination with comprehensive genomic and epigenetic analysis for patients with TNBC, CRC and other selected tumor types.</detailed_description>
