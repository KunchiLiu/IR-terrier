	<brief_title>The Diagnostic Accuracy of "Three Rings Vulvoscopy" for Detection of Vulvar Dermatosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order to ensure a more accurate and systematic mapping of vulvar lesions, we previously described the original technique for performing colposcopy of the vulva called "Three Rings Vulvoscopy", taking into account three different skin types and zones, as well as morphological evaluation of lesions according to their specificity (non-specific and specific lesions). As the new colposcopy technique seemed to be promising in the differential diagnosis of vulvar discomfort, we designed two index tests, a semi-quantitative test called "N-S-P scheme" and a quantitative test named "Vulvoscopy Index". The sensitivity and specificity of both index tests will be estimated in comparison with histopathology as the reference test in two groups of asymptomatic patients ("normal vulva" - without any colposcopy lesion and "impaired vulvar skin" - with non-specific lesion) and in two groups of symptomatic patients ("vulvodynia" and "vulvar dermatosis") at the end of the study. Vulvar discomfort and lesions are being assessed and measured with "ISSVD Vulvodynia Pattern Questionnaire" and "TRIV Form Data". Asymptomatic patients are being recruited from asymptomatic patients undergoing planned labiaplasty, who grant vulvar samples to further investigation. Biopsy of the vulva from the symptomatic patients is being done during the routine clinical care.</detailed_description>
