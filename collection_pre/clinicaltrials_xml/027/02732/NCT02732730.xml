	<brief_title>Uptake and Adherence to Daily Oral PrEP as a Primary Prevention Strategy for Young African Women: A Vanguard Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Phase IV randomized multi-site prospective study to assess PrEP acceptance and adherence among HIV-uninfected young women. All women who accept open-label daily oral PrEP will be randomized 1:1 to receive enhanced adherence counselling based on feedback from observed drug levels or standard adherence support. A subset of up to ~25 women per site (maximum 75), will participate in qualitative assessments of facilitators and barriers for PrEP acceptance, adherence and continuation.</detailed_description>
