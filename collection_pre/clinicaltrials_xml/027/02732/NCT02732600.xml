	<brief_summary>In August 2014, the White House issued an Executive Action mandating that 25 VA medical centers place Peer Specialists (Veterans recovered from mental illness who are trained to support other Veterans with mental illness) on Primary Care Teams. Research shows that the success of adding new staff to existing teams can be improved by outside aid and facilitation. This quality improvement project will evaluate whether providing expanded support to half of the Primary Care Teams will lead to better outcomes when compared with teams that do not get extra support.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Peer Specialists on VA PACTs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peer Specialists are individuals with mental illness currently deployed to serve Veterans in specialty mental health clinics based upon their lived experiences. Peer Specialist delivered interventions have been shown to improve patient activation in multiple studies. In August 2014, the White House issued an Executive Action mandating that 25 VA medical centers pilot the deployment of Peer Specialists in their Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACTs). This project expands upon this nationally mandated Peer Specialist pilot with the integration of a cluster randomized implementation trial. This quality improvement project will evaluate the impact of facilitated implementation vs. standard implementation to support on the deployment of Peer Specialists in PACTs. The 25 sites will be divided into three cohorts (n=8,8,9). Each cohort will begin over three successive six-month blocks beginning in early 2016. Within each cohort, sites will be randomized to receive either facilitated or standard implementation. Facilitated Implementation sites will receive one year of support based on the i-PARIHS implementation model which includes training, implementation planning, ongoing external facilitation, feedback and consultation. Standard Implementation sites will receive written guidance and limited consultation by the investigators' team. The investigators will compare the groups on 1) the percent of their target population that actually received PS services; 2) ratings on PS workload productivity including ; 3) Peer Implementation and Services scores; 4) assessment of Veteran's change over time on the outcome variables of satisfaction, activation, and functioning ; 5) qualitative analysis of how well PSs were deployed and their impact.</detailed_description>
