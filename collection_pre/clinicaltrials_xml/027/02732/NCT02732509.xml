	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine how chronic inflammation influences skeletal muscle protein metabolism and metabolic function in humans. The investigators will evaluate acute responsiveness to a single bout of exercise in men and women who are either lean or overweight/obese. The investigators will explore the relationship between circulating inflammatory markers and anabolic, proteomic, and transcriptional responses to acute exercise. The investigators will measure skeletal muscle protein synthesis in the postabsorptive state and in response to a single bout of exercise.</brief_summary>
