	<brief_summary>To measure the absorption kinetics and postprandial amino acid availability after ingestion of minced beef compared with hydrolyzed beef in young males. Moreover, the basal muscle protein synthesis and the postprandial muscle protein synthetic response to minced beef and hydrolyzed beef ingestion are measured in young males. The postprandial muscle protein synthetic response is measured and compared during the early postprandial period (0-3 hours) after ingestion of the two meat products.</brief_summary>
