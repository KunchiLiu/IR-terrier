	<brief_summary>The REKREATE project will be an international, multi-centre, non-randomised, prospective single-arm pivotal study. All study patients will receive the FibroFix™ Meniscus scaffold following the provision of informed consent. A study period of 1 year and extended follow up period of up to 3 years is planned , to enable a thorough and complete assessment of the performance of the device when implanted to replace removed or damaged meniscal tissue in humans. The test article for this multi-centre study is the FibroFix™ Meniscus scaffold, which has been developed for repair of defects of the meniscus.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The subject (or guardian, if appropriate) has signed and dated a specific informed consent form; The subject is over the age of 18 and ≤55 years of age; The subject is able to comply with the protocoldefined preoperative procedures, the postoperative clinical and radiographic evaluations and the recommended rehabilitation regimen as determined by the Investigator; The subject has a diagnosis of an MRI or arthroscopically confirmed irreparable medial meniscus defect; The meniscal defect should represent 25% or more of the meniscus and be amenable to implantation; The peripheral meniscal rim must be present; The subject has a functionally intact ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament); Haemoglobin &gt;9g/dL and platelet count &gt;100,000/mm3 prior to Day 1; No contraindication to general anaesthetic; Female subjects of childbearing potential: a negative urine pregnancy test. Subject is &gt;55 years of age; The subject has a functionally deficient ACL; The subject has concomitant posterior cruciate ligament insufficiency of the involved knee or a concomitant injury that interferes with the subject's ability to comply with the recommended rehabilitation programme; The subject has a diagnosis of Grade IV Outerbridge Scale degenerative cartilage disease in the involved knee joint; Patients demonstrating an active local or systemic infection; Any condition, which in the judgment of the Investigator would preclude adequate evaluation of the FibroFix™ Meniscus scaffold and clinical outcome; The subject has a history of confirmed anaphylactoid reaction; The subject has received local administration of any type of corticosteroid or systemic administration of antineoplastic, immunostimulating, or immunosuppressive agents within 180 days prior to the scheduled surgery; The subject has evidence of osteonecrosis of the involved knee; The subject has a medical history that includes a confirmed diagnosis of rheumatoid or inflammatory arthritis, or relapsing polychondritis; If female and of childbearing potential: evidence of a positive pregnancy test or a stated intention to become pregnant in the next 612 months; Current or recent (&lt;3 months) participation in another device or drug study.</criteria>
