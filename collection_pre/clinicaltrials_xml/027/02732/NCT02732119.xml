	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is determine if the triplet combination of ribociclib, everolimus and exemastane is effective in the treatment of locally advanced/metastatic breast cancer following treatment with a CDK 4/6 inhibitor</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Ribociclib With Everolimus + Exemestane in HR+ HER2- Locally Advanced/Metastatic Breast Cancer Post Progression on CDK 4/6 Inhibitor.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the phase I dose escalation part of this study is to estimate the MTD(s) and/or identify the RP2D of the combination treatment of ribociclib+ everolimus + exemestane when dosed continuously in adult men and postmenopausal women with HR+ HER2-negative advanced breast cancer resistant to the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors, fulvestrant or tamoxifen. The purpose of the phase II portion of this trial will be to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of exemestane, everolimus and ribociclib triplet following progression on a CDK 4/6 inhibitor. This part of the study will be conducted using a Simon's optimal two-stage design.</detailed_description>
