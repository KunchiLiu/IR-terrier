	<brief_title>Does Stellate Ganglion Block Decrease Stress Response of Intubation?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both groups will have the same general anesthesia procedure, patients in stellate block group will receive lidocaine in the stellate block will in control group patients will receive Na.Cl as placebo. primary outcome will be stress response to subsequent endotracheal intubation measure by changes in heart rate</detailed_description>
