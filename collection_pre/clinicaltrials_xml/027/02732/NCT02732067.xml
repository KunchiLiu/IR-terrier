	<detailed_description>Death rate in anesthesia is one of the most valuable methods to assess the safety of anesthesia practice among different types of patients. Most of the studies of death rate in anesthesia are retrospective with many drawbacks and pitfalls like absence of information in the records of the patients. In this study, the investigators will follow the death among patients who underwent surgery under anesthesia whether regional or general over the next two years from 2016 to 2018, by examining the patients records from the hospital database and recording the events that occur to the dead patients. The end point of this study will be anesthesia death rate inside the hospital.</detailed_description>
