	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to compare rolapitant with fosaprepitant in controlling or preventing nausea and/or vomiting that may be caused by chemotherapy in patients with sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Rolapitant on Nausea/Vomiting in Patients With Sarcoma Receiving Multi-Day Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy (HEC) With Doxorubicin and Ifosfamide Regimen (AI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups and Study Drug Administration: There are 2 parts in this study. If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will be assigned to either Part 1 or Part 2 based on when they joined the study. Each study cycle is 21 days. If participant is enrolled on Part 1 of the study, they will receive rolapitant by mouth on Day 1 of each cycle. If participant is enrolled on Part 2 of the study, they will then be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups to learn which study drug they will receive. This is done because no one knows if one group is better, the same, or worse than the other. - If participant is in Group A, they will receive rolapitant by mouth on Day 1 of each cycle. - If participant is in Group B, they will receive fosaprepitant by vein for about 30 minutes on Day 1 of each cycle. Depending on how participant responds to the drug, they may also receive fosaprepitant on Days 1 and 4 of Cycles 2 and beyond. Participant and the study staff will know to which group participant is assigned. Both groups will also receive additional supportive drugs (such as dexamethasone and ondansetron) before chemotherapy, every day for 5 days, to help prevent nausea and vomiting. Participant may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks. Participant will also receive the chemotherapy prescribed by their doctor. Participant will sign a separate consent form for chemotherapy that will describe these treatments in detail, along with their risks. Before each chemotherapy cycle, participant will be given a study diary. Each day, participant will record any side effects they may have. Participant should bring their study diary to every study visit. Study Visits: Within 1 week before each cycle: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Participant will fill out the same questionnaire they did at screening. - Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests. Participant will have this blood draw repeated 2 times each week during Cycle 1. Participant may choose to have these blood draws performed at a local lab or clinic that is closer to their home. The results of these blood tests will be sent to the study doctor for review. This option will be discussed with participant. Length of Study: Participant may receive up to 6 cycles of chemotherapy/study drug. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if they are unable to follow study directions. Patient's participation on the study will be over after they have completed the end-of-study visit. End-of-Study Visit: About 3 weeks after your last dose of rolapitant/fosaprepitant: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Participant will fill out the same questionnaire they did at screening. This is an investigational study. Both fosaprepitant and rolapitant are FDA approved and commercially available for the prevention of nausea and vomiting that may be caused by chemotherapy. It is considered investigational to compare these 2 standard treatments to one another to learn if one is more effective than the other. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work. Up to 91 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
