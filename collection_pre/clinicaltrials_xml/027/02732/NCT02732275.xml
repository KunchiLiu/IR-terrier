	<brief_summary>This will be a First-in-Human, Phase 1, multi-center, non-randomized, open label study of DS-3201b, Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase EZH1/2 dual inhibitor to assess its safety and tolerability, identify a maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/ tentative recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and assess its pharmacokinetic/dynamic properties in Japanese subjects with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.</brief_summary>

ULN = upper limit normal AST = aspartate transaminase ALT = alanine transaminase Has a leukemia, such as precursor Tcell lymphoblastic leukemia, Tcell lymphoblastic leukemia, Tcell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Tcell prolymphocytic leukemia, or Tcell large granular lymphocytic leukemia Has a history of central nervous system (CNS) symptoms, and are diagnosed with CNS lymphoma Previously had (within 6 months before registration) or currently has any of the following diseases: uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, cardiac failure (The New York Heart Association [NYHA] Functional Classification ≥ Class III), myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, unstable angina, arrhythmia requiring treatment, coronary/peripheral bypass surgery, pulmonary thrombosis, uncontrolled deep vein thrombosis, clinically severe thromboembolic event, or autoimmune disease requiring treatment. Has a history of myocardial infarction and unstable angina within 6 months before registration; symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF; NYHA classes IIIIV); congenital long QT syndrome; or ventricular arrhythmia requiring treatment. Grade 4 neuropathy Has a QTcF prolongation to &gt;450 ms based on triplicate ECG at screening. Clinically severe infection that requires systemic administration of antibacterial or antiviral agents. Positive for any of the following: active infection with human hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigen, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody within 90 days before registration. Positive for any of the following: human hepatitis B core (HBc) antibody, human HBs antibody with ≥ 2.1 log copies/mL hepatitis B virus (HBV)DNA within 90 days before registration. Has a concomitant neuropsychiatric disorder that would increase the risk of toxicity, in the opinion of the investigators. Has a history of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Has received autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation within 12 weeks (84 days) of the start of study treatment. Has received other investigational drugs within 4 weeks (28 days) of the start of study treatment. Has received chemotherapy or immunotherapy (including targeted therapy with antibody or small molecule, retinoid therapy, and hormonal therapy) within 4 weeks (28 days) of the start of study treatment ( or within 12 weeks for anti CCR4 antibody or anti CD20 antibody). Has received radiation therapy within 4 weeks (28 days) of the start of study treatment. Has multiple primary malignancies, EXCEPT adequately resected nonmelanoma skin cancer, curatively treated insitu disease, or other solid tumors curatively treated, with no evidence of disease for ≥5 years. Has a concomitant treatment with strong/moderate inhibitors/inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Is unwilling to use doublebarrier contraceptive measures or avoid intercourse during the study and for at least 3 months after the last dose of DS3201b. Is a lactating mother, or pregnant as confirmed by pregnancy tests performed within 14 days before registration. Prior treatment with other EZH inhibitors Has a concomitant medical condition that would increase the risk of toxicity.</criteria>
