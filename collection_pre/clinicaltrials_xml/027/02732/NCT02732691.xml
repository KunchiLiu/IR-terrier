	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to collect information about a new treatment for severe aortic stenosis, which affects the aortic valve in the heart. Aortic stenosis is a narrowing of the aortic valve opening, which decreases blood flow from the heart and causes symptoms such as chest pain, fainting and shortness of breath. The preferred treatment for severe aortic stenosis is aortic valve replacement surgery. A less invasive surgical approach called TAVR is offered to those patients who are high risk for undergoing open heart surgery to replace the aortic valve. In this study, TAVR will be performed using the JenaValve Pericardial TAVR System, which is intended to help treat severe aortic stenosis. The JenaValve replacement valve is placed inside the aortic valve by using the JenaValve delivery system. The JenaValve replacement valve may be implanted in one of two ways: (1) transapical - where the valve is implanted through the chest wall, and (2) transfemoral - where the valve is implanted through an artery in the groin. The choice of which implant method will be used is decided by the doctor.</brief_summary>
