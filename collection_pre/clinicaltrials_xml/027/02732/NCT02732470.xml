	<brief_summary>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is chronic and systemic autoimmune disease that mainly affecting women and leading to organ damages especially skin, joints, kidneys, central nervous system and heart. In SLE, immune system dysfunction leads to autoantibodies, autoreactive T cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines production. These elements will initiate and maintain organ damages. Patients with SLE have disease flares followed by period of remission. Flares can occur because of stress, infections, surgery, pregnancy or ultraviolet exposition. Furthermore the chronic nature of SLE is an important factor of depression in these patients. Qi Gong is an ancient Chinese practice based on relaxation movements, posture and breathing in order to harmonize the body and mind. This practice improves the general state by reducing fatigue and improving sleep. The beneficial effect of Qi Gong in medicine has been studied in several diseases including cancer, diabetes, arterial hypertension and fibromyalgia. Qi Gong seems interesting in depressed patients but also to reduce stress in healthy subjects. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of Qi Gong on quality if life in patients with SLE. Patients will have two lessons of 60 minutes per week for three months and a collective lesson of 90 minutes per week for three months. The teacher of Qi-Gong will evaluate adherence to the practice of Qi Gong every week. Clinical and biological data will be collected at baseline and at 2th, 4th, 6th, 9th and 12th month. Different evaluation scores and neurotrophin levels will be collected at baseline and at 6th month.</brief_summary>
