	<detailed_description>Cranial Electrostimulating (CES) Therapy is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved treatment for depression and anxiety. However, there are no known studies on the use of this device with homeless adults. The objectives of this study are as follows: 1) to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of CES as a treatment for homeless adults; and 2) to evaluate the efficacy of CES for the treatment of anxiety and depressive symptoms among homeless adults. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatments: sham (n=10) or CES (n=10). Changes in anxiety and depressive symptoms will be evaluated over time.</detailed_description>
