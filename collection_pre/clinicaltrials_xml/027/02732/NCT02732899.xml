	<brief_summary>To determine safety and efficacy of intravitreal injections of Sirolimus with adjunct EYLEA in subjects with exudative age related macular degeneration (AMD) with persistent intraretinal or subretinal edema due to neovascular AMD despite previous intravitreal antiVEGF treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sirolimus in Conjunction With Eylea vs Eylea Alone for Exudative AMD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a single-center, masked, randomized, 36 week study, designed to evaluate the safety and treatment efficacy of intravitreal Sirolimus with adjunct EYLEA® (aflibercept) in patients with persistent edema due to neovascular AMD versus EYLEA® (aflibercept) alone. Twenty (20) patients will be randomized to receive study medication in a 1:1 ratio. Study treatment will be administered by intravitreal injections. The sham injections given in the EYLEA® alone group are needleless and they are given in order to help preserve the masking of those subjects in that treatment group.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female patients, 50 years of age or older at baseline 2. Patient has completed/signed an informed consent prior to any studyrelated procedures and is able to follow study instructions and likely to complete all required visits. • Ocular Inclusion Criteria (Study eye only): 3. BCVA 5 75 (20/80020/30), inclusive, in study eye; if both eyes are eligible, the eye with the best potential visual improvement as determined by the investigator will be selected for treatment. 4. Presence of choroidal neovascularization secondary to AMD 5. At least 3 previous intravitreal antiVEGF injections in the past 6 months 6. Injection of AntiVEGF may be deferred for at least 4 weeks from randomization based on clinical assessment of AMD by the investigator. 7. Clear ocular media and adequate pupil dilation to permit good quality photographic imaging 1. Females who are pregnant, nursing, planning a pregnancy or who are of childbearing potential not using a reliable method of contraception. 2. History or current evidence of hypersensitivity to any components of the study medication or fluorescein, as assessed by the investigator. 3. Participation in any investigational drug or device study within 30 days prior to baseline 4. History or current evidence of a medical condition that may, in the opinion of the investigator, preclude the safe administration of study medication or affect the results of the study. • Ocular Exclusion Criteria (Study eye only): 5. Decrease of greater than 150 microns in central subfield thickness as measured by OCT since the last intravitreal injection in the study eye 6. Aphakia 7. History of pars plana vitrectomy in the study eye 8. History of major ophthalmic surgery in the study eye in the past 3 months and any ophthalmic surgery in the study eye within the past 30 days 9. History of significant ocular disease or condition other than exudative AMD that may confound results 10. Uncontrolled glaucoma (defined as intraocular pressure &gt;21mm Hg despite treatment with two or more ocular hypotensive medications at baseline) 11. No active ocular or periocular infections, or ocular malignancy including lymphoma 12. Presence of significant epiretinal membrane 13. Significant vitreoretinal traction</criteria>
