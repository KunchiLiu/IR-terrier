	<brief_summary>Gastrointestinal(GI) hemorrhage related with gastric cancer is prevalent in advanced cases mostly. As endoscopic hemostatic methods such as argon plasma ablation (APC) had developed, controlling GI hemorrhage in gastric cancer is much easier these days. but re-bleeding rate is still high, even after successful hemostasis with APC or electrical coagulation. Furthermore patients who were experienced re-bleeding are expected poorer survival outcomes than those who are not. So excellent bleeding control in gastric cancer is most important in GI hemorrhage of gastric cancer. Recently developed hemostatic powder [Endo-Clot(TM)] is easy to use and have proven its usefulness in GI hemorrhage in peptic ulcer diseases. So in this study, investigator will try to find out feasibility &amp; safety of Endo-Clot(TM) in GI hemorrhage in gastric cancer.</brief_summary>
