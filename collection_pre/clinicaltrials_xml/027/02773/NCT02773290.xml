	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of romiplostim administered once weekly to Aplastic Anemia (AA) patients with thrombocytopenia refractory to or ineligible for immunosuppressive therapy in Japan and Korea. Safety and pharmacokinetics of romiplostim after repeated administration will also be assessed.</brief_summary>
