	<brief_summary>Traditionally, healers are willing to look after, two out of three French citizens have already appealed to them at least once during their lives. Many healers in good faith are exercising their magnetism as a "gift" often inherited from elders. Now, they create interest of doctors who do not hesitate in some cases to ensure their cooperation, to implicitly recognize their mysterious talents. Some serious studies have examined these practices: Several studies have been conducted on the influence of biofield therapies in pain, depression and fatigue in cancer disease. The investigators propose a study of the effect of magnetism on the wart disease whose cure is objectively assessable. Sixty-two subjects in total would be included, comparing 2 proportions observed: the proportion of healing in the group treated with a "real" biofield therapist (recognized and affiliated to the National Group for Alternative Medicine in France) to the proportion of healing in the group treated with a "fake" biofield therapist (someone assessed as not having capacity to magnetize). The "fake" biofield therapist, placebo, has been trained to replicate gestures during a training validated by an independent recognized biofield therapist. If the results are in favor of magnetism, this pilot study would encourage additional investigations to determine whether the practice of magnetism may be a paramedic specialization.</brief_summary>
