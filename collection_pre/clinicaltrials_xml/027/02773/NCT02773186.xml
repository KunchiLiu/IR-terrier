	<detailed_description>This prospective and observational study involved consecutive patients aged between 2 and 12 years undergoing a major surgery using general anesthesia. Cerebral oxygen saturation, non-invasive arterial pressure, pulse oximetry, and heart rate were recorded at the following stages of the surgical intervention: baseline, induction, intubation, surgical incision, end of surgery, and extubation. Preoperative anxiety was evaluated by using the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale, and NPOBC was determined by using the Post-Hospital Behaviour Questionnaire on 7th and 28th postoperative days. A logistic regression was created to identify factors associated with the development of NPOBC</detailed_description>
