	<criteria>1. The ability to understand and give informed consent to participate. 2. HIV1 infected with stable ART &gt; 12 months 3. Plasma HIVRNA &lt; 50 copies/ml 4. Plasma homocysteine ≥ 12 μmol/L (subjects with &lt; 12 μmol/L will be included in the analysis of secondary endpoint 3 (see 5.4). 5. Male or female, age 18 or older. 1. Treatment with trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole or methotrexate 2. Ongoing B6, B12 or folate substitution 3. Antiepileptic treatment 4. Small bowel or ventricular resection 5. Disturbed absorption in small bowel (Mb Crohn, untreated coeliac disease) 6. Ongoing neurological disease or severe psychiatric disease 7. Any malignant tumor in the history. 8. Severe ongoing infection or opportunistic infection 9. AUDIT &gt; 7 for men and &gt; 5 for women 10. MADRS &gt; 20 11. Significant B12 or folate deficiency that indicate substitution (all subjects will be offered adequate substitution, they will be included in the analysis of secondary endpoint 3 (see 5.4)). 12. Pregnancy at screening visit, or planning pregnancy during study period is an exclusion criteria. (Not due to toxicity of Triobe, but to elevated risk of being prescribed Bvitamins outside of trial. If study object gets pregnant during study, she can continue the study but must be excluded if she starts treatment with other Bvitamin treatment than Triobe.)</criteria>
