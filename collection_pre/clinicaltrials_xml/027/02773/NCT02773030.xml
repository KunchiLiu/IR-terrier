	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, multicountry, open-label, Phase 1b/2a dose-escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of CC-220 when administered as monotherapy and in combination with dexamethasone. The study will consist of an escalating dose-escalation portion (Part 1) as well as an expansion of each cohort (ie, Cohort C: Monotherapy (MonoT) and Cohort D: Combination treatment with 2 drugs (DoubleT) at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) to further evaluate safety and estimate preliminary efficacy (Part 2).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Study to Determine Dose and Tolerability of CC-220 Monotherapy and in Combination With Dexamethasone in Subjects With Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects assigned to CC-220 monotherapy who develop PD will have the option to receive Dexamethasone (DEX) in addition to CC-220 after consultation with the Medical Monitor. The dose of CC-220 will not be higher than the dose of CC-220 used in combination with dexamethasone that has been tested and is considered safe. Progressive disease must be confirmed in accordance with International Myeloma Working Group ( IMWG) criteria. The starting dose of DEX will be 40 mg Once daily (QD) on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28-day cycle for subjects who are ≤75 years of age. For subjects who are &gt;75 years of age, the starting dose of DEX is 20 mg QD on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28 day cycle. This treatment will continue until PD, unacceptable toxicity or the subject withdraws consent. The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study: 1. Subject is ≥18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent form (ICF) 2. Subject must understand and voluntarily sign an ICF prior to any studyrelated assessments/procedures being conducted 3. Subject is willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements 4. Subjects must have a documented diagnosis of Multiple myeloma (MM) and have measurable disease by serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis (sPEP or uPEP): sPEP ≥0.5 g/dL or uPEP ≥200 mg/24 hours 5. All subjects must have received at least 2 prior myeloma regimens (note: induction with or without bone marrow transplant and with or without maintenance therapy is considered one regimen) 6. All subjects must have received prior treatment with at least 2 consecutive cycles of a lenalidomide or pomalidomidecontaining regimen 7. All subjects must have received prior treatment with at least 2 consecutive cycles of a proteasome inhibitor or a proteasome inhibitorcontaining regimen 8. All subjects must have documented disease progression on or within 60 days from the last dose of their last myeloma therapy 9. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0, 1 or 2 10. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must: 1. Have a negative pregnancy test as verified by the Investigator prior to starting study therapy. She must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the course of the study, and after the end of IP. This applies even if the subject practices true abstinence* from heterosexual contact. 2. Either commit to true abstinence* from heterosexual contact (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis and source documented) or agree to use two forms of reliable contraception. One must be a highly effective method and one additional effective (barrier) method. Contraception must be practiced without interruption, 28 days prior to initiation of CC220, during the study therapy (including dose interruptions), and for at least 28 days after discontinuation of study therapy. 11. Male subjects must: a. Practice true abstinence* (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis) or agree to use a condom during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while participating in the study, during dose interruptions and for at least 28 days following investigational product discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy. * True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. [Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.] 12. Males must agree to refrain from donating sperm while on CC220 and for 90 days after discontinuation from Investigational product (IP). 13. All subjects must agree to refrain from donating blood while on IP and for 90 days after discontinuation from IP 14. All male and female subjects must follow all requirements defined in the Pregnancy Prevention Program. The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment: 1. Subject has any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from participating in the study 2. Subject has any condition including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study 3. Subject has any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study 4. Subject has nonsecretory or oligosecretory multiple myeloma 5. Subjects with Plasma Cell leukemia 6. Any of the following laboratory abnormalities Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1,000/μL Hemoglobin &lt;8 g/dL (&lt;4.9 mmol/L) Platelet count &lt;75,000/μL Corrected serum calcium &gt;13.5 mg/dL (&gt;3.4 mmol/L) Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥2.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Serum total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase &gt;1.5 x ULN Subjects with serious renal impairment (24hour creatinine clearance [CrCl] &lt;50 mL/min) or requiring dialysis would be excluded 7.

Subjects with a prior history of malignancies, other than MM, unless the subject has been free of the disease for ≥5 years with the exception of the following noninvasive malignancies: Basal cell carcinoma of the skin Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin Carcinoma in situ of the cervix Carcinoma in situ of the breast Incidental histological findings of prostate cancer such as T1a or T1b using the Tumor/Node/Metastasis (TNM) classification of malignant tumors or prostate cancer that is curative 10.
