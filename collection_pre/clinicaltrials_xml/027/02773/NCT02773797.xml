	<brief_summary>A variety of medications have been used to treat the anxiety, discomfort, and fear associated with continuous and sudden episodic breathlessness in patients with advanced respiratory disease. Opioids and benzodiazepines, used alone or in combination, are commonly prescribed for this distressing symptom. Clinicians are concerned about the adverse effects of opioids, especially respiratory depression, so they frequently prescribe benzodiazepines. Recent studies have shown that benzodiazepine use is associated with adverse respiratory outcomes in older adults with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Dexmedetomidine may be an alternative to current drug therapies for breathlessness. Dexmedetomidine produces a dose dependent sedation, anxiolysis, and analgesia without respiratory depression or cognitive dysfunction. The drug can be administered intranasally (IN-DEX) to induce light to moderate sedation of several hours duration. The objective of the research is to assess the dose dependent safety and efficacy of intranasal dexmedetomidine compared to intranasal saline (placebo) in clinically stable patients with severe COPD. This will be accomplished in a staffed acute care setting with routine vital signs monitoring and continuous pulse oximetry. Patients will be assessed objectively and subjectively for their level of sedation by validated sedation scales. The study is an extension of a similarly designed pilot study which did not include a placebo comparison. Results of the study will be helpful to design additional trials with intranasal dexmedetomidine in acutely symptomatic COPD patients, exertional dyspnea and exercise performance, and dyspnea treatment comparisons.</brief_summary>
