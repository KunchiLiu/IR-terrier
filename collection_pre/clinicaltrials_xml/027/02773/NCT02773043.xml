	<brief_summary>The proposed study is to validate a non-invasive imaging technique to evaluate the myocardial perfusion reserve in comparison with a validated invasive technique, the measure of coronary flow reserve (CRF) with thermodilution.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Myocardial Perfusion Reserve</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary artery disease is a public health problem. The measurement of myocardial perfusion reserve is a prognostic factor supplemental. Its measure should influence the treatment and the follow up of the patients. The measurement of CRF by by one pressure-temperature sensor-tipped guide wire is a validated technique to evaluate the myocardial perfusion reserve but it is an invasive technique. In this study, the investigators will compare this method with a non-invasive method: completely automated analysis and quantification of myocardial blood flow from DICOM files corresponding to stress and rest images was developed with a new camera CZT SPECT.</detailed_description>
