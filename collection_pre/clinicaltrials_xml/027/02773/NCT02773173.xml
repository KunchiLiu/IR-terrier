	<brief_title>Individualized Pneumoperitoneum Pressure in Colorectal Laparoscopic Surgery Versus Standard Therapy (IPPCollapse-II)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the last two decades laparoscopic surgery has settled as a less invasive surgical approach compared to open surgery. It is associated with lower perioperative morbidity and hospital stay. There is growing evidence that increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), even for short periods of time, is associated with increased perioperative morbidity (pain, increased inflammatory markers peritoneal injury worse splanchnic perfusion abnormalities hemodynamic and ventilatory ...). The study is a prospective multicenter randomized clinical intervention trial to assess the impact of IAP individualization strategy (IPP-Individualized pneumoperitoneum Pressure) relative to a IAP standard strategy (SPP-Standard pneumoperitoneum Pressure) using a validated scale (VAS) (PQRS- Postoperative Quality of Recovery Scale). Postoperative pain in the first 24 hours (area under VAS curve , opioid rescue, referred pain to the shoulder) and surgical stress and inflammatory markers (neutrophil/lymphocyte, ratio,C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, procalcitonin) are also measured. Postoperative complications are evaluated by Clavier-Dindo classification.</detailed_description>
