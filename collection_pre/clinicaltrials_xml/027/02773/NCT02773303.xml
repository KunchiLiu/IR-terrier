	<brief_summary>This project aims: - to further explore the effectiveness of a novel sonified Neurofeedback management therapy for children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) - to determine if balance control is different before and after therapy</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Once the informed consent of a parent or guardian has been secured, each child will be asked to provide informed assent. If the child elects to participate in the research project, he/she is enrolled in the study and assign to one of two groups: Active Comparator or Sham Comparator. If possible, his/her ability to maintain balance is then assessed using a standard extended mCTSIB protocol (standing for 25 seconds on a hard surface/4" tall foam cushion with eyes open/closed and head neutral/turned right/left/flexed or extended) and his/her baseline qEEG and Galvanic Skin Response are recorded. A series of questionnaires will be administered to the child and/or his/her parents/legal guardian/caretaker. Afterward the child will be instructed to wear the prescribed device (either the Active Comparator (Mente Autism™) or the Sham Comparator (a device externally identical to Mente Autism™, providing binaural beats but not tailor-made neurofeedback binaural beats)) to use at home for 40 minutes a day for 12 weeks. After 6 weeks and at the end of the 12 weeks treatment period, the child will again be tested as at the beginning of the trial (posturography, qEEG, Galvanic Skin Response and questionnaires). At the end of the study, participants in the Sham Comparator group will be offered the option of receiving the full therapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>a clear diagnosis of ASD and a high starting delta wave level, as confirmed by the initial qEEG. Furthermore, since the therapy is administered via a device requiring to be connected to a computer, tablet or phone with WiFi capabilities to work, the following are additional requirement: iPhone 4s or later or all iPads except first generation iPAD running OS v7 or later, or computer running Windows 7 or later Tablet running Android 4.1 or later Internet connection a history of hearing impairment and comorbidities such as RettSyndrome and if they get low delta wave recordings in frontal lobe with qEEG (part of the baseline testing battery)</criteria>
