	<brief_summary>There are two primary approaches to the treatment of OCD, pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). Lack of therapeutic success with one approach leads to trials of the alternative approach or a combination of the two. A rarely used third therapy approach, appropriate for only the most severely afflicted and treatment resistant patients, is neurosurgical ablation of certain brain regions involved in mood and anxiety. The neurosurgical ablation procedures are irreversible in nature, and involve the destruction of specific volumes of brain tissue through various controlled means. Surgical procedures include cingulotomy, subcaudate tractotomy, limbic leucotomy which is a combination of the first two procedures and capsulotomy. DBS therapy is an alternative to neurosurgical procedures, specifically anterior capsulotomy, for patients with chronic, severe OCD which has proven resistant to primary pharmacological and/or behavior therapy options. Results from 26 severe, treatment-resistant OCD patients treated with DBS at four collaborating centers, three in the US, and one in Europe are summarized in great detail in pages 12-22 of the provided/attached "Reclaim Summary of Safety and Probable Benefit."</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reclaimâ„¢ Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) Therapy for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Procedure The DBS lead is stereotactically introduced into the target in the brain (AIC) and fixed to the skull; the lead is then connected to a neurostimulator implanted subcutaneously in the subclavicular region. This is performed by a neurosurgeon skilled in this technique, as the same procedure is routinely performed in patients with other diseases (using other brain targets). Sample Size: There is no minimum number or maximum, but is expected to be far less than 100. Patients that meet the inclusion criteria and will obtain insurance coverage will be candidates for the procedure. As this is not a study on efficacy, there is no statistical analysis to be performed. IRB approval is required per FDA stipulations. Recruitment: Patients who have medically refractory OCD for at least 5 years or more, have failed 3 or more SSRIs, and who meet the criteria for the indications above and are not contraindicated, will attempt to be recruited, or to at least learn more information about the procedure, through the use of flyers. These flyers will attempt to catch the attention of those subjects who may be candidates, and who may benefit from the procedure; only through a more detailed clinic visit would it be know if they meet criteria. The flyers are included as an attachment, and display contact information. They will be posted on line, on free advertising bulletin boards, on UT Psychiatry Clinic buildings, on Baylor Psychiatry Clinic buildings, within the UT and Baylor schools of Medicine, and in private OCD support groups. Course of Study Patients who are enrolled will meet the necessary requirements/indications for insurance coverage of the system to be implanted. Aside from these criteria, no specific population will be targeted or else excluded from recruitment. They will sign the informed consent form (attached) prior to surgery if they agree with the course of action. They will be followed for clinical effect and side effects on a routine basis following surgery: after 2 weeks, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 months and then every 6 months for months, by both the psychiatrist and neurosurgeon. The known risks are detailed in the attached Summary of Safety and Probable Benefit document, Section VIII, as well as the Device manual (attached). All patients enrolled will have their identity safe-guarded, will be issued subject numbers, and personal information will be kept electronically under lock and key in a permanent office. Data Safety Monitoring As this procedure is nearly identical to that routinely performed here on patients with Parkinson's disease (except that these are different patients and thus a different brain structure is targeted), no specific/independent DSMB will be needed, as there is none currently in use nor needed for the Parkinson's patients. Risks to Clinicians/Researchers There are no known procedures or situations that will provide risks to the clinical/research staff.</detailed_description>
