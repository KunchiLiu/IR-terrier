	<brief_summary>Braces are commonly prescribed after posterior spinal instrumented fusion (PSIF) in patients with lumbar degenerative conditions with the aim of improving pain relief and quality of life. However, there is a lack of evidence on the indication for postoperative bracing, as surgeons choose to use braces mainly based on their experience and training. The aim of this study is to investigate whether wearing a brace after PSIF can improve pain relief and quality of life (QOL) 6 weeks and 3 months after surgery.</brief_summary>
