	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the current study is to determine if providing cognitive-behavioral therapy of Insomnia and nightmares (CBTin) and Cognitive Processing Therapy of PTSD (CPT) results in greater PTSD and sleep symptom reduction than CPT only. A secondary objective is to determine if the sequencing of CBTl&amp;N before or after CPT results in differential effects on PTSD and sleep symptom reduction.</brief_summary>

Active duty military and recently discharged Veterans at Fort Hood eligible for treatment at Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center (CRDAMC). History of having deployed in support of combat operations following 9/11, assessed by selfreport.

Willing to refrain from new behavioral health or medication treatment for issues pertaining to sleep, PTSD, or nightmares during participation in the study. Indication that the individual plans to be in the area for the 5 months following the first assessment. Individuals who have been redeployed from a theater of operation less than 3 months.

Inability to speak and read English. Moderate to severe brain damage, assessed by the inability to comprehend the baseline questionnaires. Pregnancy, assessed by selfreport and review of medical record, because sleep disturbances due to pregnancy may be the result of different mechanisms and the proposed instruments and treatments have not been validated in this population. Current circadian rhythm, environmental, sleep deprivation, or hypersomnia sleep disorder, assessed by selfreport because CBTin has not been validated in these populations. Other untreated sleep disorders to include individuals with clinically significant obstructive sleep apnea (Respiratory Disturbance Index &gt;5/hr), periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD; &gt;15/hr with arousals), nocturnal seizures, or a parasomnia (e.g., sleepwalking, confusional arousals, nocturnal eating and drinking syndrome), based on criteria from the International Classification of Sleep Disordersthird edition (American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 2013). Individuals meeting criteria for one of the above sleep disorders will be seen for clinical care at the CRDAMC Sleep Center. Once the aforementioned sleep disorder is stably treated, individuals meeting the study criteria for insomnia, nightmares, and PTSD can be reassessed for participation in this study. Sleep efficiency &gt;85%, as assessed by the sleep diary. Serious mental health diagnosis (e.g., bipolar disorder or psychosis) assessed with review of baseline questionnaires, review of medical record, and/or Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI 7.0 Mania module).
