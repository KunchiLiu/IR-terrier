	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted globally. The aim of this trial is comparing glycaemic control and safety of insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) versus insulin glargine (IGlar) as add-on therapy to SGLT2i (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors) in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female, age at least 18 years at the time of signing informed consent Subjects diagnosed (clinically) with type 2 diabetes mellitus HbA1c 7.011.0% [5397 mmol/mol] (both inclusive) by central laboratory analysis Body mass index (BMI) equal to or above 20 kg/m^2 and below 40 kg/m^2 Insulin naïve subjects; however short term insulin treatment for a maximum of 14 days prior to the day of screening is allowed, as well as prior insulin treatment for gestational diabetes A stable daily dose for at least 90 days prior to the day of screening of any SGLT2i in monotherapy or in combination with metformin ± DPP4i ± pioglitazone. Use of pioglitazone is not allowed in subjects treated with dapagliflozin Receipt of any investigational medicinal product within 90 days prior to screening Use of any OADs (other than SGLT2i in monotherapy or in combination with metformin or DPP4i or pioglitazone as described in the inclusion criteria) within 90 days prior to the day of screening Use of glucagonlike peptide1 (GLP1) receptor agonist (e.g., exenatide or liraglutide) within 90 days prior to the day of screening Acute decompensation of glycaemic control requiring immediate intensification of treatment to prevent severe metabolic dysregulation (e.g., diabetes ketoacidosis) in the previous 90 days prior to the day of the screening Subjects presently classified as being in NYHA (New York Heart Association) Class III or IV1 Renal impairment estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 as per CKDEPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) Impaired liver function, defined as ALT (alanine aminotransferase) equal to or above 2.5 times upper normal limit at screening Known or suspected hypersensitivity to trial product(s) or related products</criteria>
