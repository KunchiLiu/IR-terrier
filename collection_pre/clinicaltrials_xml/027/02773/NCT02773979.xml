	<brief_summary>This phase 1, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study will enroll 36 healthy volunteers to receive 1 of 3 regimens of PfSPZ or placebo, randomized 3:1. They will also receive suppressive doses of chloroquine (CQ). 10 weeks post 3rd immunization (and 4 weeks after last dose of CQ) subjects will be subjected to controlled human malarial infection. The primary objective of this study is to 1) evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge administered by DVI on Days 3, 10, and 17 to healthy malaria-na誰ve adults taking suppressive doses of CQ.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This phase I, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study will randomize 36 healthy adult participants to one of three cohorts. The first 12 subjects will be randomized to receive PfSPZ Challenge vaccine at a dose of 51,200 sporozoites or normal saline placebo. The next 12 subjects will be randomized to receive PfSPZ Challenge vaccine at a dose of 102,400 sporozoites or placebo. The last 12 subjects will be randomized to receive PfSPZ Challenge vaccine at a dose of 204,800 sporozoites or placebo. Within each group, placebo will be assigned 1:3, with blinded allocation to the two treatments within each dose-escalation group. All subjects will be immunized via the DVI route at 3, 10, and 17 days from chloroquine initiation. All subjects will receive, by directly observed treatment, oral chloroquine (CQ) on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 at a suppressive dose of 600 mg base on Day 1 and 300 mg base on Days 8, 15 and 22. At 10 weeks after the third administration of study vaccine or placebo, all subjects will receive PfSPZ Challenge by direct venous injection at a dose of 3,200 P. falciparum sporozoites to assess vaccine efficacy against controlled human malarial infection. Participants will receive a telephone follow-up six and twelve months thereafter. Malarone速 will be offered as terminal treatment for all volunteers who do not sustain malaria by Day 28 and as first line therapy in the event of volunteer withdrawal from the study prior to onset of a clinical malaria episode. The primary objective of this study is to 1) evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge administered by DVI on Days 3, 10, and 17 to healthy malaria-na誰ve adults taking suppressive doses of CQ.</detailed_description>
