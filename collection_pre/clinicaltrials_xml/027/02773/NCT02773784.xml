	<brief_summary>- This is a prospective, single-center, non-randomized, non-controlled study. - The estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), HER2 status and Ki67 index of CNB specimen are critical biomarkers for making neoadjuvant therapy strategy in invasive breast cancer. The concordance of these biomarkers between CNB and surgical specimen was varied in previous retrospective reports. The aim of this study is to determine the discordance of these biomarkers between CNB and surgical specimen and the influence of making treatment strategy by the discordance.</brief_summary>
