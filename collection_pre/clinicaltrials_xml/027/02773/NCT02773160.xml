	<brief_summary>A large subgroup of patients with chronic non-specific low back pain have motor control impairments. During motor control exercises, different forms of external feedback can be used to support training. This randomized controlled trial will investigate the effectiveness of different forms of external feedback during the learning phase of a motor control task for the lumbar spine in healthy subjects and patients with chronic non-specific low back pain (CNSLBP). Both healthy subjects and patients with CNSLBP will be randomized into three groups: one group will receive feedback from motion sensors, one group from a mirror and one group will receive no feedback (control group). A single session intervention with measurements at baseline and immediately post-intervention will be used.</brief_summary>
