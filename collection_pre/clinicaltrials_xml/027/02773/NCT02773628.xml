	<brief_summary>Eviction methods for dust mite allergy have been evaluated in asthma control in a recent Cochrane meta-analysis. None have shown efficacy on asthma control and there are not recommended. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy of a new commercialized system (Acar'Up) to decrease dust mite load and to assess its impact on the possibility to perform inhaled corticosteroids step down in stable asthmatics.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eviction methods for dust mite allergy have been evaluated in asthma control in a recent Cochrane meta-analysis. None have shown efficacy on asthma control and there are not recommended. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy of a new commercialized system, Acar'Up (a spray pulverized on a technical textile that traps the dust mite) to decrease dust mite load and to assess its impact on the possibility to perform inhaled corticosteroids step down in stable asthmatics.</detailed_description>
