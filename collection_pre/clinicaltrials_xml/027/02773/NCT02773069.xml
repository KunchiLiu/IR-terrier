	<brief_summary>The proposed Church Bridge intervention project will provide an innovative, evidence-based and technology supported, health intervention model for Southern, African American, and rural populations who continue to be disparately burdened by obesity and associated co-morbidities (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease). By targeting young adults (21-50 years of age) with families, the project will contribute to the long-term reduction of preventable chronic disease and related health care costs for the public.</brief_summary>
