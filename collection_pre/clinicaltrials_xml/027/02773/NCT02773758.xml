	<brief_summary>This will be a single centre, two week, randomised, examiner blind, two treatment arm, parallel design, stratified (by maximum baseline Schiff sensitivity score of the two selected test teeth), controlled study, in participant with at least two sensitive teeth that meet the study criteria at the Screening and Baseline visits. The study will be conducted in participants in good general health, with pre-existing self-reported and clinically diagnosed tooth sensitivity at screening.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Demonstrates understanding of the study procedures, restrictions and willingness to participate as evidenced by voluntary written informed consent and has received a signed and dated copy of the informed consent form. Aged 1865 years inclusive. Good general and mental health with: No clinically significant and relevant abnormalities of medical history or oral examination. Absence of any condition that would impact on the participant's safety or wellbeing or affect the individual's ability to understand and follow study procedures and requirements. Selfreported history of dentinal hypersensitivity (DH) lasting more than six months but not more than 10 years. Minimum of 20 natural teeth. Minimum of 2 accessible nonadjacent teeth (incisors, canines, premolars), preferably in different quadrants, that meet all of the following criteria at screening: Signs of facial/cervical gingival recession and/or signs of erosion or abrasion (EAR). Tooth with MGI score =0 adjacent to the test area (exposed dentine) only and a clinical mobility of ≤1. Tooth with signs of sensitivity measured by qualifying evaporative air assessment (yes[Y]/No[N] response). Minimum of two, nonadjacent accessible teeth (incisors, canines, premolars), that meet all of the following criteria at screening: Tooth with signs of sensitivity, measured by response to a qualifying tactile stimulus (Yeaple ≤ 20g) and evaporative air assessment (Schiff sensitivity score ≥ 2). Women who are breastfeeding, known to be pregnant or who are intending to become pregnant over the duration of the study. Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the study materials (or closely related compounds) or any of their stated ingredients. Previous participation in this study or participation in another clinical study (including cosmetic studies) or receipt of an investigational drug within 30 days of the screening visit. Recent history (within the last year) of alcohol or other substance abuse. Presence of chronic debilitating disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect study outcomes or causing xerostomia. Dental prophylaxis within 4 weeks of Screening. Tongue or lip piercing or presence of dental implants. Gross periodontal disease, treatment of periodontal disease (including surgery) within 12 months of Screening, scaling or root planning within 3 months of Screening. Teeth bleaching within 8 weeks of Screening. Tooth with evidence of current or recent caries, or reported treatment of decay within 12 months of Screening. Tooth with exposed dentine but with deep, defective or facial restorations, teeth used as abutments for fixed or removable partial dentures, teeth with full crowns or veneers, orthodontic bands or cracked enamel. Sensitive teeth with contributing aetiologies other than erosion, abrasion or recession of exposed dentine. Sensitive tooth not expected to respond to treatment with an overthecounter dentifrice. Use of an oral care product indicated for the relief of dentine hypersensitivity within 8 weeks of screening. Daily doses of medication/treatments which, in the opinion of the investigator, could interfere with the perception of pain. Examples of such medications include analgesics, anticonvulsants, antihistamines that cause marked or moderate sedation, sedatives, tranquilisers, antidepressants, moodaltering and antiinflammatory drugs. Currently taking antibiotics or has taken antibiotics within 2 weeks of Baseline. Daily dose of a medication which, in the opinion of the Investigator, is causing xerostomia.</criteria>
