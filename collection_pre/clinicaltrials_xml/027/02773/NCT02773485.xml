	<brief_title>Chemo Alone or in Combination With Radiation in Unresectable Cholangiocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently the standard of care of unresectable non-metastatic cholangiocarcinoma is chemotherapy which has a median survival of 11.7 months (ABC-02 study). While this study included almost 60% of patients with cholangiocarcinomas (intrahepatic, extra hepatic and hilar), almost 73-76% of patients in each arm had metastases to begin with. And while the overall survival of the entire cohort was significantly improved by gemcitabine plus cisplatin compared to cisplatin alone, the hazard ratios for intrahepatic {0.57 (0.34-0.94)}, extra hepatic {0.73 (0.43-1.23)} and hilar cholangiocarcinomas {0.59 (0.32-1.09)} were all insignificant. Even though concurrent chemoradiation+/= brachytherapy has been used for management of cholangiocarcinomas for more than 3 decades the lack of level I evidence prevents from it being recommended as the first line management across multidisciplinary clinics. While either modality alone rarely yields survival of more than 12 months, recent reports of improved median survival with combination of high dose radiation and systemic chemotherapy necessitates investigation into role of combination of high dose (chemo) radiation and systemic chemotherapy. All patients with diagnosis of nonmetastatic unresectable cholangiocarcinoma who fulfill the study eligibility criteria will be evaluated for study participation. Patients will undergo upfront randomization into one of the study arms (systemic chemotherapy alone vs Systemic chemotherapy+ High dose radiation) The study stratification criteria will be done according the primary site i.e. Intrahepatic vs Extrahepatic.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age &gt;18 years Performance Status 02 Tissue diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the biliary tract. Wherever tissue diagnosis is not feasible in spite of repeated attempts a multidisciplinary consensus on clinicoradiological diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma (CA 199= 100mg/ml with a radiological evidence of malignant stricture) should be made and patients consent should be available for treatment without tissue diagnosis. Unresectable disease as determined by hepatobiliary surgical team. No evidence of peritoneal or distant metastasis. No radiological evidence of paraaortic nodal disease. Child A or Child B (score 7) Ability to tolerate radical treatment. Multicentric intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (however adjacent satellite lesions are permitted) Inability to deliver safe radiation due to high tumor/ liver ratio. Active cholangitis. Expected Survival&lt;6 months. Unresolved biliary tract obstruction. Inability in deliver systemic chemotherapy (persistent bilirubin&gt;3)</criteria>
