	<brief_summary>National guidelines advocate the use of paracetamol in conjunction with strong opioids for cancer pain, despite a lack of evidence for its efficacy. Work is needed to examine the analgesic benefit of paracetamol in this large patient group. The investigators aim to establish if paracetamol in combination with strong opioids provides superior analgesia for cancer related pain over strong opioids alone.</brief_summary>
