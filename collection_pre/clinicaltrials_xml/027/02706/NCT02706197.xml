	<brief_summary>Tumors with low oxygen levels are associated with poor prognosis and resistance to standard radiotherapy or chemotherapy. The ability to make repeated oxygen measurements in tumors could be used to help select the most effective treatment or the best timing to start therapies. The purpose of this study is to ascertain the safety and feasibility of using an implantable oxygen sensor, known as the OxyChip, to make oxygen measurements in tumors using EPR oximetry, a technique related to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxygen Measurements in Subcutaneous Tumors by EPR Oximetry Using OxyChip</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I clinical trial. Total enrollment will be 12 patients. The study is split in a phase IA (short duration of implantation &lt; 4 weeks with no other cancer therapy planned prior to excision) and a phase IB (longer duration of implantation while receiving radiation therapy or neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgical excision), as described below. The initial 6 patients will have the OxyChip placed for a short duration (up to 4 weeks) after which the OxyChip will be removed when the tumor mass is resected, prior to delivery of any further therapies. After successful implantation and removal of the OxyChip in the first 6 protocol patients, enrollment will be opened to an additional 6 patients who will either receive radiotherapy or neoadjuvant chemotherapy while the OxyChip is in place. Up to five oxygen measurements per week will be made during the course of radiation or chemotherapy. The OxyChips will be removed at surgery. Patients receiving radiation or chemotherapy will be evaluated at least weekly for assessment with respect to any adverse events for the primary objective and oximetry measurements will be taken periodically at least one day after implantation and up to its removal at the planned tumor excision to assess the secondary objective. Following resection, the tissue surrounding the OxyChip will be examined for any adverse events for the primary objective. For the exploratory objectives, the tissue will also be examined for biomarkers associated with hypoxia or growth.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Phase IA: Any tumor identified on imaging or through physical examination and that is going to receive surgical resection with intent to remove the entire tumor. The tumor must be sufficiently large to accommodate the OxyChip. 2. Phase IB: Any biopsyproven malignancy expected to undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy prior to resection. The tumor must be sufficiently large to accommodate the OxyChip. 3. Malignancy must be present within 1.5 cm of the surface of the skin 4. Subject must be capable of giving informed consent or has an acceptable surrogate capable of giving consent on behalf of the subject. 5. Anticipated time between implantation and planned surgical excision of at least three days. 1. Pregnancy. 2. Receipt of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy, or planned sequential chemotherapy and radiotherapy, prior to resection (Phase 1B). 3. Receipt of Avastin, or other angiogenesis inhibitors during the study. 4. Prior radiotherapy to the site of implantation. 5. Having other implanted (not removable) devices that generate electrical artifacts or that could be altered by the EPR magnetic field, such as cardiac pacemakers or defibrillators.</criteria>
