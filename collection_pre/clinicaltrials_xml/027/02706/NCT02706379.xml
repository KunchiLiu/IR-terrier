	<brief_summary>Early goal directed therapy (EGDT) is an effective treatment for patients with septic shock, which is widely used in clinic. Fluid resuscitation can significantly reduce the mortality of patients with septic shock and improve the prognosis of patients with EGDT. However, in recent years, the standard of EGDT to determine the existence of the target of septic shock. Some studies have shown that there may be a manifestation of the deficiency of kidney and liver and other organs such as kidney, liver and other organs in the recovery of EGDT. Therefore, this experiment is to explore the brain perfusion and metabolism of the EGDT when the target is reached.The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of EGDT as a guide to the cerebral perfusion and metabolism in order to provide clinical evidence for the treatment of fluid resuscitation in patients with septic shock.</brief_summary>
