	<brief_summary>1. Purpose: 1) compare three conservative treatment approaches for subjects with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAI), and 2) analyze functional outcome comparatively across groups. 2. Interventions will be provided based on randomized assignment. Group 1 will receive treatment based on identified impairments and treated twice weekly to address said impairments with hip manual therapy and exercise, as well as a prescriptive exercise for strengthening and mobility of the hip. Group 2 will receive only the prescriptive exercise program. Group 3 will be a control group (supervised neglect) 3. Primary outcomes data analysis will involve a mixed design (repeated measures) ANOVA for assessment of the primary outcome measure of the HAGOS. Secondary analyses will include chi square analyses (PASS, surgery at 6 months, adverse events), ANCOVA (PPMs, and expectations measures), or other appropriate comparative measures. None of the proposed treatment is considered outside of 'standard of practice'.</brief_summary>
