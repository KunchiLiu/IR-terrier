	<brief_title>Trial of Pancreatic Enzyme Supplements (Pancrelipase) for Treating Pain in Patients With Chronic Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Type: Interventional, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, efficacy study Intervention arm: Pancreatic enzyme replacement (Pancrelipase) with meals and snacks daily, for 4 weeks. Placebo arm: Lactose placebo tablets with meals and snacks, for 4 weeks. Washout Phase: Weeks 4 to 6, there will be cessation of placebo or Pancrelipase use. Crossover Phase: Weeks 6 to 10, initial placebo arm receives Pancrelipase, Pancrelipase arm receives placebo Surveys - Izbicki score and PANQOLI assessment occur at Week 0, 4, 6, and 10. Narcotic and non-narcotic usage will also be noted at these intervals. Patient will also report the tobacco and alcohol use.</detailed_description>
