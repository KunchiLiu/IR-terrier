	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Escalating Single Doses of TAK-828 in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-828. TAK-828 is being tested to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) of single oral doses of TAK-828 in healthy non-Japanese and Japanese participants. The study will enroll approximately 36 healthy participants. An interleaving crossover design with placebo substitution will be used for Cohorts 1-3. Each cohort will consist of 12 participants, randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to a treatment sequence to receive TAK-828 or placebo after undergoing a fasting stage of at least 8 hours through intervention periods 1-4 for Cohorts 1 and 2 and through intervention periods 1 - 3 for Cohort 3. The assigned treatment sequence will remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need). An additional interventional period 5 (fed state) is planned to be conducted in either cohort 1 or 2, based on the dose of TAK-828 that will be chosen to be studied under fed conditions. Cohorts 1 and 2 were conducted in non-Japanese participants and Cohort 3 in Japanese participants. This multi-center trial will be conducted in The United States. Participants will remain confined to the study site from check-in (Day -1) through Day 4 of each intervention period and will return 7 to 10 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>

Cohorts 1 and 2: nonJapanese participants aged 18 to 55 years, inclusive, with body mass index (BMI) of 18 to 30 kilogram per square meter (kg/m^ 2), inclusive, and body weight greater than or equal (&gt;=) 50 kilogram (kg). 3. Cohort 3: Japanese participants (born to Japanese parents and grandparents) aged 20 to 55 years, inclusive, with BMI of 18.5 to 25 kg/m^ 2, inclusive, and body weight &gt;= 45 kg. 1. Has used prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary supplements within 7 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to Checkin (Day 1). Herbal supplements and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) must be discontinued 28 days prior to Checkin (Day 1). As an exception, acetaminophen may be used at doses of less than equal to (&lt;=) 1 gram per day (g/day). Limited use of nonprescription medications that are not believed to affect participant safety or the overall results of the study may be permitted on a casebycase basis following approval by the sponsor.</criteria>
