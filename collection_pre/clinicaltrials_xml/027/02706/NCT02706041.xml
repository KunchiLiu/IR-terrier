	<brief_summary>Randomized study to compare outcomes of patients undergoing damage control laparotomies versus definitive closure for which there is surgeon equipoise to randomize.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Damage Control Laparotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single center, prospective, randomized study involving seriously injure patients requiring an emergent laparotomy within 90 minutes of arrival to the emergency department. There are situations in which the patient is unable to be closed at the end of the emergent laparotomy (identified as damage control) and there are situations in which the injury has been treated and the incision can be closed (definitive). There are also situations where it is not clear if the patient should be kept open or closed and the result of the surgery varies based on the surgeon performing the case. The eligible subjects for this study will be randomized toward the end of the emergent laparotomy procedure on a 1:1 basis and will be followed throughout the hospitalization for complications. Patients will also be contacted at 6 month to complete a quality of life questionnaire.</detailed_description>
