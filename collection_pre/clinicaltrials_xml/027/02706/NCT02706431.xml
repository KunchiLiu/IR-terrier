	<brief_summary>Oxygenation with high-flow nasal cannula with 100% oxygen has only been evaluated in a limited number of studies. Although data are convincing it is of importance to evaluate this new concept in our department before implementing it into clinical practice. The general purpose of this project is to evaluate a new ventilation strategy during ENT-surgery based on oxygenation with high-flow nasal cannula with 100% oxygen with focus on gas exchange.</brief_summary>
