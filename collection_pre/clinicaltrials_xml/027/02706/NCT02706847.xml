	<criteria>Diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for &gt;= 3 months. Subjects have been treated for &gt;= 3 months with &gt;= 1 bDMARD therapy, but continue to exhibit active RA or had to discontinue due to intolerability or toxicity, irrespective of treatment duration prior to the first dose of study drug. Subjects have been receiving csDMARD therapy &gt;= 3 months and on a stable dose for &gt;= 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. The following csDMARDs are allowed: methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and leflunomide. A combination of up to two background csDMARDs is allowed except the combination of MTX and leflunomide. Meets the following criteria: &gt;= 6 swollen joints (based on 66 joint counts) and &gt;= 6 tender joints (based on 68 joint counts) at Screening and Baseline Visits. Prior exposure to any Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor (including but not limited to tofacitinib, baricitinib, and filgotinib). Current diagnosis of inflammatory joint disease other than RA. Current diagnosis of secondary Sjogren's Syndrome is permitted.</criteria>
