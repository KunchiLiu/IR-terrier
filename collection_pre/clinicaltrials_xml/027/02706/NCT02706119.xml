	<brief_title>Insulin in Total Parenteral Nutrition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A pattern of basal insulin (using subcutaneous insulin glargine and regulating the stock as prandial), plus regular subcutaneous insulin as rescue, applied to total parenteral nutrition (TPN) should be as effective (glycemic control, variability) and safe (hypoglycemia) as the usual (regular insulin inside the TPN reservoir and subcutaneous insulin as rescue) in patients with type 2 diabetes critics.</detailed_description>
