	<brief_title>Cefaliv® Compared to Neosaldina® in the Treatment of Migraine Attacks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cefaliv® is a combination of 3 drugs: dihydroergotamine mesylate, dipyrone sodium, and caffeine. The dihydroergotamine mesylate interacts with the serotonergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic receptors, but it's mechanism is not totally known. The dipyrone is a non-steroidal antiinflammatory which has an analgesic, antiinflammatory and antipyretic effect. And the caffeine presents mechanisms that are not totally clear, but it may relieves the pain by activating of the central noradenosine pathway (pain suppressing system).</detailed_description>
