	<brief_title>Pain Management Associated With the Insertion of JaydessÂ® in Nulliparous Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most intrauterine contraception (IUC) insertions do not require pain management. However, small proportions of nulliparous women experience substantial pain that needs to be proactively managed No prophylactic pharmacological intervention has been adequately evaluated to support routine use for pain reduction during or after IUC insertion. Women's anxiety about the procedure may contribute to higher levels of perceived pain, which highlights the importance of counselling, and creating a trustworthy, unhurried and professional atmosphere in which the experience of the provider also has a major role; a situation frequently referred to as 'verbal anaesthesia'. It has been proven in the past that the use of oral Tramadol can reduce the pain in the insertion. In the study investigators will compare the analgesic affects of oral Tramadol and verbal anesthesia on pain relief during Jaydess insertion in nulliparous women.</detailed_description>
