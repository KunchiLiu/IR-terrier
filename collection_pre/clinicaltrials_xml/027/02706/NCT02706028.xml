	<brief_summary>In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study the effects of underwater ultrasound (US) therapy were investigated in 48 patients with moderately active rheumatoid arthritis (disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28) ≥3.2 and ≤5.1). Patients randomly assigned to the ultrasound group (N=25) received underwater ultrasound therapy to both wrists and hands for 7 minutes per session with an intensity of 0.7 W/cm2 during 10 sessions. The control group (N=23) received sham treatment under the same conditions. At baseline, at the end of treatment (Week 2) and at the follow-up visit (Week 14), the following parameters were evaluated: disease activity - erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), tender and swollen joint counts, pain on a visual analogue scale, and DAS28, hand function (fist making, wrist extension and flexion, hand grip strength), quality of life - Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and the patients rated their own condition.</brief_summary>
