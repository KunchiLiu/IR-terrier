	<brief_title>Effect of Oral Carbohydrate on Serum S-100β Protein and Development of Postoperative Delirium in Elderly Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Perioperative insulin resistance may primarily contribute to development of postoperative delirium in high risk patients. Preoperative administration of oral carbohydrate reduces insulin resistance. The investigators aimed to investigate the influence of carbohydrate loading on the serum level of S-100β, a surrogate marker of delirium, and the incidence of postoperative delirium in elderly patients.</detailed_description>
