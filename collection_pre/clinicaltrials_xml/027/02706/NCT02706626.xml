	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of this investigational drug, brigatinib (AP261136) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have had first-line treatment for their cancer and it still got worse, even after, or while taking drugs called ALK inhibitors, or anti-cancer drugs that act on tumors. Some examples of these anti-cancer drugs are: KEYTRUDA® or ALECENSA®).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Brigatinib After Treatment With Second-Generation ALK Inhibitors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A significant population of Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) plus Non-small cell lung cancer patients exist that have progressed on or who were intolerant of second generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitor (e.g. ceritinib or alectinib). Brigatinib has demonstrated activity in patients who have progressed on crizotinib, but the activity of brigatinib in patients who have progressed on ceritinib, alectinib, or other second generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors is unknown. Based on the preclinical data. 3, brigatinib is the only known anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitor with potent activity against known secondary anaplastic lymphoma kinase mutations suggesting it may retain activity as third-line treatment of anaplastic lymphoma kinase plus disease. Patients enrolled in ARI-AT-002 must have previously received a second generation Anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitor other than brigatinib. Given that third-line treatment of anaplastic lymphoma kinase plus disease is analogous to a phase I population, we have chosen 20% as a clinically meaningful response rate that would justify further study of brigatinib in previously treated anaplastic lymphoma kinase plus disease.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer that has been cytologically or histologically confirmed Anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangement based on FDA approved test (e.g., Vysius break apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or Immunohistochemistry (IHC) using Ventana) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status greater than or equal to 2 Age 18 years or older Previous treatment with one second generation ALK inhibitor (e.g., ceritinib or alectinib) other than brigatinib Brain lesions may be used as target lesions if progressing, are greater than or equal to 10mm in longest diameter and if they were not previously treated with any of the following: whole brain radiation therapy within 3 months; Stereotactic radiosurgery; surgical resection Availability of core biopsy of progressive lesion taken within 60 days prior to D1 of treatment under study therapy or willing to undergo tumor biopsy: NOTE:. All subjects must consent to provide tumor blocks or slides. If archival tissue is not available and biopsies to obtain fresh tumor tissue cannot be performed with minimal risk to the subject, subjects may be permitted to enroll on the study with prior approval of the Study PI.
