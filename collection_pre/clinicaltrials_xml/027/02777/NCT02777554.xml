	<brief_summary>This study will be conducted in 2 Parts. The purpose of this study is to measure how much of apremilast is found in the blood when administered as a once daily tablet compared to a twice a day tablet, when given as multiple doses (Part 1) and when administered as a single dose under fasting and fed conditions (Part 2). Information on the safety and tolerability of apremilast will also be obtained. In addition, the effect of apremilast on certain biomarkers in the blood will be evaluated in 16 assigned subjects (Part 1 only). Biomarkers are substances such as proteins that tell us how the study drug is working in your body. Part 1: This is a multi-center, phase 1, open-label, randomized, two-period, two-sequence, crossover study in healthy subjects. The study will consist of a screening phase, a baseline phase, two treatment periods, and a follow-up phone call. Each Period will be ten days in duration (Day 1 through Day 10) for dosing and sample collection for up to 72 hours post Day 7 morning dose of Periods 1 and 2. There will be a washout between Period 1 and Period 2. Part 2: This is a single center, open-label, randomized, four-period, four-sequence crossover study to evaluate the PK and exposure of apremilast following single dose administration of different formulations of apremilast. Part 2 will consist of a Screening phase, Baseline, four Treatment periods, and a follow-up phone call. Each Period will be four days in duration (Day 1 through Day 4) for dosing and sample collection for up to 72 hours post Day 1 of Period 1, 2, 3, and 4.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open Label Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetic Exposure of Apremilast in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Objectives Part 1 Primary Objectives To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and exposure of apremilast following multiple-dose administration of a QD apremilast formulation relative to the BID reference IR tablet under the fed condition with a standard meal. Secondary Objectives To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a QD apremilast formulation and the BID reference IR tablet. Exploratory Objective To evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of apremilast following multiple-dose administration of the QD apremilast formulation relative to the BID reference IR tablet under the fed condition with a standard meal. Part 2 Primary Objectives To estimate the PK and exposure of apremilast following single dose administration of a QD apremilast formulation relative to the BID reference IR tablet under the fasting condition To estimate the effect of food on the PK of a single oral dose of a QD apremilast formulation. Secondary Objectives To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a QD apremilast formulation and the BID reference IR tablet.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study (Part 1 and Part 2): 1. Must understand and voluntarily sign a written Informed consent form (ICF) prior to any studyrelated procedures being performed. 2. Must be able to communicate with the investigator, understand and comply with the requirements of the study, and agree to adhere to restrictions and examination schedules. 3. Male and female subjects of any race between 18 to 55 years of age (inclusive), and in good health as determined by the Investigator at the time of signing the informed consent document. 4. Have a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 33 kg/m2 (inclusive). 5. No clinically significant laboratory test results as determined by the investigator. 6. At the screening visit, must be afebrile, with supine systolic BP: 90 to 140 mmHg, supine diastolic BP: 50 to 90 mmHg, and pulse rate: 40 to 110 bpm. Eligibility criteria for vital signs performed during checkin and/or predose on Day 1 will be at the discretion of the Investigator. 7. Must have a normal or clinically acceptable 12lead Electrocardiogram (ECG). Subjects must have a QT interval corrected using the Fridericia formula (QTcF) value â‰¤ 450 msec. 8. Female subjects 1. Must have a negative pregnancy test 2. If postmenopausal: must have follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) test result &gt; 40 IU/L and a negative pregnancy test 9. Contraception Requirements: Must comply with the following acceptable forms of contraception. All Female of child bearing potential (FCBP)1 must use one of the approved contraceptive options as described below while taking apremilast and for at least 28 days after administration of the last dose of the apremilast. At the time of study entry, and at any time during the study when a FCBP's contraceptive measures or ability to become pregnant changes, the Investigator will educate the subject regarding contraception options and the correct and consistent use of effective contraceptive methods in order to successfully prevent pregnancy. All FCBP must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and Day 1 of each Treatment Period. All FCBP subjects who engage in activity in which conception is possible must use one of the approved contraceptive options described below: Option 1: Any one of the following highly effective methods: hormonal contraception (oral, injection, implant, transdermal patch, vaginal ring); intrauterine device (IUD); tubal ligation; or partner's vasectomy; OR Option 2: Male or female condom (latex condom or nonlatex condom NOT made out of natural [animal] membrane [for example, polyurethane]); Plus one additional barrier(c) contraceptive sponge with spermicide. Male subjects (including those who have had a vasectomy) who engage in activity in which conception is possible must use barrier contraception (latex or nonlatex condoms NOT made out of natural [animal] membrane [for example, polyurethane]) while on Investigational Product (IP) and for at least 28 days after the last dose of IP. 10. Must agree to refrain from donating sperm, blood or plasma (other than for this study) while participating in this study and for at least 28 days after the last dose of investigational product. 11. Subject is willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements. The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment: 1. History of any clinically significant and relevant neurological, psychiatric, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, psychological, pulmonary, metabolic, endocrine, hematological, allergic disease, drug allergies, or other major disorders. 2. Any condition which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he were to participate in the study, or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study. 1 A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature female who 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy (the surgical removal of the uterus) or bilateral oophorectomy (the surgical removal of both ovaries) or 2) has not been postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (that is, has had menses at any time during the preceding 24 consecutive months). 3. Use of any prescribed systemic or topical medication within 30 days of the first dose administration (exception, FCBP may use hormonal contraception). 4. Use of any nonprescribed systemic or topical medication (including vitamin/mineral supplements, and herbal medicines) within 14 days of the first dose administration. 5.

Exposure to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30 days prior to the first dose administration or 5 halflives of that investigational drug, if known (whichever is longer). 7. Donated blood or plasma within 8 weeks before the first dose administration to a blood bank or blood donation center. 8. History of drug abuse (as defined by the current version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual [DSM]) within 2 years before dosing, or a positive drug screen reflecting consumption of illicit drugs. 9.
