	<criteria>1. Presence of thoracic aortic pathology deemed to warrant surgical repair which requires proximal graft placement in Zone 02. 2. Age ≥18 years at time of informed consent signature 3. Subject is capable of complying with protocol requirements, including followup 4. Informed Consent Form (ICF) is signed by Subject or legal representative 5. Must have appropriate proximal aortic landing zone. 6. Must have appropriate target branch vessel landing zone 7. For patients with aneurysm/isolated lesion, must have appropriate distal aortic landing zone. 1. Concomitant disease of the ascending aorta or aneurysm of the abdominal aorta requiring repair 2. Previous endovascular repair of the ascending aorta 3. Previous endovascular repair of the DTA with a nonGore device 4. Surgery within 30 days prior to enrollment, with the exception of surgery for Ascending Aortic Dissection and/or placement of vascular conduit for access 5. Infected aorta 6. Life expectancy &lt;2 years 7. Myocardial infarction within 6 weeks prior to treatment 8. Stroke within 6 weeks prior to treatment, stroke defined as rapidly developing clinical signs of focal (or global) disturbance of cerebral function, lasting more than 24 hours or leading to death, with no apparent cause other than that of vascular origin. 9. Patient has a systemic infection and may be at increased risk of endovascular graft infection 10. Pregnant female at time of informed consent signature 11. Degenerative connective tissue disease, e.g. Marfan's or EhlerDanlos Syndrome 12. Participation in another drug or medical device study within one year of study enrollment 13. Known history of drug abuse within one year of treatment 14. Presence of protruding and/or irregular thrombus and/or atheroma in the aortic arch or ascending aorta 15. Tortuous or stenotic iliac and/or femoral arteries preventing introducer sheath insertion and the inability to use a conduit for vascular access 16. Planned coverage of celiac artery 17. Patient has known sensitivities or allergies to the device materials 18. Patient has known hypersensitivity or contraindication to anticoagulants or contrast media, which is not amenable to pretreatment 19. Previous instance of Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia type 2 (HIT2) or known hypersensitivity to heparin 20. Patient with a history of a hypercoagulability disorder and/or hypercoagulability state 21. Diameter taper outside of the device sizing range between proximal and distal landing zones of aorta and the inability to use additional devices of different diameters to compensate for the taper 22. Mycotic aneurysm 23. Persistent refractory shock (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mm Hg) 24. Patient has body habitus or other medical condition which prevents adequate visualization of the aorta 25. Renal failure defined as patients with an estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) &lt;30 or currently requiring dialysis</criteria>
