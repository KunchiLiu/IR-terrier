	<brief_summary>First, the aim of the study was to evaluate the usefulness of echocardiographic parameters for detecting pulmonary hypertension (PH) in patients with advanced lung disease referred for lung transplantation. Second, to assess the prevalence of PH and to identify which hemodynamic, echocardiographic, pulmonary functional test, exercise capacity and biochemical parameters (especially NT-proBNP) have an impact on survival in a cohort of patients with severe lung diseases referred for lung transplantation.</brief_summary>
