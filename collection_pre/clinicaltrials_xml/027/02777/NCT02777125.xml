	<brief_summary>This study is determines if metered dose inhalers are as effective as breath actuated nebulizers for the treatment of mild to moderate asthma exacerbations in pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department. Half of the participating patients received albuterol via the metered dose inhaler whereas the other half received albuterol via the breath actuated nebulizer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial Comparing Metered Dose Inhalers and Breath Actuated Nebulizers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Albuterol administered via metered dose inhalers with spacers are more effective than small volume nebulizers in the treatment of acute pediatric asthma exacerbations. There is also supporting data that the breath actuated nebulizers are also more effective than small volume nebulizers. The effectiveness of breath actuated nebulization compared to MDI for treating asthma exacerbations is less well defined. This is the first prospective study demonstrating that metered dose inhalers are non-inferior to breath actuated nebulizers for the treatment of mild to moderate asthma exacerbations in pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department. Metered dose inhalers with spacers are more readily available to the general population, are easily transportable and do not require a power source. Demonstrating equal effectiveness of albuterol delivery systems for treatment of acute pediatric asthma exacerbations would enable physicians to confidently utilize clinical encounters as opportunities to educate families on management of asthma exacerbations using their home appliance.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients presenting either with a first time wheeze or with an asthma exacerbation of a mild to moderate severity, both defined by a pediatric asthma score (PAS)11 of 5 to 11. Subjects were excluded if they had initiated therapy at an outlying medical facility or had a history of any chronic lung disease Congenital heart disease, tracheostomy, or were receiving diuretic therapy. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis or signs and symptoms compatible with pneumonia were excluded along with children who were wards of the state or whose parents did not speak English.</criteria>
