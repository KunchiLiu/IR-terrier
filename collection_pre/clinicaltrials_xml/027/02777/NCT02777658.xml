	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study are to assess molecular testing, treatment patterns, and associated outcomes among patients with EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) mutation-positive locally advanced or advanced NSCLC (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer) who have progressed on or after EGFR-TKI (EGFR-Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor) therapy post availability of a third-generation TKI (primary study cohort). Additionally, molecular testing and treatment patterns will be assessed among a secondary cohort of patients which will include patients diagnosed with de-novo EGFR T790M mutation-positive locally advanced or advanced NSCLC.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Primary Study Cohort Provision of written informed consent (patient consent should be within 6 weeks of disease progression, defined elsewhere as the Index Date) Adult male or female subjects (according to age of majority/adulthood as defined by local regulations) Patients with prior confirmed EGFR mutationpositive (all mutations) locally advanced or advanced NSCLC Patients who developed resistance to an EGFRTKI due to any other phenotypic/histologic transformations (e.g., smallcell lung cancer, EMT) or other mutations (e.g., HER2, MET amplifications) at the indexdate will be eligible for participation in this study as long as they have prior confirmed diagnosis of EGFR mutationpositive (all mutations) locally advanced or advanced NSCLC Patients who have progressed on or after EGFRTKI therapy (i.e., gefitinib, erlotinib or afatinib) within the patient selection period Inclusion Criteria Secondary Study Cohort Provision of written informed consent (patient consent should be within 6 weeks of NSCLC diagnosis, defined elsewhere as the Index Date) Adult male or female subjects (according to age of majority/adulthood as defined by local regulations) Patients diagnosed with denovo EGFR T790M mutationpositive locally advanced or advanced NSCLC during the patient selection period. The denovo T790M mutation can be alone or in combination with other mutations (e.g., L858R and T790M). Exclusion Criteria Primary and Secondary Study Cohorts â€¢ Enrollment in studies that prohibit any participation in this noninterventional study. These patients will be censored.</criteria>
