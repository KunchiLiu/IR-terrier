	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine pharmacodynamic interactions of propofol and dexmedetomidine,exploring the effect of dexmedetomidine on propofol unconsciousness median effective concentration (EC50).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacodynamic Interactions of Propofol and Dexmedetomidine on Intravenous Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>64 cases were randomly divided into four groups, In each group, dexmedetomidine target plasma concentration are 0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 ng/ml. Dexmedetomidine administered 15 min before target controlled infusion of propofol. The propofol infusion was started to provide a target effect-site concentration of 1.0ug/ml, and increased by 0.2ug/ml until loss of consciousness when the effect-site concentration and target concentration equilibrium.</detailed_description>
