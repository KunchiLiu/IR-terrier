	<brief_summary>This is a cross sectional case controlled study to assess lung microbiome and inflammation in smokers with and without Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Investigators will look at active bacterial metabolic pathways in the lower airways using metagenomic and metabolomic approaches an assess relationships among microbiome, metagenome, metabolome and host immune responses in COPD and controls. Investigators believe COPD cases will have higher prevalence of pneumotype supraglottic predominant taxa (SPT) than matched controls.</brief_summary>
