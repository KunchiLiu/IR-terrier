Presence of prostate nodule or induration upon digital rectal exam; 15. Obstructive uropathy of prostatic origin and of a severity that, in the opinion of the Investigator, contraindicates the use of testosterone; 16. Patients with poorly controlled diabetes.

This includes cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, hematological, endocrine, gastrointestinal, or pulmonary disease; 23. Positive serology for human immunodeficiency virus antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen, or hepatitis C virus antibody at the Initial Screening Visit; 24. Current evidence of alcohol or drug abuse. A positive drug screen is exclusionary without documentation of a current prescription and medical condition requiring treatment with the drug for which the screen is positive. Exception: tetrahydrocannabinol is allowed in states where recreational use of marijuana is legal; 25.
