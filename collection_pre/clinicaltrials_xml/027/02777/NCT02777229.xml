	<brief_summary>Several reports indicate that treatment failure due to HIV resistance or to adverse event-related discontinuation could compromise the effectiveness of scaling-up antiretroviral treatment (ART), especially when lack of access to viral load is a concern. Combined with other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, Dolutegravir (DTG) is a very promising alternative to the current first-line non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based regimens. Initial evaluations of DTG conducted in high income countries showed excellent efficacy and safety and indicated high genetic barrier thus preserving second line treatment. As a consequence, DTG-based regimens have been recently included in the first-line options in the national guidelines for ART of several high-income countries. However, the clinical trials evaluating DTG-based regimens have been conducted in highly controlled conditions, including baseline resistance testing and regular viral load monitoring. Moreover, these trials included a high proportion of men with rare co-morbidities. There is need to evaluate how a DTG-based regimen will perform in real-world conditions within resources-constrained settings, where viral load monitoring is limited, and where the majority of HIV patients are women with important family planning consideration and NAMSAL trial is a randomized clinical trial which aims to evaluate efficacy and safety over 48 weeks of DTG + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine versus Efavirenz (EFV) + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine in 606 ART-naïve HIV-1-infected adults in Cameroon. A set of efficacy and safety endpoints will be compared over 48 weeks between the two arms including the proportion of patients with viral load &lt;50 copies/mL and incidence of severe adverse events.</brief_summary>
