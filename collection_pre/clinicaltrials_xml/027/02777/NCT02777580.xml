	<brief_summary>In elderly patients ≥ 70yrs with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction randomised within 3 hours of onset of symptoms the efficacy and safety of a strategy of early fibrinolytic treatment with half-dose tenecteplase and additional antiplatelet therapy with a loading dose of 300 mg clopidogrel, aspirin and coupled with antithrombin therapy followed by catheterisation within 6-24 hours or rescue coronary intervention as required, will be compared to a strategy of primary PCI with a P2Y12 antagonist and antithrombin treatment according to local standards.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Age equal or greater than 70 years 2. Onset of symptoms &lt; 3 hours prior to randomisation 3. 12lead ECG indicative of an acute STEMI (STelevation will be measured from the J point; scale: 1 mm per 0.1 mV): ≥ 2 mm STelevation across 2 contiguous precordial leads (V1V6) or leads I and aVL for a minimum combined total of ≥ 4 mm STelevation or ≥ 2 mm STelevation in 2 contiguous inferior leads (II, III, aVF) for a minimum combined total of ≥ 4 mm STelevation 4. Informed consent received 1. 1. Expected performance of PCI &lt; 60 minutes from diagnosis (qualifying ECG) or inability to arrive at the catheterisation laboratory within 3 hours 2. Previous CABG 3. Left bundle branch block or ventricular pacing 4. Patients with cardiogenic shock Killip Class 4 5. Patients with a body weight &lt; 55 kg (known or estimated) 6. Uncontrolled hypertension, defined as sustained blood pressure ≥ 180/110 mm Hg (systolic BP ≥ 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 110 mm Hg) prior to randomisation 7. Known prior stroke or TIA 8. Recent administration of any i.v. or s.c. anticoagulation within 12 hours, including unfractionated heparin, enoxaparin, and/or bivalirudin or current use of oral anticoagulation (i.e. warfarin or a NOACs) 9. Active bleeding or known bleeding disorder/diathesis 10. Known history of central nervous system damage (i.e. neoplasm, aneurysm, intracranial or spinal surgery) or recent trauma to the head or cranium (i.e. &lt; 3 months) 11. Major surgery, biopsy of a parenchymal organ, or significant trauma within the past 2 months (this includes any trauma associated with the current myocardial infarction) 12. Clinical diagnosis associated with increased risk of bleeding including known active peptic ulceration and/or neoplasm with increased bleeding risk 13. Prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation (&gt; 2 minutes) within the past 2 weeks 14. Known acute pericarditis and/or subacute bacterial endocarditis 15. Known acute pancreatitis or known severe hepatic dysfunction, including hepatic failure, cirrhosis, portal hypertension (oesophageal varices) and active hepatitis 16. Dementia 17. Known severe renal insufficiency 18. Previous enrolment in this study or treatment with an investigational drug or device under another study protocol in the past 7 days 19. Known allergic reactions to tenecteplase, clopidogrel, enoxaparin and aspirin 20. Inability to follow the protocol and comply with followup requirements or any other reason that the investigator feels would place the patient at increased risk if the investigational therapy is initiated.</criteria>
