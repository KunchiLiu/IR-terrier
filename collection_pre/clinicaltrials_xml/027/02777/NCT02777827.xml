	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the pharmacodynamics of single doses of abediterol given by 2 different devices in participants with asthma. Abediterol (AZD0548) is a potential for once daily treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in fixed dose combination (FDC) with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) or a novel anti-inflammatory agent. The aim of the clinical studies is to enable further investigations in participants with asthma and COPD to evaluate and develop abediterol as an effective long acting bronchodilator with an acceptable safety profile compared to other inhaled bronchodilators on the market, for the treatment of asthma and COPD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Single Dose PD &amp; PK Study With Two Formulations of Abediterol in Patients With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomised, double-blinded, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, six-way William's design, crossover study to assess the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and safety of abediterol single dose, given by dry powder inhaler or pressurised metered-dose inhaler, in patients with asthma, on inhaled corticosteroids. During the screening period, all patients will take their own baseline inhaled corticosteroid for 2 weeks. Patients on long-acting β2-agonist/ inhaled corticosteroids will be switched over to the respective inhaled corticosteroid monocomponent. Patients will be provided salbutamol as rescue medication for use throughout the study. Abediterol is an investigational product in early stages of clinical development, therefore individual participants in the clinical studies may not have a clinical benefit, especially in view of alternative therapies (bronchodilators) being available for the treatment of asthma and COPD.</detailed_description>

Treatment with any investigational drug within 30 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to Visit 1. 10. Plasma donation within 1 month of screening or any blood donation/loss more than 500 mL during the 3 months prior to Visit 1. 11. Any laboratory abnormality or suspicion of any clinically relevant disease or disorder (on history or examination), including uncontrolled hypertension or uncontrolled diabetes, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may either put the patient at risk because of participation in the study, or influence the results or the patient's ability to participate in the study, or any other safety concerns in the opinion of the Investigator. 12. Known chronic hepatitis or HIV infections at the time of enrolment. 13. Any active malignancy or treatment thereof within the 3 years prior to enrolment. 14.
