	<brief_title>Laparoscopy Combined With Enhanced Recovery Pathway</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty patients with CD of ileocolon will be randomly assigned to two groups.One group is ERP group which include no bowel preparation nor fasting, no abdominal drains, early removal of urinary catheter, early solid dietary intake and mobilization and restrictive fluid management.In the end,we can compare the time to first flatus、time to first flatus 、postoperative length of stay postoperative hospital expense、complication grade readmission within 30 days of discharge between the two groups.</detailed_description>
