	<brief_title>Motivate: A Web-based Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MotivATE is a web-based intervention intended to be delivered at the point of referral to an Eating Disorder (ED) service. The intervention focuses on managing expectations of assessment, addressing ambivalence and increasing users' motivation and confidence to attend their initial appointment. This is achieved through the use of information, motivational tools, interactive activities and stories from other individuals with EDs spread across four 15-20 minute modules. These modules have been evaluated by service-users who have an ED. The aim of this study is to test whether MotivATE can increase attendance at assessment. This will be done using a single-consent Zelen randomised control trial, with all non-emergency adult clients referred to the Kimmeridge Courte Eating Disorder Service over a one year period being randomised to either treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU plus access to the MotivATE intervention prior to their assessment appointment. Routine audit data will be collected to compare the number of people who attend their assessment appointment in the MotivATE group verses the control group. Usage data generated by the intervention will also be assessed. Twenty participants from the MotivATE group will be invited to give qualitative feedback about their experience of the intervention.</detailed_description>
