	<brief_summary>Treatment for pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) involves intensive chemotherapy regimens that result in periods of profound neutropenia leaving patients susceptible to severe infectious complications. Infectious complications are the leading cause of treatment related mortality among AML patients, but there are little clinical data to inform whether management of neutropenia post AML chemotherapy should occur in an outpatient or inpatient setting. Further, no studies have been conducted that assess the impact of neutropenia management strategy on the quality of life of pediatric patients with AML and their caregivers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Home Away From Home - Quality of Life Surveys</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective observational cohort study, where the primary objective of this study is to compare patient and caregiver quality of life and other patient-centered outcomes for inpatient versus outpatient management of neutropenia in children with AML. Local study investigators (pediatric oncologists and study coordinators) at each of the thirteen participating pediatric institutions will communicate on a weekly basis with their inpatient leukemia service to identify AML patients potentially eligible for study enrollment. Once identified, study personnel will review each patient for study eligibility criteria. Three visits with the patient and their caregivers will occur: a screening visit, initial survey visit, and a follow-up visit. Screening Visit: Patients interested in the study will be approached for consent during initiation of a course of chemotherapy. After informed consent/assent is obtained and after completion of that chemotherapy course, the eligibility criteria for participation will be confirmed prior to study inclusion. Visit 1 will occur prior to the last day of chemotherapy administration in the course. This visit will include: - Brief survey to capture covariates unavailable in the medical record - A baseline health-related quality of life (HRQOL) survey Surveys will be administered via tablet computer and will last a total of 15-30 minutes per respondent. In the case that the child is 5 years of age or older, the child self-report and parent proxy-report scales will be separately administered to the child and caregiver, respectively. If the child is under 5 years of age, only the parent-proxy version will be administered. Visit 2 will occur prior to the start of the subsequent course of chemotherapy. This visit will include: - A follow-up HRQOL survey - Patient-centered outcome survey developed previously from qualitative interviews of AML patients and their caregivers Surveys will be administered via tablet computer and will last a total of 15-30 minutes per respondent. In the case that the child is 5 years of age or older, the child self-report and parent proxy-report scales will be administered to the child and caregiver, respectively. If the child is under 5 years of age, only the parent-proxy version will be administered. We will provide a $50 gift card to each child-parent dyad upon completion of the follow-up quality of life surveys.</detailed_description>
