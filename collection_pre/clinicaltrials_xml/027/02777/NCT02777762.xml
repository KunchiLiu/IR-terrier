	<brief_summary>Getting regular physical activity has many health benefits. Current physical activity programs often encourage people to track their physical activity as a way to motivate them to continue being physically active over time. However, not everyone enjoys physical activity, so tracking physical activity may not be very motivating. This research study will evaluate whether a new program—specifically designed to enhance people's enjoyment of physical activity—improves people's attitudes toward physical activity compared to a program that encourages people to track their physical activity with a mobile app.</brief_summary>
