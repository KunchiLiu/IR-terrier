	<brief_summary>Oral anticoagulants (warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban) are the very top cause of serious drug-related harm. More than 7 million prescriptions are dispensed annually for oral anticoagulants (OAC) in Canada, with more than 340,000 recipients in Ontario Drug Benefit Program alone. Because of their very high and chronic utilization, their large benefit in lowering important clinical events (stroke, embolism, death) and their high potential for major harm (primarily bleeds, which can be fatal), OACs are the highest priority for improving medication safe and effective use. The early period after hospital discharge is clearly high risk, with three times the usual rate of major bleeds compared with later. Since healthcare has been declared unsustainable in its current delivery form, it is time that Hamilton hospitals took the lead in finding more cost-effective ways to improve anticoagulation safety. The investigators will do this by structuring discharge medication assessment, with formal handover to telehealth coordination and communication with patients and their providers, to extend access and reduce the cost of expert anticoagulation guidance. This innovative study will rigorously and efficiently address whether a focused care coordination intervention targeting the highest priority medication safety topic (anticoagulants), delivered by telehealth experts already providing other services for Ministries of Health, can improve outcomes and reduce costs of care. The rigorous research design tests whether high quality, easily scalable, teletriage coordination can be effective in preventing anticoagulation-related adverse events during the most risky time period of therapy - transition from hospital to home.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Work: Before the RCT commences, investigators are working on three areas: Current rates of thromboembolic and bleeding events in the early post-discharge period in Ontario; Review of current practices, barriers and facilitators to optimal anticoagulation care and management; Finalization of OAC-focused medication reconciliation, workflow management diagrams and scripts, outcome assessment tools. Design: Randomized controlled pilot trial, two parallel groups, blinded outcome assessment. Participants: Patients discharged from any of the three Hamilton acute care hospitals with a discharge prescription for an oral anticoagulant intended to be taken for at least 4 weeks. Patients will be excluded if they are less than 16 years of age, expected lifespan is less than 6 months, if they are to be followed post-discharge by the Thromboembolism service, if they are unable to provide consent, or refuse consent. Patients will be stratified according to new users and persistent users of anticoagulants. Intervention: Formal discharge medication reconciliation organized similar to current discharge bundle processes, adapting the LHIN CCAC discharge medication reconciliation templates; hand-overs to care team including telehealth coordinator; telehealth coordination of patient, family caregiver, family physician, specialist(s), community pharmacist, home care, using an Oral Anticoagulant Monitoring Checklist. Expert clinician back-up by telemedicine is complemented by a) best evidence (internationally renowned ACCP Antithrombotic Guidelines led by experts including the applicants, Thrombosis Canada guidelines which update the ACCP AT9, and decision aids for patients and their family to assist in anticoagulant knowledge, decisional conflict, adherence, and b) best practices regarding discharge medication reconciliation, coordination of care with clear accountability, and teletriage where situations require medical intervention, c) most scalable and sustainable coordinator type (a teletriage clinician who is already working in the Ontario Ministry of Health's Telehealth Ontario, a system in place for more than a decade offering confidential advice on chronic illnesses and symptoms with specific algorithms for triage to acute medical care).</detailed_description>
