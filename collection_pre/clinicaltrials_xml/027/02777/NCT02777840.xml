	<brief_title>High Flow Oxygen With THRIVE Gives Better Oxygenation in Rapid Sequence Induction Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators intend to do the study using high flow oxygen for all emergency cases needing rapid sequence induction. As part of the study the Investigators will measure the oxygen levels in the blood gas sample of the patient and the heart rate of anesthetist in charge of the airway management. After the airway is secured the time for desaturation will be noted.</detailed_description>
