	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To compare LixiLan to lixisenatide in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) change from baseline to Week 26 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Secondary Objective: To compare the overall efficacy and safety of LixiLan to lixisenatide (with or without OADs) over a 52 week treatment period in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</brief_summary>
