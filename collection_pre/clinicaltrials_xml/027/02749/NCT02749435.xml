	<brief_summary>A real-world, point-of-care, randomized, parallel group, open, 6-month clinical study to evaluate if the provision of a digital disease management tool improves glycaemic control in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as measured by change from baseline to End of Study (Month 6) in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. Clinical assessments for this study will be conducted as part of normal, standard care. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of adding this tool to participants' current standard care for T2DM on glycaemic control, other variables of importance in T2DM (eg, weight, blood pressure, and lipid levels), and participant-reported outcomes (PROs), such as satisfaction with treatment and adherence to their antihyperglycaemic treatment</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Effect of a Digital Disease Management Tool in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the provision of a digital disease management tool in addition to standard care for T2DM, will improve glycaemic control. This is an open design study, in which the patients will be aware of the guidance they are receiving via the provided support tool. Study duration of 6 months has been chosen, as a reasonable amount of time to evaluate the tool. Glycaemic control is considered to be the goal of a T2DM disease management plan. In T2DM, long-term goals may not be achieved because participants fail to adhere to their management plan after an initial period of compliance. The study will compare the group receiving the digital disease management tool added to standard care for T2DM to a concurrent control group receiving standard care. Standard of Care cohort: Participants will have standard care with no access to the digital disease management tool. Clinical assessments for this study will be conducted as part of normal, standard care. Participants in the Standard of Care + digital disease management cohort will be taken through their standard T2DM management plan by their HCP (Health Care Provider) and trained in the use of the digital disease management tool. All participants will complete the PRO assessments. This study also aims at helping the health care practitioners and managed care providers to make evidence-based decisions about how to improve patient self-management of their diabetes. Participants diagnosed with T2DM and on one or more non-insulin antihyperglycaemic medications will be offered participation in the study at their point of care. Participants in the Standard of Care cohort will be taken through their T2DM management plan with their HCP per standard care. It is not anticipated that the use of this patient tool will be associated with any increase in risk to participating patients. The study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that are consistent with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH)/Good Clinical Practice (GCP), applicable regulatory requirements, and the AZ policy of bioethics.</detailed_description>
