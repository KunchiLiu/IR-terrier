	<brief_summary>The effect of perineural dexamethasone administered as an adjuvant in prolonging the duration of analgesia continues to be under debate. The investigators performed a prospective randomized study to evaluate the effect of perineural dexamethasone in different concentrations in postoperative analgesia in femoral nerve block for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perineural Dexamethasone in Femural Nerve Block After Ligament Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After Ethics committee approval, 75 patients American Society of Anesthesiologists score (ASA) I-III were randomized at the end of surgery into 3 groups of 25 patients each who underwent femoral nerve block: group A with 20 ml ropivacaine 0,5% and 20 ml lidocaine 1%; group B with 20 ml ropivacaine 0,5%, 20 ml lidocaine 1% and 4 mg dexamethasone; group C with 20 ml ropivacaine 0,5%, 20 ml lidocaine 1% and 8 mg dexamethasone. All groups received postoperative analgesia when visual analog scale (VAS) over 3 (by request), with IV Perfalgan 1 g and morphine (loading dose 0.1 mg/kg and titration until VAS under 3, followed by subcutaneous (SC) administration of 1/2 of total loading dose on demand for the following 24 hours (h) . Efficacy was evaluated by the time interval from performing the block until the first analgesic dose required, the total amount of morphine in the first 24 h postoperative, the patient satisfaction and the neurological side effects.</detailed_description>
