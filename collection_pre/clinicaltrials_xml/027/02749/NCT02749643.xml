	<brief_title>Functional Outcome Measures With Vibrotactile Feedback to Prostheses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators will perform three experiments: 1. Investigators will add vibrotactile feedback to prosthetic users during the execution of a standardized functional test and performance of simple grasping tasks, with a disruption to the normal visual feedback, and examine whether their performance and arm kinematics are improved with tactile feedback; 2. Investigators will examine the effects of adding the feedback to a prosthesis on the performance and visual attention during a dual task assignment in prosthetic users, and 3. Investigators will provide prosthetic users with the feedback, to use it at their natural surroundings for a week, and study the reported activity and satisfaction levels.</detailed_description>
