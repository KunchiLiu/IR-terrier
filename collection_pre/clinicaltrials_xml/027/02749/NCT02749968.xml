	<brief_summary>This is a study of liposomal bupivacaine for pain control in patients with blunt chest wall trauma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intercostal Liposomal Bupivacaine for the Management of Blunt Chest Wall Trauma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of liposomal bupivacaine to provide analgesia via paravertebral intercostal nerve block following significant blunt chest trauma, minimizing adverse outcomes, length of stay and overall narcotic use. The primary outcome of the study is to compare requirements between the bupivacaine group and a standard-of-care group.</detailed_description>
