	<brief_summary>Obesity is a prevalent, destructive, and costly chronic disease. In 2008, 37% of Canadian adults were measured as overweight, and 25% as obese. Obesity is a risk factor for a number of serious health problems, including type 2 diabetes, asthma, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis, chronic back pain, several types of cancers (i.e., colorectal, kidney, breast, endometrial, ovarian and pancreatic cancers) and cardiovascular disease (i.e., hypertension, stroke, congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease). In 2008, it was estimated that the annual economic burden of obesity in Canada was $4.6 billion. Given the economic strain and widespread health risks of obesity, there is a clear need to provide effective interventions for obesity. The purpose of the proposed study is to examine the role of ACT-based interventions in long-term weight maintenance. The proposed study will examine the role of value consistent behaviour, acceptance skills, and mindfulness skills in promoting long-term weight-related health behaviours. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is an empirically supported psychological intervention that emphasizes value consistent behaviours, acceptance skills and mindfulness skills.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For the proposed study, participants will receive specific sessions from the psychologist on value consistent behaviour, acceptance skills, and mindfulness skills. Their self-reported perceived consistency with their values and health behaviours will be recorded along with their weight at each session for the duration of the year-long program. The investigators will also assess their acceptance and mindfulness skills at 6 months and 1 year. The investigators will continue to monitor their value-consistent behaviour, acceptance skills, mindfulness skills, weight-related health behaviours, weight and medication use at 6 months, 1 year and 5 years post the completion of the Partners for Healthier Weight program. Partners for Healthier Weight is a hospital affiliated program that offers an empirically based, multidisciplinary, year-long weight management program. Participants attend weekly sessions for the first 6 months of the program. Sessions are facilitated by a dietician, psychologist and physiotherapist. For the second 6 months of the program, participants attend bi-weekly sessions. Participants are monitored by a nurse for the duration of the program. Results will be compared to past participants who received standard treatment of care who are registered in the investigators patient database. Participants who consented to be in the patient database will be contacted and asked to complete the follow up measures.</detailed_description>
