	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that early independent adaptive bimanual-to-unimanual training of arm and hand movements, assisted with specially designed mechanical devices: the mirrored motion bimanual arm trainer (m2 BAT), will improve motor control and function in patients with post-stroke hemiparesis.</brief_summary>

History of surgery or other significant injury to either upper extremity causing mechanical limitations that preclude task performance. Previous neurological illness such as head trauma, prior stroke, epilepsy, or demyelinating disease. Complicating medical problems such as uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes with signs of polyneuropathy, severe renal, cardiac or pulmonary disease, or evidence of other concurrent neurologic or orthopedic conditions precluding the subject from complying with the study protocol.
