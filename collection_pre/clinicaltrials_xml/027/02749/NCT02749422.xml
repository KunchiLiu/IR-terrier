	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, single-blinded, controlled phase 1 study to demonstrate feasibility and explore the neurophysiologic and clinical effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) interventions in epilepsy patients and healthy controls. The inclusion of a control group will be used to see whether epilepsy patients, who suffer from a higher degree of comorbid memory difficulty presumably from entorhinal-hippocampal dysfunction, can benefit from a TMS intervention can benefit as much as a healthy matched population. Investigators will also be looking at functional connectivity between the hippocampus and cortical regions</brief_summary>
