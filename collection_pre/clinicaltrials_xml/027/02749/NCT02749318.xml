	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study to determine whether knowledge gained by an individual of genetic risk for severe periodontitis changes the patient's health behavior as measured by an increased frequency of their preventive dental office visits. In addition to the primary objectives of the study, the overall design and logistics will be used to inform a possible future study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Data to be analyzed in this study will be gathered through a patient questionnaire, genetic testing and tracking of preventive dental office visits. Eight hundred (800) total participants will be randomly assigned to either the Usual Care or Experimental Groups. Two hundred participants will be assigned to the Usual Care Group and 600 will be assigned to the Experimental Group. It is anticipated that approximately 17% (~100) of the Experimental Group subjects will refuse to enroll in the study, leaving a final total of approximately 500 subject in this group. Within the Experimental Group, 125 subjects positive for the IL-1 genetic test (PerioPredictÂ® Genetic Risk Test, Interleukin Genetics, Inc., Waltham, MA) will be identified and ~375 will test negative for the IL-1 genetic test. The Sponsor will enter the subject's dental office registration number into a master spreadsheet and randomly assign every fourth patient to the Usual Care Group and all others will be assigned into the Experimental Group. Information about the study and informed consent will be made available by the dental office for the specific groups, either by directing to a website location with videos and ICFs, or alternatively by by dental office showing informational videos on provided tablet and gathering signed hardcopy ICFs at schedule first visit.</detailed_description>
