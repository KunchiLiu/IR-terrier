	<brief_title>The Impact of Chiropractic Activator Adjustments on Mental Rotation and Line Judgment Reaction Time</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study seeks to assess the impact of chiropractic on cognition. Participants must be between 18 and 35 years of age. Within the past six months individuals may not participate if they have had any broken bones, accidents, or surgeries to their spine. Additionally, participants cannot have any mental disabilities, be pregnant, or have other conditions of the spine such as bone mineral loss. Patients will receive a chiropractic exam and will be randomized to a sham (simulated chiropractic adjustment) or chiropractic adjustment intervention group. Prior to receiving either the sham or chiropractic adjustment, the participants will sit in front of a computer screen and will be asked to follow instructions and press a button on a keypad. There will be three different types of computer assessments that will take approximately fifteen minutes total. After the computer assessments the participant will receive either the sham or chiropractic adjustment. The chiropractic adjustment and the sham will both utilize a handheld instrument called an Activator. After the adjustment or sham the participant will take the computer assessments again. The total time this may take is ninety minutes.</detailed_description>
