	<brief_summary>This is a study of the muscle stabilizers of the elbow with respect to the prevention of Ulnar Collateral Ligament (UCL) injuries in pitchers. Pitchers are assessed at spring training and end of season for approximately 5 years. Pronator, flexor digitoum superficialis (FDS), and wrist flexion strength will be measured and correlated with upper extremity injuries and time missed from pitching. The investigators will also be measuring loss of strength over the season. The goal is to learn whether strength in these muscles prevents UCL injuries and finally whether these muscles can be strengthened to avoid such injuries.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal of this study is to assess whether the strengths of the secondary muscular stabilizers toward valgus stress at the elbow, the wrist flexors, flexor digitorum superficialis, and pronator teres emanating from the medial epicondyle, affect the incidence of ulnar collateral ligament injuries of the elbows in pitchers. Pitchers in the minor leagues of a single professional baseball club will have the strength of these secondary muscular stabilizers assessed and then correlated to ulnar collateral ligament injuries and time missed from baseball season and subsequent seasons. A secondary goal is to assess whether strengthening exercises targeted toward these muscular stabilizers of the elbow can decrease the incidence of ulnar collateral ligament injuries in young baseball pitchers. This could impact the field by changing the emphasis from reconstruction and rehabilitation of ulnar collateral ligament injuries to prevention.</detailed_description>
