	<brief_summary>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common chronic neurologic disability in young adult females in their childbearing ages. Little evidence is available regarding the association between exposure to IFN-beta (β) products and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Therefore the four marketing holders of IFN-β are conducting a European-wide IFN-β pregnancy registry. Additionally, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has requested a study to enable identification of pregnancy outcomes in the MS population unexposed to IFN-β products for comparison with the ongoing European IFN-β Pregnancy Registry.</brief_summary>

The Swedish MBR includes data on stillbirths after 28 GW The estimated number of pregnancies in MS patients needed is 1671, encompassing data from: i) FIN: 1 January 1996 - 31 December 2014; ii) SWE: 1 July 2005 - 31 December 2014; iii) NOR: 1 January 2004 - 31 December 2014.</detailed_description>
