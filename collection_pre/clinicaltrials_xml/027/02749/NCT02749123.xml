	<brief_title>Comparison of Prescription Lidocaine Patch to Over the Counter Lidocaine Patch and Placebo for Back Pain and Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this comparison of; lidocaine 5%, lidocaine/menthol 1.25% and placebo for patients with back pain and arthritis, subjects had to qualify by meeting various inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects signed an informed consent and were randomized in a double blinded fashion to one of the three arms. After randomization subjects completed a baseline questionnaire regarding how pain affects their lives. Then they began therapy with their blinded product. This same questionnaire was administered after the second day of therapy and after the final day on day 10. Responses at the day two and ten endpoints were compared to baseline to access the response of each arm.</detailed_description>
