	<brief_summary>Rosacea is a common disease characterized by inflammation and vascular abnormalities of the facial skin and ocular surface. It it considered to be a syndrome encompassing various combinations of cutaneous signs including flushing, erythema, telangiectasia, papules, edema, ocular lesions, and rhinophyma. The exact etiology of cutaneous rosacea is unknown but is characterized by persistent vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and vascular hyper-reactivity of the microcirculation of the central part of the face. The purpose of this study is to develop gene expression profiles of papulopustular rosacea compared to those of normal skin. The investigator hopes to better understand the abnormal gene functions that might contribute to this condition. This understanding may lead to the development of additional and better treatments for rosacea.</brief_summary>
