	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the application of newly generated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols for the assessment of placental perfusion in human subjects. The primary objective is to validate and establish the utility of placental MRI in pregnant women. The study will be entirely MRI-technology based with collection of placental tissue at the time of infant delivery for later correlative studies.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The placenta provides all the nutrition from a pregnant mother to a developing fetus. A placenta that functions normally is needed to ensure normal fetal growth and development. Unfortunately, the placenta is the least understood human organ even though it is involved in all pregnancy complications. The placenta is so poorly understood because our current methods to look at it during pregnancy, like ultrasound, do not provide enough information about placental growth and function. This study will help provide information about: - How the placenta grows and develops during pregnancy - How the placenta delivers nutrients, like oxygen to the developing fetus - If placental function using new advanced imaging tools can predict pregnancy complications like fetal growth restriction, stillbirth, preeclampsia and preterm labor This study will explore how blood flow to the placenta affects placental growth, fetal growth, and oxygen delivery to the fetus. Blood flow to the placenta may determine how the placenta supports fetal growth and development. Having a way to measure placental function during pregnancy may provide a way to understand normal pregnancies but importantly also identify pregnancies at increased risk for pregnancy complications.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Pregnant women will be recruited based on inclusion criteria for 3 subject groups: 1. nonsmokers with low risk for placental insufficiency (N=60) 2. Smokers (N=90) 3. Nonsmokers who are at a high risk for adverse outcomes based on prior clinical history (N=150) Inclusion criteria: Pregnant women fulfilling inclusion criteria, and not meeting exclusion criteria, will be invited to participate in this study. Inclusion criteria for all groups: 1. Maternal age over 18 years and able to give informed consent 2. Pregnant patient, as defined by positive pregnancy test for elevated Î²human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) and certain menstrual history, or early ultrasound, identified prior to12 weeks of gestation 3. Intent to deliver at Oregon Health &amp; Science University (OHSU) Inclusion criteria for low risk group: 1. At least one successful pregnancy defined as a nonanomalous, appropriate birth weight for gestational age, singleton delivery at 3741 weeks gestation with no evidence of hypertensive disease. 2. No history of a second or third trimester loss 3. No history of fetal growth restriction 4. No medical problems requiring chronic treatment 5. No history of preterm birth Inclusion criteria for high risk group: 1. Multiparous 2. History of pregnancy complicated by placental insufficiency (i.e. severe preeclampsia requiring preterm delivery, oligohydramnios) in the immediately preceding pregnancy 3. Not currently a smoker Exclusion criteria: These criteria will exclude women whose medications, personality traits or obstetric conditions could confound their ability to complete a 1 hour MRI scan. 1. Individuals with intellectual disability or who are incarcerated 2. Multiple gestation 3. Major fetal anomalies known to be associated with abnormal growth (i.e. major congenital heart defect, gastroschisis) 4. Current use of vasoactive medication (aspirin, heparin, antihypertensives). 5. Current maternal history of alcohol or illicit drug use 6. Current medical problems requiring chronic treatment: Cancer Endocrine disease (including thyroid disease, adrenal disease) Pregestational diabetes Renal disease with altered renal function (creatinine &gt; 0.9 mg or proteinuria) Epilepsy or other seizure disorder Any collagen disease (lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, etc) Active liver disease (acute hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, persistently abnormal liver enzymes) Hematological disorder including alloimmune and isoimmune thrombocytopenia but excluding mild iron deficiency anemia Chronic pulmonary disease including asthma requiring regular use of medication Heart disease Prior or current thromboembolism. Antiphospholipid Syndrome. 7. Prior history of claustrophobia 8. Metal implants 9. Increased aneuploidy risk based on ultrasound findings or genetic testing 10. Intent to deliver outside of OHSU</criteria>
