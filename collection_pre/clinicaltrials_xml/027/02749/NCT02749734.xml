	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and therapeutic effect of sub-retinal transplantation of human embryo stem cell derived retinal pigment epitheliums (hESC-RPE) in patients with macular degeneration diseases, and explore new treatment modalities for macular degeneration diseases (Age-related macular degeneration and Stargardt's macular dystrophy).</brief_summary>
