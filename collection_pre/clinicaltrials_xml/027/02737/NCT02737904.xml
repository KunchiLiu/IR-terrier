	<brief_summary>This randomised controlled trial aims to explore the effectiveness of a four week programme of exercise using lower limb Active Passive trainer (APT) (MOTOmed trainer) in terms of spasticity in people with moderate to severe Multiple Sclerosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Active-Passive Trainer Cycling on Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exercise is beneficial for people with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS). However, exercise options for those with moderate to high levels of disability are limited. Cycling, delivered with an Active Passive Trainer (APT) is one exercise option often offered within rehabilitation/exercise settings and many pwMS buy APTs for home use. Anecdotally, pwMS report they feel better and their spasticity reduces after APT cycling, however there is a lack of evidence to support this. 30 pwMS will be recruited from the Physical Disability Rehabilitation Unit at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, and randomised to APT + usual care or usual care only. Those in the APT group will receive 30 minutes of APT (2 mins passive warm up, 26 mins active cycling and 2 mins passive cool down), five days per week for 4 weeks. Outcome measures will be cardiovascular fitness measured using the oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES), spasticity assessed by Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) and the Multiple Sclerosis Spasticity Scale (MSSS-88), function assessed by the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and the Timed 25 foot walk test (T25FW), Quality of Life measured by MSQOL-54. Outcome measures will be assessed in both groups before and after the 4 week intervention period. Symmetry, distance cycled and power will be recorded following each cycling session in the intervention group.</detailed_description>
