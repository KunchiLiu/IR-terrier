	<brief_summary>Chronic disease self-management is the ability of the individual, in conjunction with family, community and healthcare professionals to manage symptoms, treatments, lifestyle changes and psychosocial, cultural and spiritual consequences associated with a chronic condition. Self-management strategies have been successfully used in supportive care and survivorship in oncology. Stepping On, a multi-component program using a small-group learning environment, reduces falls by 31%. It empowers participants with knowledge about fall-risk, exercise, medications and environmental hazards to self-manage their risk of falls over 7 weeks of educational sessions, followed by a home visit. The research in this proposal will yield the adaptation of the effective group-education-based fall-prevention intervention Stepping On, tailored to cancer patients, feasible for testing in a multi-institutional trial, and ultimately scalable in the oncology setting.</brief_summary>
