	<brief_summary>Infants with viral bronchiolitis are currently treated with oxygen therapy if oxygen saturation is low. In earlier observational clinical studies, the use of high flow nasal cannulae therapy in infants with bronchiolitis has been associated with a decreased rate of intubation and intensive care. This study is a randomized controlled trial in two pediatric university hospitals in Finland comparing high flow nasal cannulae therapy to usual oxygen therapy in infants with bronchiolitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Flow Nasal Cannula Use in Infants With Bronchiolitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infants with viral bronchiolitis are currently treated with oxygen therapy if oxygen saturation is low. In earlier observational clinical studies, the use of high flow nasal cannulae therapy in infants with bronchiolitis has been associated with a decreased rate of intubation and intensive care. This study is a randomized controlled trial in two pediatric university hospitals in Finland comparing high flow nasal cannulae therapy to usual oxygen therapy in infants with bronchiolitis. The investigators will recruit 84 infants who require oxygen therapy (oxygen saturation &lt;92%) during hospitalization due to a viral bronchiolitis. The participants are randomized to receive oxygen therapy either with high flow or ordinary nasal cannula.The infants are closely observed by study physicians for clinical parameters. The primary end point is the respiratory rate (RR) 120 minutes after starting oxygen therapy. Secondary endpoints are RR, oxygen saturation (%) and modified Wood's Clinical Asthma Score (mWCAS) at specific measuring points, time to discharge and admission to intensive care unit (ICU).</detailed_description>
