	<brief_summary>&lt;Part I - Phase I trial&gt; The phase I clinical trial is to identify the MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose) and DLT (Dose Limiting Toxicity) of CG200745 PPA in combination use of Gemcitabine and Erlotinib. Initial dose of CG200745 PPA is 187.5 mg/m^2, and it will be extended to 250 mg/m^2, 312.5 mg/m^2 or it will be reduced to 125 mg/m^2 based on the results of the cohort of 3 subjects per dose level. Based on the 3+3 dose escalation study design, Gemcitabine and Erlotinib are administered as fixed doses, whereas CG200745 PPA is to be administered as in four different cohorts according to the dose level. Each cohort consists of 3 or 6 subjects. &lt;Part II - Phase II trial&gt; In the phase II clinical trial, the subjects will be administered with the dose which is to be identified as a recommended dose based on the results of Phase I study. The whole one cycle is consisted of 28 days, same as the phase I. The entire treatment period is 6 cycles and tumor assessment is evaluated every 2 cycles.</brief_summary>
