	<brief_summary>Chronic opioid therapy for pain can be associated with significant risks, and a significant number of patients maintained on chronic opioids have continued pain and/or poor functioning. When patients need to or want to come off their opioid pain medications, there is little to guide physicians as to how to best help them do so, and it is not known how patients do after coming off opioid medications. The goals of this study are (1) to evaluate two medications in assisting patients in coming off their opioid pain medications and (2) determining outcomes after discontinuing opioids.</brief_summary>
