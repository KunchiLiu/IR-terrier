	<brief_title>Belinostat Therapy With Zidovudine for Adult T-Cell Leukemia-Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ATLL is an aggressive malignancy caused by HTLV-1. ATLL cannot be cured by conventional chemotherapy thus urging the development of new therapeutic strategies. HDAC inhibitors are broadly active anti-neoplastic agents that can be exploited for the treatment of ATLL as it has been demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of HDACs promotes acetylation of nucleosomes and chromatin unwinding at the HTLV-1 5' LTR, which results in transcription of the viral genome. Belinostat, a potent pan HDAC inhibitor, causes H3 subunit acetylation and induces HTLV-1 Tax expression in cultured ATLL cells resulting in dose-dependent apoptosis. Further, Belinostat blocks constitutive expression of NF-κB, and increases apoptosis in the presence of AZT.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histologically or cytologically documented adult Tcell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) with the following characteristics: any stage of disease, aggressive leukemic types (unfavorable chronic or acute) initial absolute lymphocytosis ≥ 4.0 cells/mm3 upon initial disease presentation, and documented presence of ATLL cells in peripheral blood by either morphology, histology, flow cytometry or gene rearrangement studies 2. One of the following: Received prior zidovudine/interferon alfa therapy (AZT/IFNα) therapy for ≥2 weeks and achieved at least partial hematological response defined as &gt; 50% reduction in absolute lymphocyte count) without evidence of new disease lesions or disease progression (defined as 50% increase in measurable disease from nadir as in section 14.5 if imaging is performed) at the time of enrollment OR, received chemotherapy for ≥ 2 weeks duration, followed by at least a partial hematologic response ((defined as &gt; 50% reduction in absolute lymphocyte count), and without evidence of new disease lesions or disease progression (defined as 50% increase in absolute lymphocyte count or measurable disease from nadir as specified in section 14.5 if imaging is performed) at the time of enrollment. 3. Presence of residual ATLL based on Tcell clonality in peripheral blood at the time of enrollment 4. Documented Human Tcell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV1) infection: Documentation may be serologic assay (ELISA) confirmed by Western blot or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 5. Measurable or evaluable disease. 6. 18 years of age or older. 7. Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ≥ 50% or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2 8. Patients must have adequate end organ and bone marrow function as defined below: absolute neutrophil count (ANC)≥ 1,000 cells/mm3 [Exception: Unless cytopenias are secondary to ATLL] platelets (PLT) ≥ 50,000 cells/mm3 [Exception: Unless cytopenias are secondary to ATLL] Adequate hepatic function: transaminase ≤ 2.5 the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN), total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN), [Exception: Unless secondary to hepatic infiltration with lymphoma. If the elevated bilirubin is felt to be secondary to Indinavir or Atazavinir therapy (or antiHIV medications), patients will be allowed to enroll.] Creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 40 mL/min, [Exception: Unless secondary to renal involvement by lymphoma.] 9. Patients who are human immunodeficiency virus positive (HIV+) are also eligible. 10. Females of childbearing potential (CBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test within one week of enrollment. Women should avoid pregnancy while receiving study treatment. Males and females must agree to use adequate birth control during participation in this trial and for 3 months after completing therapy. 11. Patients receiving erythropoietin or Granulocytecolony stimulating factor (GCSF) from baseline are eligible. 12. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document. 1. Patients with progressive disease (after previous chemotherapy or AZT/IFNα) at the time of enrollment. 2. Patients with lymphomatous, chronic leukemia with favorable features, or smoldering type ATLL (for definition of ATLL subtypes see Appendix H). 3. Patients receiving any other investigational agents within 14 days prior to initiation of study therapy. (Exception: Patients actively receiving IFNalfa2b or PEGIFNalfa2b are permitted). 4. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF), unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that are likely in the judgment of the Investigator(s) to interfere or limit compliance with study requirements/treatment. 5. Pregnant or breastfeeding women. 6. Known hypersensitivity to histone deacetylases (HDACs), zidovudine, belinostat or any component of the formulation(s). 7. Autoimmune or viral hepatitis or decompensated liver disease unless due to lymphoma. 8. Concurrent active malignancies, with the exception of in situ carcinoma of the cervix, nonmetastatic, nonmelanomatous skin cancer, or Kaposi's sarcoma not requiring systemic chemotherapy. 9. New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class 3 or 4 heart disease as per Appendix D. 10. Ejection fraction &lt; 50% 11. Psychological, familial, sociological or geographical conditions likely in the judgment of the Investigator(s) to interfere or limit compliance with study requirements/treatment.</criteria>
