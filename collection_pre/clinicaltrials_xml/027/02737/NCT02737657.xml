	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to describe the tolerability of canagliflozin and any sulphonylurea (each administered with metformin with or without a DPP-4 inhibitor), in terms of the percentage of patients with at least one episode of hypoglycaemia, in patients with T2DM who fast during Ramadan.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Observational Study to Evaluate Tolerability of Canagliflozin and Sulphonylurea in Type 2 Diabetes Patients During Ramadan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is non-randomized, parallel-cohort, prospective, multicenter (when more than one hospital works on a medical research study), observational study to describe the treatment of T2DM with canagliflozin during the Holy Month of Ramadan. Observed participants will be participants with T2DM (at the time of enrollment) who are being treated with either canagliflozin or any sulphonylurea, each administered on a background therapy of metformin with or without a DPP-4 inhibitor within clinical practice, and who intend to fast during the Ramadan period. On enrollment, patients will enter one of two parallel treatment cohorts based on their ongoing T2DM therapy: canagliflozin and metformin with or without a DPP-4 inhibitor will be the treatment of interest, while any sulphonylurea and metformin with or without a DPP-4 inhibitor will serve as the reference standard treatment. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
