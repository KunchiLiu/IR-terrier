	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study of patients undergoing structural heart disease procedures that utilize TEE and fluoroscopic guidance at the New York University (NYU) Langone Medical Center. Patients in this study will undergo their procedure utilizing the TEE/Angio fusion software prototype. This protocol is primarily intended to ascertain the potential utility of the software prototype in the study population and to provide data and feedback to improve the workflow and algorithms of the prototype. As such, a primary outcome variable and statistical analysis plan have not been identified. However, procedural time, measures of radiation exposure (dose area product, total radiation dose, fluoroscopy time), degree of residual valvular regurgitation or paravalvular regurgitation as applicable, and complications will be recorded.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TEE/Angio Fusion Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is for patients planned to undergo a transcatheter-based structural heart disease procedure that utilizes TEE and fluoroscopic guidance at the NYU Langone Medical Center. It will evaluate the utility and workflow of the transesophageal echocardiography/angiography (TEE/Angio) fusion software prototype to provide visualization of anatomic landmarks and guidance during structural heart disease procedures. The purpose of this study is to evaluate software (TEE/Angio fusion) that merges images from two standard procedures (ultrasound and x-ray) used to look at the heart during a procedure for structural heart disease. Typically, these 2-dimensional images are viewed separately, requiring the operator to mentally merge the two images together while deciding if he/she is in the correct location for the treatment strategy. TEE/Angio fusion is designed to make a single 3-dimensional image of the heart in real-time.</detailed_description>
