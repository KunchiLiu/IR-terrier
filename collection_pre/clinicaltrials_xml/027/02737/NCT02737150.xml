	<brief_summary>Aim of the study is to demonstrate equivalence of second-generation self-expandable valves (CoreValve Evolut R) in comparison to second-generation balloon-expandable valves (Edwards Sapien 3) and of local anesthesia with conscious sedation in comparison to general anesthesia with respect to safety and efficacy in high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.</brief_summary>
