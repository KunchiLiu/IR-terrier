	<brief_summary>Primary objective: 1. To evaluate the safety of TWB-103 in split-thickness skin graft donor site wounds (DSW) for Phase I in terms of Incidence of treatment-related AEs and SAEs (including infections and bleeding) 2. To evaluate the efficacy for Phase I+II of TWB-103 in split-thickness skin graft donor site wounds (DSW) in terms of The healing time from DSW creation to 100% re-epithelialization Secondary objective: 1. To evaluate the efficacy of TWB-103 in split-thickness skin graft donor site wounds (DSW) in secondary efficacy endpoints 2. To evaluate the safety of TWB-103 in split-thickness skin graft donor site wounds (DSW) in secondary safety endpoints</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>A patient is eligible for the study if all of the following apply: 1. Female/male patients, aged 2065 years old 2. Presenting a splitthickness skin graft donor site wound with a minimum size of 15 cm2, with a minimum width of 3 cm and with an approximate thickness of 0.38mm. The graft cannot be harvested from a site from which a skin graft was previously obtained. 3. If the primary wound is a result of a thermal or chemical burn, the total body surface area of the said wound must be less than 15%. 4. Females of childbearing potential must have a documented negative serum pregnancy test and must agree to use highly effective contraceptives during the treatment period 5. Willing to comply with the study protocol and to sign the Informed Consent Form Any patient meeting any of the exclusion criteria will be excluded from study participation. 1. Female patients who are pregnant or lactating or planning a pregnancy during the study period. 2. Clinically significant disease or condition that may compromise graft take and/or donor site healing (e.g. the presence of a bleeding disorder, capillary fragility, venous or arterial disorder directly affecting the donor site to be treated, known or suspected systemic malignancies, human immunodeficiency virus infection, renal or liver disease, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, thrombocytopenia, vasculitis, poor nutritional status). 3. Patients who are currently receiving or have received the following treatments within 4 weeks prior to study entry are excluded from the study: 1. systemic, inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids or immunosuppressant agents; or 2. therapeutic doses of anticoagulants (e.g. Plavix, Coumadin, Heparin, low molecular weight Heparin) for preexisting medical conditions, for whom a dose interruption from Screening through the end of the study period is contraindicated. 4. Autoimmune disease, e.g. lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis. 5. Hematologic disease, malignancy or hypoimmunity. 6. History of HIV or congenital immunodeficiency. Note: HIV = human immunodeficiency virus 7. History of alcoholism or drug abuse. 8. Have used any tobacco product within 1 week prior to treatment. 9. Patients previously treated with any cellbased product, including autologous tissue at the treatment site. 10. Received an investigational drug, device or biological/bioactive treatment within 30 days prior to study entry. 11. Any clinical condition or significant concurrent disease judged by the investigator to complicate the evaluation of the trial treatment. 12. History of sensitivity to bovine or porcine origin materials</criteria>
