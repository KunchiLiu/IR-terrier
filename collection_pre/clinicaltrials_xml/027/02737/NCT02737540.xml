	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to confirm the existence of risky decision making in a non strategic situation (Iowa Gambling Task) and a deficit of decision making in social situations, linked to greater sensitivity to injustice (Ultimatum Game) and a lower level of trust (Trust Game) in elderly depressed patients with a history of suicide attempts in comparison with older depressed patients without a history of suicidal acts and healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neuropsychological Factors Associated With Vulnerability to Suicidal Behavior in Depressed Elderly Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives are to confirm or explore the deficits of certain cognitive processes involved in potentially suicidal behavior in depressed elderly persons but that have been little or not studied to date. These include: A. cognitive control and sensitivity to interference (Victoria Stroop test, incompatibility test, flexibility test, Go / No-Go); B. Strategic recovery of semantic memory (verbal fluency test); C. Working memory (TEA); D. Insight related to depression (Mood Disorders Insight Scale); E. Recognition of facial emotions; F. Emotional regulation; G. Negative attitudes; H. Self-perception and; I. Time perspectives. Finally, patients will be contacted by telephone at month 6 to assess the occurrence of a suicidal act during this period and thus calculate the predictive ability of cognitive and psychological factors.</detailed_description>
