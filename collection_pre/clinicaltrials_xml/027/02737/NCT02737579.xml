	<brief_title>XFM: (X-ray Fused With MRI) Guided Cardiac Catheterization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular interventional procedures are currently conducted under the guidance of X-ray fluoroscopy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide increased soft tissue information about the cardiovascular system. By combining the familiar X-ray environment with superior magnetic resonance imaging, the investigator hopes to enhance and expand the capabilities of cardiac catheterization techniques. The investigator will conduct cardiac catheterization procedures using XFM guidance in pediatric research patients who are undergoing medically necessary procedures. The investigator aims to decrease the exposure of these patients to the routine hazards of ionizing radiation and contrast exposure compared to the standard of care approach.</detailed_description>
