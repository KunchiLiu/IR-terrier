	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the serum testosterone levels in patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer on SoluMatrix™ Abiraterone Acetate as Compared to Abiraterone Acetate</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate Serum Testosterone Levels in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is 12-week, open-label study of abiraterone acetate in at least 50 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The primary endpoint is total testosterone at pharmacokinetic steady-state. Additional secondary endpoints include safety assessments, PSA and pharmacokinetic measurements</detailed_description>
