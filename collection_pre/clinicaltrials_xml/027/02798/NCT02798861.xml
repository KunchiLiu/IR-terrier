	<brief_summary>The primary aim is to determine the accuracy of CAP in the quantification of liver steatosis using liver biopsies as reference. Secondarily, investigators will correlate transient elastography (TE) and CAP results, analyze possible associations between CAP/TE and post-liver transplant (LT) clinical outcomes, and evaluate the change in CAP after LT. The study aims to include as many donors as needed to achieve 100 transplanted liver allografts.</brief_summary>
