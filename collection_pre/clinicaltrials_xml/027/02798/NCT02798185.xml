	<brief_summary>This is a study to develop methods of diagnosing chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) during life, as well as to examine possible risk factors for this neurodegenerative disease. Once component of this study is the use of an investigational PET scan radio tracer to detect abnormal tau protein in the brain.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a distinct deposition of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in neurons and astrocytes in a pattern that is unique from other tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the neuropathological features of CTE have become further clarified in recent years, the clinical presentation of CTE is still not well characterized. Diagnostic criteria have only recently been published and lack validation. Neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers developed for the diagnosis of other neurodegenerative diseases have only been used in preliminary studies of individuals at high risk for CTE, namely athletes with histories of significant exposure to repetitive head impacts (RHI), such as former football players and boxers. There is thus an urgent need to develop accurate methods for detecting and diagnosing CTE during life so that effective interventions for prevention and treatment can be developed. Moreover, though a history of RHI is a necessary risk factor for CTE, it alone is not sufficient. There is a need to understand what specific aspects of RHI exposure places an individual at increased risk for CTE and to examine potential genetic polymorphisms that modify that risk. To address these needs, the investigators are conducting a multidisciplinary, multicenter, longitudinal study of former NFL and varsity college football players (with and without symptoms), and a control group of asymptomatic same-age men without any history of RHI exposure, traumatic brain injury or military service. Subjects will be seen at 1 of 4 participating study sites in Boston; Las Vegas, ; New York; and Scottsdale/Phoenix . Subjects will undergo a baseline evaluation and a 3 year follow-up evaluation (currently former college players will not complete the follow-up evaluation). Each evaluation will be take place over a 3 day period and consist of the following procedures/tests: neurocognitive testing, determination of functional independence, neuropsychiatric examination (with measures of mood and behavior), neurological assessment (motor, headache, postural stability), neuroimaging (including structural, diffusion, functional, biochemical, and molecular imaging), lumbar punctures (for Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) biomarkers), blood draws (for blood biomarkers and DNA), and saliva samples (for biomarkers).</detailed_description>
