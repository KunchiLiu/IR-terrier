	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if a type of radiation therapy called frameless fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (FFSRT) is effective for treating participants with brain metastases. The safety of this therapy will also be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Frameless Fractionated Stereotactic Radiation Therapy (FSRT) for Brain Mets Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Treatment: Participant will receive FFSRT daily for 3-5 days (weekdays only), based on what the doctor thinks is needed. Each dose will last about 30 minutes. A mask will be fitted to keep participant's head in the same position for each dose. Participant may notice sounds and lights from the radiation machine working. Participant will be alone in the room during their treatment, but they will be able to see and hear the staff. Length of Study Participation: Patient's participation on this study will be over after their 1-year follow-up visit, described below. Follow-Up Visits: Every 3 months for 1 year after participant's last dose of FFSRT, they will return to the clinic for follow-up visits. At each visit participant will have an MRI to check the status of the disease. Participant will also be asked about how they are feeling. This is an investigational study. FFSRT is delivered using FDA-approved and commercially available methods. The study doctor can explain how FFSRT is designed to work. Up to 35 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson locations in Rio Rancho and Albuquerque, NM and the following Houston area locations in Bay Area, Katy, Sugarland, and The Woodlands.</detailed_description>
