	<brief_title>Early Luteal Progesterone Profile After hCG Triggering</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The early luteal progesterone profile in IVF differs significantly from the progesterone profile of the natural cycle, in which the peak is reached around the time of implantation. With this non-invasive trial investigators wish to further explore the early luteal phase profiles of progesterone and hCG in order to optimize current luteal phase support policies in IVF and hopefully increase ongoing pregnancy rates. Stimulation, monitoring, and oocyte pick-up will be performed according to the standard procedure of the clinic. On the day of trigger with 5.000 IU hCG a blood sample will be drawn prior to triggering for subsequent analysis. Moreover, all ovarian follicles on each side equal to or above 11 mm will be registered. Oocyte pick-up and timing of the trigger bolus will be performed according to the standard procedures of the unit. A total 10 blood samples will be drawn during this trial - please see "blood sampling". Blood samples will be collected on the following days for subsequent analysis of LH, E2, hCG and progesterone. All embryos will be cryo-preserved for transfer in subsequent frozen/thaw embryo transfer cycles. Primary endpoint Serum concentrations of progesterone, LH, E2, and hCG during early luteal phase. Secondary endpoints The correlation between follicles ≥ 11 mm and progesterone in early luteal phase Data are analyzed using SPSS version 20 software. All tests are two tailed, and P&lt;0.05 is considered statistically significant. Continuous variables are presented as mean +/- SD and are tested by student's t-test. Categorical data are expressed as numbers and compared using the Chi-square test.</detailed_description>
