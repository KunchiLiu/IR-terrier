	<brief_summary>Particular attention is paid to thermal management of preterm neonates in neonatal intensive care units because of the major risk of morbidity associated with hypothermia. Percutaneous central venous catheter placement is essential to ensure adequate caloric intake and intravenous administration of treatments, but this procedure can cause major body temperature variations, responsible for complications in these neonates, as convection incubator function is impaired during opening of the incubator, which can be prolonged (30 minutes to 2 hours) depending on the technical difficulties encountered during catheter placement. In parallel, the use of a polyethylene bag or sheet in the delivery room and for neonatal transport is now clearly defined and ensures stability or even a considerable temperature gain during transfer immediately after birth. In the light of several clinical cases, the use of a polyethylene bag during central venous catheter placement appears to be effective to prevent body temperature loss in preterm neonates. No data are currently available concerning the value of this method of prevention of hypothermia during this type of procedure. Preliminary studies conducted by our team on a dummy suggest that a polyethylene bag or sheet could be useful during this procedure by significantly reducing heat loss caused by convection and evaporation. However, compensation phenomena such as generalized vasoconstriction to cold in preterm infants are very poorly described, but can induce a functional conflict between mechanisms ensuring maintenance of homeostasis and those involved in maintenance of blood pressure.</brief_summary>
