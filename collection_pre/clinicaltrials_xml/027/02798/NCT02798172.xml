	<brief_summary>Objective: To observe the effect of alogliptin combined with metformin on pulmonary function in obese patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by metformin monotherapy (500 mg, bid po, for at least 3 months), and evaluate its efficacy and safety. Method: After a 2-week screening period, adult patients (aged 36-72 years) entered a 4-week run-in/stabilization period. Then, patients were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n=55) or control group (n=50) for 26 weeks. The patients in the control group were given metformin (1,000 mg, bid po) and the patients in the intervention group were given metformin (500 mg, bid po) combined with alogliptin (25 mg, qd po). All the patients received counseling about diet and exercise from a nutritionist during run-in and treatment periods. The primary endpoints were the between-group differences in the changes pulmonary function parameters [VC%, FVC%, FEV1%, PEF%, MVV%, TLC%, FEV1/FVC%, DLCO%, and DLCO/VA%] between pretherapy and posttreatment. The secondary endpoints were changes from baseline to week 26 in HbA1c, FPG, 2hPG, HOMA-IR, WC, and BMI. The tertiary endpoints were the changes from baseline to week 26 in blood-fat (TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG). The quartus endpoints were the changes from baseline to week 26 in SBP and DBP. The fifth endpoints were the changes from baseline to week 26 in oxidative/antioxidative parameters (ROS, MDA, SOD, and GSH-PX). In addition, safety endpoints were assessed (AEs, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and electrocardiographic readings).</brief_summary>
