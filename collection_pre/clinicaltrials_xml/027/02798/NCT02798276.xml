	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of a pericardial adipose graft transposition (Adipose Graft Trasposition Procedure, AGTP) for the improvement of cardiac function in patients with a chronic myocardial infarction. Preclinical studies in the porcine model of myocardial infarction have shown that the AGTP reduces infarct area and improves cardiac function. A first-in-man clinical (NCT01473433) trial showed that the AGTP is safe in patients.</brief_summary>
