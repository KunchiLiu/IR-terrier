	<brief_summary>Investigators will collect blood specimens from the participating patients and then blood samples will be centrifuged in order to collect platelet-rich plasma which is going to be injected in the atrophic acne scars. A split-face design is going to used in this randomized controlled trial. In the control side of the face, micro-needling to the skin will occur using a specific tool (Dermapen).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Atrophic Acne Scars With Platelet-Rich Plasma and Skin Needling</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrophic acne scar is a common problem with a challenging treatment. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an autologous preparation of platelets in concentrated plasma that may be beneficial in the treatment of atrophic acne scars by promoting collagen deposition. Skin needling is a technique that uses a sterile micro needles to puncture the skin and release growth factors. The combination of skin needling and PRP could enhance the efficacy of both modalities.</detailed_description>
