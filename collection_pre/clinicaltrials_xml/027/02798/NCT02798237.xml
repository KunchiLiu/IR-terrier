	<brief_summary>Physical activity level is an important determinant of quality of life in persons post-stroke. There is a lack of knowledge regarding the effects of overground walking aerobic training on physical activity level and cardiorespiratory fitness in post-stroke subjects. Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare the effects of aerobic overground training, aerobic treadmill training and overground training to improve physical activity level, cardiorespiratory fitness, endurance, mobility, quality of life and participation in participants post-stroke. A randomized controlled trial with blinded assessment will assign eligible participants to either: 1) aerobic overground training, 2) aerobic treadmill training, or 3) control group (overground walking). Participants will receive three 40 minutes sessions per week on 60-80% of heart rate reserve (groups-1 and 2), and below 40% (group-3) over 12-weeks. At baseline, post-intervention, and at 4-week follow-up researchers blinded to group allocations will collect the following outcome measures: physical activity level, cardiorespiratory fitness, endurance, mobility, quality of life and participation. We hypothesize that the two aerobic training groups (overground and treadmill), would have an increase on physical activity level and on cardiorespiratory fitness (peak VO2), as well as endurance, mobility, quality of life and participation. In addition, the control group would not improve in any of these outcome measures.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sample size: cardiorespiratory fitness (peak VO2) was used as the primary outcome measure to determine the sample size which has been derived from the aerobic treadmill training study of Globas et al. on post-stroke subjects. In this randomized controlled trial, the experimental group (n=18) showed an increase on peak VO2 on average of 5.5 ± 4.6 mL/kg/min, and the control group (n=18) had an average reduction of 0.8 ± 7.8 mL/kg/min. Using α=0.05 and β=0.80, a number of 13 participants per group is required. Assuming a dropout rate of 15%, 45 participants (15 participants per group) will be recruited. Statistical analyses: A code will be given to each participant. Two independent examiners will perform data entry, and will verify missing or apparently wrong values. Original paper forms will be kept in a secure place. Electronic files will be available only to the research team. An independent examiner, blinded to the group allocation, will perform statistical analysis by SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). Descriptive statistics and tests for normality will be employed. Baseline variables will be compared between groups using One-way ANOVA. The effects of the trainings will be analyzed from the collected data and the analysis of intention-to-treat. Data from the last available assessment will be considered as the values of sessions lost by dropouts. Between-groups differences will be measured with two-way ANOVA (α=0.05) with repeated measures considering the baseline, post-training and follow-up. Study results will be spread regardless of the magnitude or direction of effect.</detailed_description>
