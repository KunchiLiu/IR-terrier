	<brief_summary>Glioblastoma (GBM) and gliosarcoma (GS) are the most common and aggressive forms of malignant brain tumor in adults and can be resistant to conventional therapies. The purpose of this Phase II study is to evaluate how well a recurrent glioblastoma or gliosarcoma tumor responds to one injection of DNX-2401, a genetically modified oncolytic adenovirus, when delivered directly into the tumor followed by the administration of intravenous pembrolizumab (an immune checkpoint inhibitor) given every 3 weeks for up to 2 years or until disease progression.

	<detailed_description>In the initial phase of the study, up to 12 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in 3 dose cohorts to determine the best dose of DNX-2401, as follows: - Cohort 1: Single dose DNX-2401 (5e8 vp) delivered intratumorally by cannula, followed by intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (Q3W) - Cohort 2: Single dose DNX-2401(5e9 vp) delivered intratumorally by cannula, followed by intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (Q3W) - Cohort 3: Single dose DNX-2401 (5e10 vp) delivered intratumorally by cannula, followed by intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (Q3W) Following the initial phase, up to 36 additional subjects diagnosed with recurrent glioblastoma or gliosarcoma will be enrolled to receive a single of DNX-2401 determined in the initial phase administered intratumorally followed by intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks. All subjects will return to the clinic for study follow-up visits at regular intervals for safety monitoring, MRI scans and other assessments, for up to 2 years or until disease progression. All subjects will be followed closely for safety and survival.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A single glioblastoma or gliosarcoma tumor with histopathological confirmation for first or presenting second recurrence of glioblastoma or gliosarcoma at the time of consent Gross total or partial tumor resection is not possible or not planned A single measurable tumor that is at least 10.0 mm longest diameter (LDi) X 10.0 mm shortest diameter (SDi) and this tumor does not exceed 40.0 mm in LDi or SDi Tumor recurrence or progression documented after previously failing surgical resection, chemotherapy and/or radiation Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70 % Prior antitumor therapies must have been completed within time periods specified in the protocol prior to DNX2401 injection Multiple (≥ 2) separate enhancing tumors Tumor location on both sides of the brain and/or involvement that would present the risk of injecting DNX2401 into the ventricles of the brain Tumor location in the brain stem Requires treatment with highdose systemic corticosteroids within 2 weeks of the start of intravenous pembrolizumab infusions Uncontrolled bloodsugar levels defined as HbA1c &gt; 7% on 2 separate measurements Previous treatment with antiPD1 or PDL1 agents including pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA) or any other checkpoint inhibitor(s) (e.g., ipilimumab, nivolumab, etc.) Evidence of active, noninfectious pneumonitis and/or a history of interstitial lung disease Prior gene transfer therapy or prior therapy with a cytolytic virus of any type Brain tumor that is not measurable on MRI or persons who are unable to have MRIs Pregnant or nursing females Note: Other protocoldefined inclusion and exclusion criteria may apply as outlined in the relevant protocol version</criteria>
