	<brief_title>Food Reward in Cachexia Induced by Acute or Chronic Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The activity in the food reward-circuitry of the brain in patients suffering from cachexia induced by cancer (lung cancer or pancreatic cancer) or chronic disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) will be analysed by using functional magnetic resonance imaging. In addition, the role of the peripheral satiety hormones will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
