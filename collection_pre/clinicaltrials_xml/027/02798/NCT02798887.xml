	<brief_title>Ridge Preservation Comparing the Healing With or Without a Barrier Membrane</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty patients will be treated using the principles of bone grafting for ridge preservation. Fifteen test patients will receive a flap technique with an intrasocket cancellous cortical particulate allograft plus a facial overlay graft using a bovine xenograft without a membrane where only the exposed intrasocket allograft will be covered with a piece of Alloderm GBR. The positive control group of fifteen patients will receive a flap technique with an intrasocket cancellous cortical particulate allograft plus a facial overlay graft using a bovine xenograft plus Alloderm GBR membrane. Approximately, four months post-surgery, a trephine core will be taken from the grafted site immediately prior to implant placement and submitted for histologic processing.</detailed_description>
