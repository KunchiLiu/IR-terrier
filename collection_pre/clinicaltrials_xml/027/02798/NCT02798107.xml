	<brief_summary>Idarucizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody fragment (Fab) that binds to dabigatran with very high affinity. Idarucizumab potently and specifically binds to dabigatran and its metabolites and neutralises its anticoagulant effect. A clinical development program is ongoing to support marketing authorisation submissions for idarucizumab indicated in patients treated with dabigatran who require emergency surgery/urgent procedures or who have a life-threatening or uncontrolledbleeding when rapid reversal of the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran is required.</brief_summary>
