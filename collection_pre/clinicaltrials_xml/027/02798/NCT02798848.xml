	<brief_summary>This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) will test the methodology for a full RCT of assistive technologies for children/young people with low vision/blindness. The investigators will recruit 40 students age 10-18 years in India and the UK, who will be randomised into two groups. Apple iPads will be the active intervention; the control arm will be the local standard low-vision aid care. Primary outcomes will be acceptance/usage and accessibility of the device and trial feasibility measures. Exploratory outcomes will be validated measures of vision-related quality of life for children/young people as well as validated measures of reading and educational outcomes. In addition, the investigators will carry out semistructured interviews with the participants and their teachers, and attempt to evaluate cost-effectiveness.</brief_summary>
