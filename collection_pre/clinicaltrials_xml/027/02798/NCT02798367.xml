	<brief_title>Melatonin 3mg and 5mg Compared to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) in the Treatment of Insomnia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment of insomnia disorder can be accomplished through pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches. Behavioral techniques of Sleep Hygiene and Stimuli control are the most used. The Sleep hygiene is a psychoeducational intervention that teaches patients to prevent external or environmental factors generate adverse effects and harmful to sleep. The stimulus control technique is based on five instructions that encourages the patient to establish a proper sleep-wake rhythm and strengthens the links between the way for a quick sleep and well established. Melatonin is a hormone that participates in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle, which is produced and secreted primarily by the pineal gland in the dark period and prepares the individual to sleep. Melatonin is involved in the induction of sleep and has proven therapeutic action in insomnia disorders, and may also play a role in the circadian timing system of mammals and serve as a marker for "biological clock".</detailed_description>
