	<brief_summary>Objective: The main target of this study was to research the early changes in pulmonary function and intrarenal hemodynamics, then research the correlation between the pulmonary function and the renal hemodynamics in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients without diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Method: 37 T2DM patients (diabetes group) without DKD and 33 healthy people (control group) were choosed to research early changes in pulmonary function and intrarenal hemodynamics, then research the correlation between the pulmonary function and the renal blood flow in T2DM patients, all having normal renal function. The primary endpoints were the pulmonary function parameters (VC%, FVC%, FEV1%, PEF%, MVV%, TLC%, FEV1/FVC%, DLCO%, and DLCO/VA%); the secondary endpoints were the intrarenal hemodynamic (bilateral kidney RI) in bilateral interlobular renal arteries were evaluated using; the tertiary endpoints were the biochemical variables: blood-fat (TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG), renal function parameters (BUN, Cr, and GFR); in addition, the albumin excrete rate (AER), urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) were measured.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pulmonary function was measured by spirometer which was provided by Jaska Corporation in Japan, model number: HI-101; RI were measured by Logiq 400 MD Pro Series scanner (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) using a 3.5-4 MHz vector array transducer</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1) The patients were diagnosed with T2DM according to the guidelines of the American Diabetes Association ; 2) No smoking history, pulmonary disease, cold, nor pulmonary infection within a fortnight; 3) Did not have hepatopathy, nephropathy, hyperuricemia, and gastrointestinal disease; and 4) Likely to have good compliance and able to visit our hospital for periodic assessments. 1) T1DM, gestation and lactation; 2) Renal inadequacy; 3) Hypohepatia; 4) Intensive care with insulin treatment; 5) The patients combinated with DKD and hypertension (antihypertensive drugs were used); 6) Patients with other renal conditions that could affect the hemodynamics, such as urolithiasis, urinary infection, and renal cyst (diameter &gt; 3 cm); 7) Heart failure; 8) Cholesterollowering drugs can not control the bloodfat ; and 9) Use of systemically injected glucocorticoids within 3 months prior to our study.</criteria>
