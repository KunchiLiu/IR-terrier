	<brief_summary>The present study is designed to validate an multimodal indicator of anesthetic depth (Schneider G et al. 2014, Anesthesiology 120, 819-28). The indicator previously developed shall now be tested on an independent set of data. The investigators will include 250 patients undergoing general anesthesia in 3 German tertiary care centers. The design is strictly observational - the anesthetic regime is at the discretion of the clinician and will not be influenced.</brief_summary>
