	<brief_summary>Pain is common after knee replacement surgery and can impact a variety of patient outcomes. Peripheral nerve blocks provide improved pain control and may improve function. However, their impact on other outcomes is poorly described. Therefore, this comparative effectiveness study will estimate the independent association between nerve blocks and health outcomes after knee replacement surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Peripheral Nerve Blockade on Outcomes After Total Knee Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This retrospective, population-based cohort study will evaluate the comparative effectiveness of peripheral nerve blocks on patient and health system outcomes after elective total knee replacement surgery. The investigators will develop a non-parsimonious propensity score to control for potential indication bias and confounding in this observational study. Using the propensity score the investigators will match patients who receive a peripheral nerve block to a patient who did not to estimate the independent association of peripheral nerve blocks with our study outcomes.</detailed_description>
