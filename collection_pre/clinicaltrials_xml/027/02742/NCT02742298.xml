	<brief_summary>Study Objectives: 1. Determine the correlation between quantitative muscle ultrasound (QMUS), electrical impedance myography (EIM) and currently accepted measures of physical function. 2. Determine the reliability of EIM measures performed in the home through use of a hand held device. 3. Determine if QMUS and EIM can detect pre-clinical changes in Pompe disease.</brief_summary>
