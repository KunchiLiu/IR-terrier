	<brief_title>Oxytocin Suppresses Substance Use Disorders Associated With Chronic Stress</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine whether intra-nasally administered oxytocin will decrease craving to use alcohol and stress reactivity following exposure to laboratory-induced stress among Active Duty Service Members (AD SMs) with a dual diagnosis of alcohol use disorder and post-traumatic anxiety (i.e., PTSD or anxiety disorder NOS). This is a 2-arm placebo controlled study. Subjects will complete a battery of self-report questionnaires and behavioral interviews. Baseline assessments of subjective (craving, stress), physiologic (HR, BP), and neuroendocrine measures (salivary cortisol) will be collected. These same assessments will be repeatedly collected throughout the testing portion of the study. Subjects will receive acute administration of intra-nasal oxytocin or placebo and will then be exposed to a laboratory-induced social stressor. They will be asked to give a short speech and perform arithmetic in front of a panel of judges. Following the task, additional post-task assessments of the subjective, physiological, and neuroendocrine measures will be completed over the next hour.</detailed_description>
