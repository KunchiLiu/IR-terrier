	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if a combination of two drugs (bimatoprost and timolol) delivered to the surface of the eye over 10 weeks is better at lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) than either of the drugs delivered alone.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Written informed consent At least 18 years of age Diagnosis in both eyes of either primary openangle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension Best correcteddistance visual acuity score equivalent to 20/80 or better Stable visual field Central corneal thickness between 490 620 micrometers Inclusion Criteria at the Randomization Visit: IOP for each eye is ≥ 23 mmHg at T=0hr, ≥ 20 mmHg at T=4hr and T=8hr. Intereye IOP difference of ≤ 5.0 mmHg at T=0hr, T=4hr and T=8hr. IOP for each eye is ≤ 30 mmHg at T=0hr, T=4hr and T=8hr. Key Any known contraindication to prostaglandin analog (latanoprost, travoprost, bimatoprost, tafluprost) or timolol A cardiac or pulmonary condition that in the opinion of the Investigator would contraindicate the use of a topical betablocker Use of any agents known to have a substantial effect on IOP during planned study period (e.g. betablockers) Cuptodisc ratio of greater than 0.8 Significant risk of angle closure due to pupil dilation, defined as a Shaffer classification of less than Grade 2 based on gonioscopy Ocular, orbital, and/or eyelid surgery of any type within the past six (6) months from screening date Laser surgery for glaucoma / ocular hypertension on one (1) or both eyes within the last six (6) months Past history of any incisional surgery for glaucoma at any time Past history of corneal refractive surgery Corneal abnormalities that would interfere with accurate IOP readings with an applanation tonometer Current participation in an investigational drug or device study or participation in such a study within 7 days of Screening Inability to adequately evaluate the retina Subjects who will require contact lens use during the study period. Subjects who currently have punctal occlusion Pregnant, lactating or of childbearing potential and not using a medically acceptable form of birth control</criteria>
