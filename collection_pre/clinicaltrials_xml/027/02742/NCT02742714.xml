	<brief_title>PillCam SBC System Functionality in Established and Suspected IBD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PillCam SBC system to be tested in this study, is a new system composed of capsule, Data recorder and a new software Pillcam Desktop Software (version 9.0). The main features of the SBC capsule are panoramic field of view and adaptive frame rate customized for complete coverage of both small bowel and colonic mucosa. Fifty established and suspected IBD patients (at least half of them with established crohn disease (CD)) with active or quiescent disease activity, aged 18 years and up, with no symptomatic stricture or known obstruction that would prevent capsule passage will be enrolled in up to 6 medical sites in Israel and Europe. Patients will undergo bowel prep, followed by a PillCam SBC capsule examination. Patency capsule may precede PillCam SBC ingestion according to physician discretion. The PillCam Software videos will be evaluated by local site reader following a Subjective Assessment Form fulfillment.</detailed_description>
