	<brief_summary>Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate if direct removal of the urine catheter after an laparoscopic hysterectomy (total laparoscopic hysterectomy and laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy) is associated with similar (or better) outcomes compared to delayed catheter removal after surgery, which is the current treatment. In addition, we want to investigate patient's experience on this subject. Study design: Randomized Controlled trial, non-inferiority study. Study population: Women older than 18 years old, who are a laparoscopic hysterectomy for benign indication or low-grade malignancy. Intervention: - Group A (treatment group): the patients in this group will have their catheter directly removed in the OR after LH. - Group B (control group): the patients in the control group will have their catheter removed according to the regular protocol of the hospital (at least 6 hours in place).</brief_summary>
