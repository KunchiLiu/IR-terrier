	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if a mobile sensing platform can passively and objectively detect the presence of clinically significant mood disorder symptomatology and symptom progression over time. Meeting this goal will allow for improved risk categorization, prediction of relapse, and measurement of disease progression in a lifetime prevalence population.</brief_summary>
