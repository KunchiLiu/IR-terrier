Subject has used any systemic methotrexate, retinoids, systemic corticosteroids [including intralesional, intraarticular, and intramuscular corticosteroids], cyclosporine or analogous products within 90 days prior to the Baseline Visit. 6. Subject has used any systemic biologic therapy (i.e., FDAapproved or experimental therapy) within five (5) halflives of the biologic prior to the Baseline Visit. Published or documented halflife of the product provided by the commercial supplier or Sponsor should be used to establish this value. 7. Subject had prolonged exposure to natural or artificial sources of ultraviolet radiation within 30 days prior to the Baseline Visit or is intending to have such exposure during the study which in the opinion of the investigator is thought to modify the subject's disease. 8. Subject has used topical body (excluding the scalp) psoriasis therapy (including coal tar, anthralin, steroids, retinoids and vitamin D analogs) within 14 days prior to the Baseline Visit. 9.

Subject is currently using lithium or Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine). 11. Subject is currently using a betablocking medication (e.g., propranolol) or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor at a dose that has not been stabilized, in the opinion of the investigator. 12. Subject has a history of sensitivity to any of the ingredients in the test articles. 13. Subject is pregnant, lactating, or is planning to become pregnant during the study. 14. Subject is currently enrolled in an investigational drug or device study. 15.
