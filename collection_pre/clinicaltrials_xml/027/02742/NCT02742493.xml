	<brief_summary>The present study aims to assess the effectiveness of three different retention schemes used to maintain tooth position after orthodontic treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances (stability) and to evaluate possible association between retention scheme and gingival recessions on the lingual surfaces of the lower anterior teeth seen for up to 5 years post-treatment. Moreover the possible association between primary relapse tendency and long term occlusal stability will be evaluated.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, controlled, single-center, equivalence trial with three parallel groups and an allocation ratio of 1:1:1, that aims to investigate the effectiveness of 3 orthodontic retention schemes on post-treatment mandibular arch stability and gingival recession.</detailed_description>
