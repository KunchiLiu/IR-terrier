	<brief_summary>Exposure to music improves cognitive function in 'healthy' participants and in brain-damaged patients. However, it is still difficult to understand what precisely in music causes a positive effect : are they emotional components, familiarity or preference which improve cognition or is there any specific effect of music? Moreover, it is not yet possible to characterize the neural and functional links between the brain systems solicited by music and those associated with other cognitive functions enhanced by music. Finally, researches on brain-damaged patients have not exploited the potential effect of music on the level of alert and perceptual awareness, while this type of stimulation could be a valuable tool to improve cognition in patients with a disturbance of consciousness and alertness. The main objective is to describe the impact of music on the brain's response to self-referential or neutral stimuli in brain-damaged patients with persistent consciousness disorder after a coma and in healthy participants.</brief_summary>
