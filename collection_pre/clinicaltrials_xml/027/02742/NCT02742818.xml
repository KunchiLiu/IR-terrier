	<brief_title>Forced-air Warming in Endovascular Surgery: Testing Effectiveness of Two Different Blanket Models</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fifty patients undergoing LEA and EVAR will be randomized into two groups: Group upper body blanket and Group underbody blanket. All patients will receive general anesthesia and body temperature will be measured with esophageal thermometer with 15 minutes interval beginning immediately after tracheal intubation up to tracheal extubation. The warming unit used (Bair Hugger 750 warming unit, Arizant Healthcare) will be the same for both groups and the blankets tested will be: upper body blanket (Bair Hugger 522 upper body blanket, 3M) and underbody blanket (Bair Hugger 635 full acess underbody blanket, 3M). Surgical and anesthetic complications will be noted. Only surgeries with minimum 45 minutes duration will be accepted for the purposes of this study.</detailed_description>
