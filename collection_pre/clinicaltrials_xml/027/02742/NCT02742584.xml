	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized comparative study in which patients are randomized to one of four different bladder volumes and a Cough Stress Test (CST) is performed in both the standing and sitting positions. The goal is to assess the agreement of each CST method with both urodynamics diagnosis of Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) and the 24-hour pad test. The primary outcome is to determine what CST method best correlated with either test in the diagnosis of SUI.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This multicenter, prospective randomized study is approved by the Institutional Review Boards at both the University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Cleveland, OH, USA and MetroHealth Hospital, Cleveland, OH, USA (Identifiers 07-11-37 and FWA00003938, respectively). Adult women who presented to the Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery (FPMRS) outpatient clinics at both the University Hospitals Case Medical Center and MetroHealth Hospital with symptoms of stress, urge, or mixed urinary incontinence and who were recommended by the evaluating staff to undergo urodynamic studies (UDS) are eligible. The staff physician will approach the patient for participation in this study after the standard clinic visit is completed and the initial diagnosis is made. A research coordinator will then explain the study and obtain informed consent if the patient agrees to participate. The patient will then be given instructions for a 24 hour pad test and standardized pads to use. The patient will also be given instructions for a three day voiding diary along with routine instruction regarding the urodynamic procedure. The patient will be asked to perform the 24 hour pad test the day prior to the UDS appointment. The three day voiding diary will be performed during a typical and sequential three day period during the week prior to the UDS. Patients will then asked to bring these items to the UDS appointment. During the initial appointment with the study coordinator, patients will be randomized to 4 groups (A, B, C, and D). Patients in group A will be scheduled to undergo Cough Stress Test (CST) with a comfortably full bladder. This will be subjectively reported by the patient. Patients in group B will be scheduled to undergo CST with an empty bladder after straight catheterization. Group C patients will be scheduled to undergo CST with a bladder infused with 200 cc of saline. Patients in group D will be scheduled to undergo CST with the bladder filled to half functional capacity as determined from the largest voided volume recorded in the patient's voiding diary. CST will be performed in the standing and sitting position for each patient in each of the above groups. The sequence of performing the standing and sitting CST will be randomly assigned for each patient.</detailed_description>
