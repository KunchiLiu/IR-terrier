	<detailed_description>Sinus conversion by electrical cardioversion increase cardiac output and systemic perfusion. According to recent reports, maintenance of sinus rhythm increase systemic perfusion which leads to improve renal function. Therefore, we hypothesized that sinus conversion of patients with atrial fibrillation will increase systemic perfusion which might improve the erectile dysfunction and cognitive dysfunction.</detailed_description>
