	<brief_summary>This study is a phase I, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind (sponsor unblind), three part study. The primary objective of the study is to characterize the safety, and tolerability of GSK3008356 single dose, 14 daily repeat doses in healthy subjects and 28 daily repeat doses in obese subjects. The study has three parts. Part 1, will be a single and multiple-dose, dose-rising study in healthy subjects. Part 2, will be a 14-day, repeat-dose, dose-rising study in healthy subjects, and part 3 will be a 28-day, repeat-dose study in obese subjects. For Parts 1 and 2, data from prior doses cohorts will be available prior to escalation decisions. Data from Parts 1 and 2 will be available prior to initiation of the three parallel cohorts in Part 3. A dose escalation meeting will be held to review these data and document the decision to proceed as planned or make any alterations in dosing, if indicated. Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3 study will have approximately 88, 24 and 30 subjects, respectively.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. For Part 1 and Part 2: Healthy as determined by the investigator or medically qualified designee based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. For Part 3: Obese subjects may have chronic disease not specifically excluded and not requiring chronic medication for treatment and are otherwise healthy as determined by the investigator or medically qualified designee based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s) which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor agree and document that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. Body weight &gt;=50 kilograms (kg) For Part 1 and Part 2 body mass index (BMI) 1925 kilogram per meter square (inclusive) For Part 3 BMI &gt;=30 kilogram per meter square Males or Females of nonchildbearing potential as follows: Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential must comply with the following contraception requirements from the time of first dose of study medication until at least five halflives of study medication after the last dose of study medication. 1. Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia. 2. Male condom plus partner use of one of the following contraceptive options: Contraceptive subdermal implant; Intrauterine device or intrauterine system; Oral Contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone; Injectable progestogen; Contraceptive vaginal ring; Percutaneous contraceptive patches Males or Females of nonchildbearing potential as follows: A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative serum human chorionic gonadotrophin [hCG] test), not lactating, and the following condition applies: Nonreproductive potential defined as: Premenopausal females with one of the following: Documented tubal ligation; Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with followup confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion; Hysterectomy; Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy. Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 milliinternational units per milliliter (MlU/ml) and estradiol &lt; 40 picograms (pg) per ml (&lt;147 picomoles per liter (pmol/L) is confirmatory. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will not be allowed. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception. Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and in this protocol. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin &gt;1.5 times upper limit of normal (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5 times upper limit of normal is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%). Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones) QTcF &gt;450 millisecond (msec) Current or chronic history of gastrointestinal illness or conditions interfering with normal gastrointestinal anatomy or motility. Examples include gastrointestinal bypass surgery, cholecystectomy, partial or total gastrectomy, small bowel resection, vagotomy, malabsorption, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or celiac sprue. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study drug, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety. By exception, subject may take acetaminophen (&lt;=2 grams per day) up to 48 hours prior to the first dose of study drug. Subjects should refrain from consumption of red wine, Seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice and/or pummelos, exotic citrus fruits, grapefruit hybrids or fruit juices from 7 days prior to the first dose of study medication until after the final dose. History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as an average weekly intake of &gt;14 standard drinks. One standard drink is equivalent to 10 grams of alcohol: 285 milliliter (mL) of beer, 100 mL of wine or 30 mL of 40% alcohol by volume distilled spirits. For Part 1 and Part 2, urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking or history or regular use of tobacco or nicotinecontaining products within 3 months prior to screening. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), positive hepatitis C antibody test result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment. For potent immunosuppressive agents, subjects with presence of hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) should also be excluded. A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen. A positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products in excess of 750 mL within 90 day period. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer). Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day.</criteria>
