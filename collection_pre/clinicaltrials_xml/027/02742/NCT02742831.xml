	<brief_title>A Pilot Intervention With Families of Children With Special Health Care Needs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot randomized controlled trial will be conducted with 60 caregivers of children with special health care needs who have been reported to the child protection team at Boston Medical Center with concern for neglect that was ultimately not substantiated. Half of the subjects will be randomly assigned to receive the 6-session, one-on-one, in-person, behavioral intervention focused on problem solving, emotional regulation, and distress tolerance. The other half will be randomly assigned to the control group and will receive periodic check-ins and referrals to community resources as needed. Both groups will be followed for 12 months after randomization. Children who have previously experienced neglect, or other forms of maltreatment, will not included in the study. Children will be defined as having special health care needs if they have a chronic physical, emotional, or behavioral condition. With this pilot, the investigators aim to field-test study mechanics, including enrollment, randomization, and the collection of baseline and follow-up data; and obtain empiric estimates of study parameters to inform a subsequent fully-powered randomized controlled trial.</detailed_description>
