	<brief_title>Efficacy and Mechanisms of CBT4CBT for Alcohol Use Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evaluate the efficacy of CBT4CBT and clinician-delivered CBT relative to standard treatment for reducing alcohol use through an 8-week randomized trial with 6-month follow-up. Our primary hypothesis is that either form of CBT will be more effective than standard treatment at increasing the percentage of days abstinent during treatment (8 weeks) and through the follow-up (6 months), assessed via Timeline FollowBack interviews.</detailed_description>

Individuals will be excluded who: Have an untreated bipolar or schizophrenic disorder, Have a current legal case pending such that incarceration during the 8week protocol is likely, Have been prescribed an alcohol pharmacotherapy (e.g., disulfiram, naltrexone) within the past two weeks, or Are physically dependent on alcohol, opioids or benzodiazepenes such that immediate medical detoxification is necessary for safety purposes (individuals demonstrating significant withdrawal symptoms would be eligible for rescreening following brief medical detoxification, which is arranged by RCS staff at triage).</criteria>
