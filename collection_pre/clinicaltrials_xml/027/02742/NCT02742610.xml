	<brief_summary>This study aims to develop a Mindfulness Smartphone Intervention with Contingency Management (MSI-CM) for smoking cessation that can be readily available to depressed smokers receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment. This project is expected to result in the development of an effective intervention that will produce preliminary data showing increased short-term cessation success in depressed smokers receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment. It is anticipated that this smoking cessation intervention will have potential for broad reach to outpatient psychiatric treatment programs and have a significant overall impact in reducing smoking-related morbidity and mortality by enhancing smoking cessation rates in at-risk populations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Smoking Cessation Intervention for Smokers With Depression Receiving Outpatient Psychiatric Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study will develop a Mindfulness Smartphone Intervention with Contingency Management (MSI-CM) for smoking cessation that can be readily available to depressed smokers receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment. The intervention will involve a series of brief mindfulness training that will be delivered via smartphone, that prompts patients to practice a mindfulness exercise multiple times a day while abstinent: 1) 10-days prior to their target quit date and 2) during the 2-week incentivized abstinence period (using CM) plus an additional 2 weeks (without CM) following their target quit date. We will use CM as an adjunct strategy to enhance the efficacy of mindfulness training due to its utility in producing short-term abstinence, so as to provide opportunities to practice mindfulness without smoking in one's natural environment. We will accomplish this objective by pursuing the following specific aims (in 2 phases): Phase 1: To develop the MSI-CM intervention intended to improve smoking cessation success among depressed smokers receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment. 1a. We will collaborate with TelASK, Inc. to develop a prototype of a smartphone intervention (MSI-CM). 1b. We will conduct preliminary pilot testing of MSI-CM, in an iterative fashion, with 10 smokers receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment for depression. Phase 2: To conduct a preliminary, randomized controlled trial (RCT) with depressed 60 smokers receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment.</detailed_description>
