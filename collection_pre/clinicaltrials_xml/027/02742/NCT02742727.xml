	<criteria>Male and female subjects with CD7+ malignancies in patients with no available curative treatment options who have limited prognosis (several months to &lt; 2 year survival) with currently available therapies will be enrolled: 1. Eligible diseases: CD7 positive relapsed or refractory Leukemia and Lymphoma. ￚ Acute myeloid leukemia, previously identified as CD7+ ￚ Precursor T lymphoblast leukemia/lymphoma ￚ Tcell prolymphocytic leukemia ￚ Tcell large granular lymphocytic leukemia ￚ Peripheral Tcell lymphoma, NOS ￚ Angioimmunoblastic Tcell lymphoma ￚ Extranodal NK/Tcell lymphoma, nasal type ￚ Enteropathytype intestinal Tcell lymphoma ￚ Hepatosplenic Tcell lymphoma 2. Patients 18 years of age or older, and must have a life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks. 3. CD7 is expressed in malignancy tissues by immunohistochemical (IHC) or Flow cytometry. 4. Assessable disease as measured by laboratory and bone marrow examinations. 5. Eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status of 02 or karnofsky performance status (KPS) score is higher than 60. 6. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and all subjects must agree to use an effective method of contraception for up to two weeks after the last infusion of CARpNK cells. 7. Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function as assessed by the following laboratory requirements: serum creatinine ≤ 2.5mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 5×upper limit of normal, serum total bilirubin ≤ 2.0mg/dL. These tests must be conducted within 7 days prior to registration. 8. Ability to give informed consent. 1. Patients with symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) involvement. 2. Pregnant or nursing women may not participate. 3. Known HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. 4. Serious illness or medical condition which would not permit the patient to be managed according to the protocol, including active uncontrolled infection, major cardiovascular, coagulation disorders, respiratory or immune system, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, obstructive/restrictive pulmonary disease, or psychiatric or emotional disorders. 5. Concurrent use of systemic steroids. Recent or current use of inhaled steroids is not exclusionary. 6. Previously treatment with any gene therapy products. 7. The existence of unstable or active ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding. 8. Patients with a history of organ transplantation or are waiting for organ transplantation. 9. Patients need anticoagulant therapy (such as warfarin or heparin). 10. Patients need longterm antiplatelet therapy (aspirin at a dose &gt; 300mg/d; clopidogrel at a dose &gt; 75mg/d).</criteria>
