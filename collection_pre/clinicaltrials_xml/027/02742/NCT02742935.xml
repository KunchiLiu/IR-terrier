	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, single center, non-randomized, dose escalation phase I trial to evaluate safety and tolerability of SHR-1210 in patients with advanced solid tumors. The primary objective is to assess safety and tolerability of SHR-1210 and identify recommended phase II doses of SHR-1210 in patients with advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of Using the SHR-1210 by Advanced Solid Tumor Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, single center, nonrandomized, dose-escalation Phase 1 study to evaluate safety and tolerability of SHR-1210 in subjects with advanced Solid Tumors who have failed current standard antitumor therapies. The safety and tolerability of SHR-1210 will be assessed by ongoing reviews of clinical laboratory tests, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and adverse events. Evaluations of immune safety will also be conducted (immune-related AEs, or labs of autoimmune sera, inflammatory events, and immunogenicity). Safety evaluations (both clinical and laboratory) are performed at baseline, before each study treatment, and throughout the study. Efficacy will be assessed every 8 weeks. The study consists of 3 periods: screening (up to 14 days before the first dose), treatment, and follow-up (up to 3 months after the last dose of study treatment).</detailed_description>
