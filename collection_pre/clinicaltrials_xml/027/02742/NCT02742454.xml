	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether providing ventilatory assistance prior to umbilical cord clamping influences the occurrence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in extremely preterm (EPT) infants, compared to standard care of providing ventilatory assistance after cord clamping.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VentFirst: A Multicenter RCT of Assisted Ventilation During Delayed Cord Clamping for Extremely Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>940 newborns with gestation 23 wks 0 days through 28 wks 6 days Randomized to Standard arm (delayed cord clamping for 30 seconds, or up to 60 seconds if breathing spontaneously) or VentFirst arm (receive CPAP or PPV from 30 sec to 120 sec). Primary outcome is lack of IVH on 7-10 day head ultrasound.</detailed_description>
