	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the clinical profile of topical-ocular MGV354 merits further development for the indication of lowering intraocular pressure (IOP).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Three Part Study of MGV354 in Ocular Hypertension or Glaucoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part 1 will evaluate the safety and tolerability of single ascending doses of MGV354 compared to placebo in healthy male and female subjects. Part 2 will evaluate the safety and tolerability of MGV354 in a multiple ascending dose design (two highest tolerated doses from Part 1) compared to placebo when administered for 7 days to patients with ocular hypertension or glaucoma. Part 3 will explore the safety, tolerability and efficacy of a single dose level of MGV354 (maximum tolerated dose) compared to placebo when administered for 7 days in patients with ocular hypertension or glaucoma.</detailed_description>
