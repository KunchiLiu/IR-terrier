	<brief_title>A Dose Escalation Study of SDX-7320 in Patients With Advanced Refractory or Late-Stage Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1 dose escalation study to assess the safety and tolerability of subcutaneously administered SDX-7320 in patients with advanced refractory or late-stage solid tumors. Once the MTD has been determined up to 12 patients will be treated at this dose level, to further characterize treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients have at least one site of radiographically measurable disease. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status ≤1. Adequate renal and liver functions. Life expectancy ≥3 months. Patients that have undergone organ transplant surgery. The patient has a known history of Hepatitis A, B, or C and is on active antiviral therapy. History of gastric bypass surgery or banding procedure. Uncontrolled or refractory hypertension: systolic &gt;180 or diastolic &gt;110, or hypotension: systolic &lt;90 or diastolic &lt;50 despite medical treatment. Participation in any other trial of an investigational agent within 30 days prior to enrollment. The resting 12lead electrocardiogram obtained during screening shows QTc (Bazett's correction) ≥470 ms or has a congenital prolonged QT syndrome.</criteria>
