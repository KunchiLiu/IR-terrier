	<brief_summary>Berries have been shown to improve postprandial glucose and insulin responses to sucrose. During processing and storage of berry products, sucrose is inverted to glucose and fructose. The effects of berries on the glycemic response induced by inverted sugar are not known. The purpose of this study is to determine whether berries are effective in lowering the postprandial glucose and insulin responses induced by inverted sugar.</brief_summary>
