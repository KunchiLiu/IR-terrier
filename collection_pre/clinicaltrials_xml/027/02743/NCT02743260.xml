	<brief_summary>The objective of the present study is to contribute to establishing in vivo phenotyping procedures for organic anionic transporter polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), organic cation transporters 1 and 2 (OCT1/2), multidrug and toxic compound extrusion transporters 1 and 2,kidney splice variant (MATE1/2K), organic anion transporters 1 and 3 (OAT1/3), and p-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporters via a cocktail approach. To this end, marker substrates for each of the respective transporters are administered as single doses in one period each and as a cocktail in one period to 24 healthy volunteers, and phenotyping metrics are derived from plasma and urine concentrations.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Blood sampling: - 0:15 h pre-dose, 0:15, 0:30, 0:45, 1:00, 1:20, 1:40, 2:00, 2:20, 2:40, 3:00, 3:30, 4:00, 5:00, 6:00, 8:00, 12:00, 16:00, 24:00 hours post-dose Urine Sampling: Pre-dose, 0-4 hours, 4-8 hours, 8-12 hours, 12-16 hours, 16-24 hours Drug analysis: by liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) Pharmacokinetic Characteristics: Evaluation is carried out using standard noncompartmental characteristics including: area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve truncated at time t (AUC0-t), area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-∞), peak plasma concentration (Cmax), time of occurrence of Cmax (tmax), apparent elimination half-life (t½), clearance over bioavailability (CL/F), renal clearance (CLr) and renal secretion. The evaluation may be completed by compartmental population pharmacokinetic approaches. Statistical evaluation: Pharmacokinetic characteristics are compared for cocktail administration vs. individual administration by standard average bioequivalence assessment. Safety, tolerability: Adverse events, laboratory and clinical parameters and vital signs will be assessed.</detailed_description>
