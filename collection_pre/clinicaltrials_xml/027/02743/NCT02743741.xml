	<brief_summary>This is a prospective single arm, multicenter study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lutetium-177 Octreotate in patients with neuroendocrine tumors who has positive Somatostatin receptor identified by 68Ga-DOTATATE. 195 patients will be enrolled totally. Patient who has progressed with neuroendocrine tumor will be evaluated by the tumor board first and eligible patients will undergo diagnostic Ga 68 PET scan. Patients who showed Somatostatin will undergo 4 cycles of Lu-DOTATATE treatment. Dose adjustment for Cycle 2-4 will be made based on individualized dosimetry, as well as creatinine clearance and hematological parameters. Patients will be evaluated progression free survival at 12 months from last dose. Patients who are negative for somatostatin will not receive 68Ga-DOTATATE treatment but will be followed until progression and acts as control group.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Biopsyproven neuroendocrine tumor 2. ECOG performance status ≤ 2 3. Ki67 index ≤ 30% 4. Evidence of progressive disease demonstrated by imaging within six months prior to study enrollment as defined by RECIST v1.1. Patients with objective evidence (imaging, or biochemical) that is insufficient to be classified by RECIST 1.1 criteria can be eligible if after provincial multidisciplinary tumor board discussion a consensus for progression eligibility is reached. The tumor board would consider exemptions based on clinical and radiological factors. 5. Adequate lab parameters within 2 weeks of enrollment: Serum creatinine ≤ 150 µmol/L GFR ≥30 mL/min Haemoglobin ≥ 90 g/L WBC ≥ 2 x 10^9/L platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L 6. Adequate liver function tests within 2 weeks of enrollment: total bilirubin ≤ 5 x ULN ALT ≤ 5 x ULN AST ≤ 5 x ULN alkaline phosphatase) ≤ 5 x ULN 7. Signed informed consent 8. Patients with extensive bone metastases (e.g. &gt;25% of bone marrow involvement are eligible but requires careful monitoring of hematological reserve 9. Subject's willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory tests, and other study procedures. 1. Life expectancy &lt;12 weeks 2. An option for curative surgical or medical therapy or local liver embolization is feasible 3. Candidate for curative and/or debulking surgical resections 4. Systemic, biologic, other radioisotope, embolization therapies within ≤12 weeks prior to study enrollment. [long acting somatostatin analogs such as octreotide LAR® are eligible but must be switched to short acting when patient is confirmed in the diagnostic phase to be eligible for 177Lu and withheld prior to the administration of 177Lu]. Somatostatin analog is to be withheld at least 24 hours prior to radiopharmaceutical administration. It may be resumed 7 days after. 5. Prior radiotherapy to target lesion(s) within ≤12 weeks prior to study enrollment [radiotherapy to nontarget lesions permitted]. 6. Prior radiotherapy to more than 25% of the bone marrow. 7. Known brain metastases (unless metastases have been treated and are stable for ≥ 6 months). 8. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (fasting glucose &gt;12 mmol/L). 9. Comorbidities that may interfere with delivery of 177Lu (e.g. urinary incontinence). 10. Secondary active cancer(s) with clinical or biochemical progression within the last 3 years. 11. Pregnancy or breast feeding. Female subjects must be surgically sterile or postmenopausal, or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of therapy. All female subjects with reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum) prior to enrolment. Male subjects must be surgically sterile or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of therapy. The definition of effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the principal investigator or a designated associate 12. Other condition, illness, psychiatric condition, or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation, 68Ga or 177Lu administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and in the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.</criteria>
