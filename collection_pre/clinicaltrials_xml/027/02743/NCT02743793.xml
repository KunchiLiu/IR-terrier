	<brief_summary>Antirejection medicines, also known as immunosuppressive drugs, are prescribed to organ transplant recipients to prevent their bodies from rejecting the new organ. Some organ transplant recipients can stop taking anti-rejection medicines without rejecting their transplanted organ (this is called 'tolerance'). The purpose of this study will collect samples and data from 'tolerant' liver or kidney transplant recipients in order to find out: The purpose of this study is to collect samples and data in order to find out: - How long liver or kidney transplant recipients can remain tolerant; - What happens in the tolerant recipient's body over time; and - If there are patterns in the body that are linked to tolerance.</brief_summary>

Normal allograft function, defined respectively as: 1. liver function tests (ALT, GGT) for liver transplant recipients, 2. serum creatinine for kidney transplant recipients, below the upper limit of normal (ULN) as defined by ranges from Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 18th edition.
