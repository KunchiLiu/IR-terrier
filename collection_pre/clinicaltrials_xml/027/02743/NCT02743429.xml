	<brief_summary>In this trial, monoclonal anti-Disialoganglioside GD2 (GD2) antibody ch14.18/CHO will be assessed for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma. The antibody is used as a single agent applied in a new treatment schedule associated with less side effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Monoclonal Antibody ch14.18/CHO Continuous Infusion in Patients With Primary Refractory or Relapsed Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Treatment with ch14.18 antibody has demonstrated efficacy in patients with neuroblastoma. However the treatment is associated with an on target side effect, i.e. neuropathic pain. This requires coadministration of intravenous morphine. In this clinical Trial we will evaluate a less toxic treatment regimen consisting of continuous longterm Infusion (LTI) of ch14.18/CHO administered at a dose of 10 mg/m2/day over 10 days (total dose 100 mg/m2/cycle). Patients may receive up to five 35-day cycles in absence of signs of progression.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Primary refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma. Tumour burden controlled by conventional therapy (except patients with early minimal bone marrow relapse). Measurable and/or evaluable disease in any of the following sites (skeletal lesions, soft tissue lesions, lymph nodes and/or primary tumour site and/or bone marrow) as measured by mIBG scan, CT, MRI and/or immunocytology. Patients should have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. Progressive disease at the time of inclusion into the study. ADA positivity due to previous treatment with an antiGD2 antibody (e.g. ch14.18/Mouse myeloma cell line SP2/0 (SP2/0), ch14.18/CHO).</criteria>
