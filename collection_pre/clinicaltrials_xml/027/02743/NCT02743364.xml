	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well simvastatin works in reducing pancreatitis (the inflammation of the pancreas) in patients with pancreatitis that occurs more than once (recurrent), has worsened quickly (acute), or has persisted or progressed over a long period of time (chronic). Simvastatin may decrease the inflammation of the pancreas by modulating the immune response responsible for inflammation. It is not yet known if simvastatin may be an effective treatment for pancreatitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Simvastatin in Reducing Pancreatitis in Patients With Recurrent, Acute or Chronic Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the effect of a simvastatin intervention versus placebo on the change in secretin-stimulated peak bicarbonate concentration in the pancreatic fluid at 6 months post-treatment in patients hospitalized for acute or chronic pancreatitis, with a prior history of one or more episodes of acute pancreatitis. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Change in the endoscopic ultrasound score (EUS). II. Change in fecal elastase. III. Change in serum and pancreatic fluid levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), and soluble (s)-fractalkine. IV. Change in pancreatic fluid levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, e-cadherin and vimentin. V. Change in pancreatitis-related readmissions. VI. Change in Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) gene mutations in pancreatic fluid. VII. Change in quality of life score as measured by the quality of life questionnaire core 30 (QLQ-C30) and quality of life questionnaire pancreatic modification (QLQ-PAN28) chronic pancreatitis (CP). OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Patients receive simvastatin orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 6 months. ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 6 months. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60, and 90 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Recurrent pancreatitis (at least two episodes of acute pancreatitis in the past 12 months) confirmed by any 2 of the following: (1) typical upper abdominal pain; (2) elevation in serum amylase or lipase &gt;= 3 times upper limit of normal; (3) features of acute pancreatitis on crosssectional imaging Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 1 (Karnofsky &gt;= 70%) Leukocytes &gt;= 2,500/microliter Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/microliter Platelets &gt;= 100,000/microliter Hemoglobin within normal institutional limits Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =&lt; 1.5 × institutional ULN; patients whose AST/ALT levels normalize by screen 2 after an abnormal test will be included in the trial Creatinine within normal institutional limits Women of childbearing potential must have a confirmed negative pregnancy test result prior to enrollment Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her study physician immediately; women who receive treatment with simvastatin should not breastfeed their infants Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document and medical release Willing and able to comply with trial protocol and followup Prior or current use of statin medication, or current use of gemfibrozil, cyclosporine, danazol, lomitapide, verapamil, diltiazem, dronedarone, amiodarone, amlodipine, ranolazine, or strong cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] protease inhibitors, boceprevir, telaprevir, erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin, nefazodone, or cobicistatcontaining products) History of chronic myopathy Current use of any other investigational agents History of adverse effects, intolerance, or allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to simvastatin (i.e., other statin medications) Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding Presence of gallstones and hypertriglyceridemia (level greater than 800 mg/dl) that requires medical or surgical intervention; note: we will include patients who had an independent episode of pancreatitis after a cholecystectomy, but exclude patients who are candidates for cholecystectomy History of active malignancy (excluding basal/squamous cell skin cancer) Known active infection with HIV Concurrent illness, such as known psychiatric disorders or substance abuse (i.e., average alcohol consumption of more than 3 drinks per day), which in the opinion of the investigators would compromise either the patient or the integrity of the data Abnormal liver function tests at screen 2 (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] or aspartate aminotransferase [AST] &gt; 1.5 institutional upper limit of normal [ULN]) Recurrent pancreatitis episode is iatrogenic (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP] induced)</criteria>
