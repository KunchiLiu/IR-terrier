	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if five simple adaptations in airway management of patients undergoing general anaesthesia can reduce minor and major airway complications. After a first detection of causes of airway complications during general anaesthesia investigators initiated five different interventions in airway management, which were: immediate bag-valve mask ventilation after administering of muscle relaxants, optimized preoxygenation, introducing of a preinterventional checklist, increased usage of video laryngoscopy and immediate change of provider in case of failed intubation. In a second phase of this observational study investigators want to evaluate if these five interventions can reduce minor and major airway complications during general anaesthesia. Additionally, investigators want to record how many critical incidents (CIRS) occur during this observational period and how many of them will be reported by the involved stuff.</brief_summary>
