	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate patients with relapsed or refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or advanced hypomethylating agent-resistant myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who will have autologous immune cells, called T cells, collected via apheresis. The T cells will be reinfused according to a dose-finding schedule after the patient has been identified as having adequate lymphopenia to provide for homeostatic expansion of the adoptively transferred, engineered T cell therapeutic product. As a safety measure, these T cells have been programmed with a self-destruct switch so that they can be destroyed if they start to react against tissues (Graft versus host disease).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Finding Study Evaluating Safety and Feasibility in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Myeloid Neoplasms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single arm, dose escalation/ de-escalation, single US center, unblinded, phase 1 study. Its main goal is to determine the safety and tolerability of the autologous genetically modified T cell (BPX-701) in subjects with relapsed or refractory AML or advanced hypomethylating agent-resistant MDS. Rimiducid (AP1903) will be administrated treat uncontrolled BPX-701 toxicity, such as Cytokine Release Syndrome or severe off-tumor/on-target toxicities.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Acute leukemia: Patients with refractory or relapsed AML, other than acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Patients with a monosomal or complex karyotype may enroll at the time of day 14 biopsy after induction chemotherapy, if residual disease is identified. Patients must express HLAA2.01 and myeloid blasts must express PRAME. Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) &gt; 300/mm^3 or cluster of differentiation (CD)3+ &gt;150 cells/ mm^3. Patients who have relapsed and are greater than 100 days after a stem cell transplant are eligible unless they have active GVHD requiring systemic immunosuppressive therapy, defined as a need for &gt; 10 mg prednisone or equivalent/day and active use of a calcineurin inhibitor. Relapsed or refractory AML or MDS. AML patients must have &gt; 5% bone marrow blasts at study entry, without alternative causality (e.g. bone marrow regeneration). a. Relapsed or refractory AML according to the Modified International Working Group Criteria for AML. 1. Relapsed: Bone marrow blasts ≥5 percent; or reappearance of blasts in the blood 2. Refractory: Failure to achieve complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) after induction chemotherapy MDS patients: 1. High Grade MDS (RAEB2) with 1019% blasts, not responding to hypomethylation therapy or 2. RAEB1 or RAEB2 MDS recurrence after initial response. Age ≥ 18 years. Life expectancy of at least 2 months. Karnofsky performance status: &gt; 60%. Informed consent has been obtained Patients who have come off previous cancer therapy for at least 14 days for prior cytotoxic agents, and prior to D0, except when hydroxyurea is given only when needed to control hyperleukocytosis. Persistent clinically significant toxicities from prior chemotherapy must not be greater than Grade 1 (CTCAE 4.03) at the time of enrollment. Salvage/lymphodepleting chemotherapeutic agents may be given up to 3 days prior to T cell reinfusion if necessary to control rapidly growing disease. Able to meet local institutional criteria for T cell apheresis collection. Renal function: 1. All patients must have a calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/min according to CockcroftGault Equation. 2. Routine urinalysis must show no clinically significant abnormalities. Subject has adequate organ function as measured by: i. Adequate LFTs: Total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 x the institutional upper normal limits (ULN) with direct bilirubin &lt; 1.6 x ULN. ii. Alanine transaminase (ALT)/aspartate transaminase (AST) and Alkaline Phosphatase ≤ 5 x ULN. iii. Cardiac: left ventricular ejection fraction at rest must be ≥ 40%. iv. Pulmonary: forced expiratory volume (FEV) 1, forced vital capacity (FVC), carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) ≥ 50% predicted (corrected for hemoglobin). Acceptable coagulation status: International normalized Ratio (INR)/ Prothrombin Time (PT) ≤ 1.5 times ULN. Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &lt; 1.5 times ULN. For fertile men and women, agreement to use effective contraceptive methods during the study and for 3 months after administration of BPX701. Patients who have any of the following are not eligible for enrollment (initiation of BPX701 infusion) in this study: Inadequate lymphocyte count for collection. Bovine product allergy. History of prior malignancy other than: i) those associated with the current disease, ii) previously treated with a curative intent therapy less than 1 year ago and except superficial skin cancers. Participation in any investigational drug study &lt; 28 days prior to D0 (BPX701 infusion). Uncontrolled leptomeningeal leukemic disease. Uncontrolled disseminated intravascular coagulation. Other serious illness or medical conditions, which in the investigator's opinion could hamper patient's understanding of the study, compliance to study treatment, and/or safety or interpretation of study results. These conditions include (but are not restricted to): 1. Congestive heart failure or angina pectoris (New York Heart Association Class III or IV) except when it is medically controlled. Uncontrolled hypertension or malignant arrhythmias. 2. Presence of significant neurologic or psychiatric disorders impairing the ability to obtain consent. 3. Uncontrolled bacterial, viral or fungal infection. 4. Known HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) positivity or subject not meeting the selection criteria as defined for the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cell Therapy (FACT) and American Association of Blood Banks (AABB). Unwillingness or inability to comply with procedures required in this protocol.</criteria>
