	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to learn about arrhythmia detection in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). For several years patients with OSA have an increased likelihood of having irregular heartbeats. This study will determine how often patients with OSA have irregular heartbeats. This study will also define which OSA patients are most likely to have irregular heartbeats. The participant is being asked to be in the study because the participant has been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).</brief_summary>
