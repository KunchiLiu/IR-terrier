	<brief_summary>This study is being conducted to determine safety and effectiveness of transplanting kidneys from Hepatitis C-positive donors into Hepatitis C-negative patients on the kidney transplant waitlist, who will then be treated with Zepatier after the single kidney transplantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zepatier For Treatment Of Hepatitis C-Negative Patients Who Receive Kidney Transplants From Hepatitis C-Positive Donors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open-labelled pilot clinical trial of Zepatier (MK-5172 and MK-8742/Grazoprevir + Elbasvir) in 10 HCV-negative subjects with end-stage renal disease receiving a kidney transplant from a HCV-positive donor. Eligible subjects will receive a kidney transplant from a deceased-donor with genotype 1 HCV, and then will receive 12 weeks of Zepatier after kidney transplantation when infection with HCV is confirmed in these kidney transplant recipients. Treatment will be complete after 12 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Recipient On chronic hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis Listed for an isolated kidney transplant with ≤548 days of accrued transplant waiting time and/or ≤548 days of dialysis time No available living kidney donor Blood group A, B, or O Between 4065 years of age Have a panel reactive antibody level ≤97% Obtained agreement for participation from the patient's treating transplant nephrologist No evident contraindication to liver transplantation (Only subjects who would be eligible for a liver transplant if HCV caused them to experience liver failure will be enrolled in this study. To be deemed eligible for a liver transplant at Penn, all patients (not only study subjects) must have adequate cardiac function and must be examined by both a hepatologist and a liver transplant surgeon. These two requirements represent the major differences between evaluation processes for kidney and liver transplants. Able to travel to the University of Pennsylvania for routine posttransplant visits and study visits for a minimum of 6 months after transplantation Women must agree to use birth control in accordance with Mycophenolate Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) following transplant due to the increased risk of birth defects and/or miscarriage Both men and women must agree to use at least one barrier method to prevent any secretion exchange No active illicit substance abuse Weigh at least 50kg Inclusion criteria for treatment (not for entry as study patient) will include any detectable HCV RNA level Able to provide informed consent Hepatocellular carcinoma Patients with primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), FSGS recurring after previous transplant, or disease process with increased risk of causing early graft failure as assessed by the transplant nephrologist and/or the investigator team HIV positive HCV RNA positive (can be isolated HCV antibody positive provided the subject has no history of previously treated HCV) Hepatitis b surface antigen positive Any other chronic liver disease (excluding nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with abnormal liver enzymes Persistently elevated liver transaminases Blood group AB(due to short expected waiting time on the kidney transplant waiting list) Significant hepatic fibrosis on screening elastography (≥F2 fibrosis) Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women Known allergy or intolerance to tacrolimus that would require post transplant administration of cyclosporine, rather than tacrolimus given the drugdrug interaction between cyclosporine and Zepatier Waitlisted for a multiorgan transplant (e.g., pancreaskidney, heartkidney,etc.) Cardiomyopathy (e.g., leftventricular heart failure, pulmonary hypertension) that would preclude liver transplantation, as per the discretion of the transplant hepatologist (dg) and abdominal transplant surgeon who will evaluate the patient. Donor Organ Criteria Inclusion criteria: Detectable HCV RNA Genotype 1 HCV Age ≤60 years Kidney donor profile index (KDPI) score ≤0.856 Exclusion criteria: Diabetes mellitus I or II Anatomical issues in the kidney allograft that raise the risk of posttransplant complications (e.g. number or length of renal arteries or veins) Confirmed HIV positive Confirmed HBV positive (positive hepatitis B surface antigen and/or HBV DNA) Known previously failed treatment for HCV using a regimen with a directacting antiviral (can have received interferon monotherapy and/or interferon + ribavirin combination therapy)</criteria>
