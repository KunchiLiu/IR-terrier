For women: Postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, OR Surgically sterile, OR If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 2 effective methods of contraception. For men: â€¢ Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 120 days after the last dose of study drug. 9. Patients must meet screening laboratory values. 10. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt; lower limit of normal (LLN) of the institutional standard of normal as measured by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multiple gated acquisition scan (MUGA) within 4 weeks prior to first study drug administration. 11. Ability to swallow oral medications. 12. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study related procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care. 13. Patients who have a history of brain metastasis are eligible for the study provided they meet certain criteria. 1. Other clinically significant comorbidities. 2. Known human immunodeficiency virus infection. 3. Radiation therapy to more than 25% of the bone marrow. 4. Known history of uncontrolled sleep apnea syndrome and other conditions that could result in excessive daytime sleepiness. 5. Systemic infection requiring IV antibiotic therapy within 14 days preceding the first dose of study drug, or other severe infection. 6. Known hepatitis B surface antigenpositive, or known or suspected active hepatitis C infection. 7. Any serious medical or psychiatric illness. 8. Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 2 years before administration of the first dose of study drug, or previously diagnosed with another malignancy and have any evidence of residual disease. Patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of any type are not excluded if they have undergone complete resection. 9. Breast feeding or pregnant. 10. Manifestations of malabsorption due to prior gastrointestinal (GI) surgery, GI disease, or for an unknown reason that may alter the absorption of MLN0128. In addition, patients with enteric stomata are also excluded. 11. Treatment with any investigational products within 3 weeks before the first dose of study drug. 12. History of any of the following within the last 6 months before administration of the first dose of the drug: Ischemic myocardial event, including angina requiring therapy and artery revascularization procedures Ischemic cerebrovascular event, including transient ischemic attack and artery revascularization procedures Requirement for inotropic support (excluding digoxin) or serious (uncontrolled) cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial flutter/fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia) Placement of a pacemaker for control of rhythm New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure Pulmonary embolism 13. Significant active cardiovascular or pulmonary disease. 14. Treatment with strong inhibitors and/or inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, CYP2C19 or CYP2C19 within 1 week preceding the first dose of study drug. 15. Patients receiving systemic corticosteroids within 1 week before administration of the first dose of study drug. 16. Daily or chronic use of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and/or having taken a PPI within 7 days before receiving the first dose of study drug 17. For patients undergoing serial tumor biopsies, known bleeding diathesis or history of abnormal bleeding or require anticoagulation therapy which cannot be interrupted for biopsy.</criteria>
