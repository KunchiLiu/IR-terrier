	<brief_title>Additive Value of Endobronchial Ultrasound-Guided Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for Staging Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in Patients Evaluated for Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>EBUS-TBNA: If you agree to take part in this study, as a part of your standard-of-care, you will have an EBUS-TBNA before SBRT. You will have this performed as an out-patient procedure while under general anesthetic. You will receive a separate consent for this that will explain the procedure and the risks. The samples collected from the EBUS-TBNA will be tested and compared with the results of your standard PET/CT scans. Follow-Up: As a part of your standard-of-care, after SBRT you will have a physical exam and chest CT scan to check the status of the disease every 3 months for the first 2 years, and then twice a year for the following year. After 3 years, you will have these visits 1 time a year. Your medical information from these follow-up visits will be collected for this study. All the information for the study will be stored in a password-protected system. Length of Study Participation: Your active participation in this study will be over after your tissue samples are collected by EBUS-TBNA. Your medical information will continue to be collected as long as you are coming for follow-up visits. This is an investigational study. The EBUS-TBNA is performed using FDA-approved and commercially available methods. It is investigational to compare the results of EBUS-TBNA and PET/CT scans to learn about the accuracy of these ways to find evidence of early stage lung cancer. Up to 150 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
