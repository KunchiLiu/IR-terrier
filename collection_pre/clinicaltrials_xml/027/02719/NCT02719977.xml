	<brief_summary>CX5461 is a new type of drug for many types of cancer, particularly cancers that cannot easily repair damage to their cells. This may help to slow down the growth of cancer or may cause cancer cells to die. CX5461 has been shown to shrink tumours in animals and has been studied in a few people and seems promising but it is not clear if it can offer better results than standard treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study of CX5461</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the first phase of this study (phase I) is to find the dose of a new therapy, CX5461, that can be tolerated without causing very severe side effects and to see what effects the study drug has this cancer. Participants are given CX5461 and are watched very closely to see what side effects they have and to make sure the side effects are not severe. If serious side effects are seen in patients at the first dose level, doses of CX5461 may be lowered in subsequent patients. If the side effects are not serious, then more participants are asked to join this study and are given higher doses. This will continue until a dose is found that causes severe but temporary side effects. Doses higher than that will not be given. The purpose of the second phase of this study (phase II) is to find out what effects a new drug, CX5461, has on you and your breast cancer.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Tumour Type Phase I: Patients must have histologically/and or cytologically confirmed solid malignancy that is advanced/metastatic/recurrent or unresectable and for which no curative therapy exists. Phase II: Patients must have metastatic/recurrent/locally advanced/unresectable triple negative breast cancer or must have BRCA1/2 or HRD germline or somatic aberrations (known, or documented during screening). All patients must have a formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue block (from primary or metastatic tumour) available and must have provided informed consent for the release of the block. All patients in phase II must also have provided informed consent for a whole blood sample. At least 6 patients in each cohort in Phase II (HRD known prior to enrollment or detected during preenrollment screening) must also have provided informed consent for and be willing to undergo a tumour and skin biopsy prior to treatment (after registration) and after cycle 2 day 8. Note: During accrual to this portion of the study, it may be necessary to restrict accrual to patients who are suitable for, and have consented to, tumour and skin biopsies. Patients must be ≥ 18 years of age. Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2. Presence of clinically and/or radiologically documented disease. All radiology studies must be performed within 28 days prior to registration (within 35 days if negative). Phase I: patients do not need to have measurable disease Phase II: patients must have measurable disease Previous Therapy Cytotoxic Chemotherapy: Phase I: There is no limit to the number of prior regimens received. Phase II: Patients must have received at least one but no more than 3 regimens for advanced disease (Note: adjuvant anthracycline/taxane containing chemotherapy is considered an advanced regimen) Note: initially, there is no limitation to the use of prior platinum containing regimens. After the interim analysis in phase II, accrual may be limited to patients considered to be platinum naive, or platinum sensitive (no evidence of disease progression on or within 3 months of the last dose. Sites will be informed at the time of the opening of the cohorts). Other Systemic Therapy: Phase I: There is no limit to the number of prior therapies, including PARP inhibitors. Phase II: Previous treatment with PARP inhibitors is not allowed. There is no limit to other prior therapies received. Patients must have recovered (to baseline or ≤ grade 1) from all reversible toxicity related to prior chemotherapy or systemic therapy and have adequate washout as follows: Longest of one of the following: Two weeks, 5 halflives for investigational agents, Standard cycle length of standard therapies. Radiation: Prior external beam radiation is permitted provided a minimum of 28 days (4 weeks) have elapsed between the last dose of radiation and date of registration. Exceptions may be made for lowdose, nonmyelosuppressive radiotherapy after consultation with CCTG. Concurrent radiotherapy is not permitted. Surgery: Previous surgery is permitted provided that a minimum of 28 days (4 weeks) have elapsed between any major surgery and date of registration, and that wound healing has occurred. Lab Requirements Absolute neutrophils: ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelets: ≥ 100 x 10^9/L Bilirubin: ≤ 1.5 x ULN (upper limit of normal) AST/ALT: ≤ 2.5 x ULN ≤ 5.0 x ULN if patient has liver metastases Serum creatinine: ≤ 1.25 x ULN Creatinine clearance: ≥ 50 mL/min Women/men of childbearing potential must have agreed to use two effective contraceptive methods while on study and for 6 months after the last dose of CX5461. Patient consent must be appropriately obtained in accordance with applicable local and regulatory requirements. Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow up. Treatment is to begin within 2 working days of patient registration. Other Malignancies Phase I Patients with other malignancies requiring concurrent anticancer therapy. Phase II Patients with a history of other malignancies, except: adequately treated nonmelanomatous skin cancer, curatively treated insitu cancer, or other solid tumours curatively treated at least 2 years prior to registration with no evidence of disease and not requiring concurrent anticancer treatment. Patients with symptomatic brain metastases or spinal cord compression. Patients with asymptomatic brain/spinal cord metastasis who are not planned for radiation, or who have been treated and are stable off steroids (or on a decreasing dose) and anticonvulsants are eligible. History of hypersensitivity to CX5461 or any excipient. Patients with known photosensitivity disorders (xeroderma pigmentosa, porphyria etc). Patients who do not agree to use sunglasses and sun blocker (with SPF &gt;30 to UVB and a high degree of protection against UVA) if exposed to sunlight during the course of the study and for 3 months after the last dose. Patients who plan to use sun beds or tanning booths during the course of the study and within 3 months after the last dose are not eligible. Patients who have untreated and/or uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions documented within the last year: unstable angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiac ventricular arrhythmias requiring medication, history of 2nd or 3rd degree atrioventricular conduction defects. Patients who do not have untreated or uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions within the last year must have a LVEF ≥ 50%. Concurrent treatment with other investigational drugs or anticancer therapy. Patients with active or uncontrolled infections or with serious illnesses or medical conditions which would not permit the patient to be managed according to the protocol. Pregnant or lactating women.</criteria>
