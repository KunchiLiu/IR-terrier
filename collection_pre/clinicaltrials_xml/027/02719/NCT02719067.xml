	<brief_summary>The significance of this project is the first longitudinal study to investigate the changes of neurocognitive functions of children and adolescents with ASD and to identify the potential neuroimaging endophenotype (biomarkers) for ASD in Asian with advanced imaging technique (Tract-based automatic analysis, TBAA; multi-echo resting-state fMRI in addition to single-echo resting-state fMRI). The success of this project will fill the gap of our understanding of longitudinal changes of brain function by neuropsychological and imaging approaches of ASD in Han Chinese in Taiwan, and is anticipated to facilitate the progress of translational research in ASD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Longitudinal Follow-up Imaging Study on Children and Adolescents With Autism Spectrum Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common severe, clinically and genetically heterogeneous childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder. Due to its high prevalence, typical autistic symptoms, and severe lifelong impairment without effective prevention and treatment, the developmental change of brain functions in individuals with this study has been recognized as one of the key topics of ASD. The goal of this project is to prospectively investigate the stability and changes of brain functions assessed by neuropsychological tests and neuroimages in a cohort of children and adolescents with ASD who had the first assessment 3-5 years ago. Specific Aims: To investigate the stability and changes of neuropsychological and structural and functional connectivity among children and adolescents with ASD as compared to age- and sex-matched typically developing (TD) controls; and to identify predictors for these neurocognitive changes across a 3-5 follow-up period. The investigators will prospectively follow up 70 ASDs and 70 TDs for reassessments of clinical symptoms, neuropsychological functions, and structural and functional brain connectivity. The assessments include ASD symptoms (ASD only: Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised, Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale; all: Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), Social Communication Questionnaires (SCQ), Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ)), other psychiatric disorders (The Chinese version of the Kiddie Schedule of Schizophrenia and Affective Disorder Scale-Epidemiologic version, K-SADS-E), neuropsychological functions (Conner's Continuous Performance Test) and MRI assessments (T1 and T2 templates, Diffusion Spectrum Imaging, resting-state fMRI).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ASD group: (1) that they have a clinical diagnosis of autistic disorder or Asperger disorder defined by the DSMIV and ICD10 criteria, made by boardcertificated child psychiatrists and who were clinically diagnosed with ASD confirmed by the ADIR 35 years ago; (2) their ages range from 12 to 20 (i.e., 717 years old at the first assessment); (3) both parents are Han Chinese; (4) who have complete clinical and behavioral data at the 1st assessment; (4) participants and their parents consented to participate in this longitudinal study 35 years ago for complete assessments at followup. TD group: who will be recruited either by school teachers or from the community, are that they are Han Chinese, consent to the study (if age &lt;18, parents, too) to complete all the assessments. ASD group: who haven't been included in PI's previous NSC (MOST) projects. TD group: (1) comorbidity with DSMIVTR or DSM5 diagnoses of ASD, ADHD, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, other psychotic disorder, organic psychosis, schizotypal personality disorder, bipolar disorder, depression, severe anxiety disorders or substance use; (2) comorbidity with neurological or systemic disorders; and (3) having a first degree relative who may have ASD based on family history method assessment.</criteria>
