	<brief_summary>In order to explore the question how an intensive, goal-based and aerobic rehabilitation treatment, addressed to act on motor and mental aspects, affects motor and functional symptoms in PD patients with normal cognition and with different level of cognitive impairment. Hypothesis is that a specific rehabilitation program based on motor-cognitive training and repetition, can affect positively the rehabilitation outcome regardless of baseline cognitive profile.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Cognitive Impairment Affect Rehabilitation Outcome in Parkinson's Disease?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: This study is aimed to evaluate the impact of cognitive decline on rehabilitation outcomes in Parkinson's disease (PD). While cognitive status is considered as a determinant of rehabilitation outcome, no studies about this issue have been performed before. Methods: 438 PD patients hospitalized for a 4-weeks Multidisciplinary Intensive Rehabilitation Treatment (MIRT) were enrolled. According to Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), patients were divided into: normal cognition (MMSE 27-30), mild cognitive impairment (MMSE 21-26), moderate or severe cognitive impairment (MMSE ≤ 20). According to Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), subjects were divided into patients with normal (FAB ≥ 13.8) and pathological (FAB &lt; 13.8) score. The outcomes measures were: Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), Six Minutes Walking Test (6MWT), Parkinson's Disease Disability Scale (PDDS).</detailed_description>
