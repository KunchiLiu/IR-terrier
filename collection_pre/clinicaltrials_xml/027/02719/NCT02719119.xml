	<brief_summary>Many physicians suggest repeating EVL every 1-2 weeks until esophageal varices are obliterated to prevent variceal rebleeding， however, the evidences supporting the efficacy of EVL intervals of 1-2 weeks are insufficient.This randomized controlled study was conducted in order to compare the long-term results of EVL when performed at two different results from monthly and bi-weekly treatments.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Monthly Versus Bi-weekly Endoscopic Variceal Ligation for the Prevention of Esophageal Variceal Rebleeding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is a safe and simple procedure now being used on a widening scale. A lot of patients who undergo endoscopic treatment for esophageal varices eventually require additional treatment for recurrent varices. Many physicians suggest repeating EVL every 1-2 weeks until esophageal varices are obliterated to prevent variceal rebleeding， however, the evidences supporting the efficacy of EVL intervals of 1-2 weeks are insufficient.This randomized controlled study was conducted in order to compare the long-term results of EVL when performed at two different results from monthly and bi-weekly treatments.</detailed_description>
