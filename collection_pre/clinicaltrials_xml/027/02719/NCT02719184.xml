	<brief_summary>The study will include 125 healthy subjects (ex-smoker without any airflow limitation), 125 COPD GOLD (global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease) I , 125 COPD GOLD II, 125 COPD GOLD III and up to 40 (with a minimum of 20) patients with COPD and A1AT (Alpha1-Antitrypsin) deficiency (ZZ genotype). Soluble and imaging biomarkers will be investigated addressing different aspects of disease pathways postulated to be relevant for COPD progression.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: General Inclusion Criteria Male or female healthy subjects or COPD (GOLD I to III) outpatients with or without A1AT deficiency . Exsmoker with a smoking history of &gt;=20 pack years Signed informed consent consistent with ICHGCP (International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice) guidelines prior to participation in the study, which includes medical shortterm restrictions Age &gt;= 40 and &lt;=60 years Body mass index (BMI) of &gt;= 18 and &lt;= 30 kg/m2 Ability to perform all study related procedures including technically acceptable pulmonary function tests, body plethysmography, DLCO ( Diffusing Capacity of the lungs for Carbon Monoxide) , sputum induction, HRCT (High Resolution Computed Tomography) and MRI (if applicable) Inclusion Criteria Specific for Patients with COPD Patients must have a current diagnosis of COPD made by a physician at least 3 months prior to Visit 1 and a mMRC (Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale) score of 1 or more. The diagnosis of COPD must be in accordance with GOLD Guidelines and must be documented by the following criteria: Known relatively stable airway obstruction with a postbronchodilator FEV1(Forced Expiratory Volume in first second)/FVC (Forced Vital Capacity) &lt; lower limit of normal (GLI 2012) The current COPD must be mild, moderate or severe based on lung functions and symptoms and the clinical situation must have stabilized for at least 6 weeks prior to Visit 1. The following definitions adapted from the GOLD Guidelines apply: 1. mild: postbronchodilator FEV1 predicted &gt;=80% (GLI 2012) at Visit 1 2. moderate: 50%&lt;= postbronchodilator FEV1 predicted &lt; 80% (GLI 2012) without chronic respiratory failure at Visit 1 3. severe: 30%&lt;= postbronchodilator FEV1 predicted &lt;50% (GLI 2012) without chronic respiratory failure at Visit 1 Patients must be on stable therapy for at least 6 months Inclusion Criteria Specific Patients with COPD and A1AT Deficiency Documented diagnosis A1AT deficiency of ZZ genotype Inclusion Criteria Specific Healthy Subjects Normal lung function values at Visit 1 with a documented postbronchodilator FEV1 &gt;=80% of predicted normal (GLI 2012) and a postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC &gt;= lower limit of normal Mean DLCO over all acceptable measurements at Visit 1 of &gt;= 70% of predicted normal value Further inclusion criteria apply Exclusion criteria: General Exclusion Criteria Previous participation in this study or participation in another trial with an investigational drug within 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 or during the study Respiratory tract infection or COPD exacerbation in the 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 or during the screening period prior to Visit 2 Significant pulmonary disease or other medical conditions* (as determined by medical history, examination and clinical investigations at screening) that may in the opinion of the investigator result in any of the following: 1. Put the subject at risk because of participation in the study 2. Cause concern regarding the subject's ability to participate in this study *e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, severe liver disease, psoriasis, osteoporosis, hematological, infectious and psychiatric diseases Documented history of asthma. For allergic rhinitis or atopy, source documentation to verify that the subject does not have asthma Planned surgery during the study expected to interfere with study procedures and outcome Blood withdrawal of more than 100 mL within the past 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 and between Visit 1 and 2 Significant alcohol or drug abuse within past 2 years prior to Visit 1 Women who are pregnant, nursing or plan to become pregnant while in the study Place of permanent residence of less than 3 months prior to Visit 1 For the MRI subset: subject who do not meet the following criteria at Visit 2: systolic blood pressure between 90 and 180 mmHg (SBP), diastolic blood pressure between 50 and 110 mmHg (DBP), pulse rate between 40 and 110 bpm, ear temperature between 35 37.5 C, and a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &gt;= 30 mL/min A malignancy for which the patient has undergone resection, radiation or chemotherapy within past 5 years. Patients with treated basal cell carcinoma or fully cured squamous cell carcinoma are allowed Inability to comply with restrictions regarding diet, life style and medication Exclusion Criteria Specific Patients with COPD and A1AT Deficiency Newly added antiinflammatory treatment within 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 Current treatment with PDE (Phosphodiesterase)5 inhibitors (e.g. Roflumilast) and maintenance treatment Methylxanthines (e.g. Theophylline) Hospitalisation for respiratory failure during the year prior to Visit 1 A history of cystic fibrosis Clinical diagnosis of bronchiectasis requiring specific treatment Clinically relevant abnormal baseline hematology and blood chemistry Known active tuberculosis Change in therapy within 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 Current and planned A1AT augmentation therapy Further exclusion criteria apply</criteria>
