	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence rate is high among liver transplant patients, while treatment measures are limited. This study plans to recruit 10 patients with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) related HCC who underwent liver transplantation and are confirmed to have recurrent HCC. The objective of the study is to assess the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of the HBV specific T cell receptor (HBV/TCR) redirected T cell in the target population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TCR-Redirected T Cell Infusions to Treat Recurrent Hepatocellular Carcinoma Post Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single armed and open labelled trial in patients with recurrent HBV related HCC after liver transplantation. For patients who successfully match TCR histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA) restriction, escalating doses of HBV/TCR expressing autologous T cells will be infused. Tests will be done to confirmed safety and efficacy during treatment, followed by one month immediate observation period for safety and a long-term follow up period up to five years for efficacy.</detailed_description>
