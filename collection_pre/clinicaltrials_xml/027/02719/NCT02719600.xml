	<brief_summary>Background: Down syndrome (DS) has unique physical, motor and cognitive characteristics. Despite cognitive and motor difficulties, there is a possibility of intervention based on the knowledge of motor learning. However, it is important to study the motor learning process in individuals with DS during a virtual reality task to justify the use of virtual reality to organize intervention programs. The aim of this study was to analyze the motor learning process in individuals with DS during a virtual reality task. Methods: A total of 40 individuals participated in this study, 20 of which were with DS (24 males and 8 females, ranging between 11-28 yrs.) and 20 typically developing individuals matched by age and gender to the individuals with DS. To examine this issue, we used software that uses 3D images and reproduced a coincidence timing task.</brief_summary>
