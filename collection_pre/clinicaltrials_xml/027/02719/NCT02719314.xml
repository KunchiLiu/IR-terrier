	<brief_summary>Glucocorticoids remain to be among the most important and most frequently used anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive or immune-modulatory acting drugs to treat rheumatic (and other) diseases. Unfortunately, glucocorticoids also exert undesired effects, especially if higher dosages have to be given over longer periods of time. The available data describing frequency and severity of these adverse effects are fragmentary. This statement is especially true for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) in the context of chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases or (in part) psoriasis(arthritis). The state of knowledge and scientific data, being sparse, is partly conflicting and often derived from over-aged projects or studies. Therefore, there are urgent needs to work on various current questions systematically and at the highest scientific level possible. In order to address these needs, we aim at collecting and analyzing disease- and bone-related data from patients with chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases or psoriasis and therapy with glucocorticoids, and to build a respective GIOP-Databank. Patients will attend for diagnostics, and where necessary therapy and follow-up of GIOP, according to current guidelines. Clinical, laboratory and instrumental examination results from more than 1000 patients in the first three years of the project are planned to be documented in a prospective database.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Glucocorticoids remain to be among the most important and most frequently used anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive or immune-modulatory acting drugs to treat rheumatic (and other) diseases. Unfortunately, glucocorticoids also exert undesired effects, especially if higher dosages have to be given over longer periods of time. The available data describing frequency and severity of these adverse effects are fragmentary. This statement is especially true for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) in the context of chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases or (in part) psoriasis(arthritis), since GIOP is counted among the two most important adverse effects of glucocorticoid therapy, by both rheumatologists and patients. The state of knowledge and scientific data, being sparse, is partly conflicting and often derived from over-aged projects or studies. Therefore, there are urgent needs to work on various current questions systematically and at the highest scientific level possible. In order to address these needs, we aim at collecting and analyzing disease- and bone-related data from patients with chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases or psoriasis and therapy with glucocorticoids, and to build a respective GIOP-Databank. Patients will attend for diagnostics, and where necessary therapy and follow-up of GIOP, according to current guidelines.
