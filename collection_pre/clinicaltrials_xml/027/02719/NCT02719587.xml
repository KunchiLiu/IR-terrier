	<brief_title>Dietary Supplementation With Low-Dose Omega-3 Reduces Salivary TNF-α Levels in Patients With Chronic Periodontitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty systemically healthy subjects with chronic periodontitis were enrolled and randomly allocated into two groups. The control group (n=15) was treated with scaling and root planing (SRP)+placebo whereas the test group (n=15) was treated with SRP and dietary supplementation of low-dose omega-3 PUFAs (6.25 mg EPA and 19.19 mg DHA). Clinical parameters were taken at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months following therapy. Saliva samples were obtained at the same time intervals and analyzed for tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and superoxide dismutase (SOD).</detailed_description>
