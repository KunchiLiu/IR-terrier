	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to understand the effects of fish oil supplement (containing parts of omega-3 fatty acids) on inflammation. The investigators are aiming to identify which dose of the fish oil supplement is the most effective. The name of the fish oil supplement is "SPM Emulsion."</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>THE OMEGA-SPM-DOSE and OMEGA-SPM-PAD: Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The OMEGA-SPM-DOSE trial and the OMEGA-SPM-PAD trial are two parts of a pilot study which aims to investigate the effect of a novel formulation of a nutritional supplement containing highly concentrated n-3 PUFA metabolites (SPM Emulsion) on the metabolo-lipidomic profile of healthy volunteers and patients with PAD. Ten healthy volunteers and ten patients with PAD will participate in Part 1a, the "OMEGA-SPM-DOSE Study". A follow-up, placebo controlled, prospective study on the best dosing modality determined in Phase 1a will then take place in a wider PAD population (n=30), Phase 1b - the "OMEGA-SPM-PAD Study". Specific measurements will include targeted metabolo-lipidomic profiling, established markers of inflammation, and functional monocyte and macrophage assays. The proposed studies have the potential to provide important new insights on the role of nutritional interventions in PAD.</detailed_description>
