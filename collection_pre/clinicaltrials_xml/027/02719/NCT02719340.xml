	<brief_summary>Although long-segment posterior spinal fixation might provide more rigid fixation, the procedure increases perioperative morbidities in the elderly. The present study reviews the results of short-segment decompression and reconstruction in thoracolumbar fragile fractures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short Segment Fixation in Thoracolumbar Osteoporotic Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study included 20 elderly patients with osteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fractures and neurological compromise. The participants were followed-up for a period of 40.6 (24-68) months. A visual analog scale (VAS) and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were used to measure back pain and disability. Radiologic assessment and neurological status were also analyzed.</detailed_description>
