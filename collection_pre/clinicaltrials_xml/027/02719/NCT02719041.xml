	<brief_summary>The main goal of this study is to employ a novel proteomic approach to identify predictive tumor biomarkers that will increase the efficacy of insulin-like growth factor (IGF1R) targeted therapy in epithelial ovarian cancer. It is expected that these predictive biomarkers will be applied to increase the response rate in selected groups of patients.</brief_summary>
