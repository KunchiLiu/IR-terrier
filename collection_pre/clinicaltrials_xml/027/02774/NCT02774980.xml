	<brief_summary>Patients with depression are frequently treatment resistant. Clinical manifestations of depression are various, but cognitive dysfunctions are commonly present. Many factors are involved in treatment resistance. As no biological marker is available, clinical markers could be considered in predicting response to antidepressive treatment. The aim of this study is to investigate the relation between the cognitive changes and the remission of depressive symptoms in patients with recurrent depression (Stage 2 of Thase and Rush classification). To explore the dynamics of cognitive dimension associated to clinical and functional remission, the investigators will observe neurocognitive functioning before and after introducing a new antidepressive therapy.</brief_summary>
