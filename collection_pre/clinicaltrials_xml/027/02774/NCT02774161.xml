	<brief_summary>This pilot trial studies how well B-mode ultrasound imaging works in detecting liver cancer that is early in its growth and may not have spread to other parts of the body. Diagnostic procedures, such as B-mode ultrasound imaging, may help find and diagnose liver cancer and find out how far the disease has spread.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>B-mode Ultrasound Imaging in Detecting Early Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To investigate the use of quantitative ultrasound spectroscopy to detect early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as an inexpensive and widely available quantitative (i.e. robust) method to confirm disease in developing countries. OUTLINE: Patients undergo B-mode ultrasound imaging of the liver over 15 minutes.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient with confirmed diagnosis of HCC, and untreated. Patients with Suspected HCC (Suspected HCC nodules should preferably be smaller than 3 cm and preferably within 6 cm in depth of the transducer head to minimize attenuation) and untreated. Patients at a higher risk of HCC undergoing a screening program by Ultrasound. Patients will be male or female over the age of 18 of any ethnic background. Ability to understand and willingness to sign written informed consent document. Preferred that the confirmed HCC lesion is within 6 cm of the transducer head to minimize attenuation. Patients should not be taking other investigational agents Concomitant medications for treatment of the target lesion</criteria>
