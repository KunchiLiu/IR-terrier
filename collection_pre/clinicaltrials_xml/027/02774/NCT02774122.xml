	<brief_title>Cochleural Alternating Acoustic Beam Therapy (CAABT) Versus Masking Intervention for Tinnitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Masking intervention was a standard monophone tinnitus masking therapy. It was usually a narrow-band noise matched with tinnitus frequency (Tf). CAABT was an innovative tinnitus intervention which based on neural science and cochlear plastic research and aimed to reprogram the central auditory system to neutralize the discordant responses of the dysfunctioning cochlea via acoustic beaming stimuli.</detailed_description>
