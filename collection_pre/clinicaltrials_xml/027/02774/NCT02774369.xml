	<brief_summary>It has been suggested that the practice of physical exercise can improve sleep, but few studies have investigated this issue in the context of cancer, despite the proven benefits of exercise in this population. This randomized-controlled trial (RCT) aimed to compare the efficacy of an aerobic intervention program to that of a self-administered cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to improve sleep of cancer patients. Forty-one men and women with insomnia symptoms and treated within 6 months for a non-metastatic cancer participated in the study.</brief_summary>
