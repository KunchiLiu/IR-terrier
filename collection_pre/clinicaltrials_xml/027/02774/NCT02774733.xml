	<brief_summary>Objective: The main target of this study was to research the correlation between the pulmonary function and the circulatory parameters of retrobulbar blood vessels in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) without diabetic retinopathy (DR). Method: T2DM patients without DR were choose to research the correlation between the pulmonary function and the circulatory parameters of retrobulbar blood vessels. The primary endpoints were the pulmonary function parameters; The secondary endpoints were the HbA1c, FPG, 2hPG, WC, and BMI. The tertiary endpoints were the blood-fat; In addition, the retrobulbar circulation in the retrobulbar blood vessels were evaluated using color doppler imaging (CDI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Correlation Between the Pulmonary Function Parameters and the Circulatory Parameters (PSV, EDV, RI) of Retrobulbar Blood Vessels (CRA, PCA, and OA) in 48 T2DM Patients Did Not Combinate With DR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary function parameters (VC%, FVC%, FEV1%, PEF%, MVV%, TLC%, FEV1/FVC%, DLCO%, and DLCO/VA%); the retrobulbar circulation (PSV, EDV, RI);retrobulbar blood vessels (CRA, PCA, and OA);blood-fat(TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG). Pulmonary function was measured by spirometer which was provided by Jaska Corporation in Japan, model number: HI-101; The CDI recordings were taken using a Powervision SSA-380A (Toshiba, Japan) using a 7-MHz transducer.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. The patients were diagnosed with T2DM according to the guidelines of the American Diabetes Association; 2. No smoking history, pulmonary disease nor pulmonary infection within a fortnight; 3. Did not have hepatopathy, nephropathy, and gastrointestinal disease; and 4. Likely to have good compliance and able to visit our hospital for periodic assessments. 1. T1DM, gestation and lactation; 2. Renal inadequacy, a serum creatinine &gt;132 µmol/L (male), or a serum creatinine &gt;123 µmol/L (female); 3. hypohepatia, the liver enzyme was two times higher than normal; 4. Intensive care with insulin treatment; 5. The patients combinated with DR and hypertension (antihypertensive drugs were used); 6. Patients with other eye conditions that could affect the blood flow, such as high degree myopia, maculopathy of any origin, glaucoma, and those with a history of laser treatment or introacular surgery; 7. New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure, a history of coronary angioplasty, coronary stent placement, coronary bypass surgery, or myocardial infarction within 6 months; 8) Cholesterollowering drugs can not control the bloodfat (TC &gt; 250 mg/dl, HDLC &lt; 30 mg/dL, LDLC &gt; 170 mg/dl, TG &gt; 200 mg/dl) adequately; and 9) Use of systemically injected glucocorticoids within 3 months prior to our study.</criteria>
