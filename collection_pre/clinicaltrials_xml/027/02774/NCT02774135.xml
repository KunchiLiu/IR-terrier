	<brief_title>Efficacy of Occupational Therapy Intervention to Promote Preschoolers' Participation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preschoolers suffering from mild developmental disabilities are being referred to Occupational Therapy (OT) clinics according to limitation in participating of daily occupations. As well these children often demonstrate behavior or emotional difficulties. The primary treatment goal is promoting participation yet many times the treatment focuses on child's performance skills and not on occupation based activities. Respectively its outcome measures are the child performance skills. This study will document the therapeutic intervention, and evaluate its impact on child participation as well on his performance skills and emotional aspects. Participants will be recruited from waiting list for Occupational Therapy at Clalit Health services, Child Development Institute and divided into 3 groups: one direct OT intervention and two control groups (waiting list and sensory-motor games).</detailed_description>
