	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to the effect of three single oral doses of nebicapone (50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg) on the levodopa pharmacokinetics when administered in combination with a single-dose of controlled release levodopa 200 mg/carbidopa 50 mg (Sinemet CR 200/50).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Single centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, 4-way crossover study with four single-dose treatment periods. The washout period between doses was 5 days or more. Procedures: Screening: Subjects will be screened for eligibility within 28 and 7 days of first admission. Written informed consent will be obtained before any study procedure is performed. The screening will consist of: medical history; physical examination, vital signs; complete neurological examination; 12-lead ECG; hematology, coagulation, plasma biochemistry and urinalysis tests; HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C serology; drugs of abuse and alcohol screen; urine pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential; and review of the selection criteria. The results of screening must be known to the investigator prior to the subject's first admission. Treatment periods: In each of the four consecutive treatment periods, eligible subjects will be admitted to the UFH on the day prior to receiving the study medication for: vital signs; medical history and physical examination updates; 12-lead ECG; hematology and plasma biochemistry; drugs of abuse and alcohol screen; and urine pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential. On the first admission the subjects will have a review of the selection criteria and will be randomized to one of the treatment sequences. On the morning of the dosing day, subjects will receive a dose of BIA 3-202 / Placebo concomitantly with a dose of Sinemet CR 200/50 in fasting conditions (at least 8 hours) and will remain in the UFH until at least 24 h post-dose; then, they will be discharged and will return for the next period or the follow-up visit. At given time-points between pre-dose and discharge, subjects will be submitted to vital signs recording, brief neurological examinations, 12-lead ECG, and blood sampling for plasma drug assays and erythrocyte S-COMT activity. At discharge, vital signs and ECG will be recorded, and hematology and plasma biochemistry tests will be performed. Follow-up: A follow-up visit will occur approximately 7-10 days after discharge of the last treatment period or early discontinuation for: medical history and physical examination updates; vital signs; 12-lead ECG; hematology, plasma biochemistry and urinalysis tests; and pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential.</detailed_description>
