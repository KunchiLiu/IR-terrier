	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to define and evaluate the efficacy of Aquatic Locomotor Training (ALT) compared to overground Locomotor Training in improving ambulatory function and health-related quality of life. The investigators hypothesize, that Aquatic Locomotor Training is capable of producing outcomes that are as good as, or better than, overground Locomotor Training. Aquatic Locomotor Training may be another tool for therapists to utilize for clinical improvements in function and gait for the Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) population. To determine the efficacy of Aquatic Locomotor Training on improving rehabilitation outcomes among patients with incomplete traumatic cervical Spinal Cord Injury by assessing these parameters: 1. Walking speed and endurance 2. Functional balance and fall risk 3. HRQoL To describe the feasibility of conducting Aquatic Locomotor Training as an Locomotor Training modality for the rehabilitation of patients with incomplete traumatic cervical Spinal Cord Injury.</brief_summary>
