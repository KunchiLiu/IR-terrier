	<brief_summary>This intervention study will be conducted on patients included in a nationwide and prospective cohort, The Oesophageal Surgery in Cancer patients: Adaptation and Recovery study (OSCAR). The OSCAR includes patients operated on for oesophageal cancer in Sweden between 2013-2018, identified through pathology departments and included in the cohort 1 year after surgery. A comprehensive interview is conducted by a research nurse during a home visit using patient reported outcomes on several HRQOL, psychosocial, emotional and nutritional aspects. Regular follow-ups are carried out at 1½, 2, 2½, 3, 4 and 5 years postoperatively. All patients within OSCAR are invited to the intervention trial. Half of the eligible patients will be randomised to intervention and half to standard care (control group) by means of block randomisation method. The intervention group will be encouraged to adhere to a physical activity regimen of 150 minutes of weekly minimum intensity activities and 5 simple strength training exercises twice a week as instructed by the research nurse. The control group will follow their routine daily physical activity. HRQOL measures, height and weight, body composition, muscle strength, functional mobility and strength, and dietary intake are assessed before and after the intervention. Compliance will be ensured by means of a daily physical activity dairy and a weekly follow up on telephone with all patients.</brief_summary>
