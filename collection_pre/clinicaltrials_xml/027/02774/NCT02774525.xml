	<brief_summary>The co-occurrence of child maltreatment and parental substance-use problems is a major public health problem with serious consequences for children, parents, families, and the community at large. The need for effective dual treatment of caregiver substance abuse and child maltreatment is unquestionable, but there is a dearth of controlled treatment outcome studies with substance-using parents who have engaged in child maltreatment. This project examines two evidence-based treatmentsâ€”Contingency Management for substance-use problems and Pathways Triple P parenting intervention to improve parenting for prevention of child-maltreatment recurrence. These two systematic interventions are being tested in the context of traditional outpatient treatment for substance-use problems.</brief_summary>
