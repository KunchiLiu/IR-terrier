	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the study drug palbociclib has anti-tumor activity against the breast cancer that has spread to the brain and also to determine the overall radiographic response rate in the CNS. Palbociclib is an anti-cancer medication that has been shown to stop cancer cells from growing. It has been approved in hormone positive breast cancer, along with other hormone therapies and has been found to be effective. The preclinical studies suggest that the drug may also have activity in other types of breast cancer, such as triple negative and HER2 positive breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to see if the study drug is effective in patients with brain metastasis, who have triple negative and HER2-positive breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Palbociclib in Treating Patients With Metastatic HER-2 Positive or Triple-Negative Breast Cancer With Brain Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the radiographic response rate in the central nervous system (CNS) in patients with TNBC and HER2-positive breast cancer who have brain metastasis treated with palbociclib. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with TNBC and HER2-positive breast cancer who have brain metastasis treated with palbociclib. II. To determine time to CNS progression in patients with TNBC and HER2-positive breast cancer who have brain metastasis treated with palbociclib. III. To determine systemic overall response rate (ORR) in patients with TNBC and HER2-positive breast cancer who have brain metastasis treated with palbociclib. IV. To determine the safety and tolerability of palbociclib in patients with TNBC and HER2-positive breast cancer. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) at baseline, 2 month and 4 months; particularly to assess cyclin D1 aberrations, and if this is predictive of responses. II. To evaluate genomic landscape of available CNS and non-CNS tumors, and describe any discordance. III. To evaluate cognitive function and quality of life at baseline, 2 and 4 months in patients receiving palbociclib. OUTLINE: Patients receive palbociclib orally (PO) daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with HER2 positive breast cancer may also receive trastuzumab intravenously (IV) as standard of care concurrently with palbociclib. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, and then every 6 months for up to 3 years.</detailed_description>

this MRI is to be obtained within 28 days of registration; NOTE: If patient needs escalation of steroids prior to therapy, or are on unstable doses of steroids they are not eligible Patients who underwent neurosurgery (NSGY) or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to a brain lesion must have a new measureable lesion; NOTE: SRS may be done to a lesion that will not be used for response evaluation and should be done &gt; 2 weeks prior to registration; any NSGY procedure must have been completed &gt; 3 weeks prior to registration Patients must not have received systemic therapy within 2 weeks of initiating palbociclib; NOTE: For the HER2positive cohort, patients on trastuzumab can remain on the drug; no break or washout period required; however, lapatinib, adotrastuzumabemtansine, and pertuzumab are prohibited and a minimum wash out period of 2 weeks is required Patients must exhibit adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function, within 14 days prior to registration, defined as: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,000/mm^3 (growth factor support is permitted) Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mm^3 (may be reached by transfusion) Hemoglobin &gt;= 10 gm/dl (may be reached by transfusion) Glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT)/glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) &lt;

NOTE: A FOCBP is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following criteria: Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy Has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months (and therefore has not been naturally postmenopausal for &gt;
