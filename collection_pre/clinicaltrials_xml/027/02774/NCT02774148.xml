	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to determine if intravenous acetaminophen decreases pain scores and the amount of morphine equivalence received as compared to oral acetaminophen in patients greater than 65 years old after sustaining a hip fracture.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pain Control in Elderly Hip Fracture Patients: Is Intravenous Acetaminophen Superior to Oral Administration?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgeons involved in this research agree to the randomization of patients into one of two groups. After informed consent, patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the treatment group or the control group. Group 1: This group will serve as the control group, and will be scheduled to receive one gram (1g) acetaminophen PO every 8 hours. Group 2: This group will serve as the treatment group, and will be scheduled to receive one gram (1g) acetaminophen IV every 8 hours The standardized pain control protocol for hip fracture patients will be initiated for all patients. The pain protocol will be initiated at hospital admission, and after three postoperative doses of the group assigned acetaminophen all patients will be switched to one gram scheduled acetaminophen PO in preparation for hospital discharge.</detailed_description>
