	<brief_summary>The study will test the efficacy of a hour long, one-on-one, active listening counseling session (called Change the Cycle or CTC) aimed at reducing behaviors among active people who inject drugs (PWID) that research has found to facilitate uptake of injection drug use among non-injectors. The study will involve ~1,100 PWID who will be randomized to CTC or an equal attention control intervention on improving nutrition. Participants will be recruited in Los Angeles and San Francisco, California and followed up at 6 and 12 months to determine changes in direct and indirect facilitation of injection initiation among non-injectors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Change the Cycle: An RCT to Prevent Injection Initiation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our goal is to conduct a large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the "Change the Cycle" (CTC) intervention. CTC is an hour long, single-session, one-on-one intervention that aims to reduce injection initiation by encouraging active PWID to not promote drug injection, model injection behavior, describe how to inject, or assist in injection initiations of non-injectors. CTC uses the Information-Motivation-Behavioral skills (IMB) model to achieve changes among active PWID through seven short modules. Information and motivational domains are addressed in guided conversations about (1) their own first injection episode and consequences, (2) past experiences initiating injection-naive people and consequences, (3) health, legal, and social risks related to injection drugs, (4) health, legal, social risks of initiating people, and (5) identifying their own behaviors that might promote injection among others. The behavioral skills are addressed through (6) skill-building discussions and consideration of common initiation scenarios, and (7) safer injection education. Aim 1: To test the efficacy of CTC on reducing the number of non-injectors initiated into injection (counts) by PWID. Hypothesis 1: PWID who receive CTC will report initiating fewer non-injectors into drug injection at 6 and 12 months as compared with PWID in the control condition. Aim 2: To test the efficacy of CTC on reducing the number of times PWID are asked to initiate (counts) someone into injection. Hypothesis 2: PWID who receive CTC will report having been asked fewer times to initiate someone into drug injection at 6 and 12 months as compared with PWID in the control condition. Aim 3: To test whether injection initiation social learning risks (injecting in front of, describing injection to, and speaking positively about injection to non-injectors) act as mediational mechanisms for the efficacy of the CTC intervention on initiation and request-to-initiate outcomes. Hypothesis 3: Social learning variables will significantly mediate the association between the CTC intervention and episodes of initiating and being requested to initiate someone into drug injection at 6 and 12 months. To achieve these aims, active PWID (N=1,076) will be randomly assigned to receive CTC or an equal attention control condition in Los Angeles (LA) and San Francisco (SF), CA. Injection initiation and injection initiation social learning variables will be collected at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months using computer-assisted personal-interviewing (CAPI). The equal attention control condition will focus on improving nutrition, specifically increasing fresh water intake and protein consumption, and will replicate CTC in length, theoretical foundation (IMB), and modality (1 on 1 personal session). Changes from the proposed: We have made 3 modest changes in study procedures. 1) We will now include all active PWID over the age of 17 in the study. We had originally proposed to exclude subjects who did not report an injection initiation risk behaviors (e.g., describing injection, speaking positively about injection, or injecting in front of non-injectors) or injection initiation assistance in the last 6 months. However, the consistency of these behaviors is unknown and PWID who previously did not report these behaviors may initiate them. For instance, in Strike et al., 2014, 16% of PWID injected in front of non-injectors at follow-up interview, but not baseline. Excluding participants with no baseline injection initiation risk may result in missing important intervention effects (i.e., we expect control condition participants to have higher incidence/uptake of injection initiation risk as compared to experimental condition participants) and is how it would be implemented in community settings. This will change the overall number of PWID screened from an estimated 1,700 to ~1,100. The reduction in overall participants allows us to make change number 2. 2) We are using CAPI rather than audio-computer assisted self-interviewing (ACASI). While ACASI has well documented advantages, we think the complexity of the behaviors we are exploring will require clarification which cannot easily be provided via self-interview even with the audio component. Cost savings from reducing the number of screened participants will allow us to hire interviewers to conduct the surveys. And 3) we originally proposed to have an equal attention control condition focused on sex risk reduction. However, in our last study of PWID in Los Angeles and San Francisco, we found that 30% of participants had no sexual contact in the last 6 months and 34% had only one partner suggesting that sex risk reduction maybe of limited interest and relevance to PWID in our samples. Instead, we will focus on improving nutrition in the equal attention control. Based on our prior study (Schmitz et al., 2016), we found that food insecurity was high among PWID (57% of PWID have low or very low food insecurity). Our participants are very low income (81% report monthly income of less than $1,351) and largely homeless (62%); focusing on strategies for improving eating behaviors seems highly appropriate for this population, yet have rarely been explored.
