	<brief_summary>The gold standard for the treatment of gingival recession, is the coronal repositioning of the flap associated with the subepithelial connective tissue graft. The acellular dermal matrix (ADM) has been used as a substitute a subepithelial connective tissue graft in periodontal plastic surgery and mucogengivais, and has achieved similar results. The use of ADM has the advantage of avoiding possible pre and postoperative complications, as well as overcome the limitations presented by autograft. The different surgical techniques used for root coverage seek predictability and success. For this, besides the type of incision placements flap and graft are of utmost importance because the healing benefit and outcome. The aim of this study is to compare two surgical techniques for root coverage and evaluate which one provides better cosmetic results and less morbidity . 20 adults , nonsmoking patients , showing multiple bilateral gingival recessions , class I or II Miller located in canine, first and second premolars are selected. Both techniques use the ADM as a graft. However , in one Quadrant partial flap will be held together with relaxing incisions through an incision intrasucular , ADM will be positioned 1 mm apical to the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) and the flap will be positioned 1 mm coronal CEJ. In the opposite quadrant a minimally invasive technique periosteal envelope above does not use relaxing incisions , preserves the buds will be held , as well as avoiding any scars, the graft will be used to ADM. The clinical parameters (probing depth, clinical attachment level, bleeding on probing index, height and width of the gingival retraction and height and thickness of keratinized gingiva) will be evaluated 2 weeks after the basic periodontal therapy and after 6 and 12 months to surgical procedures. In addition, measurements of photographic gingival recession with the aid of software will be performed.</brief_summary>
