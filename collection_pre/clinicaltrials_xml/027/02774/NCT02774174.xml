The objective of this study is to evaluate the retrospective patient data where patients have been followed up for at least 12 months post operation; to demonstrate the safety of the METS Proximal Humeral replacement system.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Evaluation of the METS™ Proximal Humeral System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The METS™ Proximal Humeral system is an endoprosthetic replacement designed to restore the length and the function of an arm after the resection of a significant amount of bone tissue; due to a malignant tumour in the proximal humerus. This Post Market Clinical Follow up (PMCF) study is designed to further support the existing evidence that the system is safe and performs as expected, when analysing retrospective patient data that have had a METS™ Proximal Humeral replacement. The target population is male or female subjects aged between 18 years and over who have been implanted with a METS™ Proximal Humeral system at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore; and the patient has been followed up for at least 12 months following implantation.</detailed_description>
