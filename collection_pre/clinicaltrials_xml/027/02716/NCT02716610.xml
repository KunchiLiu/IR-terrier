	<brief_title>Dose-Response and Variability of Inhaled Insulin in Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study investigated the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of Dance-501, a novel inhaled human insulin liquid formulation (INH) and device. Twenty-four subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) received 3 INH doses: low (69 units), medium (139 units) and high (208 units) and 1 equivalent medium dose (18 units) of subcutaneous insulin lispro (LIS). The medium dose was repeated to determine within subject variability. PD was investigated during a 12 hour euglycemic clamp.</detailed_description>
