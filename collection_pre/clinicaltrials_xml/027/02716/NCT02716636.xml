	<brief_title>Fast Versus Slow Tenaculum Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IUD insertion and endometrial biopsies are commonly performed in office procedures that use a tenaculum to stabilize the cervix. Patient's often complain that tenaculum placement is one of the most uncomfortable parts of these procedures. Patient's who agree to be in the study will be randomized into one of two groups, either slow tenaculum placement or fast tenaculum placement. Throughout the procedure patient's will be asked to rate the amount of pain they are experiencing using a visual analog scale. The researchers will then compare the two groups. The providers will also rate what they perceived the patient's pain to be with the procedure.</detailed_description>
