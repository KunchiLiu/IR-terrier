	<brief_summary>Background International guidelines underline the importance of strengthening the coordination and continuity of cancer care. The different roles of general practitioners and oncologists with regard to treatment, follow-up and rehabilitation during and after cancer treatment are often obscure to cancer patients. Parallel courses of healthcare are often taking place instead of coordinated care characterized by continuity and partnership between care providers. Patients may feel uncertain about the health professionals' skills and area of responsibility. Healthcare seeking and support during and after cancer treatment may, therefore, be inappropriate, leaving patients feeling insecure and lost between care providers.The study aims to design and evaluate a new way of communication and shared decision-making that brings the patient, the oncologist and general practitioner together in a shared video-consultation in the early phase of chemotherapeutic treatment. The effect of the intervention in addition to usual care will be tested in a randomized controlled trial at Vejle Hospital in the Region of Southern Denmark. Based on sample size calculation, investigators intent to include 300 patients at the Department of Oncology and their general practitioners. Results and process outcomes will be evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively, questionnaires to patients, general practitioners and oncologists, and data from registers.</brief_summary>
