	<brief_summary>Exercise-based rehabilitation improves physical function, fatigue and quality of life in patients with thoracic neoplasia. Consequently, the need for rehabilitation across the continuum of care in oncology is growing rapidly. However, the implementation of this type of intervention is limited because of many barriers such as patients' symptoms and poor accessibility to programs. In this context, healthcare systems should develop and implement new approaches to dispense these services. Consequently, telerehabilitation is a promising strategy to improve access and adherence to rehabilitation. OBJECTIVES To investigate the feasibility, adherence and satisfaction of a home-based telerehabilitation program (TELERP) with real-time physiological parameters acquisition in patients with unresectable thoracic neoplasia receiving chemotherapy and to explore its effects on patients' functional capacity. METHODS Five patients receiving chemotherapy followed an 8-week TELERP using real-time monitoring combined with interactive exercises. The TELERP included supervised (15) and unsupervised (9) strengthening and cardiovascular exercise sessions at a rate of 3 sessions/week. The feasibility of the TELERP, adverse outcomes, technical issues, program adherence and satisfaction were analysed. Prior to and after the program, a six-minute walking test (6MWT), a timed up and go (TUG) and a timed stair test (TST) were done to assess functional capacity</brief_summary>
