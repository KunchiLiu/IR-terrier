	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1 study of checkpoint therapy, tremelimumab and durvalumab, administered to subjects with multiple myeloma who are at high risk for relapse. Checkpoint therapy will be administered prior to and for 2 cycles post autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). This will be followed by up to 6 additional monthly cycles of durvalumab alone.</brief_summary>
