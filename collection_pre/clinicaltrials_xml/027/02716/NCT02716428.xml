	<brief_summary>Phase 2 study designed to assess the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of Faldaprevir and TD-6450 alone or in combination with other antivirals for a 12-week treatment duration in treatment-naïve participants with genotype 1b hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Faldaprevir, TD-6450 and Other Antivirals in Participants With Genotype 1b Hepatitis C Virus Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A study to evaluate the safety and effect of treatment with experimental antiviral drugs alone or in combination with ribavirin in treatment-naïve participants with genotype 1b hepatitis C infection. The study will test the safety and anti-viral activity of two regimens administered for a duration of 12 weeks. Secondary objectives of this study are to determine the pharmacokinetics of the study drugs when co-administered, and to evaluate HCV RNA kinetics during treatment.</detailed_description>
