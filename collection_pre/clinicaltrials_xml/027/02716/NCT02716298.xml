A person will be excluded from the study if he/she: Is participating in any concurrent clinical or research study; Is a habitual wearer of lotrafilcon B or enfilcon A lenses. Has any known active* ocular disease and/or infection; Has a systemic condition that in the opinion of the investigator may affect a study outcome variable; Is using any systemic or topical medications that in the opinion of the investigator may affect a study outcome variable; Has known sensitivity to the diagnostic pharmaceuticals to be used in the study; Is pregnant, lactating or planning a pregnancy at the time of enrollment; (by verbal confirmation at the Screening Visit) Is aphakic; Has undergone refractive error surgery; For the purposes of this study, active ocular disease is defined as infection or inflammation which requires therapeutic treatment. Mild (i.e. not considered clinically relevant) lid abnormalities (blepharitis, meibomian gland dysfunction, papillae), corneal and conjunctival staining and dry eye are not considered active ocular disease. Neovascularization and corneal scars are the result of previous hypoxia, infection or inflammation and are therefore not active.</criteria>
