	<brief_summary>Gastrointestinal vascular malformation (GIVM), which is an important cause of acute or chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, consequently is in dire of effective treatment. The investigators' previous study first confirmed thalidomide treatment of GIVM bleeding was safe and effective. This trial intends to investigate the efficiency of endoscopic intervention to the hemorrhage due to GIVM. What more, the research tends to suggest standardizing clinical paths for small bowel bleeding due to GIVM.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>the Efficiency of Endoscopic Treatment for Recurrent Small Intestinal Bleeding Due to Gastrointestinal Vascular Malformation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-institutional clinical trial investigates the efficacy of endoscopic intervention to the recurrent small intestinal hemorrhage due to GIVM. Patients with recurrent bleeding (&gt;2 times for one year) will undergo balloon assisted enteroscopy and be treated with endoscopic therapy if necessary. The hierarchical primary endpoints were the difference in yearly Bleeding times, followed (if significant) by the difference in Blood Transfusions, Total Transfused Red Cell Requirements, yearly bleeding Episodes, Bleeding Duration, yearly average Hemoglobin (Hb) level, hospitalization and iron requirement. The study will be done at 10 centers in China.</detailed_description>
