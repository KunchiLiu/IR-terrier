	<criteria>1. Subject is &gt; 18 years and &lt; 80 years of age 2. Written subject informed consent available prior to PCI 3. Subjects with stable or unstable angina pectoris or documented silent ischemia 4. Subject eligible for PCI 5. Subject acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass surgery 6. Subjects with a maximum of two single lesions in two separate coronary arteries which have to be de novo lesions. 7. Reference vessel diameter between 2.73.8 mm by visual estimation, depending on the scaffold size used. 8. Target lesion length by visual estimation, assisted by QCA: &lt; 21 mm, depending on the scaffold size used. 9. Target lesion stenosis by visual estimation, assisted by QCA &gt; 50% &lt; 100% 10. Eligible for Dual Anti Platelet Therapy (DAPT) 1. Pregnant or breastfeeding females or females who intend to become pregnant during the time of the study 2. Evidence of myocardial infarction within 72 hours prior to index procedure 3. Subjects with a ≥2 fold CK level or in absence of CK a ≥3 fold CKMB level above the upper range limit within 24 hours prior to the procedure 4. Left main coronary artery disease 5. Threevessel coronary artery disease at time of procedure 6. Thrombus in target vessel 7. Subject is currently participating in another study with an investigational device or an investigational drug and has not reached the primary endpoint yet 8. Planned interventional treatment of any nontarget vessel within 30 days post procedure 9. Subjects on dialysis 10. Planned intervention of the target vessel after the index procedure 11. Ostial target lesion (within 5.0 mm of vessel origin) 12. Target lesion involves a side branch &gt;2.0 mm in diameter 13. Documented left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 30% 14. Heavily calcified lesion 15. Target lesion is located in or supplied by an arterial or venous bypass graft 16. The target lesion requires treatment with a device other than the predilatation balloon prior to scaffold placement (including but not limited to directional coronary atherectomy, excimer laser, rotational atherectomy, etc.) 17. Unsuccessful predilatation, defined as minimal lumen diameter smaller than the respective crossing profile of DREAMS 2G and angiographic complications (e.g. distal embolization, side branch closure, extensive dissections that can't be covered by a single scaffold), by visual estimation 18. Known allergies to: Acetylsalicylic Acid (ASA), Heparin, contrast medium, Sirolimus, Everolimus or similar drugs (i.e., ABT 578, Biolimus, Tacrolimus), PLLA, Silicon Carbide Magnesium, Yttrium, Neodymium, Zirconium, Gadolinium, Dysprosium, Tantalum 19. Impaired renal function (serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dl or 221mmol/l) determined within 72 hours prior to intervention 20. Subject is receiving oral or intravenous immunosuppressive therapy ( inhaled steroids are not excluded) or has known lifelimiting immunosuppressive or autoimmune disease (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus, systemic lupus erythematosus, but not including diabetes mellitus) 21. Proximal or distal to the target lesion located stenosis that might require future revascularization or impede run off detected during diagnostic angiography 22. Life expectancy less than 1 year, or other comorbidities (e.g. Sepsis, Apoplexy or TIA within 6 months prior to the study procedure) (Comorbidities definitions will be left to the discretion of the Study Investigators) 23. Planned surgery or dental surgical procedure within 6 months after index procedure 24. Subject with tortuous vessel that may impair scaffold placement in the region of obstruction or proximal to the lesion 25. In the investigators opinion subjects will not be able to comply with the followup Requirements</criteria>
