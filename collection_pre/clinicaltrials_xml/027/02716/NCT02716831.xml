	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to test a novel, acceptance-based behavioral treatment for bulimia nervosa (BN) in weight-suppressed adults. This treatment is a type of individual psychotherapy called Nutritional Counseling And Acceptance-based Therapy (N-CAAT) that enhances existing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for BN by incorporating acceptance-based behavioral strategies and nutritional counseling to help patients high in weight suppression (WS) reduce the biobehavioral bind of WS and eliminate BN symptoms.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bulimia nervosa (BN) is an eating disorder characterized by a pattern of binge eating and compensatory behaviors as well as an overemphasis on body weight and shape in self-evaluation. BN has a lifetime prevalence rate of 1-3% and is associated with numerous psychiatric and medical complications. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is regarded as the gold-standard treatment for BN and the treatment approach with the most empirical support to date. However, although CBT has accumulated impressive empirical support for its effectiveness, CBT produces abstinence from binge eating and purging in only 30-50% of treatment completers. Furthermore, relapse is common and many individuals do not maintain treatment gains. Innovative treatments that can improve rates of remission among patients with BN and related disorders are sorely needed for bulimia nervosa and related eating disorders, particularly for individuals for whom existing treatments fail. Weight suppression (WS) is a robust predictor of bulimic symptomatology, being positively correlated with frequency of objective binge eating and purging in individuals with BN. A recent study found that women who experienced objective binge episodes were twice as weight suppressed (M = 8.8kg) than those without these eating problems (M = 4.4kg). Among patients with threshold or sub-threshold BN, greater WS at baseline predicted increased likelihood of persistent BN symptoms at 10-year follow-up. Furthermore, in the comparison group of those without bulimic symptomatology at baseline, higher WS predicted the onset of a bulimic syndrome at 10-year follow-up. WS appears to be uniquely predictive of binge eating and purging behavior rather than disordered eating behaviors more broadly (e.g. shape and weight concern, drive for thinness, BMI), suggesting that WS is not merely a marker of disease severity. This body of research suggests that WS may not only be an important factor in the maintenance of BN pathology, but may be a significant contributor to its etiology. Additionally, WS predicts remission and treatment outcome in BN. Butryn, Lowe, and Agras (2006) previously found that greater WS predicts poorer outcome in the cognitive-behavioral treatment of BN, perhaps because those higher in WS have greater difficulty normalizing eating without gaining weight. Although two more recent studies have failed to replicate this finding, both replication studies included patients whose average WS level was substantially lower than the mean level in the study by Butryn and colleagues (Carter, McIntosh, Joyce &amp; Bulik, 2008; Zunker, Crosby, Mitchell, Wonderlich, Peterson &amp; Crow, 2011). This might suggest that only relatively high levels of WS are relevant to treatment outcome. In a more recent study, level of WS at study entry predicted time to first full or partial remission from the disorder over 8 years of follow-up (Lowe, Swanson, Clark, Eddy, Franko, Shaw, Ross &amp; Herzog 2011). Novel treatments are needed to address the barriers to successful treatment of BN within patients high in WS. The high metabolic efficiency in those with elevated WS could help explain why WS has consistently predicted weight gain in several BN samples, over periods as short as several weeks and as long as five years. If greater WS in patients triggers greater weight gain, this may intensify dieting efforts and compensatory behaviors to slow or prevent weight gain, thus perpetuating BN symptoms. Patients appear to be in a "biobehavioral" bind, whereby they need to continue utilizing disordered eating symptoms to prevent weight re-gain, which may explain why individuals high in WS have poorer treatment outcome and require significantly longer time to achieve partial and full remission. Even modest weight gain, which may help patients high in WS experience fewer urges to binge and more effectively normalize their eating behavior, is highly distressing for patients with BN. Treatments that specifically address the added barriers faced by patients high in WS may be needed to improve treatment efficacy for this sub-group. In particular, approaches that can alter the biobehavioral bind by 1.) increasing willingness to increase caloric intake and experience modest weight re-gain during treatment despite distress and 2.) promoting more adaptive and healthy behaviors designed to stabilize weight gain could improve treatment efficacy. Existing CBT may be enhanced by incorporating acceptance-based behavioral strategies and nutritional counseling to help patients high in WS reduce the biobehavioral bind of WS and eliminate BN symptoms. Acceptance-based behavioral treatments (ABBTs) emphasize "changing what you can and accepting what you can't", which refers to a focus on learning how to accept and tolerate distressing internal experiences (e.g., thoughts, emotions, urges, physical sensations) that might not be directly under the patients' control while choosing to engage in adaptive behavioral choices that are within their control. Patients high in WS will likely need to gain weight to experience the improvements associated with a reduced biobehavioral bind (e.g., reduced urges to binge, greater ability to normalize eating behaviors), and will need to "accept" the distress that accompanies this weight gain. However patients may also benefit from the provision of more adaptive behavioral strategies to maintain weight in a healthy range, which is not a primary goal of existing behavioral treatments. Nutritional counseling (NC), which is designed to promote healthy, non-rigid dietary restraint and exercise habits, can lead to improvements in weight control that may also improve disordered eating behaviors. As described above, a primary maintenance factor for BN is the strict and rigid dieting behavior that triggers urges to binge. For patients high in WS, some degree of dietary restraint may be needed to stabilize weight gain and the provision of healthier and more functionally adaptive strategies to regulate weight could reduce the likelihood of engaging in disordered eating symptoms. Several studies have indicated that the provision of healthy restraint strategies to patients with BN can reduce binge eating and purging behaviors, suggesting that this approach can be an effective treatment alone or in combination with other behavioral techniques. Of most relevance to the current study, two recent clinical trials examined Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), the most widely studied ABBT, for eating pathology (Juarascio, Forman, &amp; Herbert, 2010; Juarascio, Shaw, Forman, Timko, Herbert, Butryn, Bunnell, Matteucci &amp; Lowe, 2013). The first study examined the treatment of sub-clinical eating pathology within the context of a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT) that compared standard CBT with ACT and found that those in the ACT condition experienced significantly greater reductions in eating pathology (as measured by the Eating Pathology Index, adapted from the SCOFF Assessment) (Juarascio et al., 2010). The principal investigator's dissertation examined whether the addition of ACT groups to treatment as usual (TAU) at a residential treatment facility for eating disorders could improve treatment outcome Those in the ACT condition showed greater reduction in global eating pathology by discharge (as measured by the Eating Disorder Examination), despite the fact that the ACT group was one of a dozen or more treatment groups patients received during their residential stay (Juarascio et al., 2013). Although WS was not formally assessed, a trend was observed in the PI's dissertation study such that individuals with lower starting weights (who were likely higher in WS) showed greater improvements in global EDE scores in the ACT+TAU condition. Study Objectives- - Test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of Nutritional Counseling And Acceptance-based Therapy (N-CAAT) for bulimia nervosa (BN) in a small pilot RCT trial - Assess the mechanisms of action to enhance treatment development - Evaluate the feasibility of recruitment, randomization, retention, assessment procedures, and implementation of the novel treatment to enhance the probability of success in subsequent larger RCTs The current study will evaluate the hypothesis that N-CAAT will successfully improve hypothesized clinical targets (e.g. distress tolerance, rigid dieting, weight suppression, biomarkers associated with metabolic efficiency and test the hypothesis that improvements in distress tolerance, rigid dieting, weight suppression, and biomarkers of metabolic efficiency will be associated with improvements in BN symptoms.</detailed_description>
