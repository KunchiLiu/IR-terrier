	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate renal function in participants with metastatic bone disease due to breast cancer receiving intravenous (IV) infusions of ibandronate (Bondronat) 6 milligrams (mg), over either 15 minutes or 60 minutes, every 3 weeks. Efficacy and safety of ibandronate in the 2 groups of participants will also be compared. The anticipated time on study treatment is 7 months, and the target sample size is 318 individuals.</brief_summary>
