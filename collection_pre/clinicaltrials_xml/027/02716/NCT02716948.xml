	<brief_summary>This phase I pilot trial studies the side effects of stereotactic radiosurgery and nivolumab in treating patients with newly diagnosed melanoma that has spread to the brain or spine. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor to more precisely target the cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving stereotactic radiosurgery together with nivolumab may be a better treatment for melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SRS and Nivolumab in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Melanoma Metastases in the Brain or Spine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety profile of stereotactic radiosurgery with nivolumab in combination to treat patients with newly diagnosed melanoma brain or spinal metastases. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate local control rate in brain and spine. II. To estimate systematic control rate. III. To estimate progression-free survival. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore peripheral blood immune response during and after treatment. OUTLINE: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Patients then undergo stereotactic radiosurgery on day 8 per standard of care. Courses with nivolumab repeats every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 10 weeks, and then every 3 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
