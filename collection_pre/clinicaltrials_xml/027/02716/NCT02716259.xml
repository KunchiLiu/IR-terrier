	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether basic periodontal therapy aim to reduce subgingival levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, has an impact on the vascular function of patients suffering from established cardiovascular disease.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design: randomized clinical trial, parallel design, double blinded. Sample: 120 patients from the Cardiology Department of Hospital Severo Ochoa (Leganés, Madrid) suffering from established cardiovascular disease and generalized moderate/severe periodontitis. Sixty patients will be randomized to test group (scaling and root planing + systemic antimicrobials), and the other 60 subjects will be included in the control group, consisting on delayed periodontal treatment (supragingival prophylaxis + placebo). Study visits: Visit 1: screening Visit 2: baseline data collection (medical history, clinical variables, gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples, vascular function) Visit 3: panoramic x-ray, blood samples, randomization and first treatment session. Visit 4: second treatment session. Visit 5: 24 hours inflammatory biomarkers assessment. Visit 6: 7 days inflammatory biomarkers assessment. Visit 7: 1 month follow up (clinical variables) Visit 8: 3 months follow up (clinical variables, vascular function) and supportive periodontal therapy. Visit 9: 6 months follow up (clinical variables, GCF samples, inflammatory biomarkers, vascular function) and supportive periodontal therapy.</detailed_description>
