	<brief_summary>This study will be targeting patients suffering from acute brain injury (ABI), including those with severe trauma brain injury (sTBI) and those with aneurysmal sub arachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). This clinical study is an open-label, non-randomized, single-center, exploratory metabolic study. The primary objective is to determine changes from baseline (before enteral administration of Peptamen AF) in plasma and brain extracellular levels of MCFAs and Ketone bodies in sTBI patients upon Peptamen AF nutritional support.</brief_summary>
