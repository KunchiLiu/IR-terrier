	<brief_summary>Preterm birth remains the most common cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. A short cervi- cal length on transvaginal ultrasonography has been shown to be one of the best predictors of preterm birth. In 2005 a meta-analysis by Berghella et al. showed that cervical cerclage does not prevent preterm birth (PTB) in women with short cervical lenght without prior PTB. However maybe the meta-analysis did not reach the statistical significance due to the small sample size</brief_summary>
