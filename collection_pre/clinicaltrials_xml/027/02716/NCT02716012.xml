	<brief_summary>This is a First in Human study of a new single agent (MTL-CEBPA) in patients with advanced cancer of the liver. The study is in two parts. The first part is a dose escalation in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma or patients presenting with secondary liver tumours. The second part is a dose expansion study in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. All participants will be refractory to or ineligible for loco-regional therapy including surgery, radiofrequency tumour ablation or transarterial chemoembolisation and sorafenib. MTL-CEBPA consists of a double stranded RNA formulated into a SMARTICLES® liposomal nanoparticle and is designed to activate the CEBPA gene.</brief_summary>
