	<brief_title>Study to Determine D-Amino Acid Oxidase Brain Enzyme Occupancy of TAK-831 After Single-Dose Oral Administration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-831. TAK-831 is a highly selective and potent inhibitor of d-amino oxidase (DAO), a peroxisomal enzyme active towards neutral D-amino acids which potentially effects cerebellar dysfunction. This study will look at the relationship between TAK-831 plasma exposure and the extent and duration of brain DAO enzyme occupancy after single oral dosing of TAK-831 in healthy male participants using [18F]PGM299 radioactive tracer injection and PET imaging. The study will enroll up to 22 participants in two different sets. Up to 16 participants will be enrolled in Set A. Within that total, up to 5 dose levels of TAK-831 may be evaluated, with up to 6 participants per dose level, although typically, there will be 2 to 3 participants per dose level. All participants in Set A will also receive up to 3 doses of [18F]PGM299. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled in Set B. All participants in Set B will be assigned to single treatment group to receive 2 doses of [18F]PGM299. All participants in Set A will be asked to take single oral dose of TAK-831 suspension on Day 1. In Set A, each of the participant will receive a maximum of 3 PET scans with [18F]PGM299; 1 at baseline 2 following a single oral dose of TAK-831 on Day 1 and 5. In Set B, each of the participant will receive 2 PET scans with [18F]PGM299 on Day 1 and 5. Set B will be conducted after the confirmation of blockade of [18F]PGM299 binding by TAK-831 in 2 to 4 participants of Set A. This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United Kingdom. The overall time to participate in this study is 62 days. Participants in Set A will make 4 visits to the clinic, and participants in Set B will make 3 visits to the clinic and all will be contacted by telephone on Day 15 (Set A) and Day 12 (Set B) of treatment period for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>

Has uncontrolled, clinically significant, neurologic (including seizure disorder), cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, metabolic, gastrointestinal, urologic, immunologic, or endocrine disease or psychiatric disorder, or other abnormality, which may impact the ability of the participant to participate or potentially confound the study results. 4. Has a known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation of TAK831 or related compounds, or to [18 F]PGM299 or to any of its components. 5. Has a positive urine or breath test result for drugs of abuse (defined as any illicit drug use), ethanol (alcohol), or cotinine at Screening, Checkin for Baseline Imaging/Confinement Period 1, or Checkin for the Treatment/Confinement Period 2(Day 1) for a participant participating in Set A or at Screening, Checkin for Tracer TEST PET Imaging/Confinement Period 1, or Checkin for RETEST PET Imaging/Confinement Period 2 for a participant participating in Set B. 6. Has a history of drug abuse (defined as any illicit drug use) or a history of ethanol (alcohol) abuse within 1 year prior to the Screening Visit or is unwilling to agree to abstain from ethanol (alcohol) and drugs throughout the study. 7. Has taken any medication, supplements, or food products during the time periods listed in the Excluded Medications and Dietary Products table. 8. Intends to donate sperm during the course of this study or for 90 days after the last dose of study medication. 9. Has evidence of current cardiovascular, central nervous system, hepatic, or hematopoietic disease; renal, metabolic or endocrine dysfunction; serious allergy, asthma, hypoxemia, hypertension, or allergic skin rash; or there is any finding in the participant's medical history, physical examination, or safety laboratory tests giving reasonable suspicion of a disease that would contraindicate taking TAK831 or a similar drug in the same class, which might interfere with the conduct of the study. This includes, but is not limited to, peptic ulcer disease and cardiac arrhythmias. 10. Has current or recent (within 6 months) gastrointestinal (GI) disease that would be expected to influence the absorption of drugs (i.e., a history of malabsorption), any surgical intervention known to impact absorption (e.g., bariatric surgery or bowel resection), esophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease, erosive esophagitis, or frequent (more than once per week) occurrence of heartburn. 11.
