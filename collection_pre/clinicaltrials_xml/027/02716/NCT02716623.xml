	<brief_title>The Feasibility of a Diet and Exercise Intervention in Diabetics During Treatment for Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will examine the effects of a carbohydrate restricted (CR) diet in bladder cancer patients with diabetes. The goal of this pilot study is to determine if the CR diet and exercise routine are feasible for this patient population to follow. Participants in this study will receive meals tailored to their specific needs. A registered dietitian will work with them to establish guidelines for the meals and to follow their progress throughout the study. Participants will be asked to be in this study for up to 12 months. A participant will be asked to make a total of 16 in-person visits over the course of 12 months.</detailed_description>
