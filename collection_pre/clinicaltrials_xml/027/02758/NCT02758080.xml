	<brief_summary>A molecular profile of a patient with hematologic malignancy, for whom standard-of-care had failed, is identified using next generation sequencing. Patients are assigned to early clinical trials of targeted agent based on the molecular profiling or physician's choice. The improvement of outcomes in the intention-to-treat population is investigated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Matching Patients With Hematologic Malignancy to Adequate Clinical Trials</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most of hematologic malignancy patient becomes incurable with standard treatment during their disease course. Although these patients are recommended to participate in an early phase clinical trials, the response rate have reported be only 4 to 6 percent. Over several decades, a lot of cancer driving mutations has been identified, and targeted agents directed at the mutations are continuously developed and studied in many clinical trials. Most of the clinical trials recruited participants regardless of mutational status of them. Recently, however, participants has been recruited in recent clinical trials according to the presence of specific mutations. The response rate of these recent clinical trials is 12-75%. In this pragmatic clinical trial, cancer driving mutations in hematologic malignancy patients is identified using next generation sequencing, and assign patients to an appropriate clinical trial which is anticipated to exhibit the best response. The improvement of outcome of this biomarker-driven assignment is investigated.</detailed_description>
