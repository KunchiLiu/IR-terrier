	<brief_summary>Anesthetics agents has an effect on immune response during the cancer surgery.This influence can regulatory to immune activity or cancer cell survival. The purpose of this study is to prove the variation of immune cell activity between preoperative and postoperative period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anesthetic Effect on Immune Cell in Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patients were allocated randomly to receive propofol or sevoflurane. Also, a total of 18ml of blood sample was obtained for total 3 times in consecutive order. 1. immediate before anesthesia induction 2. postoperative 1 hours 3. postoperative 24 hours Immune cells isolation from patients peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Next, immune cell were co-culture with human cancer cell line (MCF-7) for 24 hours. investigation for immune cell or cancer cell survival by flow cytometry.</detailed_description>
