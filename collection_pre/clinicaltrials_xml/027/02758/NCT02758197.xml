	<brief_title>Online MBSR Program for Cancer Survivors With Chronic Neuropathic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic neuropathic pain (CNP) affects close to 50% of cancer survivors. Even with the best medical treatment, some survivors continue to experience disabling pain. In our recent survey with cancer survivors, we found that the capacity to be aware of different aspects of one's day-to-day experiences, without judgment or reactivity (i.e., being mindful) predicted decreased pain intensity, pain related disability, and increased health-related quality of life among cancer survivors with CNP. Building on these findings, the present randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effectiveness of an online Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program for cancer survivors with moderate to severe CNP. The program will benefit patients in rural and remote regions and patients with mobility issues. We will recruit 100 cancer survivors. All will have their medical treatment optimized by a pain specialist. Additionally, they will complete an 8-week online MBSR program. We hypothesize that the online MBSR program will result in less pain perception, better function and increased health-related quality of life. We will also examine the effects of the MBSR training on biomarkers of stress and immune function.</detailed_description>
