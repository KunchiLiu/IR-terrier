	<detailed_description>Pelvic floor disorders can significantly affect a woman's quality of life, yet many feel uncomfortable openly discussing these topics. Treatments include lifestyle modification, medications, and/or surgery. "Decisional conflict" arises when patients have difficulty choosing between several viable treatment options. Factors contributing to decisional conflict include biased information, poor peer support, and unaddressed fears. Effective counselling may help address these factors. There are few studies on how decision coaching can help women with prolapse and incontinence reach a satisfactory decision about treatment. This study aims to use the principals of shared decision making to address decisional conflict surrounding treatment for pelvic floor disorders. Specifically, the investigators will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of small group workshops on pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence led by a nurse continence advisor and a psychologist (decision coach). Results of this study will inform future development of interdisciplinary, patient-centered approaches to enhanced decision making in women's health.</detailed_description>
