	<brief_summary>A prospective, open-label, multicentre phase-II trial of ibrutinib plus venetoclax plus obinutuzumab in physically fit (CIRS ≤ 6 &amp; normal creatinine clearance) and unfit (CIRS &gt; 6 &amp; creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min) patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with TP53 deletion (17p-) and/or mutation</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Ibrutinib Plus Venetoclax Plus Obinutuzumab in Patients With CLL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with TP53 deletion (17p-) and/or mutation has a poor prognosis. Different therapeutic strategies have been tested over the last decade such as fludarabine-based regimens, alemtuzumab, bendamustine alone or with rituximab, lenalidomide, or ofatumumab, but all without compelling evidence for success. For example, with the FCR regimen as the standard 1st line treatment for fit CLL patients, only 5% (1 of 22) of patients with 17p deletion had a complete response (CR) and 40% of patients were free of disease progression at 12 months in the CLL8 Trial. New agents like Bruton's Tyrosin Kinase (BTK) inhibitors such as ibrutinib have shown promising results in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL, however, outcome of CLL patients with 17p deletion is inferior to other subgroups. The CLL11 trial revealed an impressive improvement in efficacy with GA-101 (obinutuzumab) as compared to rituximab when combined with Chlorambucil. Moreover, the BCL2 antagonist venetoclax (previously GDC-0199/ABT-199), tested as a single agent in relapsed / refractory CLL patients, showed striking activity with tumor lysis syndrome as dose limiting toxicity. Consequently, the current trial will test a combination regimen consisting of obinutuzumab, ibrutinib and venetoclax (the "GIVe" regimen) as first line treatment in CLL patients with TP53 deletion (17p-) and/or mutation with the aim to demonstrate efficacy in this population at highest unmet medical need. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of the GIVe regimen in patients with TP53 deletion (17p-) and/or mutation and previously untreated CLL requiring treatment. For this, the CR rate at cycle 15 (d1; final restaging) will be used as primary parameter for efficacy. The CR rate is defined as the proportion of patients having achieved a CR or a CR with incomplete recovery of the bone marrow (CRi) as best response (according to iwCLL criteria) until cycle 15 (d1; final restaging) from start of therapy. Efficacy of the regimen will be further assessed by evaluation of the proportion of patients free of disease progression (PD-free rate) after 12 cycles of therapy, overall response rate (ORR), minimal residual disease (MRD) and overall survival as well as other time to event endpoints as outlined below. A further secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of ibrutinib, venetoclax and obinutuzumab.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Have documented CLL according to iwCLL criteria, measurable disease (lymphocytosis &gt; 5x109 and/or palpable and measurable lymph nodes by physical exam and/or organomegaly assessed by physical exam) 2. Subjects must have untreated CLL, i.e. no prior chemotherapy, antibody therapy or nonchemotherapeutic agent (BTK, PI3K, BCL2 inhibitor or similar). Local irradiation or short term (up to 1 month) corticosteroid treatment for autoimmune phenomena are allowed 3. Subjects must have TP53 deletion (17p) and/or mutation (in bone marrow or peripheral blood), with preexisting local test results confirmed by central laboratory in Ulm 4. CLL requiring treatment ("active disease") according to the iwCLL criteria 5. ECOG ≤ 2 6. Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min calculated according to the modified formula of Cockcroft and Gault or directly measured after 24 h urine collection 7. Adequate liver function as indicated by a total bilirubin ≤ 2 x, AST, and ALT ≤ 3 x the institutional ULN value, unless directly attributable to the patient's CLL or to Gilbert's Syndrome 8. No cardiovascular disability of New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class &gt; 2. Class 2 is defined as comfortability at rest but moderate physical activity causes dyspnoea, angina pain or fatigue 9. Adequate bone marrow function (unless directly attributable to CLL, BM examination required): ANC ≥ 1000/µl or ANC &lt; 1000/µl, if attributable to the underlying CLL (growth factor support may be administered after screening) Platelets &gt; 30.000/µl (unless directly attributable to the underlying CLL) Hemoglobin ≥ 8g/dl (unless directly attributable to the underlying CLL) 10. Negative serological testing for hepatitis B (i.e. HBsAg negative and antiHBc negative, patients positive for antiHBc may be included if PCR for HBV DNA is negative) negative testing for hepatitisC RNA and negative HIV test within 6 weeks prior to registration. [Patients who are HBsAg negative/antiHBc positive with undetectable serum HBV DNA should be monitored closely (every month) for HBV DNA by a realtime PCR quantification assay with a lower limit of detection of the order of 10 WHO IU/mL until at least 24 months after the last treatment cycle with obinutuzumab. If the HBV DNA assay becomes positive, patients should preemptively be treated with a nucleoside analogue (i.e. lamivudine) for at 24 months after the last cycle of therapy with obinutuzumab or be referred to a gastroenterologist for management.] 11.
