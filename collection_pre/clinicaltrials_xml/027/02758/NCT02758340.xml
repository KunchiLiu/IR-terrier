	<detailed_description>Artificial initiation of labor pains has become a common occurrence. A variety of methods are employed to initiate labor pains. Labor pains are more successful in culminating into vaginal delivery if the neck of womb that is the cervix is soft (ripe). This is usually achieved by ripening agents. They include drugs and devices that help soften the cervix. Misoprostol and foley's balloon catheter both are used to soften the cervix so that vaginal delivery is possible. Both work on different aspects of the softening of cervix. Misoprostol acts on shortening the cervix and making it more pliable Foley's balloon helps to open up the cervix that is it aids in dilating the cervical canal.</detailed_description>
