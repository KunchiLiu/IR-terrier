	<brief_summary>The overall objective is to determine the impact of EED on total daily zinc absorption of young Bangladeshi children (18-24 months of age) in an austere setting with high rates of diarrhea, stunting, and micro-nutrient deficiencies..</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of EED on Zn Absorption and Retention in Children From a MNP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participating children are screened for EED using the lactulose:mannitol ratio test and assigned to one of two groups: +EED or -EED. After assignment to one of the two groups, proposed subjects will be randomized to one of four supplement groups: Micronutrient powder (MNP) with 15 mg Zn, MNP with 10 mg Zn, MNP with 5 mg Zn, and MNP with 0 mg Zn. Children will receive the supplement once with a meal on Day 8 of the study. Absorption of zinc from the supplement and from other non-supplemented meals will be determined using zinc stable isotope technology.</detailed_description>
