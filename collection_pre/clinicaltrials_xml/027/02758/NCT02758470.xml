	<brief_summary>The objective of this research is to assess the effects of acetazolamide and methazolamide on respiratory and limb muscle fatigue development. A fatiguing protocol will be conducted for the respiratory and plantar flexor muscles and the difference in pressure/torque produced by supramaximal nerve stimulation used to assess muscle fatigue between conditions.</brief_summary>
