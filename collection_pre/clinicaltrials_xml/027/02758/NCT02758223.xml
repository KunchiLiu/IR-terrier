	<brief_summary>PACT is a non-randomized multicentre phase I/II study to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the prophylactic administration of donor derived TCM. Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) who are planned to undergo a HLA -matched (9/10 or 10/10) allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and who are either 50+ years old or have a high comorbidity score are included according to criteria as described below. TCM will be applied in escalating doses to a maximum of 30 patients who have received T cell depleted Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched alloHSCT grafts and qualify for TCM transfer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prophylactic Application of Donor-derived TCM After Allogeneic HSCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One of the major challenges in the field of allo-SCT is to find a balance between the harmful induction of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and the beneficial graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) response, both mediated by donor T cells recognizing antigens expressed on cells of the recipient. Complete removal of T cells from the graft results in abrogation of severe GVHD, but is also frequently associated with removal of the immunity against infectious agents and the anti-tumor efficacy (GVT effect), which is reflected by an increased incidence of infectious complications and (early) disease relapses after T cell depleted allo-SCT. The investigators hypothesize that the prophylactic adoptive transfer of donor-derived central memory T cells is a safe and tolerable method to improve overall survival after HSCT. TCM are administered in escalating doses at day 30, day 60 and day 90 posttransplant to prevent infectious complications and early relapse or disease progression.</detailed_description>
