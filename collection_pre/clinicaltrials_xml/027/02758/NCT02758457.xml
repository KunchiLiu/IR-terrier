	<brief_summary>The objective of this study was to compare the 5-year survival and clinical behavior of single posterior ceramic crowns made with pressable ceramic on zirconia or on a metal framework. If failures occurred, the further aim of the study was to delineate the factors contributing to the failure. The null hypothesis stated that the survival of zirconia-based restorations would be no worse that those made with metal-based material.</brief_summary>
