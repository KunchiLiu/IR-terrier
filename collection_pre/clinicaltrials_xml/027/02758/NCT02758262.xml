	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is to identify brain mechanisms by which Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) could decrease hyperphagia. The investigators will synchronously deliver NIBS and measure brain activity in a randomized, crossover, sham-controlled, fully blind study. This work will reveal brain mechanisms to reduce hyperphagia and may contribute to new therapeutic avenues to treat this eating disorder.</brief_summary>
