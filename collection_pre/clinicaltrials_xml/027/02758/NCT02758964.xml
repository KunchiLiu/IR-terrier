	<detailed_description>Calcific aortic valve stenosis is the most common cause of aortic stenosis (AS) among adults in Europe and in the United States. The prevalence of moderate or severe AS was found to be age-dependent rising from 0.02% in patients aged 18-44 years to 2.8% in patients aged ≥ 75 years. Among patients at prohibitive surgical risk, TAVR has become the treatment of choice.The safety and efficacy of TAVR compared with medical management and SAVR has been demonstrated in clinical trials.The composite of the rate of all-cause death or stroke was 27% and 37% in TAVR patients after 1 and 2 years, respectively.Even though parts of the strokes occur during the peri-procedural period, the patients remain at risk of stroke throughout the first months after the procedure. EARTH-TAVR is a diagnostic multicenter study performing in association with the GALILEO trial (NCT02556203), which is investigating cerebral embolization with MRI and neurocognitive testing in patients undergoing TAVR, who are treated with anticoagulation (Rivaroxaban/ASS) or DAPT (Clopidogrel/ASS). GALILEO is a global multicenter, open-label, randomized, event-driven, active-controlled study comparing a rivaroxaban-based antithrombotic strategy to an antiplatelet-based strategy after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) to optimize clinical outcomes. Investigators aim to investigate peri-interventional and delayed cerebral embolization in the early period (3 months) after TAVR and to analyze associations between neurocognitive parameters and cerebral embolization patterns in patients on different antithrombotic treatment regimes.</detailed_description>
