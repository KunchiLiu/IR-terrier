	<brief_summary>The use of drug coated balloon (DCB) in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) and tissue loss has recently raised some concerns after the IN.PACT deep trial using paclitaxel coated balloon angioplasty in the tibial arteries was terminated. The investigators objective is to establish the safety and efficacy of drug coated balloon (DCB) for femoropopliteal occlusive disease in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) and tissue loss.

	<brief_title>Evaluation of Paclitaxel in Patients With CLI and Femoropopliteal Occlusive Disease Treated With DCB Angioplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although the association between the drug coated balloon (DCB) therapy and limb outcomes could not be clearly linked to the use of antiproliferative agents, the findings of paclitaxel crystals downstream of the treated lesions, although in small amounts, has raised concerns about the safety of such therapy in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) and tissue loss. These concerns, however, may not translate to patients with femoropopliteal occlusive disease as the amount of paclitaxel reaching the foot may be even smaller after being filtered by the calf musculature. Since the use of DCB angioplasty in the Superficial Femoral Artery (SFA) and popliteal has been shown to deliver significantly more durable outcomes compared to standard angioplasty alone, with reported primary patency rates of almost 90% at one year, this therapy may even be more needed in patients with tissue loss where prolonged patency is essential for wound healing.</detailed_description>
