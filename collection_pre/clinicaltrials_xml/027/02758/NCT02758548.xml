	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the accuracy of the Novel point of care test (POCT) total IgE assay in atopic patients. 120 patients with atopic conditions and approximately 40 healthy subjects will be enrolled. Fingerstick capillary blood samples will be collected and tested in the POCT device. Venous samples will be collected and sent to a reference laboratory for measurement of serum total IgE using the reference immunoassay method.</brief_summary>
