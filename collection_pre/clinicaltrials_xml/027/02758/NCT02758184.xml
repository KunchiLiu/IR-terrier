	<brief_title>Effectiveness of ROTEM-based Coagulation Surveillance on Reducing Blood Product Utilization During Complex Spine Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of intra-operative ROTEM-based coagulation monitoring on reducing total blood product use during complex spine surgery. The primary outcome will include estimated blood losses and blood product utilization during and after surgery (48 hours). Secondary outcomes also include hospital length of stay, and cost analysis of the 2 methodologies.</detailed_description>

Normal coagulation profile (PT/INR, aPTT) and normal platelets count on preoperative evaluation. 4. Preoperative hemoglobin Level &gt;10 g/dl. 5. OR time &gt; 4 hours. 6. No contraindication for the use of antifibrinolytic therapy (Tranexamic acid). 1. Age &lt; 18 or age &gt; 80 years old. 2. Anterior spine surgeries or posterior spine surgeries involving &lt;5 levels. 3. Minimally invasive spine surgeries. 4. Patients with known coagulopathies or bleeding tendencies or patients with abnormal coagulation laboratory values at baseline. 5. Patients with Hemoglobin level of &lt;10 g/dl on preoperative baseline laboratory values. 6. Trauma and Emergency spine surgeries. 7.
