	<brief_summary>Food will decrease stomach acidity due to its buffering effect.This has implications when providing drugs that are dosed with food but require higher levels of stomach acid, such as some medications commonly used for HIV patients. This study will attempt to determine the dose of betaine hydrochloride (over the counter acid supplement) at which the effect of food on stomach acid could be countered. Additionally, this study will evaluate the ability of a natural supplement (betaine hydrochloride) to affect the gastric pH following a standardized meal in healthy volunteers. The investigators predict that 4500mg of betaine hydrochloride will have the greatest effect on gastric pH.</brief_summary>
