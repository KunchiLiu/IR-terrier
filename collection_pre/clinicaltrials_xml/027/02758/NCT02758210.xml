	<brief_title>Evaluating the Electro Magnetic Interference of Using Tablet and Smart Phone on Leadless Pacemaker (MICRA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With advancement in technology people are exposed to new sources of electromagnetic field like Tablet, smart phones etc. There are magnets in Smart Phones and Tablets that could affect the functions of pacemakers. The main purpose of this study is to study effects of Electromagnetic field exposure using a Tablet and smartphone on participants that have a Leadless Pacemaker (MICRA device) implanted inside them. Participants will be asked to report any symptoms that they might experience during the testing.</detailed_description>
