	<brief_summary>Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a life-changing condition that affects women in their reproductive age. There is a lack of reports which focus on how to improve the reproductive outcome of these women who wish to conceive spontaneously or use assisted conception with their own oocytes. However, one could surmise that it is important to lower gonadotropin levels into the physiological range before embarking on any treatment, even if natural conception is the only choice for the woman/couple.</brief_summary>
