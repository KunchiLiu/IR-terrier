	<brief_summary>This randomized clinical trial studies how well high volume washing of the abdomen works in increasing survival after surgery in patients with pancreatic cancer that can be removed by surgery. High volume washings may remove free floating cancers present after surgery and help prolong survival in patients with pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Volume Washing of the Abdomen in Increasing Survival After Surgery in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer That Can Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Overall survival (OS) (18 to 27 months after resection). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Disease free survival (DFS). II. Complication rate. III. Site of first-recurrence (by site, and distant vs. local). IV. Clearance of malignant cells pre vs. post-lavage. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms. Arm I (EIPL-S) extensive intraoperative peritoneal saline lavage: Patients undergo pancreaticoduodenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, or total pancreatectomy. Immediately after removal of tumor, patients receive extensive intraoperative peritoneal saline (EIPL-S) lavage 10 times over 15 minutes. Arm II (EIPL-D) extensive intraoperative peritoneal distilled water lavage: Patients undergo pancreaticoduodenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, or total pancreatectomy. Immediately after removal of tumor, patients receive extensive intraoperative peritoneal distilled water (EIPL-D) lavage 10 times over 15 minutes. Arm III (NO LAVAGE): Patients undergo pancreaticoduodenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, or total pancreatectomy with no extensive lavage after removal of tumor. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.</detailed_description>
