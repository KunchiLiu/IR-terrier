	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to establish the safety of using a moderate escalation of radiotherapy dose in advanced/poor prognosis OPC and LH cancers receiving curative radiotherapy. The study will also explore the efficacy (improvement in complete response rates at 2 years) of dose escalation in intermediate and high risk OPC and LH cancers patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Versus Standard in Laryngopharyngeal Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with locally advanced Laryngeal, Hypopharyngeal (LH) or oropharyngeal (OPC) head and neck squamous cell carcinomas have 5 year survival ranging between 25-45%. 60% of all LH cancers occur in the developing world and its incidence in India ranges from 1.8-8.8 per 1,00,000 population . Local control outcomes of OPC patients with stage III and IV OPC has been modest with reported loco-regional control rates of 50-60% at 5 years. For patients with locally advanced LH a 60-70% 2 year survival is seen and loco-regional control rates of 70% have been reported . Majority of locally advanced OPC and LH cancers are treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy (CRT) with organ and function preserving approach. Identifying the area of tumour involvement in the OPC and LH could be challenging on CECT scans, requiring metabolic imaging with PET-CT for more precise definition of radiation target. Improvements in radiation treatment delivery techniques have enabled clinicians to explore the possibility of improving tumour control probability (TCP) and reduce normal tissue complication probability . This allows us to explore the role of escalating dose in the above group of patients to assess the safety and efficacy of the regime. Tumours treated in the standard dose arm will receive radiotherapy @ 220 cGy per fraction for 30 fractions whilst those in the escalated dose arm will receive @ 245 cGy per fraction for 30 fractions using IMRT techniques. Patients in both arms will receive weekly platinum based chemotherapy concurrent with radiotherapy.</detailed_description>
