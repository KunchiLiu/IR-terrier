	<brief_summary>This study evaluates whether different explanations given to patients with long lasting back pain influence a physical therapy treatment technique. Half of the patients will receive an explanation of the proposed treatment technique focusing on how their joints are moving and not moving. The second half of the group will receive the same treatment technique as the first group, but their explanation of the technique's purpose will focus on how their brain interprets the information. The study aims to determine if patients have a different response to the treatment based on the words chosen to explain the technique.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Manual Therapy as a Form of Sensory Discrimination in Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traditional treatment provided by physical therapists to patients with chronic low back pain focuses on the biomechanical or anatomical impact to local tissues. Recent research has shown that treatment effects may be more related to the understanding of the structural and functional changes in the brain of someone suffering from chronic low back pain. This research implicates that the patients understanding and interpretation of input to the brain may change the patient's perceived representation and interpretation of output of pain within the brain.</detailed_description>
