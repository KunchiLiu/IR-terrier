	<criteria>1. Male or Female 2. Age 18 60 3. Symptoms or manifestation secondary to gastroparesis such as vomiting, nausea, the feeling you are full after you start eating, bloating and abdominal pain. 4. Subjects must have a comprehensive evaluation to eliminate other causes of their symptoms which includes gastric emptying scintigraphy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), and the patient's subjective symptoms. 5. Subject has signed informed consent for the administration of domperidone that informs the patient of potential adverse events including: increased prolactin levels extrapyramidal side effects breast changes cardiac arrhythmias including QT prolongation and death 6. Female subjects must be: surgically sterile (have had a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation) if sexual active, practicing an effective method of birth control such as hormonal prescription oral contraceptives, progesterone implants or injections, contraceptive patch, intrauterine device, or maintenance of a monogamous relationship with a male partner who has been surgically sterilized by vasectomy. A double barrier method such as condoms, diaphragms, or cervical caps with spermicidal foam, cream, or gel may be used as a method of birth control 1.
