	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if it is safe to deliver a CD8+T cell therapy to patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancers. This study will use your tumor cells (either from a fresh biopsy or from leftover tissue samples) and blood to help create a T cell immune-based therapy designed specifically for you based on what the study doctor and research staff can learn about the type of mutated proteins (a type of genetic change) in the tumor.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Leukapheresis and Tissue Collection: If you are eligible and agree, you will be consented and enrolled under a separate protocol, PA14-0138, to have the leukapheresis procedure performed. Leukapheresis is a special type of blood draw procedure that separates the red blood cells, white blood cells, and other parts of your blood from each other. The consent form for this protocol will explain how the leukapheresis procedure is performed and its risks. The white blood cells collected from leukapheresis will be used in this study. You will need tumor tissue available for this study. If you do not have enough tumor tissue available, you will be consented and enrolled in a separate protocol, PA15-0176 for the tumor tissue collection. The consent form for PA15-0176 will explain how the tissue will be collected and its risks. After the tissue and blood cells have been collected, your T cell product will be made. Standard of Care Chemotherapy: You must receive at least 1 type of chemotherapy after you are enrolled in this study but before your T cell dose. There is no limit to the number or types of chemotherapy you may receive. Your study doctor will decide when you will enter the treatment part of this study. In general you will have exhausted all standard chemotherapy options before you receive your T cell product. Within 28 days after your last dose of chemotherapy: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and for genetic mutation and immune system testing. The routine blood draw will include a pregnancy test if you can become pregnant. - You will have a CT scan to check the status of the disease. - A date will be chosen for your T cell infusion. Cyclophosphamide Administration: Two (2) days before your CD8+T cell infusion, you will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over 30 minutes. Cyclophosphamide will be given at a low dose to weaken the body's natural defense against the T-cell transplant, so that the transplanted T-cells have a chance to grow and multiply. CD8+T Cell Infusion: You will be admitted to the hospital the day before your CD8+T cell infusion (Day 0). The infusion will take about 2 hours. After the T cell infusion, you will be monitored overnight for any side effects. On Day 0: - You will have a physical exam. - 6 tablespoons of blood will be drawn for routine, genetic, and immune system testing. Aldesleukin (IL-2) Administration: Starting within 6 hours after the cell infusion and then 2 times a day after that for 14 days, you will have an aldesleukin injection into your skin around your abdomen. Aldesleukin is given to help the survival of the infused CD8+T cells. You will be taught how to give yourself these injections, and you will be given needles, syringes and other supplies so that you can finish the 14-day course at home. Pembrolizumab Administration: Pembrolizumab will be given about 24 hours after the T cell infusion by vein over about 30 to 60 minutes. Pembrolizumab takes away the natural immune system process that would stop the CD8+T cells. You will have additional infusions 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 weeks after the T cell infusion. Study Visits: On Day +3, and Day 1 of Weeks 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 24: - You will have a physical exam (except for weeks 1 and 2). - Blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and genetic mutation and immune system testing. During Weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24, you will have a CT scan to check the status of the disease. Length of Study: After the T cell infusion, you may receive pembrolizumab for up to 6 total doses. You will no longer be able to be on the study if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your participation on the study will be over about 6 months after your T cell infusion. Follow-Up: You will be called 2 times by the study staff in the 6 months after you are off the study and asked about any side effects you may have had. Each call should last about 10 minutes. If you left the study because you had side effects, you will be called by the study staff until that side effect has gone away or has become stable. This is an investigational study. The CD8+T cell infusion is not FDA-approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the T cell therapy is designed to work. Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histopathologic documentation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, esophageal cancer and gastric cancer with radiographic evidence of metastatic disease. 2. Male or female subjects greater than or equal to 18 years of age. 3. ECOG/ Zubrod performance status of 0 or 1. 4. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized. Suggested precautions should be used to minimize the risk or pregnancy for at least 1 month before start of therapy, and while women are on study for at least 8 weeks after pembrolizumab is stopped. WOCBP include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal. Acceptable forms of birth control include condom, diaphragm, hormonal, IUD, or sponge plus spermicide. Abstinence is also an acceptable form of birth control. 5. Men must be willing and able to use an acceptable method of birth control, during and for at least 3 months after completion of the study, if their sexual partners are WOCBP. 6. Willing and able to give informed consent. 7. Adequate vein access: consider PICC or other central line. 8. Patients must have adequate tissue (fresh or frozen) available or planned removal of adequate tissue for analysis. At least 250mg of tumor are needed for peptide elution. There is no specific time limit on how long the tissue can remain frozen prior to use. The tissue will be collected and analyzed under Lab protocol PA150176. 9. Patients can have any lines (including zero) of prior therapy to sign consent prior to tissue harvest. 10. Toxicity related to prior therapy must either have returned to &lt;/= grade 1, baseline, or been deemed irreversible. 11. ELIGIBILITY FOR TREATMENT: ECOG/Zubrod performance status of 0 to 2. 12. Bidimensionally measurable disease by radiographic imaging (CT scan) that represents at least one measurable lesion per RECIST v1.1. 13. At least 4 Weeks must have elapsed since the last chemotherapy, radiotherapy or major surgery. 14. Toxicity related to prior therapy must either have returned to less than or equal to grade 1, baseline, or been deemed irreversible. 15. Subjects must have received at least one line of chemotherapy prior to receiving adoptive T cell therapy and should have exhausted standard of care systemic therapy options. The decision to implement the T cell therapy will be at the discretion of the treating physician. The timing and total exposure to chemotherapy will depend on the tumor type in question (more systemic options for breast cancer; fewer for gastric cancer, for example). Due to the heterogeneity of tumors being treated in this protocol, the discretion of the treating physician in terms of timing of immunotherapy will be critical. 1. EXCLUSION FOR ENROLLMENT: Any other malignancy from which the patient has been diseasefree for less than 5 years, with the exception of adequately treated and cured basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, and carcinoma in situ of the cervix. 2. Pregnant women, nursing mothers, men or women of reproductive ability who are unwilling to use effective contraception. Women of childbearing potential with a positive pregnancy test within 3 days prior to entry. 3. Significant cardiovascular abnormalities as defined by any one of the following: 1. Congestive heart failure NYHA classes IIIV. Patients with asymptomatic class I CHF may participate in conjunction with a Cardiology consultation. 2. Clinically significant hypotension. 3. Symptoms of coronary artery disease. 4. Presence of arrhythmias in EKG requiring drug therapy. 4. Active and untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases (including metastasis identified during screening MRI or contrast CT). Patients with asymptomatic, treated metastases may be eligible if their lesion(s) have demonstrated stability over 2 months. 5. Autoimmune disease: Patients with a history of Inflammatory Bowel Disease are excluded from this study, as are patients with a history of autoimmune disease (e.g. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, vasculitis, infiltrating lung disease) whose possible progression during treatment would be considered by the Investigator to be unacceptable. 6.
