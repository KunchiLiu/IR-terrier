	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the metabolic load during a single session of moderate intensity walking in water compared to walking on land (over-ground) in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are normal weight and obese, compared with peak exercise metabolic response. The hypothesis is that the metabolic load of walking at a moderate intensity in water will be greater than walking on land.</brief_summary>
