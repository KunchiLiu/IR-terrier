	<brief_title>The Right Ventricular Responses to Mild Hypercarbia After Mitral Valve Repair Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aims of the study is to investigate the right ventricular responses to mild hypercarbia after mitral valve prolapse repair surgery by the measurements obtained on pulmonary arterial catheter and transesophageal echocardiography. Investigators hypothesize that induced mild hypercarbia (PaCO2 7.5 kPa) cause elevated mean pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, and this reflect to the right ventricle, both volume and function. And this right ventricle effect could be noticed by echocardiography.</detailed_description>
