	<brief_summary>This is a Phase Ib/II safety and efficacy trial of single agent ABC294640, an inhibitor of sphingosine kinase 2 and dihydroceramide desaturase, in refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma (MM). Cohorts of patients with refractory or relapsed MM who have previously been treated with proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents will receive increasing doses of oral ABC294640. The starting dosage for ABC294640 will be 250 mg bis in die (BID) which is known to be safely tolerated as a single agent, and the ABC294640 dose will be escalated to two additional dose cohorts of 500 and 750 mg BID using Bayesian model average continual reassessment method (BMA-CRM) for dose finding. It is expected that 18 patients will be used to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for ABC294640 in refractory or relapsed MM. Up to 56 additional patients will be treated on the phase II portion of the study at the MTD or maximum dose used in phase I, with interim stopping rules for futility. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments of ABC294640 will be conducted on Day 1 of Cycle 1. Bone marrow biopsy will be obtained prior to the initiation of ABC294640, at the end of cycle #3 and at the end of cycle #6. In addition to serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) and serum free light chain measurement, correlative studies will be performed to measure sphingosine kinase 2 (SK2) activity, sphingosine metabolites, and additional biomarkers in CD138+ myeloma cells.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives for Phase 1b: Primary Objectives • To assess safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of single agent ABC294640 in patients with refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma (MM) who have been previously treated with proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents. Secondary Objectives - To assess the antitumor activity of single agent ABC294640 in patients with refractory or relapsed MM after 3 cycles of treatment. - To determine the pharmacokinetics of ABC294640 following administration of the drug. - To describe the effects of ABC294640 on plasma levels of sphingosine 1-phosphate and IL-6 in patients with refractory or relapsed MM. - To assess pharmacodynamic markers (SK2 mRNA level or activity, sphingolipid metabolites, c-Myc, Mcl-1 and pS6) in bone marrow CD138+ myeloma cells. Objectives for Phase 2: Primary Objectives • Assess overall treatment response rate and overall survival in patients with relapsed or refractory MM treated with single-agent ABC294640. Secondary Objectives - To assess the treatment response of ABC294640 in patients with refractory or relapsed MM after 3 cycles of treatment. - To determine if pharmacodynamic markers (SK2 mRNA or activity, sphingolipid metabolites, c-Myc, Mcl-1 and pS6) in bone marrow CD138+ myeloma cells predict tumor response to the treatment with ABC294640. The projected ABC294640 doses for the escalation phase are: 250, 500, and 750 mg BID orally continuously as determined in the single agent trial for ABC294640. The dose will be given under fasting conditions (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating). Each cycle of treatment is 28 days. Patients will be monitored for safety and pharmacodynamics effects weekly in Cycle 1, biweekly for Cycles 2-4, and monthly for subsequent cycles. Myeloma treatment response will be assessed as follows: - Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) and serum free light chains before each cycle. - Skeletal survey at screening, then every year or at the end of study if the study ends before the anniversary. - Bone marrow biopsy and aspirates at the last day of cycle #3 and cycle #6 (± 7 days). For the phase II portion of the study, patients will be treated with single agent ABC294640 at the MTD determined from the phase Ib study (or highest dose used, if MTD is not reached) until disease progression or intolerable toxicity occurs.</detailed_description>
