	<brief_title>A Randomized Comparison of Pediatric I-gel, Air-Q With Classic Laryngeal Mask Airway</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) Classic has gained popularity for airway management in both anesthesia and resuscitation due to its ease of use. However, insertion of the LMA Classic is not always easy in children due to differences in airway anatomy compared with adults, and more complications are related to its use in younger children compared with adults. The i-gel has been commercially available in sizes suitable for children since 2010. It has a non-inflatable cuff and an additional lumen for the active or passive drainage of gastric contents (except in size 1). It is available in four children's sizes (1, 1.5, 2 and 2.5). The air-Q_ ILA, is easily inserted with the index finger of the right hand, while the anesthetist performed jaw's lift with left hand, without a rotational technique (Jagannathan N et al., 2011, Dar long et al, 2014 and Keil et al, 2015). Oropharyngeal leak pressure is defined as the airway pressure at which air leaks into the mouth or enters the stomach (Hughes et al., 2012). This feature is the most common primary outcome parameter used to evaluate the safety and efficacy of supraglottic airway devices because high pressures generally indicate that adequate ventilation can be achieved without air leakage during positive pressure ventilation at high inspiratory pressures (Teoh et al., 2010).</detailed_description>
