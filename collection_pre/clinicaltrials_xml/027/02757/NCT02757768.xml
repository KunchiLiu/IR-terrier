	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of Mirabegron in Men With OAB Symptoms While Taking Tamsulosin Hydrochloride for Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) Due to Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At Screening (Visit 1), subjects will enter into a 4-week open label tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg QD run-in period prior to being randomized into the 12-week double-blind treatment period (Visit 2). At conclusion of the 4-week tamsulosin hydrochloride run-in period, subjects will complete a 3-day diary just prior to Baseline (Visit 2). Approximately 7 days prior to Visit 2 subjects will receive a phone call reminding them about the diary and to answer any questions. If subjects meet all entry criteria at the end of the tamsulosin hydrochloride run-in period, subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups (mirabegron or placebo) for 12 weeks of treatment in addition to the continuation of tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg QD. Those subjects randomized to mirabegron will start at 25 mg and will increase to 50 mg after 4 weeks. Those subjects randomized to placebo will start blinded product matched to the mirabegron 25 mg tablet and will increase to blinded product matched to 50 mirabegron after 4 weeks. Once a subject has increased dose, the subject will remain on that dose for the remainder of the study unless for safety reasons is required to discontinue study drug. A training diary will be completed in the first 2 weeks of the tamsulosin hydrochloride run-in period. During this evaluation period at least one telephone contact will take place with the subject. Diaries will be completed at home, using the electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) device, for 3 consecutive days prior to each visit: Baseline (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 3), Week 8 (Visit 4), and Week 12/End of Treatment (Visit 5). Site staff will contact the subject approximately 7 days prior to the scheduled visit to remind the subject to complete the electronic diary, review completion instruction and review changes to concomitant medications and adverse events (if applicable). Three days before Visits 2 (Baseline), 3 (Week 4), 4 (Week 8), and 5 (Week 12), subjects will complete a 3-day diary, using the ePRO device in which the subject will record micturition frequency, urgency (PPIUS), incontinence and volume voided. In addition, the diary will capture morning and evening blood pressure and pulse rate measurements via Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM). At Visit 1, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) will be completed. At Visits 2, 3, 4, and 5, subjects will complete the IPSS, EQ-5D-5L, OAB-q, PPBC, and TS-VAS. Maximum urinary flow (Qmax) will be measured at Visit 1 (Screening/tamsulosin hydrochloride run-in) and Visit 5 (Week 12/End of Treatment). Post-void residual volume (PVR) will be assessed at Screening/tamsulosin hydrochloride run-in (Visit 1), Baseline (Visit 2) and at Week 4 (Visit 3), Week 8 (Visit 4), and Week 12/End of Treatment (Visit 5). A follow-up phone call (Visit 6) will be conducted 4-weeks after End of Treatment (Visit 5). Total study participation is approximately 20 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria assessed at Visit 1 (Screening): Men ≥40 years of age with history of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms (frequency of ≥8 micturitions per day and urgency episodes of ≥2 per day) while taking tamsulosin hydrochloride for at least 2 months to treat LUTS due to BPH. Subject has symptoms of OAB (urinary frequency and urgency with or without incontinence) for ≥3 months prior to Screening. Subject has an International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) score ≥8. Subject has ProstateSpecific Antigen (PSA) &lt;4 ng/mL. Subject is willing and able to complete the 3day diary (including urine volumes, vital signs measurements), and Quality of Life questionnaires. Subject and the subject's spouses/partners who are of childbearing potential must be using a highly effective birth control, which includes established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception, placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS). Birth control must be practiced from Screening and continue throughout the study and for 30 days after the final study drug administration. In addition, sperm donation will not be allowed throughout the study and for 30 days after the final study drug administration. Subject agrees not to participate in another interventional study while on treatment. Inclusion Criteria assessed at Visit 2 (Baseline) based on the 3day diary: Subject continues to meet all inclusion criteria of Visit 1 (Screening). Subject must experience an average of 8 or more micturitions per day over the 3day diary period. Subject must experience an average of 2 episodes of urgency per day (grade 3 or 4) over the 3diary period Exclusion Criteria assessed at Visit 1 (Screening): Subject has postvoid residual volume (PVR) &gt;200 mL. Subject has maximum urinary flow (Qmax) &lt;5.0 mL/second with a minimum voided volume of 125 mL. Subject has hematuria &gt;3 rbc/hpf that has not been fully evaluated. Subject has evidence of Urinary Tract Infection (UTI). Urine culture and sensitivity will be performed for positive leukocytes, nitrites, or turbidity and will be confirmed with a culture greater than 100,000 cfu/mL. If a subject has a UTI, at Screening (Visit 1) the subject may be rescreened after successful treatment of the UTI (confirmed by a laboratory result of negative urine culture).
