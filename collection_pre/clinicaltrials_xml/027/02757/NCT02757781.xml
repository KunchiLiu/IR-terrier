	<detailed_description>Main Objective: to assess the effectiveness of a Community of Practice (CdP) virtual in improving attitudes of health professionals in primary care on the empowerment of patients with chronic diseases. Methodology: Design: cluster randomised controlled. Scope: primary care centers (PCC) belonging to the Regions of Catalonia, Madrid and Canary Islands. Population: primary care health professionals (family doctors and nurses). Sample size: 270 healthcare professionals and 1382 patients. Randomization: Randomization unit: PCC; unit of analysis: primary care health professionals. 9 pairs of PCC by region will be randomly selected and randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. Randomization will be performed after the selection of professionals and patients. Intervention: the intervention group will be offered participation for 12 months in a virtual CdP based on a web 2.0 platform. The control group will receive usual training. Measurements: the primary outcome will be measured by Patient-Provider Orientation Scale (PPOS) questionnaire at baseline and 12 months. Secondary outcomes: sociodemographic of professionals; sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients; Patient Activation Measure (PAM) questionnaire for patient activation; outcomes regarding use of the CdP.
