	<brief_title>Evaluating the Neurobiological Basis of Traumatic Dissociation in Women With Histories of Abuse and Neglect</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dissociative symptoms commonly are associated with exposure to traumatic stress. Preliminary evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging-based analysis (fMRI) of neural activation during dissociative symptom provocation in patients with PTSD or DID has implicated certain key structures involved in the generation of dissociative symptoms. Given the presumed region-to-region neural interplay implicit within this model, the investigators believe the use of intrinsic functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) represents a valuable next line of investigation into the neurobiology of traumatic dissociation. The investigators also believe that a genetic approach holds promise as another converging line of inquiry into our understanding of traumatic dissociation. To evaluate the neurobiological basis of traumatic dissociation, this study will recruit patients with PTSD or DID, and recruit matched controls to identify neurobiological correlates of traumatic dissociation.The study will compare the phenomenology of traumatic dissociation in patients with different PTSD subtypes and DID using standardized measures to look at the neurological and genetic correlates. This study will also include a follow up visit that includes neuroimaging and genetic assessments.</detailed_description>
