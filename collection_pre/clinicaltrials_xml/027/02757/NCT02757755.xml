	<brief_title>Ascending Dose Study of the Safety of AB-SA01 When Topically Applied to Intact Skin of Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AB-SA01 consists of three bacteriophages (viruses) that target Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. The safety of AB-SA01 will be assessed when topically administered once daily to the volar aspect of the forearm at a dose of 10^8 plaque forming units (PFU) per phage for 3 consecutive days, and then at a dose of 10^9 plaque forming units (PFU) per phage for 3 consecutive days. Both AB-SA01 and placebo will be administered to each subject to provide his/her own control for evaluation of skin reactions. The right or left placement of the placebo will be randomized and double-blinded.</detailed_description>
