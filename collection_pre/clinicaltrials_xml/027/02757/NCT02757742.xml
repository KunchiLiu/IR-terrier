	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to establish a quantitative LGE mass based scoring system (including LGE mass on cardiac magnetic resonance , clinical features, specific medical histories, et al) for risk prediction of sudden cardiac death in non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quantitive LGE Mass in Prediction of SCD in NICM Patients With Severe Cardiac Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Single-centered, Prospective, Observational Study. The study design included two phases. In Phase I, the investigators enrolled a set of consecutive patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy who performed contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance at baseline and had severe cardiac dysfunction (defined as cardiac magnetic resonance LVEF equal or less than 35% ) in FuWai Hospital from 2010 to 2013. The investigators collect patients' clinical baseline data and cardiac magnetic resonance specific data(Late gadolinium enhancement mass). All patients were followed up every six month by phone or clinical visits. The primary endpoint was composite of sudden cardiac death(SCD), ventricular arrhythmias(VAs) and SCD/VAs related Implantable Cardioverter defibrillator or cardiac resynchronization therapy-cardioverter defibrillator(ICD/CRTD) shock. The investigators plan to establish a quantitative LGE mass based model (including LGE mass on cardiac magnetic resonance, clinical features, specific medical histories, et al) for risk prediction of sudden cardiac death by analysing the phase I data(1-year model and 3-year model). In Phase II,the investigators will enroll another group of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy(NICM) patients from 2014 to 2015 to testify the risk prediction model(1-year model) the investigators have constructed in phase I. The investigators aim to find the real high risk NICM patients that may suffer from SCD or VAs in those with severe cardiac dysfunction.</detailed_description>
