	<brief_summary>This trial will compare two strategies for patients with Heart Failure, Left Ventricular systolic dysfunction, and intermediate QRS durations. The control group is conventional CRT. The experimental group is LVendo CRT</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Resynchronization for Ambulatory Heart Failure Trial - LV Endocardial Acute Hemodynamic Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients randomized to the Conventional CRT will receive a CRT device with or without ICD. Device implantation will be performed within 10 working days of randomization. Patients randomized to LV endocardial CRT will receive a CRT device with or without ICD, placed in the same time frame and will have RA and RV leads implanted as the conventional CRT group. The device will be implanted in a facility that has the capacity to perform trans-atrial septal puncture with ultrasound guidance. The LV lead will be placed using a trans-atrial septal approach using a specially designed puncture tools and LVendo delivery tool kits specifically designed for this study</detailed_description>
