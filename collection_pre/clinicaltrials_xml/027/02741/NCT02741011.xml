	<brief_title>Radiological Examination of the Mentally Handicapped Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dental radiography has become an indispensable part of routine dental examination with the help of the technological development of radiological devices. However, medical procedures like dental treatment and medical imaging (magnetic resonance imaging-MRI, computed tomography-CT, orthopantomography- OPG, etc.) that require cooperation are usually hard to apply to mentally handicapped (MHP) or uncooperative patients (UCP). Treatments that will be done without radiological examination can be missing or incorrect.</detailed_description>
