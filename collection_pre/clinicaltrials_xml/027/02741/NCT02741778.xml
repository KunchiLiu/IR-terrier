	<brief_title>Minimally Invasive Sweet Esophagectomy for Patients With Siewert Type II Adenocarcinoma of the Esophagogastric Junction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Of the esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma (AEG) is a 1 region of the 5 cm region in the esophageal gastric junction. Due to the special anatomical location, the biological behavior of esophageal cancer and gastric cancer are not the same. Because of its wide range of lesions, the majority of the Siewert classification system will be divided into three types: I type, CM type, CM 1-5, which is the 5 cm of the CM L, which is the traditional meaning of cardiac carcinoma. In the investigators country, the majority of patients with type II and III are 2,3,4. For the resection of esophageal gastric junction adenocarcinoma, the main treatment method for the treatment of surgical treatment. The high incidence of type II and type III AEG, type III patients more than the use of the abdominal approach to the proximal gastrectomy, more than by the Department of general surgery. In patients with lesions, the lymph node metastasis is also characterized by a bidirectional transfer of the lymph nodes and the peritoneal cavity with the lesion of the two boundary. In order to ensure that the upper cut edge of the esophagus and the dissection of the mediastinal lymph nodes, the domestic more by the Department of thoracic surgery. For the part of the patients, the traditional standard surgical approach to the left thoracic approach with open phrenoesophageal, partial resection of the stomach, aortic arch esophagogastric anastomosis + thoraco abdominal 2-field lymph node dissection dissection [5,6]. The minimally invasive surgery in the treatment of esophageal cancer and gastric cancer has been widely accepted by domestic and foreign counterparts. For I type AEG patients with type Ivor-Lewis and type III AEG patients are commonly used in the treatment of gastric cancer, and the corresponding minimally invasive surgery has a certain development [7,8]. And for type II AEG patients with relatively standard minimally invasive surgery, there is no unit carried out at home and abroad. Therefore, how to choose the minimally invasive method to complete this operation is more thorough. It has become a hot research topic in the domestic and foreign doctors. It has very important clinical significance and application prospect. For the type II type of esophageal gastric junction adenocarcinoma, the mainstream of the traditional surgical method for the left chest approach to open the chest. The operation has the following disadvantages: 1) the integrity of the chest wall and diaphragm, the impact of the chest and abdomen of patients with large, close to the long-term life quality is greatly affected by the traditional surgery using the right side of the chest, abdominal lymph node dissection through the diaphragm to complete, and its complete abdominal approach to the poor. The foreign part of the center for smaller lesions of type II esophageal gastric junction adenocarcinoma underwent minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy, but it exists the following drawbacks: 1) is not suitable for larger tumors; 2) gastric resection is not enough, the type of esophageal and gastric junction adenocarcinoma essence should be a special type of gastric carcinoma, proximal gastric resection should be for the removal of one of the standard. And the position of the operation is relatively high, which can lead to a large number of esophageal resection, and the length of esophageal resection is more than 3. The 5cm is sufficient. Therefore, how to implement a minimally invasive surgical approach to the upper and lower middle and upper mediastinal and abdominal lymph nodes is a hot research topic in the field of esophageal gastric junction adenocarcinoma. Up to now, there is no reasonable standard minimally invasive surgery for treatment of type II esophageal gastric junction adenocarcinoma. The investigators sum up the experience of the past in the minimally invasive resection of esophageal cancer, and combine domestic and foreign research results. Pioneered by laparoscopic mobilization of the stomach and dissection of the abdominal field lymph node + thoracoscopic (left thoracic approach) to free the esophagus and cleaning + mirror under the purse string forceps esophagogastric aortic arch anastomosis under lower mediastinal lymph node, corresponding to the operation is the traditional through left thoracotomy combined with open operation on diaphragm. Can achieve the same with the traditional surgical resection of the tumor, while taking into account the characteristics of minimally invasive surgery. In this study, cases of type II esophageal gastric junction adenocarcinoma cases were collected from 120 patients with type II esophageal gastric junction adenocarcinoma by prospective randomized controlled clinical trial. Comparison of different surgical methods for patients with the safety of surgery, oncology resection range, the incidence of short-term complications. The effect of different surgical methods on the survival rate and quality of life of the two groups were compared with the postoperative follow-up. The surgical treatment of esophageal carcinoma with a reasonable level of type II type of esophageal gastric junction adenocarcinoma is improved, and the surgical treatment of esophageal gastric junction adenocarcinoma is improved.</detailed_description>
