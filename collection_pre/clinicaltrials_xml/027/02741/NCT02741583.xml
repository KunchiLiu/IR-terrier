	<brief_summary>prospective controlled interventional trial evaluating the efficacy of a 3-weeks asthma rehabilitation program at high altitude (3200m) and low altitude (760m) on lung function and asthma control.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Kyrgyz Asthma Rehabilitation at High Altitude</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low altitude baseline measurements will be performed in Bishkek. Participants will then either be assigned to a rehabilitation program in Bishkek (760m) or in Tuja Ashu (3200m). The rehabilitation programs in high or low altitude will be identically performed and will comprise - asthma education and awareness - instruction on inhaled therapies - smoking cessation counseling - respiratory and skeletal muscle training in groups - guided walks / cycle ergometer training - questionnaires on asthma control, quality of life - spirometry and peak flow measurements - echocardiography Measurement on study subjects will be performed at baseline (Bishkek), during the rehabilitation program, after completion of the rehabilitation program and during a follow-up at week 15.</detailed_description>
