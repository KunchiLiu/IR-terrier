	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate pain control of continuous transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks placed for open inguinal hernia repair. The investigators hypothesize that there will be improved pain control when compared with sham blocks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transversus Abdominus Plane Catheters for Open Inguinal Hernia Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized, controlled trial designed to determine whether continuous transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block versus sham block has a substantial impact on pain following open inguinal hernia repair. Our primary outcome is to determine whether there will be a difference in opioid consumption within the first two days following surgery. Secondary outcomes will include: pain scores and activity assessment score.</detailed_description>
