	<brief_summary>The purpose of the Lifestyle Intervention Study is to investigate the influence of a micronutrient supplement in combination with a comprehensive lifestyle intervention program on retinal amyloid, among patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Patients will be placed on supplement or placebo throughout their 18-month study participation. Patients will also be given lifestyle training on nutrition, physical activity, cognitive and social activity, meditation and sleep, which have all been proven to positively affect cognition over time. Throughout their participation, patients' cognitive functioning will be monitored with comprehensive imaging, neuropsychological testing, blood testing and study compliance.</brief_summary>
