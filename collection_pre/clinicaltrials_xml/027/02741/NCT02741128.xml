	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the Dengue vaccine in a population of special interest, such as HIV-positive adults. Primary Objective: - To describe the safety of each injection of CYD dengue vaccine in HIV-positive adults. Secondary Objectives: - To describe the humoral immune response to each dengue serotype at baseline and after each injection of CYD dengue vaccine in HIV-positive adults. - To detect the CYD dengue vaccinal viremia post-Inj 1 in HIV-positive adults. - To describe changes in CD4 count and HIV RNA viral load after each injection of CYD dengue vaccine in HIV-positive adults. Observational Objective: - To describe the FV (YF, Dengue) serological status in the study population at baseline.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio into 1 of 2 groups to receive 3 injections of either CYD dengue vaccine or placebo at 0, 6, and 12 months. The enrollment of subjects will be carried out in two steps, including an early safety data review before the second step. The duration of each subject's participation in the study will be approximately 18 months.</detailed_description>

Subject is pregnant, or lactating, or of childbearing potential (to be considered of nonchildbearing potential, a female must be premenarche or postmenopausal for at least 1 year, surgically sterile, or using an effective method of contraception or abstinence from at least 4 weeks prior to the first vaccination until at least 4 weeks after the last vaccination) Participation at the time of study enrollment (or in the 4 weeks preceding the first trial vaccination) or planned participation during the present trial period in another clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical procedure Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding the first trial vaccination or planned receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks following any trial vaccination Previous vaccination against dengue disease with either the trial vaccine or another vaccine Receipt of immune globulins, blood or bloodderived products in the past 3 months Selfreported or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, except HIV; or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy such as anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the preceding 6 months; or longterm systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months) Previous acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), defined as the occurrence of opportunistic infection in the last 2 years before consent Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a lifethreatening reaction to the vaccines used in the trial or to a vaccine containing any of the same substances Deprived of freedom by an administrative or court order, or in an emergency setting, or hospitalized involuntarily Current alcohol abuse or drug addiction Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, is at a stage where it might interfere with trial conduct or completion Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to investigator judgment) or febrile illness (temperature ≥ 38.0°C) on the day of vaccination. A prospective subject should not be included in the study until the condition has resolved or the febrile event has subsided Identified as an Investigator or employee of the Investigator or study center with direct involvement in the proposed study, or identified as an immediate family member (i.e., parent, spouse, natural or adopted child) of the Investigator or employee with direct involvement in the proposed study Previous CD4 count &lt; 200 cells/mm3 (nadir) since diagnosis of HIV History of chronic and active hepatitis B infection or HBsAgpositive History of chronic and active hepatitis C infection or HCV Abpositive Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), urea and creatinine &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal range (ULN) Hemoglobin (Hb) &lt; 10 g/dL White blood cell count (WBC) &lt; 1500 cells/mm3 Platelets &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3.</criteria>
