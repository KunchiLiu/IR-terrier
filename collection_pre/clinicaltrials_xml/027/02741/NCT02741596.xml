	<criteria>Male and female HAE subjects who are 12 years of age or older at the time of screening Documented diagnosis of HAE, Type I or II A historical baseline HAE attack rate of at least 1 attack per 12 weeks Adult subjects and caregivers of subjects under the age of 18 are willing and able to read, understand, and sign an informed consent form. Subjects age 12 to 17, whose caregiver has provided informed consent, are willing and able to read, understand and sign an assent form. Males and females who are fertile and sexually active must adhere to contraception requirements for the duration of the study Discontinued from DX293003 after enrollment for any reason. If rolling over from DX293003, presence of important safety concerns that would preclude participation in this study. Concomitant diagnosis of another form of chronic, recurrent angioedema, such as acquired angioedema (AAE), HAE with normal C1INH (also known as HAE Type III), idiopathic angioedema, or recurrent angioedema associated with urticaria. Dosing with an investigational drug (not including DX2930 or other HAE therapies) or exposure to an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to screening. Exposure to angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors within 4 weeks prior to screening or any newly initiated or dose modification of estrogencontaining medications with systemic absorption (such as oral contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapy) 3 months prior to the screening visit. Unwilling to discontinue use of longterm prophylactic therapy for HAE (C1INH, attenuated androgens, or antifibrinolytics) within 3 weeks after starting DX2930 treatment. Any of the following liver function test abnormalities: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 3x upper limit of normal, or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 3x upper limit of normal, or total bilirubin &gt; 2x upper limit of normal (unless the bilirubin elevation is a result of Gilbert's Syndrome). Pregnancy or breastfeeding.</criteria>
