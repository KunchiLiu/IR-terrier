	<brief_title>Fontan Udenafil Exercise Longitudinal Assessment Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized, double-blinded, efficacy trial of the effects of udenafil vs. placebo on the background of standard therapy on maximal VO2 (ml/kg/min) from baseline to six months in adolescent survivors of the Fontan procedure. . The target sample size is 400 subjects (200 per group).</detailed_description>

Single lung physiology with greater than 80% flow to one lung. 9. VO2 less than 50% 10. Severe ventricular dysfunction assessed qualitatively by clinical echocardiography within six months prior to enrollment. 11. Severe valvar regurgitation, ventricular outflow obstruction, or aortic arch obstruction assessed by clinical echocardiography within six months prior to enrollment. 12. Significant renal (serum creatinine &gt; 2.0), hepatic (serum AST and/or ALT &gt; 3 times upper limit of normal), gastrointestinal or biliary disorders that could impair absorption, metabolism or excretion of orally administered medications, based on laboratory assessment six weeks prior to screening for the trial. 13. Inability to complete exercise testing at baseline screening. 14. History of PDE5 inhibitor use within 3 months before study onset. 15. History of any other medication for treatment of pulmonary hypertension within 3 months before study onset. 16. Known intolerance to oral udenafil. 17. Frequent use of medications or other substances that inhibit or induce CYP3A4. 18. Current use of alphablockers or nitrates. 19. Ongoing or planned participation in another research protocol that would either prevent successful completion of planned study testing or invalidate its results. 20. Noncardiac medical, psychiatric, and/or social disorder that would prevent successful completion of planned study testing or would invalidate its results. 21. Cardiac care, ongoing or planned, at a nonstudy center that would impede study completion. 22.
