	<brief_title>The Influence of Cortical Bone Perforation on Guided Bone Regeneration in Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effect of cortical bone perforation on angiogenesis and osteogenesis of augmented ridge by guided bone regeneration. Methods: Fourteen patients (mean age: 52) who were in need of dental implants at areas with osseous defects in the mandible were selected. In the test group (n=7), alveolar cortical bone at the area of regeneration was perforated using a #2 high speed round bur. No decortication of cortical bone was performed in the control group (n=7). Subsequently, defects were augmented by guided bone regeneration using resorbable membrane and bovine bone. After a healing period of 7 months, implant sites were created and trephine cores harvested for histological and histomorphometric analysis of the grafted areas.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria were presence of atrophic mandibular ridges with buccolingual width ranging between 25 mm, as measured on serial sections of a computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan. Exclusion criteria included patients with diabetes, osteoporosis or other metabolic disorders, smokers, pregnant patients and patients who had any systemic or local factors that would inhibit normal wound healing process.</criteria>
