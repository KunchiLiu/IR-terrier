	<brief_title>Pathophysiology of Inflammation After Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy is the treatment of choice in patients with primary or secondary peritoneal surface malignancies. However the survival benefit is achieved at the cost of increased morbidity and mortality due to an extensive surgery and intraoperative chemo-therapy. Among complications infectious complications are the most common. The early diagnosis of a potential fatal infection is therefore crucial to ensure a good outcome in patients.</detailed_description>
