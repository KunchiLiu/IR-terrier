	<brief_summary>This protocol seeks to enroll smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) patients with λ light chain (LC) involvement, a group of patients for whom standard of care is observation not treatment. Patients with SMM have a precursor plasma cell disorder from which light chain amyloidosis (AL) often evolves. In this trial they will have blood and bone marrow cells evaluated by molecular testing to determine their clonal λ LC variable region (VL) germline gene. The repertoire of clonal germline genes employed in AL is restricted; 70% of cases of AL involve just 7 germline donors, 5 of which are λ germline donors. The hypothesis that will be tested with this protocol is that the presence of VL germline genes associated with AL in patients with a pre-existing diagnosis of λ SMM will be indicative of risk of progression to AL.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Diagnostic Screening Trial Seeking AL Amyloidosis Very Early</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this trial up to 200 smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) patients with λ light chain (LC) involvement whose κ::λ LC ratio are &lt; 0.26 and whose clonal minus non-clonal LC difference (called the dFLC) are greater than 23mg/L will be recruited. Heavy chain type will not affect patient eligibility as long as the involved LC is λ type. The assay for free LC is a routine standard test for all patients with monoclonal gammopathies and will provide the basis for this screening. Patients will learn about the trial through internet advertisements, contact the data manager, consent to participate in writing, and sign the HIPAA release forms allowing the PI to receive their medical data relevant to their λ LC SMM; standard physician-to-physician medical practice will apply here. Patient recruitment will be open to all eligible patients within the United States. Informed consent may be obtained in person or in a phone call with the PI. The patient's physician will be contacted and informed of the patient's consent and enrollment in this study and asked to provide medical records for screening. If the patient is found eligible, the patient and physician will be informed of the required samples needed for this protocol, which include a one-time donation of peripheral blood and a one-time donation of marrow aspirate, both taken during routine clinical procedures. Prepaid FedEx boxes will be provided by the study to ship research samples to Tufts Medical Center for remote patients. Both the peripheral blood and marrow samples will be tested for the presence of variable region (VL) germline genes. Samples will be processed on the day of arrival and stored at -80 degrees Celsius. The results of these laboratory tests will be shared with the patient and their physician after both samples have been processed. No further samples will be requested from the participant at any time as a part of this study. The analysis of this trial will be based on the frequency with which λ LC SMM patients are found to have genes associated with light chain amyloidosis (AL) and are diagnosed with AL, or have AL-associated genes and progress to AL. The diagnosis of AL is a tissue diagnosis. If amyloidosis is suspected at any time during a subject's participation, their physician will be contacted and given recommendations regarding diagnostic tests and disease staging.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>SMM patients with λ LC involvement with dFLC greater than 23mg/L and κ::λ free LC ratios &lt; 0.26. Subjects must be able to share their medical records and ship us bone marrow and blood samples. λ SMM patients with light chains that do not meet the inclusion criteria as well as patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), SMM with kappa LC involvement or active myeloma will not be included. And patients who are unable to send us blood and marrow for any reason will not be eligible.</criteria>
