	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of dual acupoints and single acupoint transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) pretreatment on incidence of Post-Mastectomy Pain Syndrome(PMPS) in patients undergoing operation of breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficiency of Acupuncture-assisted Anesthesia With Single Acupoint or Dual Acupoints in Patients Undergoing Radical Operation of Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients were randomly assigned to three groups, receiving 30min TEAS before anesthesia respectively. The acupoints of dual point group are bilateral Neiguan points(PC6) combined with Danzhong point(RN17), single point group is bilateral Neiguan points(PC6), and the false stimulation group only attach electrodes without electric current. The frequency of TEAS is set to 2/15 Hz. Intraoperative anesthetic dosage of propofol and remifentanil was recorded. Three and six months after surgery, follow-up about chronic pain was made by telephone or face-to-face using the follow-up questionnaire. The adverse events were recorded.</detailed_description>
