	<brief_summary>This is a feasibility and exploratory study consisting of two parts: first, a cross-sectional (one-time) biomarker measurement comparing BDNF-TrkB (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, TrkB,) signaling and cortical plasticity in patients diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease (PD) vs. healthy controls matched by age. Second, a prospective, randomized, double blind trial of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) MAGSTIM Rapid2 Therapy System (TMS) (real or Sham) and aerobic exercise. This exploratory feasibility study will look at BDNF-TrkB signaling and cortical plasticity.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Twenty-four PD patients (n=24) will be randomly assigned to receive one of two interventions for a duration of two weeks. In Group 1, subjects will participate in daily sessions of sham-rTMS followed by supervised aerobic exercise (Sham rTMS+Aerobic); in Group 2, subjects will participate in a combination of rTMS and supervised aerobic exercise (Real rTMS+Aerobic). Serum BDNF-TrkB signaling in lymphocytes and TMS-based electrophysiological measures of LTP-like plasticity will be measured. A comparison of such measures in a group of patients with PD and in a group of age-matched controls (n=12) will be analyzed to establish the effect of the disease on indices of plasticity.</detailed_description>
