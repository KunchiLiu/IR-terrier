	<brief_summary>Insomnia is a highly prevalent, often debilitating, and economically burdensome condition. Reviews of the literature indicate that there are ethnic differences in sleep behavior, with African Americans objectively and subjectively reporting more disordered sleep than Caucasian Americans.Chronic insomnia can have a significant impact on mental and physical health outcomes and has been associated with impaired cognitive performance, particularly, in areas of speed, attention, working memory, and executive function. In order to understand the brain mechanisms in sleep disorder both during resting state as well as during cognitive processing, the investigators will assess resting state EEG (during eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions) as well as ERP tasks for assessing decision-making and reward processing. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of a tailored, telephone-delivered cognitive behavioral intervention, versus a self- monitoring control condition, on symptoms of insomnia and its neurodynamic correlates. Hypotheses: Among Blacks subjectively reporting symptoms of insomnia, those randomized to the tailored, telephone-delivered CBT-I, compared with those randomized to the self-monitoring control group, will have: Hyp. 1: Greater reduction in symptoms of insomnia as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Hyp. 2: Greater neurophysiologic improvement (ERP, ERO) in the intervention condition in response to laboratory paradigms Hyp 3: Greater improvement in psychosocial functioning including reduction in depression and increase in quality of life.</brief_summary>
