	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to compare the whitening effect of a toothpaste containing blue pigment with a conventional toothpaste and with at-home tooth bleaching; evaluate the subject's perception about tooth color improvement and; and evaluate the safety and acceptability of these products.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of a Whitening Dentifrice on Tooth Discoloration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was approved by local Ethical Committee under protocol number CAAE: 035541412.7.0000.5188, and each volunteer signed an informed consent form prior to enrollment in the study. The sample size calculation was carried out based on a previous study. To detect the bleaching effect with a power of 80% and a one-tailed alpha error of 5%, a sample size of 20 subjects in each treatment group was necessary to detect a 20% difference between groups in shade change. A 20% addiction in subjects' number, taking into consideration potential loss or refusal, gave a total sample size of 75 subjects (25 in each group). The individuals were invited to participate in this clinical trial through advertisement exposed at the Federal University of Para√≠ba, Brazil. Basing on eligibility criteria, 75 volunteers were selected to the trial and randomized to one of the three groups of treatment: G1- brushing teeth with a conventional toothpaste; G2- brushing teeth with a silica whitening dentifrice containing blue pigment; and G3 - at-home tooth bleaching with 10% carbamide peroxide. The treatments will be detailed in another section. It was used a simple randomization to allocate the subjects, and a randomization table was prepared in the Excel Program by a member, not directly involved with the clinical part of the study. To mask the products used in the treatment groups, each toothpaste type was enveloped with an adhesive tape of a different color and the seal of the bleaching gel syringe was removed. The same examiner responsible for subject allocation did this procedure. Thus, testing with the toothpastes was double-blinded, where both evaluator and subject did not know which toothpaste was being used. The outcomes evaluated were: tooth shade, subjects' perception about tooth color appearance, and safety and acceptability of products tested, which were measured at baseline, 2-weeks, 3-weeks and 4-weeks of the beginning of treatments. For statistical analysis, data were checked for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov Smirnov test, and then it was applied the appropriated parametric or non-parametric tests. Differences were considered statistically significant when p &lt; 0.05.</detailed_description>
