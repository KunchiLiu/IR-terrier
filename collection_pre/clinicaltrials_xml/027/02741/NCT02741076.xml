	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect on pain intensity (PI) of structured discontinuation of long-term opioid analgesic therapy compared to continuation of opioid therapy in Suboptimal and Optimal Responders to high-dose, long-term opioid analgesic therapy for chronic low back pain (CLBP).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Be male or nonpregnant, nonlactating female aged 18 to 75 years, inclusive. 2. Have a clinical diagnosis of nonradicular CLBP (pain that occurs in an area with boundaries between the lowest rib and the crease of the buttocks) of Class 1 or proximal radicular (above the knee) pain of Class 2 based on the Quebec Task Force Classification for Spinal Disorders (subjects with previous surgery or chronic pain syndrome, i.e., classes 9.2 or 10, will be allowed if their pain does not radiate or radiates only proximally) for a minimum of 12 months and 1. For the Suboptimal Responder group, pain must have been present for at least several hours a day and have an Average PI score of 69 on an 11point NRS within the past 24 hours of screening. 2. For the Optimal Responder group, subjects must have an Average PI score of 14 on an 11point NRS within the past 24 hours of screening. 3. Have been taking ER/LA opioids or immediate release opioids (at least 4 times at day) for at least 12 months. 4. Have been taking one of the 3 index ER opioid drugs aroundtheclock at a twiceaday frequency for at least 3 consecutive months at a total daily dose within the range shown below. Daily Dose Range 1. Morphine sulfate extendedrelease: 120540mg 2. Oxycodone extendedrelease: 80360mg 3. Oxymorphone extendedrelease: 40180mg 5. Be considered, in the opinion of the Investigator, to be in generally good health other than CLBP at screening based upon the results of a medical history, physical examination, 12lead ECG, and laboratory profile. 6. Speak, read, write, and understand English (to reduce heterogeneity of data), understand the consent form, and be able to effectively communicate with the study staff. 7. Have access to the Internet (to access the patient support program). 8. Voluntarily provide written informed consent. 9. Be willing and able to complete study procedures. 1. Have any clinically significant condition that would, in the opinion of the Investigator, preclude study participation or interfere with the assessment of pain and other symptoms of CLBP or increase the risk of opioidrelated AEs. 2. Have a primary diagnosis of fibromyalgia, complex regional pain syndrome, neurogenic claudication due to spinal stenosis, spinal cord compression, acute nerve root compression, severe or progressive lower extremity weakness or numbness, bowel or bladder dysfunction as a result of cauda equina compression, diabetic amyotrophy, meningitis, diskitis, back pain because of secondary infection or tumor, or pain caused by a confirmed or suspected neoplasm. 3. Have undergone a surgical procedure for back pain within 6 months prior to the Screening Visit. 4. Have had a nerve or plexus block, including epidural steroid injections or facet blocks, within 1 month prior to the Screening Visit or botulinum toxin injection in the lower back region within 3 months prior to screening. 5. Have a history of confirmed malignancy within past 2 years, with exception of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has been successfully treated. 6. Have uncontrolled blood pressure, i.e., subject has a sitting systolic blood pressure &gt;180 mm Hg or &lt;90 mm Hg, or a sitting diastolic blood pressure &gt;110 mmHg or &lt;40 mm Hg at screening. 7. Have a body mass index (BMI) &gt;45 kg/m2. Anyone with a BMI &gt;40 but &lt;45 with complete a screening tool (STOPBang Questionnaire) to rule out high risk of obstructive sleep apnea. 8. Have clinically significant depression based on a score of ≥20 on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ8) 9. Have suicidal ideation associated with actual intent and a method or plan in the past year: "Yes" answers on items 4 or 5 of the ColumbiaSuicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS). 10. Have a previous history of suicidal behaviors in the past 5 years: "Yes" answer (for events that occurred in the past 5 years) to any of the suicidal behavior items of the CSSRS. 11. Have any lifetime history of serious or recurrent suicidal behavior. (Nonsuicidal selfinjurious behavior is not a trigger for a risk assessment unless in the Investigator's judgment it is indicated.) 12. Have clinically significant abnormality in clinical chemistry, hematology or urinalysis, including serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase/aspartate aminotransferase or serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase/alanine aminotransferase ≥3 times the upper limit of the reference range or a serum creatinine &gt;2 mg/dL at screening. 13. Have severe enough psychiatric or substance abuse disorder to compromise the subject's safety or scientific integrity of the study. 14. Have ongoing litigation associated with back pain or pending applications for workers compensation or disability issues or subjects who plan on filing litigation or claims within the next 12 months; subjects with settled past litigations will be allowed as will subjects who have been on workers compensation or disability claims for at least 3 months. 15. Have used a monoamine oxidase inhibitor within 14 days prior to the start of study medication. 16. Are taking agonistantagonists (pentazocine, butorphanol or nalbuphine), buprenorphine, methadone, barbiturates, or more than one type of benzodiazepine within 1 month prior to screening. 17. Have a positive UDT for illicit drugs (including marijuana), nonprescribed controlled substances (opioid or nonopioid), or alcohol at screening. 18. Have taken any investigational drug within 30 days prior to the Screening Visit or are currently enrolled in another investigational drug study.</criteria>
