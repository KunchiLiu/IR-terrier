	<brief_summary>This study will compare the efficacy and safety of mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate (MF/F) 100/10 mcg to mometasone furoate (MF) 100 mcg, both administered by metered-dose inhaler, in 5- to 11-year-old children with persistent asthma. This study will evaluate the change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) from baseline as a measure of pulmonary function</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Has a diagnosis of asthma of ≥ 6months duration prior to study start Has asthma that is adequately controlled, according to the clinical judgment of the investigator, on a stable dose of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) combined with longacting betaagonist (LABA) ≥ 4 weeks prior to study start Is able to demonstrate at screening, an FEV1 &gt;60% and ≤90% predicted Is able to demonstrate at screening, an increase in absolute FEV1 of at least 12% within 30 minutes after administration of albuterol/salbutamol. Requires &gt;8 inhalations per day of albuterol (100 mcg per actuation), and/or &gt;2 nebulized treatments per day of 2.5 mg albuterol on any 2 consecutive days between the screening visit and the study start Has a clinical worsening of asthma between the screening visit and the study start, that results in emergency room visit (for an asthma exacerbation), hospitalization due to asthma, or treatment with additional, excluded asthma medication (other than SABA). Has experienced an upper or lower respiratory tract infection within the 4 weeks prior to screening Is considered by the investigator to have unstable asthma at the end of the runin period Has had &gt; 4 asthma exacerbations (defined as a worsening of asthma requiring systemic corticosteroid use and/or ≥ 24hour stay in an emergency department, urgent care center, or hospital) within 1 year of the screening visit Has had a history of lifethreatening asthma, including an asthma episode that required intubation and/or was associated with an increase in carbon dioxide levels in the blood requiring noninvasive ventilator support</criteria>
