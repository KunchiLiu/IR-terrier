	<brief_summary>Obesity is a chronic illness and multifactorial etiology, related to genetic factors, environmental and behavioral. Features association with several metabolic abnormalities in childhood, leading to increased risk of cardiovascular disease in adult life. The treatment involves lifestyle change, with balanced diet guidance and encouraging physical activity. The treatment in this age group have brought limited data, in addition to high drop-out rates. A unique type of food guidance is the equivalent calorie count, where calories are converted into points. The objective of this study was to evaluate the variance of Z score of body mass index (ZIMC) of obese adolescents undergoing orientation of two groups of low-calorie diet: traditional and based on the points system, as well as evaluate anthropometric variables, body composition, food intake, metabolic changes and self-monitoring. METHODS: randomized clinical study with duration of 24 weeks, with 66 adolescents with an average age of 13.7 ± 0.7 years of both genders, with scores of BMI &gt;= 2 to &lt;= 4 curve adjusted for gender and age of the World Health Organization. Were verified weight, height, blood pressure and waist circumference, intensity of physical activity and self- monitoring, as well as performed the nutritional guidance to each visit. Laboratory parameters, applying the scale of binge eating, pubertal, stage and body composition were evaluated at the beginning and end of the action. The patients were divided into two groups: one that received guidance of traditional low-calorie diet and meet the food consumption record (RCA), three days (Group A) and another that received low-calorie diet guidance based on the system of points and meet the daily RCA (Group B).</brief_summary>
