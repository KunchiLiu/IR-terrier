	<brief_summary>Quisinostat besides its own efficacy, which can potentially lead to better results of polychemotherapy and increase the mean time to progression, it may be demonstrated that Quisinostat leads to sustained tumor sensitivity to platinum drugs. In this study safety and tolerability of multiple administrations of Quisinostat in doses ranging from 8 mg to 12 mg combined with standard backbone chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (second line) and ovarian cancer (second and subsequent lines) will be investigated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Quisinostat, a Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor, in Combination With Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It was proven that Quisinostat increases HDAC1-inhibited E-cadherin expression (at the low concentrations of 30 nM) which increases susceptibility to epidermal growth factor inhibitors in case of non-small-cell lung cancer and stops proliferation of paclitaxel-resistant cells. Thus, besides its own efficacy, which can potentially lead to better results of polychemotherapy and increase the mean time to progression, it may be demonstrated that Quisinostat leads to sustained tumor sensitivity to platinum drugs and possibly to resensitiztion in case of acquired or primary resistance. The main objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Quisinostat in multiple ascending doses and establish its maximum tolerated dose (MTD), administered in combination with standard backbone chemotherapy, as follows: Gemcitabine + Cisplatin in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (second line) and Paclitaxel + Carboplatin in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (second line) and in patients with ovarian cancer (second and subsequent lines). MTD is defined as maximum dose at which DLT occurs in no more than 1 patient of 6. Secondary objectives are: • Study of pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple dosing of Quisinostat administered in combination with chemotherapy, as follows: Gemcitabine + Cisplatin in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (second line) and Paclitaxel + Carboplatin in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (second line) and in patients with ovarian cancer (second and subsequent lines) Preliminary estimation of possible effect of the drug, added to chemotherapy, on tumor growth.</detailed_description>

No history of treatment with Gemcitabine if the patient is planned for inclusion in the group of chemotherapy with Cisplatin and Gemcitabine, or Paclitaxel if the patient is planned for inclusion in the group of Carboplatin and Paclitaxel. 12. Vital capacity of lung by spirometry data is more than 50% of normal at screening Special inclusion criteria for patients with ovarian cancer 13. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of ovarian cancer. 14. Progression after no more than three modes of anticancer drug therapy for ovarian cancer. 1. Indications for Xray therapy or chemoradiation therapy at the time of inclusion, regardless of the treated area; 2. Presence of clinical and/or radiological signs of metastases in the brain and meningeal structures (CNS); 3. Previous therapy with HDAC inhibitors 4. Any contraindications to the chemotherapy with Gemcitabine + Cisplatin or Paclitaxel + Carboplatin (in patients with lung cancer); contraindications to chemotherapy according to the standard chemotherapy combination scheme Paclitaxel + Carboplatin (in female patients with ovarian cancer); 5. Any contraindications to administration of glucocorticosteroids, antihistamine drugs, serotonin 5HT3 receptor antagonists, aprepitant; 6.
