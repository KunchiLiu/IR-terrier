	<brief_summary>The combination of subarachnoid anaesthesia (SAB) and continuous local wound infiltration (LCWI) with a consistent amount of local anaesthetics could prevent central sensitization through an additive or synergistic effect because it can maintain continuous inhibition of nociceptive afferents</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Local Continuous Wound Infusion of Anesthetics in the Management of Post-operative Pain After Total Hip Arthroplasty.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Wound infiltration with local anesthetics is an analgesic technique that has been adopted for post-operative analgesia following a range of surgical orthopaedic procedures. Pain management by infusion of local aesthetic into wounds was found to improve pain, reduced opioid use and side effects, increase patient satisfaction, and shorten the hospital stay when compared to placebo or no treatment, but actually it was not definitively proven that wound infiltration provides additional analgesic or outcome benefit in the setting of a comprehensive multimodal analgesic approach. The hypothesis of this study is that a consistent amount of Levobupivacaine 0.5% for LCWI and LIA could provide a more extended postoperative analgesia for post-operative incident and rest pain with a better post-operative recovery and rehabilitation following THA, in the first 72 hours after surgery.</detailed_description>
