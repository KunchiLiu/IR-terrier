	<brief_title>Effects of Gonadotropin Replacement Therapy on Metabolic Parameters in Patients With Hypogonadism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>30 male patients diagnosed with IHH and a control group of 20 healthy cases with similar age and BMI were included in the study. The levels of advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), thiol, malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and the levels of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein (HDL-K), low density lipoprotein (LDL-K), Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) and Apolipoprotein B100 (ApoB100) were measured before and after gonadotrophin therapy.</detailed_description>
