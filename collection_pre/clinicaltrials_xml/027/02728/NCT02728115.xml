	<brief_summary>Cellavita HD is a stem-cell therapy for Huntington's Disease. This is a first-in-human, dose escalation study in which participants with Huntington's Disease will receive 3 intravenous injections and will be followed for 5 years to evaluate safety and preliminary evidence of effectiveness.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Evaluation of Cellavita HD Administered Intravenously in Participants With Huntington's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a first-in-human, dose escalation, non-randomized phase I study in which participants with HD will receive 3 intravenous injections of one of three doses of the investigational product, one every month for three months. Safety evaluation data will include report of all adverse events (including type, frequency, intensity, seriousness, severity, and action taken related to the investigational product study), changes in vital signs, physical examination and medical evaluations, changes in laboratory tests or serology and electrocardiogram (ECG), and incidence and classification of benign and malignant neoplasms. Clinical improvement of motor, cognitive and behavioral degradation will be assessed by the following parameters: inflammatory markers: IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 (interleukin IL) e TNF-alpha (tumoral necrosis factor alpha); application UHDRS Scale (Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale); BMI assessment (Body Mass Index); CNS will be assessed by magnetic resonance.</detailed_description>
