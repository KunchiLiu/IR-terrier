	<brief_summary>The investigators have hypothesized that dietary flavonoids reduce insulin resistance and subclinical inflammation secondary to reductions in intestinal inflammation and permeability and that these events are mediated through alterations in gut microbiota composition. To test this hypothesis, 30 overweight/obese men and women will be provided two well-controlled diets that are identical in macronutrient content (Protein, 17% en; Fat, 30% en; Carbohydrate, 53% en), but differ markedly in flavonoid content (Low Flavonoid Diet, 10 mg/1000 Kcals; High Flavonoid Diet, 340 mg/1000 Kcals). All meals for both diets will be prepared and fed for 6 weeks each in a randomized cross-over design with endpoints determined in duplicate during the last week of each diet period.</brief_summary>
