	<brief_summary>Patient/Population: Women over the age of 18, who are not pregnant and are undergoing benign, robotic-assisted gynecologic procedures at Lutheran General Hospital. Intervention: Decreasing the angle of Trendelenburg for the procedure Control: Steep Trendelenburg, which is the usual standard of care, to the limit of the operative bed, which is 30 degrees. Outcome: Outcomes will include the mean angle of Trendelenburg in the experimental arm and the difference in Trendelenburg between the two arms. Additional outcomes included will be end tidal Carbon dioxide, peak airway pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate and arterial Carbon dioxide. Secondary outcomes will include operative time, blood loss and conversion to laparotomy.</brief_summary>
