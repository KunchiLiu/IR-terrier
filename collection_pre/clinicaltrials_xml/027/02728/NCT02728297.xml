	<brief_title>Staged Extended Thoracoscopic Sympathicotomy for Palmo-axillo-plantar Hyperhidrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a pilot study that investigates the efficacy of video-assisted endoscopic sympathicotomy from the level of T3 to T12 on combined palmar and plantar hyperhidrosis. Ablation of ascending sympathetic fibers would help alleviating both types of hyperhidrosis in a single setting.</detailed_description>
