	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well copanlisib works in treating patients with endometrial cancer that has not decreased or disappeared, and the cancer may still be in the body despite treatment (persistent) or has come back (recurrent). Copanlisib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Copanlisib in Treating Patients With Persistent or Recurrent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the activity of copanlisib (BAY 80-6946) in patients with persistent or recurrent endometrial carcinoma harboring phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PI3KCA) hotspot mutations with the frequency of objective response. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate 6 month progression-free survival (PFS) and median PFS. II. To estimate the distribution of the duration of overall survival (OS). III. To assess the safety profile of copanlisib in endometrial cancer patients. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To systematically evaluate by sequencing the site (i.e., exome) and characteristics of PIK3CA mutations in endometrial cancer patients and correlate such mutations to overall response (OR), PFS, and OS in patients treated with copanlisib. OUTLINE: Patients receive copanlisib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>

measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded); each lesion must be &gt;= 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or &gt;= 20 mm when measured by chest xray; lymph nodes must be &gt;= 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI Patients must have at least one "target lesion" to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by RECIST 1.1; tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as 'nontarget" lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy Patients must have recovered from effects of recent surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy; at least 4 weeks must have elapsed since the patient underwent any major surgery (e.g., major: laparotomy, laparoscopy); there is no delay required for minor procedures (e.g., tumor fineneedle aspiration [FNA] or core biopsy, venous access device placement) Patients may have received prior radiation therapy for treatment of endometrial cancer; prior radiation therapy may have included pelvic radiation therapy, extended field pelvic/paraaortic radiation therapy, intravaginal brachytherapy and/or palliative radiation therapy; all radiation therapy must be completed at least 4 weeks prior to registration Patients may have received prior hormonal therapy for treatment of endometrial carcinoma; all hormonal therapy must be discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to registration Patients may have received prior therapy (including chemotherapy, biologic/targeted therapy and immunotherapy) for treatment of endometrial cancer; all therapy must be discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to registration; any investigational agent must be discontinued at least 30 days prior to registration Patients must have had at least one prior chemotherapeutic regimen for management of endometrial carcinoma; initial treatment may include chemotherapy, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, or consolidation/maintenance therapy; chemotherapy administered in conjunction with primary radiation as a radiosensitizer WILL be counted as a systemic chemotherapy regimen Patients are allowed to receive, but not required to receive, up to a total of 3 lines of chemotherapy Appropriate stage for study entry based on the following diagnostic workup: History/physical examination within 28 days prior to registration Imaging of target lesion(s) within 28 days prior to registration Completion of prestudy protocol specific assessments as required Performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG]/Karnofsky) of 0, 1 or 2 within 28 days prior to registration Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,500/mcl Platelets &gt;= 75,000/mcl Hemoglobin (Hgb) &gt;= 8 g/dL Creatinine =&lt;
