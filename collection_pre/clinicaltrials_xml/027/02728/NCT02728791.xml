	<brief_title>Comparison of Allows Measurement of Cardiac Output Between Clearsight System and Transpulmonary Thermodilution</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since 2014, Edwards society has developed a completely non-invasive monitoring device for measurement of blood pressure and continuous cardiac output without inserting foreign intravascular bodies in the patient. Initially tested on healthy volunteers cardiac disease -free, the correlation with the other devices seems to be good. If this ClearSight © system show a relevant accuracy in measuring blood pressure and cardiac output with a specific ICU hospitalized population, it could justify its place in the therapeutic arsenal of monitoring in intensive care. This is a common care ,prospective observational single center study , concerning the results of blood pressure , cardiac output values and their variations.</detailed_description>
