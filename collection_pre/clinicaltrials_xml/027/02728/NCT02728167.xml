	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether HIFU-assisted liver resection (HIFU-AR) results in reduced blood loss compared to standard liver resection in patients with LM.This is a prospective, monocentric, randomized (1:1 ratio), comparative, open-label Phase II study.</brief_summary>
