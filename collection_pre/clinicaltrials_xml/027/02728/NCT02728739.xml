	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of moderate-to-severe Mitral Regurgitation (MR) in acute Heart Failure (HF) patients requiring hospital admission.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Incidence of Significant Mitral Regurgitation in Acute Heart Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients admitted with symptoms of HF- (shortness of breath (SOB), peripheral oedema, palpitations and irregular heart beats) will be assessed by the Research Team. The level of BNP will be checked using a small device (i-STAT BNP) at the bedside. If results of the test suggest HF they will undergo special procedure called transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). TTE is an ultrasound scan of the heart which will enable the investigators' to grade severity of Mitral Regurgitation (MR) as well as strength of the heart muscle. The investigators will use bi-plane Simpton's method to calculate left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF). Colour Doppler and PISA method will be used to quantify severity of MR or valve leak. Simultaneously there will be recording of heart sounds to find out if auscultation is reliable in identifying leaky valves.</detailed_description>
