	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 3, multi-site, non-randomized, open-label study evaluating the safety and efficacy of MK-7625A 1.5 g (ceftolozane 1 g/tazobactam 0.5 g) for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) including pyelonephritis (uncomplicated or complicated pyelonephritis and complicated lower urinary tract infection) in Japanese participants. Efficacy will be primarily assessed by microbiological response defined as eradication of the baseline pathogen or pathogens.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Japanese males or females who need hospitalization Clinical signs and/or symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTI) at screening visit, either one of the following: Pyelonephritis (uncomplicated or complicated) Complicated lower UTI (cUTI) Has a pretreatment baseline urine culture specimen obtained within 24 hours of start of study drug Requires IV antibacterial therapy for the treatment of the presumed UTI Female participants of child bearing potential must not be pregnant (negative human chorionic gonadotropin test) or breastfeeding and must agree to use adequate contraception for the duration of the study and up to 35 days after the last dose of study drug Male participants must agree to use adequate contraception for the duration of the study and up to 75 days after the last dose of study drug Has a history of recent or recurrent Grampositive organism UTI suggesting colonization, or participant with UTI that shows or suspects the presence of a Grampositive organism only Has a history of any moderate or severe hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to any Betalactam antibacterial including cephalosporins, carbapenems and penicillins, or tazobactam Has a concomitant infection at the time of randomization, which requires nonstudy systemic antibacterial therapy in addition to study drug with the exception of an antibacterial with Grampositive activity only (vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin and teicoplanin) Is receiving probenecid Is currently receiving bladder infusions with topical urinary antiseptics or antibacterial agents Has received any amount of potentially therapeutic antibacterial therapy after collection of the pretreatment baseline urine culture and before administration of the first dose of study drug. Has received any dose of a potentially therapeutic antibacterial agent for the treatment of the current UTI within 48 hours before the pretreatment baseline urine is obtained Intractable urinary infection at baseline that would require more than 7 days of study drug Has complete, permanent obstruction of the urinary tract. Has confirmed fungal urinary tract infection at time of randomization (with ≥ 10^3 fungal colony forming units /mL) Has permanent indwelling bladder catheter or urinary stent including nephrostomy Has suspected or confirmed perinephric or intrarenal abscess Has suspected or confirmed prostatitis, urethritis, or epididymitis Has ileal loop or known vesicoureteral reflux Severe impairment of renal function including an estimated CrCl &lt; 30 mL/min, requirement for peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis or hemofiltration, or oliguria (&lt; 20 mL/h urine output over 24 hours) Has urinary catheter that is not scheduled to be removed before the end of therapy Has any rapidly progressing disease or immediately lifethreatening illness including acute hepatic failure, respiratory failure, and septic shock Has an immunocompromising condition (i.e., AIDS, hematological malignancy, or bone marrow transplantation, or immunosuppressive therapy) or is receiving ≥ 40 mg of prednisone per day administered continuously for &gt; 14 days prior to study start Has participated in any clinical study of an investigational product within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug Has previously participated in any study of ceftolozane or MK7625A.</criteria>
