	<brief_summary>The goals of this project are to: 1) explore the potential use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data for improved prediction of response to cardiac resynchronization (CRT), and 2) use the MRI-derived data together with a computer model of the cardiovascular system to study the relative roles of different factors in the mechanical effects of dyssynchrony in failure, and in the response (or lack thereof) to CRT.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Male and female patients ages 18 and over scheduled by conventional criteria (symptomatic impairment of cardiac function with broadened QRS) for clinical CRT procedures at NYULMC. Normal kidney function as determined by GFR levels. Inclusion Criteria for Controls Normal kidney function as determined by GFR levels No significant cardiovascular disease or risk factors. electrical implants such as cardiac pacemakers or perfusion pumps ferromagnetic implants such as aneurysm clips, surgical clips, prostheses, artificial hearts, valves with steel parts, metal fragments, shrapnel, tattoos near the eye, or steel implants ferromagnetic objects such as jewelry or metal clips in clothing (which will be removed) preexisting medical conditions including a likelihood of developing seizures or claustrophobic reactions, and any greater than normal potential for cardiac arrest.</criteria>
