	<brief_summary>The main aim of the study is to investigate the effect of daily consumption of a margarine enriched with plant sterol esters and fish oil on fasting triglycerides (TG) concentrations. The study also aims to investigate the effect of plant sterols and fish oil on fasting total cholesterol (TC), Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and non-HDL-C. At last, the effect of plant sterols and fish oil on fasting apolipoprotein concentrations will be explored.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main aim of the study is to investigate the effect of daily consumption of a margarine enriched with plant sterol esters and fish oil on fasting TG concentrations. The study also aims to investigate the effect of plant sterols and fish oil on fasting TC, LDL-C, HDL-C and non-HDL-C. At last, the effect of plant sterols and fish oil on fasting apolipoprotein concentrations will be explored. This exploratory objective will only be analyzed if a relevant treatment effect on fasting triglycerides concentrations is observed.</detailed_description>
