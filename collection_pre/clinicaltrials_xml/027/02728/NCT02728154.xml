	<brief_summary>Gut microbiota play an important role in normal cardiovascular function and pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases. Patients with heart failure (HF) have substantial hemodynamic changes which lead to intestinal hypoperfusion and congestion and eventually change gut morphology, permeability, function and composition of gut microbiota and cause translocation of microbial and endotoxins into the blood stream. Additionally, metabolites derived from gut microbiota modulate the pathophysiology of HF. Patients with HF have intestinal overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria and increased gut permeability. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that antibiotic treatment benefits patients with acute coronary syndromes and reduces the incidence of ischemic cardiovascular events. Taking the strong association of gut microbiota with HF into account, it is reasonable to speculate that gut microbiota could contribute to the progression of pre-HF with preserved ejection fraction (pre-HFpEF) to HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Pre-HFpEF remains poorly understood, yet has high prevalence and a significantly high risk for death in comparison to patient without pre-HFpEF. We hypothesize that altered gut microbiota is involved in the initiation and establishment of HF and pre-HFpEF.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The research study will initially enroll 50 subjects without HF as normal controls,120 subjects with history of HF and 50 subjects with pre-HFpEF to characterize gut microbiota. The subjects will provide blood samples and a stool sample.</detailed_description>
