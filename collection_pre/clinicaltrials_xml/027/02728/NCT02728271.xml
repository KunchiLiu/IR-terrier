	<brief_summary>Churg-Strauss syndrome is a rare autoimmune inflammatory disease affecting medium- and small-sized blood vessels, causing asthma, abnormalities of the blood, lung diseases, and neuropathy. The main cause of death in these patients is heart attack. Without therapy, the 5-year survival in patients with Churg-Strauss syndrome is 25%. Although with the 5-year survival is increased to 62% with the appropriate therapy, many patients remain refractory to therapy. The long term outcome of these patients remains grim. The aim of this research study is to determine if suppressing the immune system using a combination of high dose chemotherapy, antibodies, and radiation followed by stem cell transplant will abolish the 'bad' immune system and let the patient's body establish a new immune system that does not attack the blood vessels.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Churg-Strauss syndrome is a rare autoimmune inflammatory disease affecting medium- and small-sized arteries and veins and is closely related to Wegener's granulomatosis. It is also one of the diseases that are associated with antibodies to neutrophils cytoplasmic antigens (ANCAs). Patients with Churg-Strauss syndrome often present with refractory asthma, eosinophilia, pulmonary infiltrates and mononeuritis multiplex. Corticosteroids remain the first line therapy for these patients and most patients respond to corticosteroid therapy. However, a small proportion of patients need other immunosuppressive agents such as cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine A, Rituximab, and azathioprine. Still a number of these patients remain refractory and extremely dependent on high dose corticosteroids. The principal cause of mortality in these patients is myocarditis and myocardial infarction due to coronary arteritis. Without therapy, the 5-year survival in patients with Churg-Strauss syndrome is 25%. Although with the 5-year survival is increased to 62% with the appropriate therapy, many patients remain refractory to therapy. The long term outcome of these patients remains grim. In this study, the investigators hypothesize that the addition of total lymphatic irradiation to the combination of high dose cyclophosphamide and antithymocyte globulins can be given safely to these patients and will not only induce disease remission in patients with refractory Churg-Strauss syndrome, it would also induce sustained and long period of medication-free remission in these patients. Since this combination preparative regimen has never been used previously, the investigators will test this hypothesis in a pilot study.</detailed_description>
