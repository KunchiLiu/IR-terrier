	<brief_summary>This single-arm, multicenter Phase 2 study will treat the patients who have Recurrent or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma with an infusion of the patient's own T cells that have been genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that will bind to tumour cells that express the EPCAM protein on the cell surface.The study will determine if these modified T cells help the body's immune system eliminate tumour cells.The trial will also study the safety of treatment with CAR-T,how long CAR-T cells stay in the patient's body and the impact of this treatment on survival.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety With CAR-T for Recurrent or Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-arm, multicenter Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the CAR-T for Recurrent or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma.The study will be conducted using a phase I/II design. The study will have the following sequential phases: Part A (screening leukapheresis,cell product preparation, and cytoreductive chemotherapy) and Part B (treatment and follow-up). The follow-up period for each participant is approximately 35 months after the final CAR-T infusion. The total duration of the study is expected to be approximately 3 years. A total of 24 patients may be enrolled over a period of 3 years.</detailed_description>
