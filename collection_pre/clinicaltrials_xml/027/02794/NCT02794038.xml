	<brief_title>Accuracy &amp; Usability Study for Soberlink Cellular Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this accuracy and usability study is to validate the performance of Soberlink Cellular Device in the hands of the intended (lay) users - untrained study participants who have consumed alcohol and use the Soberlink Cellular Device to measure their blood alcohol content (BAC) in comparison to a predicate device. The purpose of this document is to define how the human factors environment impacts the actual user interface design as well as how usability engineering evaluates user interface via usability objectives and usability tests. This accuracy and usability study will be performed on Soberlink Cellular Device in order to comply with FDA's Draft Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, titled: Applying Human Factors and Usability Engineering to Optimize Medical Device Design, IEC 60601-1-6 (collateral standard for usability engineering of medical electrical equipment), and IEC 62366 (application of usability engineering to medical devices).</detailed_description>
