	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the efficacy of an infusion of Ronopterin (VAS203) on clinical outcome in patients with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury. Half of the participants will receive Ronopterin (VAS203), while the other half will receive placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of VAS203 (Ronopterin) in Patients With Moderate and Severe Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe and moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) constitutes a major health problem. TBI is the leading cause of death and disability among young adults in developed countries, and the incidence in the elderly population is increasing. Neurological damage after TBI is caused not only by the accident itself, but evolves afterwards. The posttraumatic secondary injury includes - among others - inflammation and oedema formation with subsequent increase of intracranial pressure. A key molecule in these processes is the gas nitric oxide, which is produced in excess during neuroinflammation. Ronopterin (VAS203) is an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase. Ronopterin reduces excess nitric oxide production and subsequent secondary injury.</detailed_description>
