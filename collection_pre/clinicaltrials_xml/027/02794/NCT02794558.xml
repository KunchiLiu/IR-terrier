	<brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness of MR Guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery in the Treatment of Early Breast Carcinomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study specific aim is to Coagulate the tissue volume of a proven breast cancer with MRgFUS and Collect post treatment follow-up clinical and radiological data for a period of 5 years following MRgFUS for breast cancer. Safety of the treatment will be evaluated by recording and assessing the incidence and severity of device- related complications from the first visit through the 5 years follow-up period. Secondary objective of this study is to evaluate post treatment local recurrence in the same quadrant or less then 4cm from the periphery of the treated lesion, during a 5 year period following the MRgFUS treatment. Women with breast cancer in whom breast MR imaging identifies a single focal breast lesion up to 1.5 cm in diameter will be eligible for the study.</detailed_description>

Breast cancer which was diagnosed by incisional / excisional biopsy Contraindication to MRI (nonMRI compatible implanted metal devices). Pregnant or lactating post partum women. Prior XRT or laser or cryotherapy to the target breast. Difficulty lying prone and still for up to 210 minutes in the MR unit, e.g., COPD, heart disease, lung disease, sleep apnea or airway problems, severe asthma, severe arthritis, severe claustrophobia.

Patients currently receiving anticoagulation therapy. Large patients who cannot fit comfortably in the magnet, or patients &gt; 100Kg. Lesions difficult to target (&lt;1 cm from skin, nippleareola complex or the ribcage), as visualized on pretherapy MRI. Microcalcifications as the only sign of breast cancer on imaging studies. Patients with breast implants. Prior reaction to gadoliniumbased contrast agent Prior radiation to the breast, which is about to be treated. Evidence of tumor at any location other then the targeted lesion. Histological type of invasive micropapillary carcinoma because of cancer displacement by the needle Mucinous carcinoma which was diagnosed by core needle biopsy because of needle cancer displacement</criteria>
