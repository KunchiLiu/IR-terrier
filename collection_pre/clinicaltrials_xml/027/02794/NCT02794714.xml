	<brief_summary>This study compares surgeon's satisfaction of operating conditions and patient's satisfaction following laparoscopic gynecological surgeries in two groups of patients, half of whom will receive deep neuromuscular blockade and the other half, moderate neuromuscular blockade.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Deep vs Moderate Block: Impact on Operating Conditions &amp; Patient Satisfaction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Deep neuromuscular blockade in anesthesia has been shown to improve operating conditions in retroperitoneal surgeries, while there is minimal evidence regarding this method in laparoscopic gynecological procedures.The advantage of improving surgical conditions with a deep neuromuscular blockade in laparoscopic surgery may however lead to a delayed neuromuscular recovery and hence a delay in turnover of patients. Rocuronium will be used for muscle relaxation in order to achieve the necessary depth of neuromuscular blockade. Sugammadex is a modified cyclodextrin that forms complexes with rocuronium, reducing free plasma concentrations of rocuronium and reversing its neuromuscular blocking action from any depth. The use of rocuronium will therefore aid in achieving a deep neuromuscular blockade which the investigators postulate will improve surgical conditions and the reversal with sugammadex will ensure a rapid recovery thereafter.</detailed_description>
