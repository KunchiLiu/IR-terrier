	<brief_summary>The investigators test with the present study design, whether an ultrasound-guided blockade of the cervical plexus in combination with an additional application of local anesthetic to the superficial cervical ansa (facial nerve: cervical branch) leads to an improved quality of anesthesia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound-guided Intermediate Cervical Plexus Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The innervation of the neck area is complex and includes cranial nerve (innervation of the vessel wall (IX,X) and of the neck muscles (VII,XI)), as well as the cervical plexus and brachial plexus. This is a major cause of insufficient anesthesia quality during carotid endarterectomies. The investigators test with the present prospective study design, whether an ultrasound-guided blockade of the cervical plexus in combination with an additional application of local anesthetic to the superficial cervical ansa (facial nerve: cervical branch) leads to an improved quality of anesthesia.</detailed_description>
