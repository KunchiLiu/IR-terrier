	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this trial is to investigate the effects of a new class of drugs that help the patient's immune system attack their tumor (glioblastoma multiforme - GBM). These drugs have already shown benefit in some other cancer types and are now being explored in GBM. Both tremelimumab and durvalumab (MEDI4736) are "investigational" drugs, which means that the drugs are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Both drugs are antibodies (proteins used by the immune system to fight infections and cancers). Durvalumab attaches to a protein in tumors called PD-L1. It may prevent cancer growth by helping certain blood cells of the immune system get rid of the tumor. Tremelimumab stimulates (wakes up) the immune system to attack the tumor by inhibiting a protein molecule called CTLA-4 on immune cells. Combining the actions of these drugs may result in better treatment options for patients with glioblastoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tremelimumab and Durvalumab in Combination or Alone in Treating Patients With Recurrent Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the T-cell changes that occur in glioblastoma (GBM) treated with tremelimumab and durvalumab (MEDI4736) as single agents and in combination. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety of either tremelimumab or MEDI4736 alone and in combination in patients with GBM. II. To determine the time to progression for patients treated with either tremelimumab or MEDI4736 alone and in combination of both, post-surgery. III. To determine the overall survival for patients treated with tremelimumab or MEDI4736 alone and in combination of both post-surgery. IV. To assess magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in patients treated with either tremelimumab or MEDI4736 alone and in combination of both post-surgery. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To correlate T-cell changes and programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1) expression with patient outcomes. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms. ARM 1: Patients receive tremelimumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM 2: Patients receive durvalumab IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM 3: Patients receive tremelimumab IV over 1 hour on day 1 then, after a gap of 1 hour for the first cycle, durvalumab IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 4 weeks with tremelimumab for up to 7 courses and every 2 weeks with durvalumab for up to 14 courses. Patients then receive both tremelimumab and durvalumab IV over 1 hour every 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All patients undergo surgical tumor resection on day 14. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 8-16 weeks for 2 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have a grade III or IV glioma that has progressed after standard radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) (Note: Pathology will need to be reviewed locally but registration can occur based on pathology report) Patients must have had radiographic evidence of tumor progression by brain MRI or computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast Patients must be &gt; 12 weeks from completion of radiation therapy unless there is tissue confirmation of tumor recurrence or there is progression outside the radiation treatment field Prior therapy with gamma knife or other focal highdose radiotherapy is allowed, but the patient must have subsequent histologic documentation of recurrence, unless the recurrence occurs remote from the treated site Patients must be surgical candidates Patients must have had no more than 3 prior lines of chemotherapy; this includes the initial treatment and two relapses; concurrent and adjuvant TMZbased chemotherapy, including the combination of TMZ with another agent, is considered one line of chemotherapy; for clarification, please contact the principle investigator (PI), Dr. Jeffrey Raizer, at (312) 6950990 Patients must be &gt;= 4 weeks from TMZ 6 weeks from a nitrosoureas 3 weeks from a biologic or targeted agent (i.e. small molecule) 4 weeks for a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor (i.e. bevacizumab) Patients must exhibit a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) &gt;= 70 Life expectancy of &gt;= 12 weeks (per treating investigator's discretion) Patients must be on a stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids within 5 days prior to CT scan or MRI (which is done to determine eligibility); the goal should be dexamethasone 4 mg or less at the time of starting treatment; if patient requires &gt; 4mg of steroid, please check with the principle investigator (PI); requirement for greater than 10mg of steroid will make the patient ineligible Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mcL Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcl Hemoglobin (Hb) &gt;
