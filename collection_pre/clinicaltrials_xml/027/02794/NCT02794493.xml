	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Hand foot syndrome may be treated or reduced by soaking Traditional Chinese Medicine Formula LC09 in patients receiving capecitabine for colorectal and/or breast cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying soaking Traditional Chinese Medicine Formula LC09 to see how well they work compared to placebos in preventing hand-foot syndrome in patients who are receiving capecitabine for colorectal or breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Hand and Foot Syndrome With Traditional Chinese Medicine Formula LC09 in Patients Who Are Receiving Capecitabine for Colorectal and/or Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: OBJECTIVES: Determine whether Traditional Chinese Medicine Formula LC09 can treat or reduce the severity of capecitabine-caused hand foot syndrome. Evaluate the potential toxicity of Traditional Chinese Medicine Formula LC09. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are randomized to 2 treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive Traditional Chinese Medicine Formula LC09 by soaking their affected hand and feet 20 min twice daily. Arm II: Patients receive placebo by soaking their affected hand and feet 20 min twice daily.</detailed_description>
