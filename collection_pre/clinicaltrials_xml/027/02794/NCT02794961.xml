	<brief_title>CD22 Targeting CAR-T Therapy Against B Cell Hematological Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CD19 is an ideal target with great potential for treating B-cell-derived hematological malignancies. Although the complete remission rate is as high as 93% by using CD19-targeting CAR-T technology, approximately 60% patients will have recurrent disease. Among all the recurrent patients, two thirds is revealed to loss their CD19 expression on B cell surface. For overcoming this issue, we establish a new chimeric antigen receptor containing humanized single chain antibody sequence to target CD22 molecule on B cells.</detailed_description>
