	<brief_summary>USING GENETIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL TO PICK THE RIGHT DRUG FOR THE RIGHT DISEASE AT THE RIGHT DOSE DEFINES PERSONALIZED MEDICINE. THIS PILOT STUDY SEEKS TO INSTITUTE PHARMACOGENOMIC TESTING, THAT IS IDENTIFYING GENETIC VARIATION THAT INFLUENCES PATIENT RESPONSE TO DRUGS, INTO THE NEMOURS CHILDREN'S HEALTH SYSTEM. WE PROPOSE TO INITIATE THE STUDY BY IDENTIFYING GENETIC DIFFERENCES IN CYP2C19, A GENE THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A CERTAIN ENZYME IN THE LIVER THAT METABOLIZES MANY DRUGS INCLUDING A CLASS OF DRUGS CALLED PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS (PPI; PREVACID, NEXIUM). PPI ARE USED TO TREAT HEARTBURN AND OTHER SYMPTOMS OF GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (GERD) AND ARE EXTENSIVELY USED IN PEDIATRICS. CHRONIC USE OF PPI CAN CAUSE SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDING COLD, PNEUMONIA AND STOMACH INFECTIONS, WHICH GETS WORSE AT HIGHER DOSES. CHILDREN WHO POORLY METABOLIZE DRUGS BECAUSE OF GENETIC VARIATION IN CYP2C19 SHOULD GET LOWER DOSES OF PPI THAN CHILDREN WHO METABOLIZE PPI NORMALLY. OUR PILOT STUDY WILL GENOTYPE CHILDREN WITH GERD OR OTHER STOMACH ACID MEDIATED CONDITIONS FOR WHICH A PPI IS PRESCRIBED USING A SAMPLE OF SPIT TO DETERMINE WHICH DOSE OF PPI THEY GET BASED ON THE FORM OF THE CYP2C19 GENE THEY HAVE. WE WILL STUDY 120 CHILDREN 2-17 YO DIAGNOSED WITH GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (GERD) OR OTHER STOMACH ACID MEDIATED CONDITIONS FOR WHICH A PPI IS PRESCRIBED . GENETIC RESULTS ARE AVAILABLE IN &lt; 60 MINUTES, AND THEIR DOSES ARE DETERMINED BY THEIR DOCTOR BASED ON GENETIC RESULTS. THIS STUDY WILL ALLOW US TO GAIN VALUABLE EXPERIENCE THAT WILL BE USED TO EXPAND OUR GENETIC PROGRAM TO OTHER GENES AND DRUGS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Implementation of PPI Medication PGX Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO IMPLEMENT PHARMACOGENOMIC (PGX) TESTING OF APPROVED GENE-DRUG PAIRS TO MAXIMIZE THE EFFICACY AND MINIMIZE ADVERSE EVENTS FOR DRUGS THAT ARE USED TO TREAT CHILDHOOD DISEASE. PERSONALIZED MEDICINE, THAT IS, THE USE OF THE PATIENT'S OWN GENETIC INFORMATION TO PREDICT THE RIGHT DOSE OF THE RIGHT DRUG, HAS BEEN A GOAL OF MEDICINE'S SINCE THE PUBLICATION OF THE HUMAN GENONE AND HAPMAP PROJECTS. HOWEVER, THE ADOPTION OF PGX TESTING HAS BEEN SLOW OWING TO SEVERALBARRIERS AND CHALLENGES. RECENTLY PRESIDENT OBAMA ANNOUNCED THE PRECISION MEDICINE INITIATIVE, WHICH INCLUDES PGX TESTING, AND HAS EARMARKED $ 1 B TO IMPLEMENT IT. THE PRECISION MEDICINE INITIATIVE IS EXPECTED TO MOVE PERSONALIZED MEDICINE FORWARD SO THAT MOST PATIENTS INCLUDING PEDIATRIC PATIENTS WILL BENEIT. THE NEMOURS CHILDREN'S HEALTH SYSTEM IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO LEAD THE EFFORT TO PERSONALIZE MEDICINE AMONG PEDIATRIC PATIENTS. THE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED 1-YEAR PILOT PROJECT IS TO IMPLEMENT PGX TESTING IN THE NEMOURS CHILDREN'S HEALTH SYSTEM. THE EXPERIENCE, KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS GAINED IN THIS PILOT PROJECT WILL POSITION NEMOURS TO HELP LEAD PRECISION MEDICINE INTIATIVES INCLUDING PGX TESTING AMONG PEDIATRIC POPULATIONS. TO IMPLEMENT PGX TESTING IN NEMOURS WE PROPOSE TO BEGIN TESTING THE CYP2C19 - PROTON PUMP INHIBITOR GENE-DRUG PAIR IN THE DIVISION OF GASTROENTEROLOGY, NEMOURS CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL. A TOTAL OF 120 CHILDREN 2-17 YO WHO HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (GERD) OR OTHER STOMACH ACID MEDIATED CONDITIONS FOR WHICH A PPI IS PRESCRIBED WILL BE RECRUITED INTO THE STUDY BY PEDIATRIC GASTROENTEROLOGISTS (AIM 1A). DRS. FRANCIOSI AND LIMA WILL EDUCATE STAFF IN THE DIVISON OF PGX TESTING AND OF THE STUDY. GI PEDIATRICIANS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN PGX TESTING. AFTER OBTAINING CONSENT, THE STUDY COORDINATOR WILL OBTAIN AND BAR CODE SAMPLES OF SALIVA FROM THE PATIENT. SAMPLES WILL BE GENOTYPED BY SPARTAN RX, A POINT-OF-CARE GENOTYPING PLATFORM, WHICH ARE HOUSED (2 OF THEM) IN THE DIVISION OF PATHOLOGY. LOSS-OF-FUNCTION ALLELES (*2, *3) AND THE GAIN-OF-FUNCTION ALLELE (*17) ARE IDENTIFIED IN &lt; 60 MINUTES. THE RESULT OF GENOTYPING WILL BE CHECKED BY DR. BADIZADEGAN AND ENTERED INTO THE PATIENT'S EMR. CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT (CDS) TOOLS WILL ADVISE DRS. BADIZADEGAN AND FRANCIOSI OF THE PATIENTS METABOLIC PHENOTYE BASED ON CYP2C19 GENOTYPE. DR. FRANCIOSI (OR OTHE GI PEDIATRICIANS) WILL DECIDE THE DOSE OF PPI TO USE BASED CDS TOOLS CARRYING ALGORITHMS FOR CONVENTIONAL DOSING AND FOR GENOTYPE-GUIDED DOSING OF PPIs. THE ELECTRONIC PRESCRIPTION FOR THE PPI WITH GENOTYPE-GUIDED DOSING WILL BE CALLED IN. PPI EFFICACY AND SAFETY FOR EACH STUDY PARTICIPANT WILL BE MONITORED WEEKLY (AIM 1B) BY COLLECTING AND RECORDING SCORES ON VALIDATED GERD AND ADVERSE REACTION QUESTIONNAIRES. EFFICACY AND SAFETY SCORES WILL BE COMMUNICATED BY EACH PARTICIPANT (OR CARE GIVER) USING MOBILE DEVICES (IPHONE; COMPUTER) AND RECORDED USING REDCAP. DR. BLAKE WILL SUPERVISE THIS PHASE OF THE STUDY. OUTCOME METRICS FOR AIM 1A INCLUDE: % OF PATIENTS AGREEING TO VOLUNTEER FOR THE STUDY; % OF PATIENTS REPORTING EFFICACY AND TOXICITY DATA; % OF PROVIDERS AGREEING TO PARTICIPATE IN STUDY; AND % OF PARTICIPANTS AGREEING TO FUTURE USE OF DNA. OUTCOME METRICS FOR AIM B WILL BE JUDGEMENTS BY DR. FRANCIOSI AND HIS STAFF REGARDING SUCCESS BASED ON SCORES FROM GERD AND ADVERSE EVENT QUESTIONNAIRES.</detailed_description>
