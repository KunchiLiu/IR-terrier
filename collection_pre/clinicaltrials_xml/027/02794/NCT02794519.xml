	<brief_summary>Sirukumab is a fully human anti interleukin (IL)-6 immunoglobulin G1-kappa monoclonal antibody (MAb) which is in development for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The continuing unmet need in subjects with asthma refractory to corticosteroid therapy and increased understanding of asthma pathogenesis have stimulated the development of targeted biologics based on predictive biomarkers. The majority of approaches to date have targeted T Helper 2 (Th2) cytokines or their downstream effects. Targeting IL-6 in severe asthma represents an unprecedented approach that has potential to address non-Th2 drivers of severe asthma. This multicenter, randomized, double-blind (sponsor-unblind), placebo-controlled, parallel group study will investigate the efficacy of sirukumab compared to placebo in subjects having uncontrolled severe asthma despite use of high dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) in combination with long-acting Beta-agonist (LABA). The study will employ a variable treatment period for individual subjects. Dosing will continue every 4 weeks until week 44 (inclusive), or until 24 weeks after the final subject has been randomized, whichever the sooner. Upon receiving the final dose of study medicine or placebo, subjects will enter a 16 week Follow Up period. Overall, the duration of participation for subjects who complete the full 44-week treatment period and Follow Up period may be up to 64 weeks. Approximately 175 subjects will be randomized such that 140 evaluable subjects complete the study.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Asthma</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Subjects aged 18 75 years, inclusive. Severe, uncontrolled asthma according to the following criteria: Physiciandiagnosed asthma for &gt;=12 months, and; treatment for at least 3 months with &gt;=880 microgram per day of fluticasone propionate (FP) dry powder for inhalation (DPI) or its equivalent, plus a long acting beta agonist (LABA), and' ACQ7 score &gt;=1.5, and; a documented history (e.g., medical record verification) in the 12 months prior to Visit 2 of &gt;=1 exacerbation resulting in prescription for systemic oral corticosteroids or hospitalisation or extended observation in a hospital emergency room or outpatient centre. [For subjects on maintenance systemic corticosteroids, at least double the existing maintenance dose for at least 3 days is required] and; prebronchodilator FEV1 3580% inclusive, with evidence of &gt;=12% (and 200 milliliter [mL]) reversibility in FEV1 measured 1530 minutes following 4 actuations of salbutamol (100 microgram per actuation) or albuterol (90 microgram per actuation) via premetered dose inhaler (pMDI). This reversibility criterion should have been documented in the 12months prior to Screening. If no prior data are available this should be demonstrated either at Screening (Visit 2) or at the Randomization visit (Visit 3); blood eosinophil count &lt;300 cells per microliter at screening. Body mass index 1845 kilogram per meter square. Male or Females and Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential must comply with the following contraception requirements from the time of first dose of study medication until a cycle of spermatogenesis following five terminal half lives after the last dose of study medication: Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia; Male condom plus partner use of one of the following contraceptive options: Contraceptive subdermal implant; Intrauterine device or intrauterine system; Combined estrogen and progestogen oral contraceptive; Injectable progesterone; Contraceptive vaginal ring; Percutaneous contraceptive patches. This is an allinclusive list of those methods that meet the following GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) definition of highly effective: having a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly and, when applicable, in accordance with the product label. For nonproduct methods (e.g., male sterility), the investigator determines what is consistent and correct use. The GSK definition is based on the definition provided by The International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of nonchild bearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as age greater than 60 or 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt;40 milliinternational units per milliliter (MlU/mL) and estradiol &lt;40 picogram per milliliter (pg/mL) (&lt;140 picomole per liter [pmol/L] is confirmatory) or if of childbearing potential is using a highly effective method for avoidance of pregnancy for the duration of dosing and until 4 months post lastdose. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. Presence of a known preexisting, clinically important lung condition other than asthma. This includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, or a history of lung cancer. Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) or asthma exacerbation requiring antibiotics or systemic corticosteroids within 6 weeks of screening. Evidence of respiratory infection at screening. Has a history of chronic or recurrent infectious disease or ongoing infection including, but not limited to, chronic renal infection, chronic chest infection, recurrent urinary tract infection (example, recurrent pyelonephritis, chronic nonremitting cystitis), or open, draining skin wound or an ulcer. Serious infection within 8 weeks of enrolment, including, but not limited to hepatitis, pneumonia, sepsis, or pyelonephritis; or has been hospitalized for an infection; or has been treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics for an infection, within 8 weeks prior to the first administration of study drug. Opportunistic infection, example, a nontuberculous mycobacterial infection or cytomegalovirus, pneumocystosis, aspergillosis within 6 months prior to screening. Evidence of poorly controlled chronic medical conditions other than asthma, example, subjects with known, preexisting, clinically significant endocrine, autoimmune, metabolic, neurological, renal, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and haematological or any other system abnormalities that are uncontrolled with standard treatment. Current history of suicidal ideation or a past history of suicide attempt. Lactating, pregnant, or planning to become pregnant during the study. Malignancy within 5 years (except local basal cell carcinoma, or fully excised local dermal, squamous cell carcinoma).

QTcorrected (QTc) &gt;450 milliseconds (msec) or QTc &gt;480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block. Notes: The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Bazett's formula (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF), and/or another method, machineread or manually overread; The specific formula that will be used to determine eligibility and discontinuation for an individual subject should be determined prior to initiation of the study. In other words, several different formulae cannot be used to calculate the QTc for an individual subject and then the lowest QTc value used to include or discontinue the subject from the trial. Alanine transaminase (ALT) &gt;1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) and bilirubin &gt;ULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5 times ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).
