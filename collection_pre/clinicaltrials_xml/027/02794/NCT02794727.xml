	<brief_summary>Decreased physical activity is not only associated with multiple chronic medical conditions, including obesity, but also with depressed mood, and other negative emotions. As many employed adults spend a great deal of time at work where we are predominantly sedentary, strategies to increase physical activity at work are being pursued to help improve the physical and mental health of Americans. This 17 week randomized controlled trial will investigate changes of occupational physical activity in three groups: those provided with a FitBit® but not able to monitor their activity level, and those provided with activity goals and individual physical activity challenges, and those who do not use a FitBit®.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All subjects will be entered into a 4 week run-in phase where subjects will wear a blinded Fitbit during work hours. The baseline work activity is collected at this time. This phase is followed by a randomization to one of 3 groups: the blinded Fitbit group, the unblinded Fitbit group, and the group which will not wear any activity monitors. During these 12 weeks we will collect data on activity levels during work hours. Everyone will have a final contact at week 17 to close out the study.</detailed_description>
