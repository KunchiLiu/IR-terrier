	<brief_title>Transdiagnostic Group Intervention for Children With Behavior Problems</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>By participating in the study, child participants will learn emotion regulation skills and have opportunities to interact and practice skills with other children who have similar problems. In addition, parent participants will learn effective parenting skills, including appropriate limit-setting, use of praise and consequences, and empathy, that may help them effectively navigate the challenges of caring for a child with behavior concerns (1). Parents will also have the opportunity to interact with other parents who face similar challenges, providing validation and support. Upon completion of the study, investigators plan to share these findings at professional conferences and submit manuscripts to peer-reviewed journals. Collectively, this study will add to the literature in the pediatric mental health field and may also serve as a model for other outpatient clinics regarding implementation and provision of a transdiagnostic approach to treat children with behavior problems. Thus, the main goals of the current study are to examine the effectiveness of the UP-C group treatment in reducing childhood behavior problems, evaluate parents' satisfaction with this treatment, and determine the feasibility of implementing this treatment in a pediatric outpatient setting.</detailed_description>
