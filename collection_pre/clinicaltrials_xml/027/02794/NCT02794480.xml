	<brief_summary>The study is conducted to evaluate the potentially improved patient handling of the ELLIPTA Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI). Therefore, the study aims to evaluate errors encountered by subject with asthma during handling ELLIPTA DPI relative to two metered dose inhalers (MDI), a GSK MDI and the AstraZeneca (AZ) MDI. It is a randomised, multi-centre, open-label, cross-over study comparing placebo ELLIPTA DPI with placebo MDI (GSK and AZ) to assess correct inhaler use. No active drug will be used in this study in order to prevent any drug-related effects. Approximately, 152 subjects will be randomized to receive ELLIPTA DPI inhaler and 152 will be randomized to receive one of the MDI inhalers, for use during the first period (P) (approximately 28 days). At Visit 2 (Day 28) all subjects previous receiving the ELLIPTA DPI will be randomized to receive one of the MDI inhalers and all subjects who received a MDI in the previous period will receive the ELLIPTA DPI for use during second period (approximately 28 days). Subjects will continue taking their asthma maintenance treatment and limited rescue albuterol MDI during the entire 56-day study period. ELLIPTA is a registered trademark of the GSK group of companies.</brief_summary>

Use of SABA prior to exercise for the prevention of exercise induced bronchoconstriction is exclusionary. Subjects with a known or suspected alcohol or drug abuse at Visit 1 which in the opinion of the investigator could interfere with the subject's proper completion of the protocol requirement Current smokers or subjects with a smoking history of 10 packyears or more (example, 20 cigarettes/day for 10 years) are not eligible. A subject may not have used tobacco products within the past year (i.e., cigarettes, cigars, or pipe tobacco) Concurrent diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or other respiratory disorders including active tuberculosis, lung cancer, bronchiectasis, sarcoidosis, lung fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung diseases or other active pulmonary diseases History of life threatening asthma or has experienced more than 1 exacerbation which required oral/systemic corticosteroids in the 12 months prior to Visit 1 History of hypersensitivity to any components of the study inhaler (e.g., lactose, magnesium stearate). In addition, subjects with a history of severe milk protein allergy that, in the opinion of the study physician, contraindicates participation Historical or current evidence of clinically significant or rapidly progressing or unstable cardiovascular, neurological, cardiovascular, neurological, renal, hepatic, immunological, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or hematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled. Significant is defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through participation, or which would affect the affect the analysis if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study Subjects who have received an investigational drug and/or medical device within 30 days of entry into this study (Screening/Visit 1), or within five drug halflives of the investigational drug, whichever is longer A subject will not be eligible for this study if he/she is an immediate family member of the participating investigator, subinvestigator, study coordinator, or employee of the participating investigator.</criteria>
