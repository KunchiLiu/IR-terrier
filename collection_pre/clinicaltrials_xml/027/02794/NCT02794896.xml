	<brief_summary>Anesthesia depth affects the proliferation of lymphocytes to NK-cells and memory T-cells effect and the phagocytosis activity of macrophages in healthy patients. ASA 1-3 subjects undergoing extended shoulder surgery under continuous regional anesthesia randomly were assigned to a deep or a shallow anesthesia level (BIS &lt;35 or &gt;55) for more than an hour. Immune response is measured by lymphocyte proliferation as well as neutrophil and monocyte phagocytosis activity.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Blood samples were taken under minimal stress prior to anesthesia induction (T0), recovery (T1) and 12 weeks following hospital discharge (T2) from the respective anesthesia depth level. Bispectral index monitoring (BIS) was performed from the awake state to complete recovery in all subjects. Hemoglobin concentration, leukocyte and lymphocyte counts were determined by routine automated laboratory techniques. Lymphocyte proliferation was analyzed by SASPA flow cytometry analysis. In brief, 100 µl EDTA blood were stirred with 10 µl FITC and PE marked antibody mixture containing CD3, CD4, CD8, CD 16, CD45, CD28, CD27, CD 56. Monocyte and neutrophil phagocytosis activity was measured separately in macrophages of fresh heparinized whole blood using flow cytometric test kits. Proteomics of monocytes was done synchronously.</detailed_description>
