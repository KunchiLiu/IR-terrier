	<brief_summary>Halitosis associated with tongue coating results from the production of volatile sulfur compounds by bacterial action. The use of prebiotics and probiotics might be useful in treating such condition. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the prebiotic inulin combined with the probiotic Streptococcus salivarius (SS) on halitosis by coating.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inulin and S. Salivarius Reduce Halitosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this double-blind, randomized, phase II trial, 45 patients (35 ± 15 years, 66% women) with halitosis by coating were allocated to three treatment groups (n = 15) using gum of oral dissolution for 10 days, containing: inulin+SS, SS and placebo. Organoleptic test, Halimeter®, coating index and evaluation of quality of life (OHIP-14 and WHOQOL-Bref) were performed before and after treatments. Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate the effects.</detailed_description>
