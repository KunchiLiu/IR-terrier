	<brief_summary>A clinical study of the efficacy of oral alpha-difluoromethylornithine (eflornithine or DFMO) in male and female subjects ages 30-60 with gastric premalignant lesions in two high risk regions of Latin America.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemoprevention of Gastric Carcinogenesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary intervention is the randomized, double-blind assignment of patients to once daily eflornithine (500 mg) versus placebo for an 18 month treatment period. Gastric precancerous lesions are defined as chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) and intestinal metaplasia (IM). Patients will be clinically assessed with endoscopy and gastric biopsy at four time points: 0, 6, 18, and 24 months. The assessments at 0 and 24 months are considered part of usual clinical care in subjects with precancerous lesions in high risk regions. Overall, the efficacy of eflornithine is assessed by its effect on: 1) DNA damage, and 2) histology scoring.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have a history of a premalignant lesion of the stomach, atrophic gastritis or intestinal metaplasia Patients must have a pure tone audiometry evaluation to document air conduction within 60 days prior to registration. Patients must have adequate blood counts as evidenced by the following results (obtained within 60 days): Blood counts: WBC ≥4.0 /mcL, platelets ≥100,000 /mcL and hemoglobin ≥11.0 g/dL Kidney function: Creatinine &lt;1.6 x IULN (institutional upper limit of normal) Liver function tests: Bilirubin ≤2.0 mg/dL and AST (SGOT) or ALT (SGPT) ≤2 x IULN Subjects with dysplasia (indeterminate, low grade, high grade) are not eligible for participation Patients must not have a significant medical or psychiatric condition that would preclude study completion. Patients with hearing loss ≥30 dB in any of the tested frequencies (250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz, 2,000 Hz, 4,000 Hz, 8,000 Hz) are not eligible. Patients must not have known hypersensitivity to eflornithine or the excipients. Patients must not be receiving corticosteroids, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or anticoagulants on a regular or intermittent basis. Patients must not have a significant cardiovascular disease history, including uncontrolled blood pressure (sBP &gt; 150 mmHg), myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, or heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III, or IV). Patients must not have a history of gastric or esophageal cancer, gastric resection or surgery, peptic ulcer disease (within 6 months), H. pylori treatment (within 6 months), or inflammatory bowel disease. No prior malignancy is allowed except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer for which the patient has been diseasefree for &gt;5 years. Patients must not be receiving corticosteroids, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or anticoagulants on a regular or intermittent basis. Patients must not be pregnant or nursing (due to eflornithine pregnancy class C). Women and men of reproductive potential must have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method.</criteria>
