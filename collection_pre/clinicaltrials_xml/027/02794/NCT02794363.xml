	<detailed_description>15 patients with biopsy proven active vulvar lichen sclerosus will be recruited by a clinic specializing in vulvar disorders. This study consists of a 2 week screening period. A 4mm vulvar punch biopsy will be obtained at the initiation of the screening period to confirm that the participant have active lichen sclerosus. 12 weeks after the biopsy, the participants will receive an injection of 5cc of autologous platelet rich plasma into the affected vulvar skin. Six weeks later, participants will receive an additional injection of 5cc of autologous platelet rich plasma. A repeat biopsy will be performed 6 weeks after the second autologous platelet rich plasma injection. The inflammation on both biopsy specimens will be determined by a dermatopathologist.</detailed_description>
