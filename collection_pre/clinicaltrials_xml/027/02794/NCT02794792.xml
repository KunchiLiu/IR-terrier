	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Ipragliflozin in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Who Have Inadequate Glycemic Control on Metformin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 3, double-blind, randomized study to assess the efficacy and safety of ipragliflozin in combination with metformin compared to metformin plus placebo in subjects in Russia with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have inadequate glycemic control on metformin. Subjects will enter a 10-day (± 3 days) screening period, followed by a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period, followed by a 24-week randomized double-blind treatment period and a 4-week follow-up period</detailed_description>
