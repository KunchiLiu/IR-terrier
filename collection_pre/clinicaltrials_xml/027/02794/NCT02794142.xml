	<brief_summary>In hemodialysis patient (HD) a reduction of the skeletal muscle mass and strength has previously been reported. This muscle impairment constitutes an independent prognosis factor in HD patients. Oxidative stress and inflammation have been linked to the muscle impairment. The mitochondria is a classical producer and target of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and may thus constitute a central actor of the skeletal muscle impairment in HD patients. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate the role of the muscle mitochondrial density on the muscle impairment in HD patients, in comparing the muscle mitochondrial density and oxidative stress in HD patients vs. healthy matched controls. In order to assess the effect of the oxidative stress and inflammation on the muscle impairment in HD patients, muscle function assessements will be performed after renal transplantation (which lowers the oxidative stress and inflammation levels) in the HD patient group. No therapeutic intervention will be tested in the present study.</brief_summary>
