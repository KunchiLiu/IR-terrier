	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of this study are to identify what outcomes related to the management of neutropenia are most important to children with AML and their caregivers. Patients who have completed treatment for AML and their caregivers will be interviewed in order to better understand the impact of neutropenia management on children with AML and their families. The primary outcome of these interviews is to identify patient-centered outcomes related to neutropenia management to include in a subsequent comparative-effectiveness analysis. Investigators will use these data to develop a structured survey for administration to prospectively identified patients in subsequent studies.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment for pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) involves intensive chemotherapy regimens that result in periods of profound neutropenia leaving patients susceptible to severe infectious complications. There are little clinical data to inform whether management of neutropenia post AML chemotherapy should occur in an outpatient or inpatient setting. Further, no studies have been conducted that assess the impact of neutropenia management strategy on the quality of life of pediatric patients with AML. Given that infectious complications are the leading cause of treatment related mortality among AML patients, it is important to identify the neutropenia management strategy that will lead to the best clinician- and patient- identified outcomes in order to improve the care of these patients. This is a qualitative interview study where in person interviews of patients and/or caregivers will be performed. Participants will be patients 18 years of age or younger at diagnosis (and their caregivers) receiving or having received Induction II chemotherapy for AML from eight participating pediatric hospitals across the United States. Participants (children and caregivers) will be interviewed in an effort to develop a survey that captures patient- and caregiver- identified outcomes related to neutropenia management.</detailed_description>
