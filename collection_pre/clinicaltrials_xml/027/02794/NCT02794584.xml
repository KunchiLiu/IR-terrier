	<brief_summary>Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is one of the most common pediatric congenital malformations. In recent years, in view of the rapid rise of transthoracic minimally invasive hybrid closure for pediatric VSD in the clinical practice, precision assessment of perioperative its effectiveness and safety has already become an important issue that must be solved. On the basis of echocardiography, integrating with characteristics associated critical care, the investigators focus on precision assessment of perioperative effectiveness and safety of transthoracic hybrid closure for pediatric VSD, compared with conventional surgical sternotomy repair with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).</brief_summary>
