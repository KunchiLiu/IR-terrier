	<brief_title>Variations in Anesthesia Care for Hip Fracture Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate the sources of variance in utilization of neuraxial anesthesia the investigators will use multilevel multivariable modeling strategies. This will allow identification of sources of variation (hospital, vs physician, vs patient characteristics), as well as identification of independent predictors of neuraxial use at each of these three levels. The investigators will also evaluate the independent association of hospital level variation in neuraxial use on our outcomes of interest using multilevel multivariable regression.</detailed_description>
