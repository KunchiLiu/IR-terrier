	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to verify the safety and accuracy of an FDA-approved device called the NEMO™ Gauge to aide in the proper positioning of the endotracheal tube (ETT), inserted in the lungs of patients admitted to the intensive care unit. The hope is that the NEMO™ Gauge is able to properly determine the correct position of the endotracheal tube without the use of a chest radiograph (chest x-ray). The study investigators anticipate sixty-eight (68) subjects will participate in this study at three (3) study centers in the Inland Empire of Southern California, with subjects being enrolled at Loma Linda University Medical Center, Riverside University Medical Center and Loma Linda Veterans Affairs Hospital.</brief_summary>
