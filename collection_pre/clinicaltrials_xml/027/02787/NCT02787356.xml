	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to (1) collect trained observer scores and digital images of skin irritated by generic and RLD Lidocaine 5% delivered via TDS, and (2) assess performance of an automated system for predicting scores directly from the digital images</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Standard TDS Irritation Study: Trained Skin Grader vs. Digital Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be screened prior to dosing to ensure subjects meet all inclusion exclusion criteria. The test materials will be tested simultaneously. Skin sites on the paraspinal region will be utilized for application. The test sites will be randomized among the individual subjects according to their assigned identification number. All patches will be applied and removed by the laboratory staff. Due to safety concerns, it is not recommended to simultaneously apply two whole, active, Lidocaine Patch 5% patches on the same subject during the 21-day period. The optimum design of this study will depend on the design of the test product patch. Since the RLD has a matrix design that can be safely cut, one-fourth of the patch can be used for these studies. If the test product patch also has a design that can be cut to a smaller size, it should also be cut in one-fourth and one-fourth of the test product patch applied simultaneously with one-fourth of a RLD patch (to separate skin sites). Each test article will be applied to sites on the skin for a contact period of approximately 24 hours (+/-1 hr.), with the exception of the weekend (72 hours, +/- 1 hr.). There will be no visits during the weekend. Evaluations will be made after removal of every patch by a single trained grader along with a single digital imaging instrument. Re-applications will be made to the same test sites unless reactions become so strong (combination of a number and letter grade of 3) as to make this unadvisable, at which point patch application will be discontinued for that test article.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males and Females, age [1865 years old or 18 years or older] Signed informed consent Good general health Subject is pregnant or lactating. Medical history of condition that would significantly influence the immune response (e.g., primary or acquired immunodeficiencies, such as HIV positive or AIDS, allergic diseases, such as anaphylaxis, asthma or generalized drug reaction, neoplasms, such as lymphoma or leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, or systemic lupus erythematosus). Medical history of significant dermatologic diseases or conditions, such as atopy, psoriasis, vitiligo or conditions known to alter skin appearance or physiologic response (e.g. diabetes, porphyria). History of significant dermatologic cancers (e.g. melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma), except basal cell carcinomas that were superficial and did not involve the investigative site. Medical history of hepatic disease Within three weeks prior to dosing, use of medications or treatments that would significantly influence or exaggerate responses to the test product or that would alter inflammatory or immune response to the product (e.g. cyclosporine, tacrolimus, systemic or topical corticosteroids, cytotoxic drugs, immune globulin, Bacillus CalmetteGuerin, monoclonal antibodies, radiation therapy). Within 72 hours prior to dosing, use of antihistamines or use of topical drugs at patch site. Subject has an obvious difference in skin color between arms or the presence of a skin condition, excessive hair at the application sites, scar tissue, tattoo, or coloration that would interfere with placement of test articles, skin assessment, or reactions to drug. Presence of open sores at the application site.</criteria>
