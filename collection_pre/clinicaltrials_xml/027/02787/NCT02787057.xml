	<brief_summary>Intra-peritoneal administration of antibiotics covering both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was recommended as first-line regimen for the management of peritoneal dialysis related peritonitis. Oral administration of quinolones can also achieve effective serum concentrations, and is more convenient and economical. We conducted a pilot randomized controlled study to compare the effects on peritonitis cure and relapsing rates between oral moxifloxacin plus IP vancomycin and conventional IP vancomycin plus ceftazidime.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vancomycin Plus Moxifloxacin Versus Vancomycin Plus Ceftazidime for the Treatment of Peritoneal Dislysis (PD)-Related Peritonitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To compare the effects on peritonitis cure and relapsing rates between oral moxifloxacin plus IP vancomycin and conventional IP vancomycin plus ceftazidime, eligible PD patients were randomly assigned to study group (IP vancomycin 1g every 5 days combined with oral moxifloxacin 400mg QD) and control group (IP vancomycin 1g every 5 days combined with IP ceftazidime 1g QD). Patients were followed for 3 months after the completion of the treatment period. Primary endpoint is complete cure, secondary endpoint are primary response and primary or secondary treatment failure.</detailed_description>
