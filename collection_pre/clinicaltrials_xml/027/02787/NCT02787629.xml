	<brief_summary>Patients presenting for elective surgery requiring orotracheal intubation will be randomized to having the ETT inserted into the pharynx simultaneous to GlideScope insertion and then having the ETT advanced under GlideScope guidance into the trachea, or, being intubated in the more common fashion with the GlideScope being inserted first and having the ETT then advanced via the pharynx into the trachea.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Simultaneous Endotracheal Tube Insertion With GlideScope Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients presenting for elective surgery requiring orotracheal intubation will be randomized to having the ETT inserted into the pharynx simultaneous to GlideScope insertion and then having the ETT advanced under GlideScope guidance into the trachea, or, being intubated in the more common fashion with the GlideScope being inserted first and having the ETT then advanced via the pharynx into the trachea. The primary outcome is time to intubation. Secondary outcomes include: 1) Ease of intubation as noted by operator (measured on a 10-cm Visual Analogue Scale) 2) Number of intubation attempts 3) Number of failures to intubate 4) Use of external laryngeal pressure 5) Laryngoscopic grade distribution</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1) Adult patient booked for elective surgery requiring orotracheal intubation 1. Any patient in whom the use of the GlideScope is contraindicated in the opinion of the attending anesthesiologist. 2. Any patient with cervical spine abnormalities. 3. Any patients with known or probable difficult airways. 4. Any patient requiring rapid sequence induction.</criteria>
