	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To demonstrate the superiority of the insulin glargine/lixisenatide fixed ratio combination (FRC) versus GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) change. Secondary Objectives: To compare the overall efficacy and safety of the insulin glargine/lixisenatide fixed ratio combination (FRC) to GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) on top of metformin (with or without pioglitazone) in patients with type 2 diabetes. To evaluate safety, efficacy and other endpoints of FRC up to the end of the extension period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of the Insulin Glargine/Lixisenatide Fixed Ratio Combination (FRC) Versus GLP-1 Receptor Agonist in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes, With a FRC Extension Period</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The maximum duration for GLP1-RA patients will be approximately 29 weeks: an up to 2 week screening period, a 26 week treatment period (either randomized or uncontrolled), and a 3 or 9 day post-treatment safety followup period. Maximum duration for FRC patients will be approximately 55 weeks: an up to 2- week screening period, a 26-week randomized treatment period, a 26-week extension period and a 3-day post-treatment safety follow-up period. All primary and secondary efficacy, safety and other endpoints will be also assessed at the end of the extension period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed at least 1 year prior to screening visit. Patients who have been treated with one of the following glucagonlike peptide 1 (GLP1) receptor agonists for at least 4 months prior to screening visit (V1), and with stable dose for at least 3 months prior to screening visit (V1): Liraglutide (Victoza®) 1.8 mg QD or 1.2 mg QD, if the 1.8 mg QD dose is not well tolerated according to the Investigator's judgment or Exenatide (Byetta®) 10 µg BID or of 5 µg BID, if 10 µg BID dose is not well tolerated according to the Investigator's judgment in combination with metformin (daily dose ≥1500 mg/day or maximum tolerated dose [MTD]), with or without pioglitazone, both at stable dose for at least 3 months prior to screening. or Patients who have been treated with stable dose of one of the following GLP1 receptor agonists for at least 6 months prior to screening visit (V1): Exenatide extendedrelease (Bydureon®) 2 mg once weekly (QW), if well tolerated according to Investigator's judgment, Albiglutide (Tanzeum®) 50 mg QW or 30 mg QW, if 50 mg QW is not well tolerated according to Investigator's judgment, Dulaglutide (Trulicity®) 1.5 mg QW or 0.75 mg QW, if 1.5 mg QW is not well tolerated according to Investigator's judgment in combination with metformin (daily dose ≥1500 mg/day or MTD), with or without pioglitazone, both at stable dose for at least 3 months prior to screening; Signed written informed consent. Exclusion criteria: At screening visit, age &lt;18. Screening HbA1c &lt;7% and &gt;9%. Pregnancy or lactation, women of childbearing potential with no effective contraceptive method. Any use of antidiabetic drugs within 3 months prior to the screening visit other than those described in the inclusion criteria. Previous treatment with insulin in the year prior to screening visit (note: shortterm treatment with insulin [≤10 days] due to intercurrent illness including gestational diabetes is allowed at the discretion of the study physician). Laboratory findings at the time of screening, including: Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) &gt;250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L), Amylase and/or lipase &gt;3 times the upper limit of the normal laboratory range (ULN), Alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase &gt;3 ULN, Calcitonin ≥20 pg/mL (5.9 pmol/L), Positive pregnancy test. Patient who has renal function impairment with estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;30 mL/min (using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula) or endstage renal disease. Contraindication to use of insulin glargine, or lixisenatide or GLP1 receptor agonist (Victoza®, Byetta®, Bydureon®, Tanzeum® or Trulicity®) according to local labeling. Any contraindication to metformin or pioglitazone use, according to local labeling. History of hypersensitivity to insulin glargine, or to any of the excipients. History of allergic reaction to any GLP1 receptor agonist or to metacresol. Personal or immediate family history of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) or genetic condition that predisposes to MTC (eg, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 syndromes). History of pancreatitis (unless pancreatitis was related to gallstones and cholecystectomy was already performed), chronic pancreatitis, pancreatitis during a previous treatment with incretin therapies, pancreatectomy. Body mass index ≤20 or &gt;40 kg/m^2 Exclusion criteria for the extension period: Patients in the FRC arm with a rescue therapy and HbA1c &gt;8% at week 22. Patients in the FRC arm who discontinued prematurely from FRC treatment before week 26. Patients in the GLP1RA treatment arm after randomization.
