	<brief_summary>Anterior dislocation of the shoulder (glenohumeral joint) is one of the most prevalent dislocations. Following a first dislocation recurrence rates of up to 80% have been reported. Many patients will seek medical assistance for reduction of the shoulder after each of these recurrent dislocations. The investigators describe the results of reduction of anterior glenohumeral dislocation using a modified self manipulated Milch technique that can be performed by the patients themselves after simple guidance and demonstration. This method is directed to patients who are not willing or cannot have surgical stabilization and may be in a place where medical assistance is not available.</brief_summary>
