Under chronic bronchopulmonary pathology were understood to be two types of diseases: COPD and bronchial asthma. Under the exacerbation of chronic bronchopulmonary pathology refers to the increased symptoms of dyspnea, cough, sputum, emergence or strengthening of wheezing and whistling in the chest, feeling of compression in the chest, requiring treatment and modification of therapy, and are confirming information in the initial documentation of patients. Under the number of courses of antibacterial drugs refers to the number of courses of antibiotics during the year prior to vaccination and during the year after vaccination due to exacerbation of chronic bronchopulmonary diseases, and also for any other reasons not associated with chronic bronchopulmonary pathology. This information also was confirmed by the presence of primary records in documentation of patients. Under hospitalization refers to the admission of the subject for treatment in a hospital for chronic bronchopulmonary disease, both in routine and emergency indications. Confirmation of hospitalization served as the medical history of the disease, or the entry in the medical card of the examinee. In the course of the work gathered information about all the hospitalizations the year before and the year after vaccination. 10. Method of estimating quality of life associated with health For the measurement of indicators of quality of life associated with health in COPD patients prior to vaccination and during the year after vaccination was used a sociological research method with the use of the SAT test (COPD Assessment Test). The value of the test from 0 to 10 points indicates no significant influence of COPD on the patient's life, from 11 to 20 points - a moderate impact of COPD on the patient's life, from 21 to 30 points - the strong effect of COPD on the patient's life, with the result of 31 points and above COPD exerts an extremely strong influence on the life of the patient. Assessment of the quality of life of patients with bronchial asthma was carried out in dynamics with the use of the questionnaire ACQ-5 (Asthma Control Questionnaire). Total score ACQ-5 is calculated as the arithmetic mean of 5 responses: &lt;0,5-0,75 - good control of asthma, 0,75-1,5 - partial control of asthma, &gt;1.5 to uncontrolled asthma.

Germanov, M.D.; - Professor of the Department of General and Clinical Pathology, anatomical pathology and pathological physiology, Doctor of Medical Sciences, professor M.I. Panina, Reviewed the following dissertation materials: 1. Extracts from medical histories (outpatient cards) - 219. 2. Data of patient clinical examination (protocols of patient questioning and examination, clinical diagnoses, questionnaire results). 3. Data of patient laboratory investigations, spirometry results, sputum culture (copies). 4. Signed patient's informed consent forms authorizing health care intervention. 5. Copies of research papers - 37. 6. Materials of statistical analysis of study results in electronic form. The author has carried out a pilot, prospective, non-randomized, one-center, non-placebo-controlled study that enrolled a total of 219 patients with chronic bronchopulmonary pathology who have been followed up for 4 years. The study was conducted at a specialist consulting and diagnostic clinical center of the State-Funded Educational Institution of Higher Professional Education "Samara State Medical University" of the Ministry of Healthcare of Russia in collaboration with the Federal State-Funded Research Institute "Moscow Scientific Research Institute of Vaccines and Sera named after I.I. Mechnikov". The investigations were those commonly used in clinical trials and included physical examination, laboratory, immunological and microbiological investigations, assessment of functional tests and health-related quality of life parameters in dynamics including a short-term (one-year) and long-term (four-year) follow-up in adult patients with chronic bronchopulmonary pathology (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchial asthma) against the backdrop of using different pneumococcal vaccination regimens. Statistical analysis was carried out using the StatPlus 2009 Professional 5.8.4 applied software package and appropriate statistical methods. Study results presented in the dissertation fully match the data in primary medical records and comply with the international system of units (SI). The correctness of all parameters are confirmed by corresponding entries in the primary documents. The author was personally involved in all steps of this study and analysis of results. The statistical significance and authenticity of primary source materials raises no doubt. The results of statistical analysis fully agree with the data presented in tables illustrating the dissertation. All results presented in the dissertation and abstract have been published in scientific papers and meeting abstracts. The author was personally involved in studying clinical, microbiological and immunological effects of vaccination against pneumococcal infection in patients with chronic bronchopulmonary pathology and the effect of different vaccination regimens on the dynamics of functional test parameters and the short- and long-term quality of life outcomes. He also developed a scientifically sound regimen for using the pneumococcal vaccines in patients with chronic bronchopulmonary pathology. The presence of a complete set of primary documents and sufficient statistical analysis of study results allows us to conclude that the data obtained are correct and conclusions and recommendations justified. No violations of requirements of the Higher Attestation Commission (HAC) of the Ministry of Education and Science of Russia applicable to primary documents have been found. The thesis advisory panel came to the conclusion that the completeness and quality of submitted materials is in conformance with the topic and content of the dissertation by A.D. Protasov "Systemic approach to vaccine prophylaxis and vaccine therapy of pneumococcal infection in patients with chronic bronchopulmonary pathology" (14.03.09 - "clinical immunology and allergology"; 14.01.25 - "pulmonology").
