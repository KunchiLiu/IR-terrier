	<brief_title>Pegteograstim in Children With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children with solid tumor experience neutropenia after cytotoxic chemotherapy, and they usually receive granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to stimulate neutrophil recovery. However it needs daily injection of G-CSF. Pegteograstim is a new formulation of PEGylated recombinant human G-CSF analogue pegfilgrastim. In this study, investigators aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pegteograstim on chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in children with solid tumors.</detailed_description>
