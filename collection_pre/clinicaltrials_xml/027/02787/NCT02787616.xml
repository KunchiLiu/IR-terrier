	<brief_summary>Rosacea is a common disease characterized by inflammation and vascular abnormalities of the facial skin and ocular surface. The exact pathogenesis of papulopustular rosacea is not well understood and current methods to treat this disease are often unsatisfactory. The purpose of this study is to develop gene expression profiles of papulopustular rosacea compared to those of normal skin. The investigators hope to better understand the abnormal gene functions that might contribute to this condition. This understanding may lead to the development of additional and better treatments for rosacea.</brief_summary>
