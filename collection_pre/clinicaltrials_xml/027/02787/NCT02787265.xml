	<brief_title>High-density in Spinal Cord Stimulation: Virtual Expert Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DISCOVER will measure the effectiveness of high-density spinal cord stimulation for treatment of chronic back and leg pain. Identification of clinical effective parameters concerning location of active electrodes, frequency, pulse duration, amplitude and battery consumption are, besides safety, the major outcome parameters of this study.</detailed_description>
