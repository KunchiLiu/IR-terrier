	<detailed_description>HD-FIT is a randomized controlled clinical trial that will analyze the impact of high volume online HDF in comparison to high-flux HD on measured physical activity (number of steps measured in the dialysis day) as a primary endpoint. The analysis of additional accelerometer data, HRQOL and time to recover from a dialysis session will be used as exploratory outcomes. The study will also capture safety data, based on intradialytic events, hospitalization and mortality. Biochemical (according to the local requirements) and drug prescription data will be monitored for pharma-economic analysis. Serum samples will be collected for future analysis of additional biomarkers. In summary, patients will go through a 4 week run in period on high flux HD. After this, patients will be randomized to high volume online HDF or will continue on high flux HD. Both groups will be followed for 6 months. Patients will be evaluated for HRQOL and physical activity at the baseline. Evaluation will be repeated in 3 and 6-months. Data will be analyzed according to an intention-to-treat principle (i.e., according to assigned instead of received treatment). With an enrollment target of 110 participants in each arm (considering a drop out of 20%) we estimate the 86 patients will complete the follow up in each arm, what will provide the trial a 90% power to detect a 20% effect with respect to the primary outcome (predefined as a 20% increase in average total steps at the dialysis day in the HDF group compared to the HD group). Because of the nature of the intervention, it will not possible to blind the patients, the local study nurses, or the investigators for the treatment assignment. Twelve dialysis centers will be invited to participate. Each center will receive two 5008S machines and Cordiax dialyzers to be used in the study of 10 patients in each center. Centralized randomization will based on a 1:1 protocol, stratified by participating center.</detailed_description>
