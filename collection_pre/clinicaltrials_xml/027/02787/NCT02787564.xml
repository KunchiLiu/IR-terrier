	<detailed_description>A total of 100 men (&gt; 30 years, living alone) with a low SES will be randomly assigned to a control or intervention group while controlling for food bank use. The intervention group will receive free fresh fruits and vegetables consisting of 2 daily portions of their favorite variety over a period of 4 weeks which will be provided to them once per week. All participants will be asked to fill out a demographic questionnaire as well as a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), a questionnaire on amounts and variety of fruits and vegetables consumed and a 24-h-food-recall questionnaire. All questionnaires will be administered by trained interviewers. During the study period, the 24h-food recall questionnaire will be administered four more times; two times before the 4-week intervention period and two times during the last two weeks of the intervention period. After the 4-week intervention period, interviewers will administered the FFQ, the questionnaire on amounts and variety, and the FIES. Participants assigned to the control group will receive a fruit and vegetable basket after 4 weeks after baseline.
