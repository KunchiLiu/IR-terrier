	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if MRI imaging can detect genetic, proteomic, and metabolomic characteristics of liver tumors. The study also aims to determine if these imaging characteristics are correlated with clinical outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Tumor Response Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For each treatment arm, pre-procedural MRI and post procedural MRI will be obtained. Pre-procedural biopsies will be obtained, if possible. Pretreatment genetic expression, proteomic, or metabolomic patterns from the tumor samples will be assessed. Imaging characteristics from tumors will be extracted using automated softwareâ€”the study will apply a computational analysis system with the capability to extract and analyze imaging characteristics and correlate them to genetic expression, proteomic, and metabolomic tumor characteristics. Imaging findings will be correlated to clinical outcomes and genetic, proteomic, and metabolomic findings to determine association. Imaging findings and genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic tumor characteristics will be correlated to clinical outcomes (time to recurrence, overall survival, 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year survival).</detailed_description>
