	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to observe the efficacy of stimulation on over all pain relief as reported in an initial cohort of 6 patients treated with the Freedom High Frequency Spinal Cord Stimulator (SCS) System for low back and/or leg pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stimwave HF SCS Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a non-blinded, short-term study for a maximum duration of 12 weeks in which 6 patients will receive a Freedom SCS System. Subjects will have chronic, intractable pain of the trunk and/or lower limbs refractory to standard medical treatment; including unilateral or bilateral pain. Stimulators will be placed in the epidural space and over exiting nerve roots at vertebrae levels: A. Bilateral T9-T10 epidural; B. Bilateral L1-L4 epidural. All Patients will be treated below perception threshold with High Frequency settings (10.000 Hz, 30 μs).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. A. Subject is ≥ 18 years of age at time of informed consent; B. Subjects have been diagnosed with chronic, intractable pain of the trunk and/or lower limbs with a VAS &gt; 5cm (on a 10cm scale); C. Subject diagnosis with chronic pain refractory to conventional medical management for at least 6 months prior to enrollment; D. Based on the medical opinion of the Principal Investigator, there is no evidence of anatomic abnormalities that could jeopardize the placement of the device or pose a hazard to the subject; E. Subject is willing to undergo surgical implant procedure, attend visits as scheduled, and comply with the study requirements; F. Based on the opinion of the Principal Investigator, subject is willing and able to operate the patient programmer, recharging equipment, diary and has the ability to undergo study assessments and provide accurate responses; G. Based on the opinion of the implanter, subject is a good surgical candidate for the implant procedure; H. Subject is male or nonpregnant female; I. Subject is deemed to be neuropsychosocially appropriate for implantation therapies based of the assessment of the investigator, using facetoface encounters and the psychological testing described in the measures; J. Patient is capable of giving informed consent; K. Patient lives within reasonable distance from the study site (circumference of 75 km). 2. A. Obvious mechanical instability related to pain (diagnosed by imaging taken within the past 6 months); B. Malignancies; C. Subject has postherpetic neuralgia (shingles); D. Subject has an active systemic infection or is immunecompromised. E. Based on the medical opinion of the Principal Investigator the subject has other psychological conditions (e.g., psychosis, suicidal ideation, borderline personality disorder, somatization, narcissism), other health conditions (e.g., substance abuse, another chronic condition requiring the regular use of opioid medication), or other legal concerns that would preclude his/her enrollment in the study or potentially confound the results of the study; F. Subject is currently enrolled in or plans to enroll in any concurrent drug and/or device study while participating in this study; G. Insulindependent diabetic who is not controlled through diet and/or medication; H. Bleeding complications or coagulopathy issues; I. Pregnant/lactating or not using adequate birth control; J. A life expectancy of less than one year; K. Any active implanted device whether turned off or on;</criteria>
