	<brief_summary>The current study aims to evaluate the safety of SP-8203, designing in two stages (stage-1, stage-2) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination therapy of SP-8203 and rtPA for the occurrence of cerebral hemorrhage in patients with acute ischemic stroke receiving rtPA standard of care.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Two Doses of SP-8203 in Patients With Ischemic Stroke Requiring rtPA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As the standard procedure of rtPA therapy, rtPA will be injected intravenously using a device like infusion pump. When reperfusion is not achieved in spite of rtPA therapy, endovascular therapy can be performed according to the judgment of a site investigator. Stage 1-The trial will be conducted with 11 subjects participating in an open label design manner. Subjects with neurologic deficit of ≥4 point and ≤10 points on NIHSS score will be given SP-8203, 80mg/dose, a total of 6 times at intervals of 12 hours. For the first administration of SP-8203, it should be administered within 30 minutes from the initiation of rtPA administration via a vein route different from one via which rtPA is injected. Thereafter, the subject will be transferred to MRI scanning room to have brain MRI and MRA performed, and brain CT will be performed to check the occurrence of intracranial hemorrhage at 24 hours after complete administration of the first dose of SP-8203. The subject will be closely monitored by research staff daily from the day of first administration of SP-8203 (Day 0) to Day 5. Brain MRI and MRA will be followed up after the last administration of SP-8203 on Day 5. The subject will make a visit on Day 14 to have his/her neurologic symptoms checked, after which subject's participation in the trial will be completed. *The DSMB (Date Safety Monitoring Board) meeting will be held, to decide whether to proceed with Stage 2 or not, based on the results of Stage 1. Stage 2- A total of 69 subjects will be enrolled in double-blind, randomized and parallel design with 23 subjects assigned to low-dose (40mg/dose, 80mg/ day) SP-8203 group, high-dose (80mg/dose, 160mg/day) SP-8203 group or placebo group, respectively. If a subject, who is able to be enrolled in Stage 2, has neurological deficit of ≥4 point on NIHSS score and give patient's consent to participate in the trial, randomization will be performed and each treatment arm (one of three) will be assigned. The subject will receive the Investigational products a total of 6 times, with 12 hours intervals. Blood sample will be taken after the sixth administration of the Investigational product for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics analysis. For pharmacokinetic analysis , blood sample will be taken at 0, 30, and 120 minutes after the complete sixth administration of the investigational products. For pharmacodynamics analysis, blood sample will be taken at between 24 to 48 hours after the first administration, at 0 minute after the sixth administration and at 4th week visit. As with Stage 1, the subject will have brain MRI and MRA performed after the administration of investigational product, and brain CT will be performed at 24 hours after completion of the first administration of investigational products. Brain MRI and MRA will be followed-up on Day 5, similarly to Stage 1. However, in Stage 2, the subject will make a visit for close monitoring for patient's neurological condition at 4th week and 12th week. Thereafter, all the procedures of the clinical trial will be completed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Stage 1specific Criteria Patients with neurologic deficit of ≥4 points and ≤10 points by NIHSS score. Stage 2specific Criteria Patients with neurologic deficit of ≥4 points by NIHSS score. Common Criteria for Stage 1 and Stage 2 1. Adults aged ≥19 years and ≤80 years. 2. Subjects fulfilling the criteria for rtPA therapy. ① Subjects who can receive rtPA therapy within 4.5 hours after the onset of early symptoms of acute ischemic stroke. ② Subjects requiring rtPA therapy according to the judgment of a neurologist. 3. Subjects available for brain MRI (DWI, GRE/SWI [Susceptibility Weighted Imaging], FLAIR, MRA) scanning 4. Subjects who consent to participate in this trial. 1. Patients with systemic allergic diseases or hypersensitivity to specific drugs. 2. Patients have condition as follows: 1. Patients who were diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) within the last 6 months. 2. Patients who had arrhythmia causing symptoms such as dyspnea or palpitation within the last 6 months. 3. Patients showing the following abnormal ECG findings in stable condition at screening: The range of pulse rate below 60/min or above 120/min 2nd or 3rd degree AV(Atrioventricular) block indicated in ECG Congenital or acquired QT syndrome indicated in ECG ④ Preexcitation syndrome indicated in ECG 3) Patients with severe heart failure of NYHA(New York Heart Association) Class III or Class IV. NYHA classification of heart failure defined as: Class I: patients with no limitation of activities; they suffer no symptoms from ordinary activities. Class II: patients with slight, mild limitation of activity; they are comfortable with rest or with mild exertion. Class III: patients with marked limitation of activity; they are comfortable only at rest. Class IV: patients who should be at complete rest, confined to bed or chair; any physical activity brings on. 4) Patients with fever (≥ 38℃) or infection signs which require antibiotics at screening 5) Patients with pulmonary diseases (asthma, COPD[Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ], and active tuberculosis etc.) who have being recently been treated more than 1 month at screening, 6) Patients showing the following hematological findings: Patients with decreased hemoglobin (Hb&lt; 10g/dL), decreased platelet count (PLT&lt; 100,000/mm3) or hematocrit of &lt;25% in complete blood count . 7) Patients who have undergone hemodialysis and/or treatments due to nephropathies, acute or chronic renal failure at screening. 8) Patients with a cancer in following conditions: diagnosed within 6 months before the screening time, or any treatment for cancer within the previous 6 months, or with recurrent/ metastatic cancer 9) Pregnant and breastfeeding women.
