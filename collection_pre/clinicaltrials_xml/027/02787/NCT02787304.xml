	<criteria>1. Male, or nonpregnant, nonlactating female who is sexually active and who agrees to comply with the contraceptive requirements of the protocol or females of nonchildbearing potential. 2. Presence of ≥ 5% steatosis on screening MRI from a centrally read radiologist performed either during the screening period or within 6 months prior to the first visit. 3. Histologic confirmation of NASH without cirrhosis (fibrosis stage 1, 2, or 3) from a centrally read liver biopsy performed either during the screening period or within 6 months prior to the first visit with a NAS of ≥ 4 with a score of at least 1 in each component (steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning). 1. Presence of or history of cirrhosis or evidence of decompensated liver disease or hepatocellular carcinoma 2. History or presence of other concomitant liver disease as assessed by the investigator or determined by laboratory findings 3. Current or recurrent disease that could affect the action, absorption, disposition, or laboratory assessment of the IP (including bile salt metabolism in the intestine) 4. Weight change ≥5% after qualifying liver biopsy and/or MRI performed. If the subject had a liver biopsy and/or MRI within 6 months of screening, but experienced a weight change ≥5% since the date of liver biopsy and/or MRI, the liver biopsy and/or MRI must be repeated at screening. 5. Inability to do an MRI (ie, claustrophobia, coronary stents, coronary implantable devices, girth, etc.). 6. Current or relevant history of physical or psychiatric illness, any medical disorder that may require treatment or make the subject unlikely to complete the study. 7. Uncontrolled diabetes defined as HbA1c of ≥ 9.0% within 60 days prior to enrollment. 8. Current use of any medication (including overthecounter, herbal, or homeopathic preparations) that could affect the action, absorption, or disposition of the IP, or clinical or laboratory assessment. 9. Use of drugs, herbs or supplements historically associated with causing or worsening NAFLD/NASH for less than 6 months prior to qualifying liver biopsy, or initiated any time after qualifying liver biopsy performed, including the use of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). 10. Serum AST &gt; 5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) at screening. 11. Serum ALT &gt; 5 times ULN at screening. 12. Elevated serum creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dL. 13. International normalized ratio (INR) &gt;1.3. 14. Total bilirubin (TB) ≥ 2.0 x ULN at screening (Except for documented Gilbert's syndrome with bilirubin levels 20 µmol/L to 90 µmol/L (1.2 to 5.3 mg/dL) and with a ratio of unconjugated/conjugated bilirubin that is commensurately higher). 15. Platelet count &lt; 130 × 109L 16. Medical history of impaired hemostasis or use of anticoagulant medication (use of antiplatelet medications, such as lowdose, ie 81mg aspirin (ASA) or clopidogrel (Plavix) will be allowed). 17. Uncontrolled thyroid disease. 18. Type 1 diabetes mellitus. 19. Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the IP, closelyrelated compounds, or any of the stated ingredients. 20. Known history of alcohol or other substance abuse within the last year. Weekly alcohol intake greater than 21 grams/day for males and 14 grams/day for females on average or inability to reliably quantify alcohol consumption based on investigator's judgment. 21. Inability to safely obtain a liver biopsy. 22. The anticipated need for a surgical procedure during the study that could interfere with the treatment. 23. Known positivity for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. 24. Cancer within 5 years of screening, except for basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ cervical carcinoma that has been treated with no evidence of recurrence. 25. History of noncompliance with medical regimens, unreliability, mental instability or incompetence that could compromise the validity of informed consent or lead to noncompliance with the study protocol. 26. Any other conditions or abnormalities which, in the opinion of the investigator, may compromise the safety of the subject, or interfere with the subject participating. 27. Subject has failed screening or was previously enrolled in this study or is currently enrolled in this study at any study site (unless the subject is transferring to another qualified study site with prior Sponsor approval). 28. Females who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding, or males who are planning to father a child during study participation.</criteria>
