	<brief_summary>The investigators postulated that the exploitation of the pro-immunogenic effects of radiotherapy with thymosin might result in abscopal responses among patients with metastatic cancer. The research is designed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of patients treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy combined with thymosin alpha 1. An exploratory biomarker analysis in blood and tumor samples is also planned.</brief_summary>
