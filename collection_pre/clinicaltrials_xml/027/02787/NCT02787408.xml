	<brief_title>The SPACER Trial - Repair of Tricuspid Valve Regurgitation Using the Edwards TricuSPid TrAnsCatheter REpaiR System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and device performance of the Edwards Tricuspid Transcatheter Repair System in patients with clinically significant, symptomatic, tricuspid regurgitation who are at high surgical risk for standard tricuspid repair/replacement. The study is a multi-center, international, prospective, single arm, safety study. Enrolled subjects will be assessed for clinical follow-up at 1 month, 6 months, 1 year and annually for 3 years post implant procedure.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Signed and dated Ethics Committee (EC) approved study consent form prior to study related procedures 2. Eighteen years of age or older 3. Clinically significant, symptomatic (New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II or greater), tricuspid regurgitation (per applicable guidelines) requiring tricuspid valve repair or replacement as assessed by the Heart Team 4. Functional tricuspid regurgitation as the primary etiology 5. New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II or greater or signs of persistent right heart failure despite optimal medical therapy 6. Determined by the 'HEART Team' (a minimum of one Cardiologist, and one Cardiac Surgeon) to be at high surgical risk for tricuspid valve repair or replacement and the benefitrisk analysis supports utilization of the investigational device 7. Willing to attend study followup assessments for up to 3 years Exclusion Criteria 1. Tricuspid valve/right heart anatomy not suitable for the study device: 1. Native tricuspid annulus area &lt; 2.63 cm2 (12 mm device) or &lt; 3.27cm2 (15 mm device) as measured by transthoracic echocardiography 2. Subvalvular structures/anatomy that would preclude from proper anchor or coaptation device placement, positioning and retrieval 3. Access pathway vessel diameter less than 7.1 mm (12 mm device) or 8.3 mm (15 mm device) 2. Moderate or greater tricuspid valve stenosis 3. Untreated clinically significant coronary artery disease requiring immediate revascularization 4. Any therapeutic invasive cardiac procedure performed within 30 days of the scheduled implant procedure 5. Patients not already receiving dialysis with renal insufficiency (eGFR &lt; 25) per lab test ≤ 48 hours prior to scheduled implant procedure 6. Myocardial infarction within 30 days of scheduled implant procedure 7. Hemodynamic instability within 30 days of scheduled implant procedure 8. Patient requiring surgery under general anesthesia for any reason within 30 days of scheduled implant procedure 9. Severe left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction &lt; 25% within 45 days of scheduled implant procedure 10. Patients with pulmonary artery systolic pressure 2/3 of systemic pressure via transthoracic echocardiography or alternative standard modality (e.g., direct pressure measurement) within 45 days 11. Concomitant clinically significant valve (aortic, mitral, or pulmonic) disease requiring immediate (± 30 days of study procedure) repair or replacement 12. Active endocarditis or infection within 3 months of scheduled implant procedure 13. Cerebrovascular accident within 3 months of scheduled implant procedure 14. Noncardiac disease limiting life expectancy to be less than 12 months at baseline evaluation 15. Documented history of bleeding diathesis, coagulopathy or gastrointestinal bleeding within 3 months of scheduled implant procedure 16. Evidence of right sided intracardiac mass, thrombus, or vegetation 17. Prior venous stent placed within the access route (e.g., subclavian vein) that could negatively react with device 18. Previously treated tricuspid valve which included implantation of a bioprosthetic valve or mechanical valve 19. Known hypersensitivity to cobalt chromium, nitinol or titanium 20. Known hypersensitivity to anticoagulation therapy or contrast agent, which cannot be adequately medicated 21. Patient is a current intravenous drug user 22. Female of childbearing potential is pregnant or lactating 23. Patient is currently participating or has participated in another investigational drug or device clinical study within 30 days of study screening activity</criteria>
