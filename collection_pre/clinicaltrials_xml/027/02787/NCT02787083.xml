	<brief_summary>Bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis (BPS/IC) is a difficult disease to both diagnose and treat. It is defined as an unpleasant sensation (pain, pressure, or discomfort) perceived to be related to the urinary bladder and associated with lower urinary tract symptoms for at least 6 weeks duration, in the absence of infection or other identifiable causes. Pain is the universal symptom, but many also experience symptoms of overactive bladder, possibly directly related to the mechanism of pain. Treating pain may influence the symptom of urgency, if the urge arises from a need to alleviate pain. In some patients whose pain improves with treatment, troubling overactive bladder symptoms still remain. Beta-3 adrenergic agonists have been found to decrease signaling of C-fibers in animal models. So, the investigators hypothesize that mirabegron, which is FDA-approved for treatment of overactive bladder, would also improve symptoms in patients with BPS/IC. As a selective beta-3 agonist, mirabegron acts on the beta-3 receptors found in the bladder which mediate relaxation of the detrusor muscle. It has been shown to significantly decrease the number or micturition episodes, urgency episodes, and increased mean volume of urine voided per micturition. It also has a favorable tolerability profile.</brief_summary>

Participant must be stable on current IC/BPS regimen. 2. Participant must have subjective complaints of i. urinary urgency, relieved with voiding or ii. urinary frequency; â‰¥ 8 voids per day iii. pelvic pain, pressure, hypersensitivity or discomfort 2. Gender of subjects: Participants in this study will be female. Pregnant women and breastfeeding women will be excluded due to unknown risk of study medication on pregnancy and fetus or nursing infants. 3. Age of subjects: Age of participants will range from 18 to 95 years. 4. Racial and ethnic origin: There are no enrollment restrictions based upon race or ethnic origin.

Participant has had bladder hydrodistention or bladder instillations within the last 4 weeks. Participants may have bladder instillations during the study period if necessary for rescue from symptom flares. 8. Participant has used or currently using CYP2D6 substrates, such as thioridazine, flecainide, propafenone, within the last 7 days prior to the study or during study period 9. Participant has used warfarin or digoxin within the last 7 days prior to the study or during the study period 10.
