	<brief_title>A Study To Confirm Efficacy and Safety of Terlipressin in HRS Type 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter pivotal trial of terlipressin in subjects with HRS type 1. HRS is a rare syndrome of marked renal dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, and portal hypertension. HRS type 1 is characterized by a rapid progressive renal impairment and has a very poor prognosis with &gt;80% mortality within 3 months. At present, there are no approved drug therapies for HRS type 1 in the US or Canada. The only curative treatment for HRS type 1 and the underlying end-stage cirrhosis is liver transplantation. However, many patients will not survive long enough to receive a liver transplant. Increased understanding of the pathophysiology of HRS type 1 has demonstrated that vasoconstrictive drug therapy may reverse HRS type 1. Substantial data available from many published clinical investigations in the literature provide compelling evidence suggesting that administration of terlipressin improves renal function in patients with HRS. A total of 300 subjects are planned to be enrolled at approximately 70 sites in the US and Canada. An interim analysis is scheduled after 150 subjects are enrolled. The study will be stopped if the pre-specified threshold for efficacy criteria is met at interim analysis.</detailed_description>
