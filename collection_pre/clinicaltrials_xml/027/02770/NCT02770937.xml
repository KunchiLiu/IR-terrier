	<brief_title>Simulator Versus Box Trainer on Laparoscopic Suturing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants will be randomized into three groups by computer-generated sequence to the virtual reality simulator, box trainer and control groups. They will be shown a video demonstration and given simple instructions on laparoscopic suturing and intracorporeal knot tying at the beginning of the training. Both the virtual reality simulator and box trainer groups will be allowed a maximum of 4 hours of training (2 sessions of 2 hours each). The participants could terminate training at any time point during the 4-hour if they felt competent to perform the task.The control group will not receive any further training. They will then be asked to perform laparoscopic suturing (which would involve needle loading and insertion via 2 pre-marked circles, and knot tying which includes at least 2 single throws) on a box trainer. Participants will be asked to complete a modified GOALS questionnaire at the end (which will take around 5 minutes) to evaluate their experiences and assess their own proficiency. The procedure will also be recorded (with a number identifying the participant only) and assessment will be performed when the study is completed by 2 experienced laparoscopic gynecologists blinded to the participants who will review the recorded procedure. The time to complete each task, total procedural time and proficiency will be assessed, which will be compared against the participants' own evaluation.</detailed_description>
