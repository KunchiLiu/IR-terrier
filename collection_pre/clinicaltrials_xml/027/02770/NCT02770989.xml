	<brief_summary>This study is a prospective, non-randomized, single arm, multicenter, CE marking trial for patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to undergo an ablation of the cardiac tissue near the PV.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vimecon CAI Trial for the Interventional Treatment of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (AF)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this clinical investigation is to confirm the safety and performance of the Vimecon® Laser Cardiac Ablation Instrument when creating scar tissue within the cardiac wall for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Up to 66 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation refractory to at least one antiarrhythmic medications (Class I or III) are enrolled. with an expected 10% dropout; 59 per protocol patients are required. The study duration will be 18 month with a 6 month enrollment period and 12 month follow-up. Interim follow-up visits are at post procedure, 1 Month, 3 Months, 6 Months and 12 Months. The baseline and follow up tests are standard of care. Additional optional tests are an esophageal endoscopy for determination of potential fistula formation and a cerebral MRI for micro embolism post treatment.</detailed_description>
