	<brief_summary>The hypothesis is that seafood proteins given in combination with carbohydrates with low GI are superior to seafood proteins in combination with carbohydrates with high GI and meat in combination with both carbohydrates with low and high GI in promoting energy expenditure and satiety. The overall objective of this study is to investigate the acute effects of meals containing fish versus meat proteins on energy balance (thermogenesis, appetite regulating hormones and appetite sensations), markers of glucose allostatis and amino acid metabolism.</brief_summary>
