	<brief_summary>In diabetics there is an abnormally increased production of AGEs due to hyperglycemia. An association was shown between AGE measured by biopsy (invasive) and DE patients with diabetes (increase of AGE level in the corpora cavernosa). To date no studies have explored the link between DE and the measure of AGE by a non-invasive method of Auto-fluorescence (AF) Skin (AGEReaderTM). If the hypothesis of an association between DE and AGE measured by AF was checked, screening for erectile dysfunction and measurement of AGEs could help to improve the overall management of diabetic patient (including cardiovascular) and their quality of life.</brief_summary>
