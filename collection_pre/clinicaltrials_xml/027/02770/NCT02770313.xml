	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to determine how effective repeated fasting over 26 weeks (6 months) is at improving risk parameters that are surrogate endpoints for cardiovascular diseases, metabolic dysregulation and cognitive impairments. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to water-only fasting or to their ad libitum usual diet, with randomization performed within strata based on fasting history (≤180 hours or 181-720 hours of total fasting for &gt;12 consecutive hours per episode in the previous two years). Subjects will be assessed at 4, 13 and 26 weeks following randomization.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. Male or nonpregnant female, 2160 years of age, who are not currently taking a statin medication, who have either prediabetes (clinical diagnosis, hemoglobin A1c ≥6.0%, or untreated fasting glucose &gt; 100 mg/dL within 6 months of screening) and are not taking medications to control diabetes OR three or more of the components of the metabolic syndrome (1. fasting glucose level &gt;100 mg/dL, 2. systolic blood pressure ≥130 mmHg, diastolic ≥85 mmHg, or use of an antihypertensive medication, 3. highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol &lt;40 mg/dL for males or &lt;50 mg/dL for females, 4. triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL or use of a nonstatin triglyceridelowering medication (e.g., fibrate, niacin), 5. waist circumference ≥40 inches (102 cm) for males or ≥35 inches (88 cm) for females, or body mass index &gt;25 kg/m2), are 2139 years of age with LDLC of 100189 mg/dL OR are 4060 years of age with either LDLC of 100129 mg/dL OR LDLC of 130159 mg/dL and &lt;7.5% tenyear risk for heart attack or stroke based on the Pooled Cohort Risk Equations (http://my.americanheart.org/professional/StatementsGuidelines/PreventionGuidelines/PreventionGuidelines_UCM_457698_SubHomePage.jsp). 2. Ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, which must be obtained prior to initiation of any study procedures. 1. Pregnant and/or lactating women and women of child bearing potential who are not using acceptable means of contraception. Women who become pregnant after enrollment in the study will be withdrawn for the health of the mother and baby. 2. Individuals who have purposefully fasted more than 15 hours per day more than one day per month during the past two years (i.e., &gt;720 hours over two years), except for those who fast during multiple weeks once per year (e.g., Muslim, Baha'i) who will be allowed to begin participation starting at two weeks after their preferred annual period of fasting ends (e.g., Ramadan or the Baha'i fast) and ending at six months prior to the beginning of the next annual observance, as long as they do not fast routinely outside of the one annual period of fasting. 3. Refusal to drink water while fasting. 4. Prior diagnosis of a chronic disease (i.e., defined as symptomatic coronary artery disease, coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack, pulmonary embolism, peripheral vascular disease, renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, other chronic lung disease, immunodeficiency, solid organ transplant, clinical depression, eating disorder, type I diabetes, dementia, traumatic brain injury including postconcussive syndrome, neurologic disorders, and cancer of any type other than of the skin excluding melanoma). 5. Patients with prediabetes who are on a diabetes medication. 6. Participation in any other clinical trials involving investigational or marketed products within 30 days prior to entry in the study. 7. Other conditions that in the opinion of the Principal Investigator may increase risk to the subject and/or compromise the quality of the clinical trial.</criteria>
