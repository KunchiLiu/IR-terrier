	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of laboratory-treated (central memory/naive) cluster of differentiation 8+ T cells (autologous Wilms tumor [WT]1-T cell receptor [TCRc]4 gene-transduced CD8-positive central memory T-cells [TCM]/naïve T cells [TN] lymphocytes) and how well it works in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia that is newly diagnosed or has come back. Genetically modified therapies, such as autologous WT1-TCRc4 gene-transduced CD8-positive TCM/TN lymphocytes, are taken from a patient's blood, modified in the laboratory so they specifically may kill cancer cells with a protein called WT1, and safely given back to the patient. The "genetically modified" T-cells have genes added in the laboratory to allow them to recognize leukemia cells that express WT1 and kill them.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety/potential toxicities associated with treating high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with polyclonal autologous CD8+ Tn and Tcm cells genetically-modified to express a high affinity WT1-specific TCR (TCRC4). II. Determine the feasibility of treating high-risk AML patients with polyclonal autologous CD8+ TN and TCM cells genetically-modified to express a high affinity WT1-specific TCR. III. Determine and compare the in vivo persistence in blood and at the primary tumor site (e.g. bone marrow, chloroma) of transferred polyclonal autologous CD8+ TN and TCM cells transduced to express TCRC4. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether adoptive transferred autologous TCRC4-transduced CD8+ cells have antitumor activity in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. II. In patients with measurable tumor burden prior to infusion of TCRC4-transduced CD8+ cells: measure the change in tumor burden by assessment of morphology, flow cytometry, cytogenetics and/or molecular testing at baseline and after infusion of T cells. III. In all patients (those with or without measurable tumor burden prior to T cell transfer): compare the probability of relapse, disease-free survival and overall survival of patients receiving TCRC4-transduced CD8+ cells with patients in the observation arm. IV. Determine and compare the migration to the primary tumor site of adoptively transferred polyclonal autologous TCRC4-transduced CD8+ TCM and TN cells. V. Determine and compare the in vivo functional capacity of transferred polyclonal autologous TCRC4-transduced CD8+ TCM to CD8+ TN cells. OUTLINE: Beginning 4 weeks after completion of last course of chemotherapy, patients receive autologous WT1-TCRc4 gene-transduced CD8+ TCM/TN lymphocytes intravenously (IV) over 1-4 hours on days 0 and 14. Beginning 6 hours after the second infusion of T cells, patients also receive aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) for 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who have clinically benefitted from T cell therapy may receive additional infusions of T cells and aldesleukin at the discretion of the principal investigator (PI) and the attending physician. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for 4 weeks, monthly for 2 months, at 6 and 12 months for the first year, and then annually for 14 years thereafter.</detailed_description>
