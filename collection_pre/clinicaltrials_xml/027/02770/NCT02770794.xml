	<detailed_description>The objective of this multicenter prospective clinical trial is to determine whether ultrasound predicts relapse after discontinuation of infliximab more accurately than does clinical index and to investigate the efficacy and safety of restarting infliximab after relapse in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in remission or low disease activity on infliximab treatment. Infliximab is discontinued in all enrolled patients. Patients are followed up for 48 weeks for monitoring relapse. If relapse occurs, patients receive readministration of infliximab and are further followed up for 24 weeks to determine the efficacy and safety of infliximab readministration. Primary endpoint is the difference in area under curve (AUC) of receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis between total power Doppler score and Disease Activity Score (DAS) 28 at baseline to predict relapse within 48 weeks after discontinuation of infliximab.</detailed_description>
