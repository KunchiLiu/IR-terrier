	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of this 2-part drug interaction study are as follows: - To evaluate the effect of gemfibrozil on the pharmacokinetics (i.e., amount in the blood) of selexipag and its metabolite ACT-333679 (Part I). - To evaluate the effect of rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics of selexipag and its metabolite ACT-333679 (Part II).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Study to Investigate the Effect of Gemfibrozil or Rifampicin on Blood Concentrations of Selexipag in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because non-clinical studies have shown that selexipag and its active metabolite, ACT-333679, are substrates for cytochrome P450 2C8 (CYP2C8), the present clinical study aims at investigating the effect of a strong inhibitor (gemfibrozil) and a moderate inducer (rifampicin) of CYP2C8 on the pharmacokinetic of selexipag and ACT-333679 as recommended by the FDA's Guidance for Industry Drug Interaction Studies (FDA, 2012).</detailed_description>
