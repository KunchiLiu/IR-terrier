	<brief_summary>To compare the safety and effectiveness of dual anti-platelet therapy with cilostazol 100 mg twice daily and aspirin 100 mg daily versus monotherapy with aspirin 100 mg daily in patients undergoing peripheral angioplasty or stenting or both for the management of peripheral arterial disease.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, randomized, single-blinded, phase III, controlled trial investigating the safety and effectiveness of dual antiplatelet therapy with cilostazol 100 mg twice daily and aspirin 100 mg daily versus monotherapy with aspirin 100 mg daily in patients undergoing peripheral, infrainguinal angioplasty or stenting or both for the management of peripheral arterial disease (intermittent claudication or critical limb ischemia). The study will include in total 200 patients randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either dual antiplatelet therapy for 6 months cilostazol 100 mg once daily and aspirin 100 mg daily versus monotherapy with aspirin 100 mg daily for 12 months. The study's primary endpoint will be the composite of major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, major amputation, target limb open surgical or endovascular revascularization). Additional therapy with clopidogrel 75mg daily will be added in either group for one month in case of stent placement. Secondary endpoints will include quality of life assessment using dedicated questionnaires, drug- and procedure-related complication rates, target-limb revascularization rates, clinical improvement (ABI and Rutherford-Becker classification changes). Clinical follow up will be performed at 1, 6 and 12 months and will include physical examination, ABI measurements, Rutherford-Becker classification. Maximum follow up period will be 2 years after the index procedure.</detailed_description>
