	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety of FMT in patients with C. difficile and cancer. In previous other studies, FMT has been shown to cure C. difficile when antibiotics have failed, but most of these studies have not included patients with cancer. The investigators want to prove that FMT is safe in this group of people so that doctors will feel more comfortable prescribing it for their patients with cancer.</brief_summary>
