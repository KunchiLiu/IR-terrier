	<brief_summary>Glucagon like Peptide -1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are well known to stimulate glucose-induced insulin secretion and to reduce energy intake. Recent findings from animal and human studies suggest a role of GLP-1 in regulating water and salt homeostasis. GLP-1 has been shown to reduce fluid intake after an oral salt load or during a meal - pointing to a hypodipsic effect. The aim of this study is to elucidate whether these putative hypodipsic properties of GLP-1 might be of advantage in persons with an exaggerated thirst perception as is the case in patients with primary polydipsia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of GLP-1 Analogues on Fluid Intake in Patients With Primary Polydipsia (The GOLD-Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GLP-1 analogues are currently used for the treatment of hyperglycaemia associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and given his properties as a natural satiety hormone, the GLP-1 analogue liraglutide was recently approved by the FDA for weight management. In studies related to the influence of GLP-1 and -analogues in controlling food intake a concomitant reduction of fluid consumption has been observed. The investigators hypothesize that GLP-1 analogues not only modulate appetite and provide satiety but also reduce fluid intake and thirst sensation in humans - especially in those with excessive thirst perception (patients with primary polydipsia). In view of future therapeutic options for these patients we aim to investigate the influence of the long-acting GLP-1 analogue dulaglutide on fluid intake, thirst perception and quality of life in patients with primary polydipsia compared to placebo.</detailed_description>
