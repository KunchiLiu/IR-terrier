	<brief_summary>The specific aim of this study is to use a shared decision making tool to allow women who have undergone cesarean delivery (CD) to choose the amount of oxycodone the participants will be prescribed at discharge, within a range from 0-40 tablets. The study investigators will document additional information from medical record abstraction (age, race/ethnicity, medical and obstetrical conditions, previous opioid use, date of CD, indication for CD, anesthetic management during CD, duration and complications of CD, length of stay, pain medication use and pain scores on each postoperative day between CD and discharge). The investigators will then follow up with the participants by telephone at two weeks after discharge to assess the amount of opioid used, frequency of prescription refill, disposition of unused medication, and participant satisfaction with their post-cesarean pain control. The investigators hypothesize that the use of a shared decision making tool will decrease the amount of opioid prescribed while still providing participants with satisfactory pain control.</brief_summary>
