	<brief_summary>This study is to investigate the effect of a wide range of assistance levels on respiratory pattern, breathing variability including tidal volume and peak inspiratory pressure during neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) in preterm infants. The investigators also aim to explore whether the effects of NAVA on the electrical activity of diaphragm (Edi) signal amplitude, work of breathing and comfort of preterm infants.</brief_summary>
