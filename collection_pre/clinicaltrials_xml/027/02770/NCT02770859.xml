	<detailed_description>Achalasia is a disease of the muscle of the esophagus (food tube) &amp; means "a failure to relax." The esophagus consists of 3 parts: the first part (uppermost part) is the upper esophageal sphincter (UES). The UES is a specialized ring of muscle which separates the esophagus from the throat, &amp; prevents food in the second part (body) of the esophagus from regurgitating into the throat. The third part of the esophagus (lower esophageal sphincter [LES]) also consists of a specialized ring of muscle which separates the body of the esophagus from the stomach, &amp; prevents food &amp; acid from regurgitating into the body of the esophagus. When achalasia is present, patients experience dysphasia (difficulty swallowing food, &amp; [sometimes] liquids), chest pain &amp; can experience recurrent pneumonia &amp; loss of weight. Current treatments for achalasia include oral medications (calcium channel blockers) to relax the LES (difficult to swallow pill/capsule), dilation (stretching) of the LES, (temporary relief) &amp; Esophagomyotomy (general surgery to cut the LES). POEM (Per-Oral endoscopic myotomy (creating a muscle [esophagus] opening), an incision-less (no cutting of the surface of the body) endoscopic procedure, is an effective non-surgical alternative to release the muscle &amp; sphincter of the LES for the treatment of achalasia.</detailed_description>
