	<brief_summary>Our primary aim in this study is to investigate the reported enhanced clotting state in adult patients with sickle cell disease using 2 laboratory tests; thromboelastography (TEG) and Endogenous Thrombin Potential (ETP), comparing the results to healthy race matched controls to see if there is a significant difference. Race matching of the control subjects is being carried out because of the well reported racial differences in coagulation parameters that exist in healthy individuals. We are aiming to study the clotting state in sickle patients on transfusion programs and hydroxycarbamide, both treatments offered to sickle patients to ameliorate the condition. We will assess the reported prothrombotic state using TEG and ETP.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Thromboelastography (TEG) and ETP in Sickle Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SCD is the most common inherited red cell disorder worldwide, the genetic mutation in SCD results in the production of abnormal haemoglobin (HbS). This leads to anaemia and unpredictable painful episodes referred to as a sickle cell crisis. Sickle cell crises result in significant chronic health problems including stroke, kidney failure, breathing problems, leg ulcers and chronic and ultimately leads to a decrease in life expectancy. The method by which sickling results in the above issues is recognised as very complex and it is thought these patients may have enhanced blood clotting which may play a role in the complications they get. Sickle cell patients are reported to have higher risk of blood clots such as deep vein thrombosis. Our primary aim in this study is to investigate the reported enhanced clotting state in sickle cell adult sickle cell patients using 2 laboratory tests called thromboelastography (TEG) and Endogenous Thrombin Potential (ETP) , we will compare the results to healthy race matched controls to show if there is a significant difference. We also aim to study the clotting state in sickle patients on a variety of treatments such as transfusion and hydroxycarbamide, both treatments offered to sickle patients. Many trials have shown the benefits of both transfusions and hydroxycarbamide in SCD, they reduce the risk of stroke and frequency with which patients get crises. To the best of our knowledge this will be the first study evaluating the clinical utility of TEG and ETP in adult patients with SCD The trial will be conducted in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the principles of Good Clinical Practice. It has been submitted for approval to the London NHS Research Ethics Committee. Trial Design &amp; Flowchart This is a cross sectional case controlled clinical study in patients with sickle cell disease. Controls will be race and age matched participants without sickle cell disease. Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. They will have samples taken as part of the usual clinic or inpatient procedure with 10 extra millilitres of blood venesected at by the phlebotomist or nurse scheduled to venesect them as part of their usual medical care. Healthy controls will be asked to provide a 10ml blood sample which will be taken by a qualified member of staff. We are aiming to collect samples from 100 patients in total and 20 healthy controls for comparison</detailed_description>
