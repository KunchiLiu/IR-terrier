	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this project is to test the safeness and clinical effectiveness of a novel exoskeleton for the upper limb (Arm Light Exoskeleton Rehab Station, ALEx RS) developed at Wearable Robotics srl, for the force assistance of stroke patients during robotic-rehabilitation. The secondary study aim is to design and test an automatic personalized robot-based upper limb motor rehabilitation protocol targeting the specific kinematic performance of each patient. Finally, the study also aims to define the "neuro-biomechanical state" of the patient and its evolution during the therapy by studying cortical signals and muscular synergies. This information will be used to improve the personalization of the robotic treatment by targeting not only the motor performance but also the cerebral and muscular activity of the patient. The study is longitudinally designed in order to test the safeness and clinical effectiveness of ALEx RS over time, and to monitor the clinical effectiveness of the automatic personalized robotic therapy from the beginning until the end of the treatment. Moreover, in order to estimate the long-term clinical effectiveness of the treatment, the assessment methods proposed in the clinical trial will be repeated one month after the end of the treatment.</brief_summary>
