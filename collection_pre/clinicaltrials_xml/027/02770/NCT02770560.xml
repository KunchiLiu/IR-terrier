	<brief_summary>Thrombotic dysfunction is a common complication of tunneled cuffed catheters (TCC) leading to inadequate dialysis dose, need to catheter replacement with as consequence progressive exclusion of vascular sites. Thrombolytic agent can be used as therapeutic locking solution to dissolve the clotting formed in of around the catheter lumen. There are few studies on the optimal approach of TCC-related thrombosis with thrombolytic containing locking solution (dose, number of administrations, timing of administration - intra or interdialytic use). The primary objective of this retrospective study was to compare the efficacy of inter versus intradialytic Urokinase containing locking solution on restoration of the TCC blood flow. The investigators also assess the question of multiple administrations of Urokinase are more efficient than one single administration</brief_summary>
