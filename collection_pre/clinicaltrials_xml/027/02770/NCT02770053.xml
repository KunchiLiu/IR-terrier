	<brief_title>Foraminal Enlargement and Postoperative Pain.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Foraminal enlargement (FE) is an intentional procedure that enlarges the cement canal. However, some RCTs indicate that enlarging the FE causes postoperative pain, flare-up, and destroy the apical constriction, whilst some RCTs pointed out there is no difference in terms of pain when a FE has been performed. The investigators, therefore, would like to conduct a RCT to increase both sample size and the number of published studies to do a systematic review for this topic.</detailed_description>
