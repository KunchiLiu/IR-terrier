	<brief_summary>In this study the buccal fat pad derived stem cells (BFPSCs) is harvested from buccal fat pad tissue of the patients receiving posterior mandible augmentation. In the test group the patients receive a combination of platelet rich fibrin (PRF) and freeze dried bone allograft (FDBA) (SureOss, Hansbiomed, Korea) loaded with BFPSCs. The control group receivesFDBA (without any cells)+PRF. In all the groups the combination are placed between the recipient site and the block graft obtained from lateral ramus. The results will be evaluated by cone beam computed tomography (CBCT)and hematoxylin and eosin staining in 6 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Buccal Fat Pad Derived Stem Cells With Cortical Tenting in Posterior Mandible Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autogenous bone blocks are harvested from lateral ramus.The buccal fat pad derived stem cells (BFPSCs) is harvested from buccal fat pad tissues. The BFPSCs will be loaded on freeze dried bone allograft (FDBA) (SureOss, Hansbiomed, Korea). Furthermore, twenty milliliters of the venous blood is obtained, placed and collected in a sterile tube, and centrifuged (GAC medical) for 14 minutes at 2800 rpm (approximately 400 g). Following centrifugation, three layers are separated in the tube: cellular plasma at the top, platelet rich fibrin (PRF) clot in the middle and red blood cells at the bottom of the tube. The PRF clot is separated by a sterile pincette. The patients in the test group receives BFPSCs loaded on FDBA with PRF for posterior mandible augmentation and the control group receives combination of PRF and FDBA (lacking any cells). The BFPSCs+FDBA+PRF in the test group and FDBA+PRF in the control group are placed in the gap between the block graft and recipient site. The results will be evaluated by cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) in 6 months and microscopic evaluation of the biopsies by hematoxylin and eosine staining during implant placement.</detailed_description>
