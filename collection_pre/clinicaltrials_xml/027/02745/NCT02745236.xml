	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disease characterized by an irregular heart rhythm of the top part (atria) of the heart. It may cause unpleasant symptoms as well as increases the person's risk of stroke and heart failure. With an ageing population, increasing rates of AF and limited access to specialists, new methods of care, like nurse practitioners (NP) need to be assessed to meet patient specific needs and provide sustainable care. The objective of the project is to evaluate the effect of Nurse Practitioner-led care in people with AF on their quality of life. The Canadian Healthcare system is overwhelmed, with increasing costs and wait times. Contributing to these issues, is AF is the most common arrhythmia accompanied with costly complications including stroke and heart failure. Currently family or emergency room physicians ask general cardiologists or specialized cardiologists, to provide care to patients with AF. Unfortunately, there is limited access to their services. NP's are nurses who have taken extra education at University to treat patients and prescribe medications. This research project involves an NP who has specialized training in AF patient management. By utilizing an NP to provide care for patients with AF, the investigators hope to improve patient's quality of life and satisfaction with care. This may also reduce complications of AF.</brief_summary>
