	<brief_summary>The key objective of this pilot study is to assess the molecular mechanisms of renal pre-conditioning by a one-week low-calorie diet in humans. The protective effect of the low-calorie diet and also of the protein-restriction in donor on transplant qualities and functions in receptor will also be investigated. Analysis of transcriptome, lipidome, metabolome, epigenome, proteome und phosphoproteome through tissue samples as well as blood samples for comparison of low-calorie diet, protein-restriction and no-diet groups.</brief_summary>
