	<brief_title>Can Oxytocin Enhance the Placebo Effect?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study included three phases to investigate oxytocin effect on placebo analgesia: 1. In a double-blind, between-subject, placebo controlled design study to investigate the intranasal OXT (24IU) treatment in 60 healthy male subjects using working memory task. 2. In a single-blind(subjects were informed that the treatment was oxytocin), between-subject, placebo controlled design study to investigate the intranasal OXT (24IU) treatment in 60 healthy male subjects using working memory task.They were informed that oxytocin would increase memory perfomance. 3. In a single-blind(subjects were informed that the treatment was oxytocin), between-subject, placebo controlled design study to investigate the intranasal OXT (24IU) treatment in 60 healthy male subjects using working memory task. But the subjects were told that oxytocin would decrease the performance. Memory performance was included as dependant factor. All subjects completed a range of questionnaires measuring personality and affective traits and levels of anxiety: Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Cheek and Buss shyness Scale (CBSS), Autism Spectrum Quotient (ASQ), Empathy Quotient(EQ),Behavioral Inhibitionactivation System Scale(BASBIS) and Raven Standard Progressive Matrices Test (SPM).</detailed_description>
