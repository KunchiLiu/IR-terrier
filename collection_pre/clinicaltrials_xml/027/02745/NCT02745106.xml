	<brief_title>Interventional Treatment of Residual Pulmonary Hypertension in Patients After Pulmonary Thromboendarterectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The best strategy of treatment patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension is pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. In 5-30% of cases after pulmonary thromboendarterectomy residual pulmonary hypertension is persisted. The technique of radiofrequency pulmonary artery denervation in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (type I) is known and was assessed during clinical investigation. In this study radiofrequency pulmonary artery denervation technique may be applied in patients with residual pulmonary hypertension after pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (type IV)</detailed_description>
