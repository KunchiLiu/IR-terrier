	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to compare two doses of abituzumab with placebo and determine whether abituzumab is more effective, safer, will be better tolerated and can provoke better immune response than placebo in the treatment of patients with SSc-ILD who already receive constant doses of mycophenolate.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects are eligible for this trial if they fulfill all of the following inclusion criteria: Female or male subjects aged between 18 and 75 years of age who provide informed written consent. Subjects fulfilling the 2013 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) /European League Against Rheumatism criteria for classification of systemic sclerosis (SSc). Disease duration of less than (&lt;) 7 years from first nonRaynaud's symptom. According to central readings: Diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 30 percent (%) predicted, Forced vital capacity (FVC) 40% to 85% predicted, and ratio of FVC % predicted to Diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) % predicted &lt;1.8. If these criteria are met, then Highresolution computed tomography (HRCT) of lungs will be performed, and must show at least 5% fibrosis for subjects to be eligible. Use of mycophenolate (MMF) for at least 6 months before the screening visit. The dose must be stable for at least 3 months prior to screening and be in the range as follows: MMF 1.5 to 3 gram/day, MPS 1080 to 2160 mg/day. Female subjects of childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of contraception to prevent pregnancy for 4 weeks before randomization and must agree to continue to practice adequate contraception for the duration of their participation in the trial (up to the last Safety FollowUp Visit). For the purposes of this trial, women of childbearing potential are defined as "All female subjects after puberty unless they are postmenopausal for at least 2 years or are surgically sterile." Highly effective contraception is defined as 2 barrier methods (eg, female diaphragm and male condoms); or 1 barrier method with at least one of the following: spermicide, a hormonal method, or an intrauterine device. Note that because mycophenolate affects the metabolism of oral contraceptives and may reduce their effectiveness, women receiving mycophenolate who are using oral contraceptives for birth control should employ an additional contraceptive method (eg, male or female barrier method). Any condition that in the Investigator's opinion constitutes an inappropriate risk or a contraindication for participation in the trial or that could interfere with the trial objectives, conduct, or evaluation. Renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] &lt;45 mL/minute (min)/1.73 square meter (m^2) as calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation) calculated as follows: GFR (mL/min per 1.73 m^2) = 175*(standardized serum creatinine)^1.154 * (age)^0.203 * 1.212 (if black) * 0.742 (if female) Urine dipstick with &gt;=3 plus protein and urine protein:creatinine ratio more than (&gt;)2 mg/mg. Known diagnosis of obstructive lung disease/emphysema (Forced Expiratory Volume [FEV1]/FVC ratio &lt;0.65) and/or significant emphysematous change on screening HRCT. Other clinically significant abnormalities on HRCT not attributable to scleroderma or emphysema as defined above. Known diagnosis of other significant respiratory disorders. Pulmonary hypertension that fulfills at least one of the following: Current/planned treatment with systemic therapy targeted to Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) or pulmonary hypertension; History of transthoracic echocardiography showing at least one of the following: tricuspid regurgitation jet &gt;2.8 m/sec, right atrial enlargement (major dimension &gt;53 mm), right ventricular enlargement (mid cavity dimension &gt;35 mm), moderate to severe left ventricular dysfunction; Nterminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide &gt;3*Upper limit of normal (ULN). Current clinical diagnosis of another inflammatory connective tissue disease (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or dermato/polymyositis). Concomitant sclerodermaassociated myopathy, fibromyalgia, and secondary Sjögren's are allowed. Suspected/confirmed significant aspiration within the previous 6 months, eg. clinically significant viral/bacterial/fungal infection, major episode of infection requiring hospitalization. Treatment with parenteral antiinfectives within 4 weeks prior/during Screening Period. Completion of oral antiinfectives within 2 weeks of Screening. Use of oral antiinfectives during Screening Period. Vaginal candidiasis, onychomycosis, chronically suppressed oral herpes simplex virus are allowed. Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia permitted. History of/positive Human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C antibody and/or polymerase chain reaction or Hepatitis B surface antigen and/or hepatitis B core antibody (total and/or Immunoglobulin M) antibody at screening. History of/current diagnosis of active tuberculosis (TB), or untreated latent TB infection (LTBI). Presence of uncontrolled or New York Heart Association Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure. History of cancer, except adequately treated (ie, no evidence of recurrence within 5 years prior screening) basal cell/squamous cell carcinomas of the skin (≤3 total in lifetime) or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Known hypersensitivity to abituzumab DS or DP. Current smoker (incl. ecigarettes) / smoking within 4 weeks of screening. Use of agents other than mycophenolate considered by the Investigator to have immunomodulating, immunosuppressive, or potential scleroderma diseasemodifying properties within 6 months of screening, e.g. pirfenidone, nintedanib, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, azathioprine, leflunomide, calcineurin inhibitors, D penicillamine, Potaba, and AIMSPRO. Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine are permitted if dose has been stable for at least 4 weeks before screening. Use of systemic corticosteroids above 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent within 4 weeks prior until last dose of study drug. Inhaled and topical corticosteroids are permitted. Use of any biologic agent within 12 weeks or 5 halflives, whichever is longer, of screening. History of antiCD20 Bcell depleting therapy, eg, rituximab or ocrelizumab. Use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet agent (aspirin =&lt;350 mg daily is permitted). Clinically significant or predefined abnormalities in lab tests: Aspartate aminotransferase, Alanine aminotransferase or alkaline phosphatase level &gt;2.5*ULN; Total bilirubin &gt;1.5*ULN (other than that due to known Gilbert's disease); Hemoglobin &lt;5.0 mmol/L (9 g/dL), white blood cell count &lt;2.5*10^9/L, or platelets &lt;100*10^9/L); International normalized ratio or partial thromboplastin time &gt;2.0*ULN; Thyroidstimulating hormone &lt;0.01 or &gt;=7.1 mIU/L. Inability to receive IV infusions. History of alcohol/drug abuse for 1 year prior screening. Pregnancy/breastfeeding/lactation within 3 months prior screening. History of thrombotic, thromboembolic, or abnormal bleeding events including concomitant antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Subjects with known lupus anticoagulant and/or anticardiolipin and/or antib2 glycoprotein antibodies alone should not be excluded. Legal incapacity/limited legal capacity. Receipt/planned live/attenuated vaccination within 12 weeks prior screening until 3 months after last dose of study drug. Seasonal influenza vaccination with inactivated vaccine formulation is permitted. Major surgery requiring hospitalization within 4 weeks prior screening, planned major surgery for the duration of the trial. Subjects with lung resection. History of/planned major organ or hematopoietic stem cell/marrow transplant. Other protocol defined exclusion criteria could apply.</criteria>
