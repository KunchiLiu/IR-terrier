	<brief_title>The Influence of Dual Task and Gait Speed on Gait Variability in Patients With Chronic Ankle Instability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This case-control study will compare the different gait parameters such as stride time and stride length variability in different gait conditions (e.g., normal speed, normal speed with dual task, fast speed and fast speed with dual task) between healthy individuals and patients who suffer from chronic ankle instability. the measurements will be collected using the OPTOGait system installed on a treadmill.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>history of at least one significant ankle sprain which occurred at least 12 months prior to enrolment in the study and was diagnosed by a physician or a physical therapist using clinical examination classifications described by Malliaropoulos et al history of at least two episodes of 'giving way', and feelings of ankle joint instability in the previously injured ankle joint of 1 year postinitial sprain the most recent injury occurred more than 6 weeks prior to the study enrolment the ability to apply full weight bearing on the injured lower extremity with no more than mild discomfort evidence of a concomitant injury (such as a bony injury or significant muscular/tendon injury) previous ankle surgery other pathological conditions or surgical procedures in lower extremity neurological/vestibular or any other balance disorder. The control group included healthy participants with no current or previous conditions that could affect proprioception.</criteria>
