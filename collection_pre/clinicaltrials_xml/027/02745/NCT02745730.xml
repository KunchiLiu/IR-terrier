	<detailed_description>The central role of the brain in regulating food intake and steering feeding behaviour is increasingly recognized. It is currently well accepted that the brain is the target organ to measure the effects of pleasantness and energy homeostasis in order to change feeding behaviour to reduce the rising prevalence of obesity. The effects of food on the brain are multiple and complex. In addition to primary aspects of food such as taste, texture, looks and smell, secondary aspects such as energy regulation are as much important in the entire "eating experience". Resting state functional connectivity in the brain can be assessed by the analysis of low-frequency fluctuations present in the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Investigators will use resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRl) to detect changes in connectivity in the default mode and salience network after consumption of four different milkshakes with added sugars or sweeteners.</detailed_description>
