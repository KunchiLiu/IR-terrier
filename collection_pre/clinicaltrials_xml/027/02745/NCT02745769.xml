	<criteria>Study Arm 1: histopathologically confirmed advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer, excluding primary tumors of appendiceal origin have at least 1 measurable lesion assessable by radiological imaging. Tumor lesions located in a previously irradiated area are considered measureable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions have received prior secondline treatment with oxaliplatin and/or irinotecan, and no other licensed/standardofcare therapies are available. If the participant has RAS wild type colorectal cancer, he or she also must have received prior treatment with an epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody Study Arm 2 pathologically confirmed mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), with (a) measurable nodal disease on positron emission tomography computed tomography (PETCT) per Lugano classification. Prior to enrollment, pathology must be reviewed and confirmed at the investigational site where the participant is entered have MCL that relapsed after or is refractory to (a) firstline combination chemotherapy with or without stem cell transplant and (b) at least 1 other locally available therapy provide a newly obtained tumor tissue sample. Tumor tissue biopsies may be taken by surgical resection, core needle biopsy, or fine needle biopsy All Study Arms: have not received previous systemic therapy (including investigational agents) targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1)/ PD1 ligand (PDL 1) or PD1/PDL2 signaling pathways. Prior therapy with other immune checkpoint inhibitors, including but not limited to, antiCD137 antibody or anticytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated antigen4 antibody, is not permitted have adequate organ function are, in the judgment of the investigator, appropriate candidates for experimental therapy after available standard therapies have failed to provide clinical benefit have discontinued all previous treatments for cancer and recovered from the acute effects of therapy, other than less than or equal to Grade 2 neuropathy or nonserious and nonlifethreatening toxicities such as alopecia, altered taste, and nail changes have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale men and women must agree to the use an effective method of contraception during the study and for at least 3 months post last dose of study drug administration. Women of childbearing potential must have negative serum and urine pregnancy tests at screening and during each treatment cycle, respectively Study Arm 1 have a serious illness or medical condition including, but not limited to, the following: active or uncontrolled clinically serious infection; inadequate biliary drainage with evidence of unresolved biliary obstruction Study Arm 2 have a serious illness or medical condition including, but not limited to, the following: received an autologous stem cell transplant within 75 days prior to the initial dose of study drug; received an allogeneic stem cell transplant; active or uncontrolled clinically serious infection, including chronic viral hepatitis All Arms: have prior or concurrent malignancies, inclusive of hematologic, primary brain tumor, sarcoma, and other solid tumors, unless in complete remission with no therapy for a minimum of 5 years have active gastrointestinal (GI) disease characterized by inflammatory bowel disease, malabsorption syndrome, or frequent Grade 2 or more diarrhea are pregnant or breastfeeding have previously documented brain metastases, leptomeningeal disease, or uncontrolled spinal cord compression have experienced any of the following: a major surgical procedure, significant traumatic injury, nonhealing wound, peptic ulcer, or bone fracture less than or equal to 28 days prior to enrollment, or placement of a subcutaneous venous access device less than or equal to 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment unless the procedure is of low risk of bleeding in the judgment of the investigator have an elective or a planned major surgery during the course of the trial have a known allergy or hypersensitivity reaction to any of the treatment components have uncontrolled hypertension have experienced any arterial thromboembolic event within 6 months prior to enrollment have experienced any Grade 3 or 4 venous thromboembolic event that is considered by the investigator to be life threatening or that is symptomatic and not adequately treated by anticoagulation therapy, within 6 months prior to enrollment have a history of GI perforation and/or fistulae within 6 months prior to enrollment have experienced any bleeding episode considered lifethreatening, or any Grade 3 or 4 GI/variceal bleeding episode in the 3 months prior to enrollment requiring transfusion or endoscopic or operative intervention have congestive heart failure or poorly controlled cardiac arrhythmia per New York Heart Association Class IIIV heart disease</criteria>
