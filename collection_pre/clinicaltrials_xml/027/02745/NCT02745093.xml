	<brief_title>Medical Abortion at Gestational Age of 8 to ≤9 Weeks Versus &gt;9 to ≤12 Weeks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medical abortion represents an important alternative to surgical methods for termination of early pregnancy. In Mexico City, abortion is legal on request up to 12 weeks of gestation; however, medical abortion is currently only offered up to 10 weeks at Marie Stopes Mexico clinics. The World Health Organization guidelines state that medical abortion drugs may be used to terminate pregnancy up to a gestational age of 24 weeks in clinical settings, with recommended regimens differing by gestational age. However, data are lacking on the safety and effectiveness of home-based medical abortion regimens for pregnancy terminations between &gt;9 and ≤12 weeks' gestation. Investigators propose a prospective cohort study with women between 8 and ≤9 weeks and &gt;9 and ≤12 weeks of pregnancy at Marie Stopes Mexico clinics to compare the effectiveness, safety, and acceptability of mifepristone followed by home-based misoprostol use in these two gestational age groups. The information from this study will inform policy and practice guidelines in Mexico City and potentially other locations by providing evidence on the safety, effectiveness, and acceptability of home-use of medical abortion between &gt;9 and ≤12 weeks of gestation.</detailed_description>
