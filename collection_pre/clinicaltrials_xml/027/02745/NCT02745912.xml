	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Effect of Naltrexone and Bupropion Combination on the Pharmacokinetics of Metformin in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is naltrexone HCl and bupropion HCl Extended- Release fixed dose combination (NB) . This study will evaluate the potential effect of multiple oral doses of extended-release combination of naltrexone/bupropion on the PK of a single oral dose of metformin in healthy participants with normal renal function (defined as creatinine clearance [CrCl] greater than equal to [&gt;=] 90 milliliter per minute [mL/min]/1.73 meter square [m^2]). The study will enroll approximately 30 participants. Participants will receive: Metformin 850 mg as a single dose alone and in combination with multiple doses of Naltrexone/Bupropion Naltrexone 8 mg/Bupropion 90 mg + Naltrexone 16 mg/Bupropion 180 mg as multiple doses alone and in combination with a single dose of metformin All participants will be asked to take 1 tablet of metformin in the morning on Day 1 and Day 14, 1 tablet of naltrexone/bupropion twice daily from Day 3 through Day 5, and 2 tablets of naltrexone/bupropion twice daily from Day 6 through Day 15. This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study is 73 days. Participants will be admitted on Day -1 (check in) and remain confined to the clinic until Day 16 and will be contacted by telephone 30 (Â±2) days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment. Serial blood samples will be collected for PK assessments. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
