	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of non-surgical periodontal treatment on the metabolic control of type2 diabetes patients. Patients with type two diabetes mellitus patients and confirmed chronic periodontitis will be selected and randomly assign to two groups. The treatment group will receive immediate full-mouth scaling and root planing whereas the control group will be scheduled to receive periodontal treatment at the following 3-month visit. Plaque index, bleeding index, probing pocket depth, recessions and cervical attachment loss will be recorded at baseline, at six weeks and at three months. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and C-reactive protein (CRP) will be analysed at baseline and three months following enrolment.</brief_summary>
