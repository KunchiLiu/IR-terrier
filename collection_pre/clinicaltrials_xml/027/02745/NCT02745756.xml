	<brief_summary>This study adds an experimental treatment with another type of cells, called dendritic cells. It is hoped that these cells may stimulate the immune system to react against neuroblastoma in much the same way that vaccines cause the immune system to react to certain viruses and bacteria. The physicians conducting this study have observed from previous research that neuroblastoma cells can be recognized by the immune system, and that they can be destroyed by immune cells.The main goal of this study is to see if giving participants this additional anti-Neuroblastoma vaccine reduces the risk of relapse following the Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Combined Cell Therapy Approach to the Treatment of Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients who are enrolled in this study will receive all treatment at All Children's Hospital which is located at 501 6th Ave South, St. Petersburg, FL 33701. This includes autologous cell donation by apheresis, high dose cytotoxic therapy conditioning for autologous HPC transplant, post-transplant follow-up care, and all administration of dendritic cell vaccines and blood draws for post therapy immunological monitoring. All preparation of cellular products, including hematopoietic progenitor cell products for autologous transplantation, and dendritic cell vaccine products, will be carried out in the Cell Therapy Facility located within the Moffitt Cancer Center, which is located at 12902 Magnolia Drive, Tampa, FL 33612.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must have a histological diagnosis of neuroblastoma or ganglioneuroblastoma and be either newly diagnosed with high risk disease or have failed previous treatment: Patients who have failed previous treatment may have had no more than one earlier autologous HPC transplant. Participant is expected to undergo autologous HPC transplantation that is consistent with standard of care. Must have the presence of residual resectable disease for which surgery is clinically indicated, and will be performed at Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital. Not an eligible candidate for collection by apheresis or HPC transplant. History of autoimmune disorder or immune deficiency disorder.</criteria>
