	<brief_title>Oxytocin Effects on Likeability After Being Liked or Disliked</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a double-blind, between-subject, placebo controlled design study, the researchers aimed to investigate the intranasal OXT (40IU) treatment on rating response after being liked or disliked in healthy male subjects. All subjects completed a range of questionnaires measuring personality and affective traits and levels of anxiety: Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) , State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) , Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Cheek and Buss shyness Scale (CBSS),Autism Spectrum Quotient (ASQ), Empathy Quotient(EQ) before self-administration.Study participants were led to believe that other participants had formed an opinion on their likability based on their appearance in a photograph and they passively viewed the responses (like or dislike) from 'other participants'. After that, they rated 'other participants' about likeability (how much do you like the person), accuracy (have you seen the person), feeling (how good do you feel), and tendency (how much would do like have him/her as a friend). Likeability, tendency, feeling and accuracy were included into analysis as dependent variables.</detailed_description>
