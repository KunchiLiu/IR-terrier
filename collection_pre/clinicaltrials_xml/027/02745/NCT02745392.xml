	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of ZP-Zolmitriptan Intracutaneous Microneedle Systems for the Acute Treatment of Migraine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, parallel group study designed to compare the safety and efficacy of a range of doses of ZP-Zolmitriptan intracutaneous microneedle systems to placebo. Subjects who have consented and meet the entry criteria will be randomized to one of four blinded treatment groups. There will be a screening period of up to 1 week, followed by a run-in period to record migraine activity. The run-in period is to determine eligibility for randomization, and is planned to be 4 weeks in duration but may be extended up to an additional 4 weeks to accommodate scheduling. Qualified subjects will randomize to the double-blind treatment period at Day 0 and will have up to 8 weeks to confirm and treat a qualifying migraine. Using the eDiary to confirm they are experiencing a qualified migraine, subjects will self-administer the patch or patches and continue to respond to questions in the eDiary for 48 hours post treatment administration.</detailed_description>

No significant ECG findings, defined by: 1. ischemic changes 2. Qwaves in at least two contiguous leads, 3. clinically significant intraventricular conduction abnormalities (left bundle branch block or WolfParkinsonWhite syndrome), or 4. clinically significant arrhythmias (e.g., current atrial fibrillation) Able to understand the operation of the electronic diary and is able to apply the demo study drug patch. Contraindication to triptans Use of any prohibited concomitant medications within 10 days of the Runin Period History of hemiplegic or basilar migraine Participation in another investigational trial during the 30 days prior to the Runin Period or during this study Previous participation in a clinical trial of ZPZolmitriptan Diagnosis of cancer (other than noninvasive skin cancer) within the 5 years prior to the Runin Period History of unstable psychiatric illness requiring medication or hospitalization in the 12 months prior to the Runin Period Subjects who have known allergy or sensitivity to zolmitriptan or its derivatives or formulations Subjects who have known allergy or sensitivity to adhesives Planned participation in activities which cause inflammation, irritation, sunburn, lesions, or tattoos at the intended application site from two weeks prior to screening through the last day of study participation Use of opiate analgesics or barbiturates more frequently than one day/week Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or plan a pregnancy during this study Clinically significant liver disease Clinically significant kidney disease History of coronary artery disease (CAD), coronary vasospasm (including Prinzmetal's angina), aortic aneurysm, peripheral vascular disease or other ischemic diseases (e.g., ischemic bowel syndrome or Raynaud's syndrome) Three or more of the following CAD risk factors: Current tobacco use Hypertension or receiving antihypertensive medication for treatment of hypertension Hyperlipidemia or on prescribed anticholesterol treatment Family history of premature coronary artery disease (&lt; 55 years of age in male first degree relatives or &lt; 65 years of age in female first degree relatives) Diabetes mellitus History of cerebral vascular accident, transient ischemic attacks, or seizures Hospitalization within the 30 days prior to the Runin Period Any other household member currently participating in a ZPZolmitriptan study or relatives of site staff Any reason to believe that compliance with the study requirements and completion of evaluations required for this study will not be possible History or current abuse or dependence on alcohol or drugs that would interfere with adherence to study requirements Any clinically relevant abnormal findings in the physical exam, vital signs or laboratory tests that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may put the subject at risk To be eligible for Treatment, subjects must continue to meet all eligibility criteria and the following criteria observed during the Runin Period: 1. An average of at least two qualifying migraines per 28day period 2. No more than 10 headache days in the last 28 days prior to randomization 3. Demonstrated ability to properly use the eDiary and apply the demo study drug patch 4. Confirmation of continuing good general health, or stable nonserious disease that in the opinion of the Investigator will not place the subject at risk.</criteria>
