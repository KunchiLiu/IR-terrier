	<brief_summary>Each year, half a million patients with a potential neck (c-spine) injury are transported to Ontario emergency departments (ED). Less than 1% of all these patients actually have a neck bone fracture. Even less (0.5%) have a spinal cord injury or nerve damage. These injuries usually occur at the time of initial trauma and not during transport to the ED. Currently, paramedics transport all trauma victims (with or without an injury) by ambulance using a backboard, collar, and head immobilizers. Trauma victims can stay immobilized for hours until an ED bed is made available or until x-rays are completed. Importantly, long immobilization is often unnecessary, it causes patient discomfort and pain, decreases community access to paramedics, contributes to ED crowding, and is very costly. The investigators developed the Canadian C-Spine Rule (CCR) for alert and stable trauma patients. This decision rule helps ED physicians and triage nurses to safely and selectively remove immobilization, without x-rays and missed injury. The investigators will evaluate the possibility and benefits of allowing paramedics to use the CCR in the field in 12 new communities from across Ontario. Patients have suggested the investigators include measures of pain and discomfort from being immobilized during transport as important patient-centred outcomes. The investigators will also measure the impact on the ED, and how much money could be saved if more paramedics were allowed to use the CCR. The investigators will also assess if sex, age, language barriers, or living far from the hospital (long transport time) will affect the outcomes of the study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pragmatic Evaluation of the Canadian C-Spine Rule by Paramedics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Paramedics in participating Ontario communities will all receive standardized training on the application of the Canadian C-Spine Rule (CCR). Once the training has been completed, paramedics will begin using the CCR to evaluate patients with potential c-spine injuries. For the first three months of the evaluation period, paramedics will use the CCR to evaluate eligible patients, but continue to use spinal immobilization for transport according to their existing protocols. After this validation period, participating services will be randomized in stepped wedge fashion in clusters of 4 services to actively use the CCR and selectively immobilize according to the CCR.</detailed_description>
