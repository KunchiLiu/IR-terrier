	<detailed_description>This study aims to show the impact of a treatment with a D2/D3 receptor-specific dopamine agonist on the hypo-dopaminergic syndrome and quality of life of patients with de-novo Parkinson's disease. The study consists of three parts: 1. The first part consists of a detailed clinical description of these patients, focusing on neuropsychological symptoms. The objective is to describe patients with and without apathy and hypo-dopaminergic syndrome. 2. From this population, a small number of patients with and without hypo-dopaminergic syndrome will be selected in order to compare serotoninergic and dopaminergic denervation by positron emission tomography (PET). 3. In patients with hypo-dopaminergic syndrome the motivational effects of a dopamine agonist will be tested in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. We hypothesize a significant improvement of apathy in the rotigotine group versus placebo</detailed_description>
