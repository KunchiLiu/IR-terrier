	<brief_summary>This is a Phase IV multi-center, randomized, open-label, cross-over, placebo study in subjects with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) to compare inhaler-specific preference attributes of two inhalers - ELLIPTA dry powder inhaler (DPI) and the HANDIHALER DPI. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether more subjects with COPD prefer the ELLIPTA inhaler to the HANDIHALER DPI based on the number of steps needed to take medication. All subjects will use the ELLIPTA inhaler and the HANDIHALER inhaler in the corresponding treatment periods based on the randomisation scheme, and at the end of 2 periods, complete the inhaler preference questionnaire. Subjects will self-administer the inhalation once daily for 5-9 days in each treatment period. This study will be placebo-only, and neither inhaler will contain active treatment. Subjects will continue their current COPD medication(s) as prescribed, and will follow up with their regular physician for their COPD healthcare during the study. Approximately 211 subjects will be enrolled in the study. ELLIPTA is a trademark of the GlaxoSmithKline group of companies. HANDIHALER is a trademark of Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>&gt;=40 years of age at Visit 1. Diagnosis of COPD with a documented history of COPD for at least 6 months. Severity of Disease: Post albuterol/salbutamol forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio &lt;0.70 and FEV1 &lt;=70% of predicted obtained within two years of Visit 1. Smoking History: Current or former (defined as subjects who have quit smoking for at least 3 months prior to Screening/Visit 1) cigarette smokers with a &gt;10 packyear smoking history. Number of pack years = (number of cigarettes per day/20) x number of years smoked (for example, 10 packyears is equal to 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years). Current COPD Therapy: 1. Currently receiving maintenance therapy with one or more longacting bronchodilators, such as a longacting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA; also known as a longacting anticholinergic), longacting beta 2agonist (LABA), or inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/LABA combination for the treatment of COPD. Subjects must be able to continue using their currently prescribed COPD maintenance inhaler therapy throughout the study and as needed short acting betaadrenergic agonist (SABA) or short acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA) for rescue use. 2. Has been on current maintenance COPD treatment for at least 4 weeks prior to Screening/Visit 1 and evaluated as unlikely to change COPD treatment within 4 weeks of Visit 1. Males or Females who are not pregnant or not planning a pregnancy during the study or not lactating. Capable of giving signed informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions defined for this study. Subject understands and is willing, able, and likely to comply with study procedures and restrictions. Subject must be able to read, comprehend, and record information in English. Asthma: Subjects with a current diagnosis of asthma. Subjects with a prior history of asthma are eligible if they have a current diagnosis of COPD. Recent experience with the ELLIPTA inhaler: Subjects who used any ELLIPTA inhaler within 6 months (180 days) prior to Visit 1. Recent experience with the HANDIHALER inhaler: Subjects who used any HANDIHALER inhaler within 6 months (180 days) prior to Visit 1. Poorly controlled COPD: Subjects with symptoms of poorly controlled COPD such as: 1. Acute worsening of COPD that is managed by the subject with corticosteroids or antibiotics or that requires treatment prescribed by a physician, in the 4 weeks prior to Visit 1. 2. Hospitalization due to acute worsening of COPD within 4 weeks of Visit 1. 3. Use of a total of 8 puffs/day or more of shortacting symptom relief medications such as albuterol and ipratropium for 2 consecutive days or any 3 days within 7 days immediately preceding Visit 1. 4. Changes in COPD symptoms and signs, suggesting worsening COPD health status at Visit 1. Other Disease Abnormalities: 1. Subjects with suspected or evidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis. 2. Historical or current evidence of clinically significant or rapidly progressing or unstable cardiovascular, neurological, renal, hepatic, immunological, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or haematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled. Significant is defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through participation, or which would affect the analysis if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study. 3. Subjects with a history of psychiatric disease, intellectual deficiency, poor motivation or other conditions that will limit the validity of informed consent to participate in the study. Compliance: Subjects at risk of noncompliance, or unable to comply with the study procedures, or unable to continue their current COPD medications. Drug/alcohol abuse: Subjects with a known or suspected alcohol or drug abuse at Visit 1 which in the opinion of the investigator could interfere with the subject's proper completion of the protocol requirement. Drug/Food Allergy: A history of hypersensitivity to any components of the study inhaler (for example, lactose, magnesium stearate). In addition, subjects with a history of severe milk protein allergy that, in the opinion of the study physician, contraindicates participation will also be excluded. Investigational Product: Subjects who have received an investigational drug and/or medical device within 30 days of entry into this study (Screening/Visit 1), or within five drug halflives of the investigational drug, whichever is longer. Affiliation with Investigator's Site: A subject will not be eligible for this study if he/she is an immediate family member of the participating investigator, subinvestigator, study coordinator, or employee of the participating investigator.</criteria>
