	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate MBSR(BC), an intensive meditation-based stress reduction intervention, in order to determine its efficacy in improving cognitive functioning among breast cancer survivors. The study will employ a three group randomized design that will (1) evaluate the extent to which MBSR(BC) compared to the Breast Cancer-Education Support (BCES) program or Usual Care (UC) improves cognitive functioning among breast cancer survivors off treatment; (2) determine if improvements in cognitive functioning achieved from MBSR(BC) are mediated through increased mindfulness and decreased rumination and stress; (3) evaluate genetic variants as moderators of MBSR(BC) on improvements in CI; and (4) determine the impact of MBSR(BC) on healthcare utilization and costs, in addition it will be delivered to a sub-group in Spanish. If shown to be efficacious, the possibility exists of utilizing this intervention in other types of cancers as well as non-cancer health-related disorders in order to minimize the morbidity experienced by these populations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of MBSR Treatment of Cognitive Impairment Among Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Due to improved detection and treatment, survival rates among breast cancer survivors have increased. However, breast cancer survivors may experience cognitive impairment (CI) following treatment, which has been reported by breast cancer survivors up to 10 years after chemotherapy (CT). There is limited evidence on whether stress-reducing interventions improve CI in breast cancer survivors. The primary goal of this application is to establish the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction for Breast Cancer (MBSR(BC)) program as an effective treatment for CI in breast cancer survivors. Specifically this study aim to (1) evaluate the extent to which MBSR(BC) compared to the Breast Cancer-Education Support (BCES) program or Usual Care (UC) improves cognitive functioning among breast cancer survivors off treatment; (2) determine if improvements in cognitive functioning achieved from MBSR(BC) are mediated through increased mindfulness and decreased rumination and stress; (3) evaluate genetic variants as moderators of MBSR(BC) on improvements in CI; and (4) determine the impact of MBSR(BC) on healthcare utilization and costs. To achieve these aims, the research team will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) among 330 breast cancer survivors with Stage I-III BC who have received adjuvant CT or CT and radiation. Within this RCT, MBSR(BC) will be delivered to a subpopulation of Spanish speaking breast cancer survivors. Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to (1) the 6-week MBSR(BC) program; (2) the 6-week BCES program; or (3) UC. The BCES program will match the MBSR(BC) program for time and attention and parallel the group support component of MBSR(BC). Assessments will take place at baseline, 6 weeks,12 weeks and 6 months and include clinical history and demographic information, objective neuropsychological assessments, subjective cognitive and symptom measurements, cost utilization surveys and a blood sample collection for genetic analyses. This study is highly innovative to be the first randomized trial to: 1) evaluate the efficacy of MBSR(BC) among breast cancer survivors for objective neuropsychological and subjective improvements in cognitive functioning; 2) evaluate genetic profiles as moderators of MBSR(BC) on improving CI; 3) offer the MBSR trial in Spanish in addition to English for the purpose of improving cognition; and 4) determine the effect of MBSR(BC) on CT-induced CI among breast cancer survivors related to health service utilization costs. MBSR(BC) provides training to promote stress reduction through self-regulation of attention and awareness to stressful events. The preliminary results show that MBSR(BC) improves subjective cognitive functioning. If MBSR(BC) is found to be effective, it will provide evidence of a viable non-pharmacological method for managing CI in breast cancer survivors. Additionally, the examination of the effects of the hypothesized mediators may yield new insights for tailoring MBSR(BC) and/or developing additional interventions to aid breast cancer survivors. The assessment of genetic polymorphisms to explore if risk alleles are associated with improvement in cognitive functioning may demonstrate that specific genetic profiles may modify improvements in CI for those receiving MBSR(BC). Finally, if MBSR(BC) is shown to be effective, this may significantly impact healthcare utilization and cost and produce necessary evidence for clinicians, researchers and policymakers.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Women age 21 or older who have: (1) a diagnosis of stage I, II, or III breast cancer; (2) completed CT or CT and radiation and are within 2 years posttreatment; (3) met the screening criteria for CI through a positive response to at least 1 of 2 questions from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTCQLQ)94 (i.e. (1) "Have you had difficulty in concentrating on things, like reading a newspaper or watching television;" and (2) "Have you had difficulty remembering things)," will be included. Subjects must have the ability to read and speak English and Spanish at the 8th grade level or above, and survivors with mild depression, anxiety, or other psychiatric conditions will be eligible. Breast cancer survivors with a severe current psychiatric diagnosis (e.g. bipolar disorder) Stage 0 or Stage IV BC History of another primary cancer diagnosis Previous chemotherapy Current neurologic disorder Or a traumatic brain injury will be excluded</criteria>
