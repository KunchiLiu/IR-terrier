	<brief_summary>Phase 1 of this study will compare the effectiveness of 3 approved HCV treatment regimens to learn whether they work equally well under real-world conditions. Phase 2 of this study will begin early 2017 and will compare the effectiveness of 2 FDA approved HCV treatments. Patients receiving HCV therapy in community and academic clinics will be offered the opportunity to consent to be randomly assigned to one of three regimens and then observed for outcomes. Once randomized, all medical care, laboratory testing, and any disease or side effect management will be assumed by usual care conditions, and patient-reported outcomes will be collected outside clinic in keeping with pragmatic design principles.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In Phase 1 of this study, consented subjects will be randomized to 1 of the following 3 HCV treatments: 1) Harvoni® 2)Viekira Pak™ 3)Zepatier™ (The addition of Ribavirin and the length of treatment will be determined by the provider). In Phase 2 of this study, consented subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 FDA approved HCV treatments: 1)1) Harvoni® or 3)Zepatier™. Both Phase 1 and Phase 2 subjects will have up to 1 tablespoon of blood drawn for HCV resistance testing and future biorepository testing (if subject provides additional consent). The results of testing will determine whether a genotype 1a subject will be provided 12 or 16 wks of Zepatier (if randomized to Zepatier). Following randomization, subjects will complete patient reported outcome questionnaires via electronic device or telephone. Following randomization, subjects will be asked to complete surveys again at Wk 4 of treatment, End of Treatment, 1 and 3 year post treatment. Subjects standard medical care will continue. Test results and medical records throughout treatment and for up to 3 years post treatment will be collected.</detailed_description>
