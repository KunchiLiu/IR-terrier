	<criteria>Moderate to severe RA despite treatment with methotrexate (MTX). Eligible to use adalimumab according to the local label without any contraindication. Na√Øve to adalimumab, and participants with prior exposure to any other biologic diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) should have experienced at least five halflives of the biologics after treatment discontinuation. Participants for whom investigators decided to prescribe adalimumab as per local label and are initiating adalimumab at baseline. Other inflammatory condition which may affect the signs on joints ultrasound (eg, gouty arthritis, or other chronic rheumatic disease besides RA). Currently being treated with or has been treated with any investigational drug of chemical or biologic nature within a minimum of 30 days of the baseline visit. Participants with contraindication or are not appropriate to use adalimumab according to local label or investigators' judgment.</criteria>
