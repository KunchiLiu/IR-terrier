	<detailed_description>This study is to be conducted in two stages. Stage 1 is the preliminary study, in which 20 patients with stage III/IV NSCLC will be enrolled to receive vaccination with an optimal concentration and amount of blood-stage P. vivax to observe the infection time, rate and cycle; principal clinical symptoms such as fever and anemia; heart, liver and kidney function; changes in spleen morphology and function, and dynamic changes in the function of peripheral immune cells. Moreover, changes in tumor-related parameters will be observed. Stage 2 is the primary study, in which 60 patients will be enrolled to receive vaccination with blood stage P. vivax to principally observe how well the patients tolerate Plasmodium infection and changes in tumor-related parameters. The duration of the planned treatment is 4-8 weeks, and successful infection will be indicated by microscopic observation of parasitemia in peripheral blood samples. The treatment will last at least 28 days from the day of finding the Plasmodium from peripheral blood and will be terminated by DUO-COTECXIN or chloroquine phosphate plus primaquine phosphate. Each patient will be vaccinated with 5-10 mL of P. vivax-infected red blood cells containing approximately 1 × 10^8 Plasmodium parasites. After vaccination, the onset and duration of peripheral parasitemia and the infection rate will be observed. Once the infection rate reaches 0.1%, 10-30 mL of venous blood will be drawn, tested, and frozen to preserve the blood with parasitemia (to ensure that except for P. vivax, all other parameters meet the blood donation standards), which will be used to vaccinate subsequent patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1865 years of age, male or female Unresectable stage III or IV nonsmall cell lung cancer, diagnosed by histological and radiological findings (UICC, Seventh Ed.), and of any histological subtype. Cancer staging during the initial diagnosis must be confirmed by radiographic findings (CT and/or MRI and/or PETCT) During study treatment, the patient should not receive other treatments, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, other biological therapy, physical therapy, traditional Chinese medicine, and so on More than four weeks since the end of targeted therapy, or radiotherapy and chemotherapy (concurrent or sequential) After the initial radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the objective response time is ≤ 4 weeks, according to the RECIST criteria (i.e., poor efficacy of initial treatment) Expected survival &gt; 16 weeks ECGO score of 0 or 1 PLT ≥100 × 10^9/L, WBC ≥ 4 × 10^9/L, and HGB ≥ 100 g/L; no significant morphological abnormalities of red blood cells, or anemia (iron deficiency anemia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, thalassemia, etc.) The patient is willing to receive Plasmodium immunotherapy and is able to sign the informed consent For female patients: the result of a pregnancy test must be negative at screening. All subjects must consent to use birth control methods during treatment and for two months after discharge The subject is willing to follow the inhospital exam and treatment and followup schedule The patient can return for regular scheduled followup visits during the 2year followup period The subject agrees that the investigators may report and publish the results of this clinical study Total ≤ 4 weeks after surgical treatment or other forms of treatments Active chronic lung diseases (hypoxemia due to bronchial asthma, tuberculosis, other conditions); lung metastatic tumor; other comorbid tumors Brain metastases Patients with autoimmune disease or other immunodeficiency diseases Patients taking longterm steroids or immunosuppressants Patients with severe hemoglobin disease or severe G6PD deficiency Patients with active or chronic symptomatic hepatitis Liver impairment: ALT &gt; 2.5 x ULN, AST &gt; 2.5 x ULN, bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN Renal impairment: serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 x ULN Patients with chronic heart disease, primarily those with recent (within a year) myocardial infarction, serious arrhythmias, heart failure, or aortic aneurysm Patients with splenectomy or splenomegaly Pregnant and nursing women Patients who have participated in other clinical studies during the previous three months Any condition that makes the subject ineligible to participate (in the opinion of the investigator)</criteria>
