	<brief_title>A Registry of Patients With Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PURE is a multi-national, prospective, observational cohort study of patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis aimed at assessing the real-world safety and effectiveness of secukinumab and other indicated therapies. The study will enroll patients for whom, prior to and independent of study enrollment, the treating physician has decided to treat with secukinumab, or one of the other indicated therapies regimens approved for the management of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Two study cohorts will be defined by patients treated with secukinumab (Cohort 1), and patients treated with other indicated therapies (systemic, phototherapy, or biologic therapy; Cohort 2). Each investigator will recruit approximately the same number of patients in each treatment arm. 2,500 patients (1,250 patients in each cohort) will be followed over a period of 5 years from the Baseline assessment (Visit 1).</detailed_description>
