	<brief_summary>The recent discovery of functional brown adipose tissue (BAT) in humans has led to a paradigm shift in adipose tissue biology; it is now believed that adipocytes may play a significant role in regulating substrate metabolism. Given that the resurgence in the interest in human BAT is still in its infancy, a number of fundamental questions pertaining to the role of BAT in human physiology remain unanswered. One area of particular importance, but poorly understood, is the potential effect of BAT on triglyceride (TG) metabolism. Data from a series of studies have found that BAT is inversely associated with adiposity, high blood lipids, and fatty liver in people. However, the role of BAT in the regulation of TG metabolism in people is not known. The overall goal of this study is to determine the physiological importance of the human BAT in TG metabolism. To this end, we are planning to study forty overweight/obese women with high amounts of BAT (BAT+, n=20) and with no/minimal BAT (BAT-, n=20) both under thermoneutrality and mild cold exposure (~2 weeks apart). The investigators hypothesize that BAT+ subjects will demonstrate greater plasma very low density lipoprotein-triglycerides (VLDL-TG) clearance rate during cold exposure compared to BAT- subjects and upregulation of genes and proteins involved in lipid metabolism only in BAT (but not muscle and white adipose tissue). Infusion of stable isotope tracers and metabolic modeling techniques will be used to assess VLDL-TG kinetics. Positron emission tomography computed tomography will be used for the identification and quantification of BAT. Supraclavicular BAT, abdominal white adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle tissue biopsies during cold exposure and thermoneutral conditions in conjunction with molecular biology techniques will used to measure expression of genes and proteins involved in lipid metabolism.</brief_summary>
