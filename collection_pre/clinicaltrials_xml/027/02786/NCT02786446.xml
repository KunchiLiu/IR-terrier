	<brief_title>Comparison of Different Analgesia Drug Regimens for Pain Control During ESWL for Renal Stones</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction of ESWL (extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy) has revolutionized the treatment of urolithiasis due to its noninvasive in nature, cost effectiveness, reduced hospitalization time and less morbidity1, 2.Impact of shock waves cause pain in most of the patient requiring analgesia or sedation. It is important to make patient pain free to get the maximum possible stone free rates3, 4. Opioids are used most commonly for pain relief in ESWL but with side effects requiring patient monitoring and delayed hospital stay3, 4. NSAIDS also showed promising results regarding pain control in ESWL without side effects of opoids1, 5. Local analgesia gels have controversial role in relieving pain in ESWL 1, 6. There are yet no guidelines for pain relief during ESWL1, 4. We intend to compare the effect of local analgesia gel, oral NSAIDS and their combination on pain during lithotripsy.</detailed_description>
