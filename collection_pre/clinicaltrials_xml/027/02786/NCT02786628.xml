	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of a multi-institutional study that collects cardiopulmonary exercise testing and 6 minute walk distance performance testing prior to a cycle of chemotherapy (or transplant), followed by collection of patient generated health data (wearable activity monitors and patient reported outcomes) for the subsequent month. In addition to demonstrating feasibility, the study looks to generate preliminary data that supports the capacity of physical performance testing and patient-generated health data to complement clinician-rated performance status in patients receiving chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing Physical Fitness in Cancer Patients With Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing and Wearable Data Generation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physical fitness, based on tests of physical performance and measurements of daily activity, can serve as both a risk stratification variable and clinical outcome for patients prior to or during cytotoxic chemotherapy. Many cytotoxic therapies cause premature aging and frailty in a sizable portion of patients, so measuring and improving physical function may also limit late morbidity and mortality in certain patient populations. Clinician-rated performance status (cPS; e.g., ECOG or Karnofsky PS) in addition to organ-specific function have been used to prognosticate risk and determine treatment strategy, but cPS only readily identifies individuals with significant functional compromise. Objective evaluations of physical function, such as aerobic capacity and measured daily activity, may have greater potential to improve the precision of performance status evaluation.</detailed_description>
