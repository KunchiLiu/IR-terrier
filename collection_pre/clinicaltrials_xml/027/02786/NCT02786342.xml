	<brief_summary>Sorafenib represents the standard care for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, molecular predictors of sorafenib efficacy have not yet been identified. The primary aim of the study is to validate the prognostic or predictive role of eNOS,Ang2, HIF-1, VEGF and VEGFR polymorphisms in relation to clinical outcome (progression-free survival, PFS) of HCC patients treated with sorafenib.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Italian Study Of Validation Of Angiogenesis Polymorphisms In HCC Patients Treated With Sorafenib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor acting on vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ) involved in tumor cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is a cascade of linked and sequential steps ultimately leading to tumour neovascularisation. Preclinical data suggested that significant HCC growth is dependent on angiogenesis, and an increase in tumour dimension may induce vascular endothelial cell proliferation. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-driven pathway has been demonstrated to play a major role in tumour angiogenesis. In fact, VEGF as a potent permeability factor promotes cell migration during invasion and as an endothelial growth factor stimulates endothelial cell proliferation, inducing the budding of new blood vessels around the growing tumour masses . Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VEGF and VEGF receptor (VEGFR) genes have also been correlated to tumour neoangiogenesis through different biological mechanisms. In the ALICE-1 study HCC patients receiving sorafenib were tested for VEGF-A, VEGF-C and VEGFR-1,2,3 SNPs. At univariate analysis VEGF-A alleles C of rs25648, T of rs833061, C of rs699947, C of rs2010963, VEGF-C alleles T of rs4604006, G of rs664393, VEGFR-2 alleles C of rs2071559, C of rs2305948 were significant predictors of PFS and overall survival (OS). At multivariate analysis rs2010963, rs4604006 and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage resulted to be independent factors influencing PFS and OS. In the ALICE-2 study SNPs of hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) were statistically significant for PFS and OS. The extended analysis of VEGF and VEGFR SNPs confirms the results of ALICE-1 study. The presence of GG genotype of rs12434438 (HIF-1α) select a population with a particularly poor outcome independently from the clinical effect of the two VEGF SNPs (PFS: 2.6 months, p&lt;0,0001; OS: 6.6 months, p&lt;0,0001). In ePHAS study a training cohort of 41 HCC patients and a validation cohort of 87 patients receiving sorafenib was analyzed. At univariate analysis, patients homozygous for an endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) haplotype (HT1: T-4b at eNOS-786/eNOS VNTR) had a lower median PFS (2.6 vs. 5.8 months, p &lt;0.0001) and OS (3.2 vs.14.6 months, p = 0.024) than those with other haplotypes. These data were confirmed in the validation set in which patients homozygous for HT1 had a lower median PFS (2.0 vs. 6.7 months, p &lt;0.0001) and OS (6.4 vs.18.0 months, p &lt; 0.0001). On the basis of these premises this prospective study aims at validating the potential role of eNOS, VEGF, VEGFR, HIF-1 and Ang2 polymorphisms in patients with HCC treated with sorafenib.</detailed_description>
