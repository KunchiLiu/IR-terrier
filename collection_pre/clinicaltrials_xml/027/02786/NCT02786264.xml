	<brief_title>Association of Type of Anesthetic and Outcomes in Transfemoral Aortic Valve Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study proposes to perform a descriptive analysis and pilot observational study looking at the types and quantity of anesthetic agents used and their associations with outcomes among patients scheduled to receive TAVR at YNHH. Hypothesis 1: TAVR surgery done under monitored anesthesia care are performed using some combination of the following anesthetics: dexmedetomidine, propofol, fentanyl, and midazolam. Hypothesis 2: Age-adjusted dosing of these agents will be insufficient to account for extreme age after controlling for preoperative comorbid status. Hypothesis 3: The rate of conversion to general anesthesia will be unrelated to the type of conscious sedation used. Hypothesis 4: ICU length of stay, delirium, hospital length of stay, and length of hospital stay will be shorter for patients who were sedated using dexmedetomidine vs those without. Research Plan: The research will be done via chart review and analysis of data already contained in the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group databases at Yale. The possible risks are primarily the risk to privacy that is inherent in any retrospective chart review. The benefit may be to suggest areas of future study to improve sedation practices for TAVR at Yale and elsewhere. Information recorded will include demographic and preoperative medical assessment from prior to the TAVR, the anesthetic record, and the post-operative course of recovery for patients undergoing TAVR. These data will include age, gender, comorbidities, laboratory values, vital signs, and the results of imaging studies as well as other records potentially related to the above hospitalization.</detailed_description>
