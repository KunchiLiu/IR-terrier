	<brief_summary>The study is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel study in obese children. A total of 75 obese children in the age 5 to 10 years, enrolled in a childhood obesity treatment program, will be included. The participating children will be randomised into one of three groups consuming either HMO (two groups) or placebo (one group). The primary objective of the study is to establish the effects of HMOs on the faecal microbiota in children. Secondary objectives are to evaluate safety of HMO supplementation in children and the effect on gastrointestinal symptoms (tolerance), bowel habits, metabolic profile and body composition in obese children.</brief_summary>
