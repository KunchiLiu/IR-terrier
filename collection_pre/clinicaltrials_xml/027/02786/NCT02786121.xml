	<brief_summary>Several authors explain as the kinesiophobia plays an important role for the recovery after orthopaedic surgery. The aim of the investigators study is to investigate if the kinesiophobia is able to influence the early recovery after total hip arthroplasty. The early recovery will be measured by the ILOA Score. The Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia will measure the fear level of movement. All the other variable that could influence the ILOA Score are identified and collected: age, sex, body max index, ability of patient pre-surgery, type of anesthesia, length of stay, pain, haemoglobin, possible complications.</brief_summary>
