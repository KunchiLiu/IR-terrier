	<brief_summary>Squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the most frequent form of head and neck cancer. The therapeutic choice depends on the stage of the disease and the habits of the medical teams. Surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be used, alone or combined. However, none of the existing strategies has proven its superiority. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy induce DNA damages in the tumor cells. However, cells have the ability to induce DNA reparation, capable of causing treatment resistance. DNA reparation in non-tumor tissues can also explain the toxicity of cancer treatments. Investigation of DNA repair pathways involved in chemo- or radiation resistance could offer a good strategy for identifying biomarkers or indicators of treatment response. This study will explore the capacity of a comprehensive functional approach that addresses several pathways, based on the use of three innovative patented technologies, to classify the tumor response of HNSCC patients to treatments according to their DNA Repair Enzyme Signature. Our hypothesis is that taking into account various clinical parameters (e.g. patient and tumor characteristics), treatment strategy and measuring the DNA Repair Enzyme Signature would create patients' profiles and optimize their management.</brief_summary>
