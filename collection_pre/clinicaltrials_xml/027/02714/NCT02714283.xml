	<detailed_description>Non-CF bronchiectasis is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that is closely linked to pulmonary NTM disease. Both are rare but rising in incidence and disproportionately affect the elderly and women. Therapy of non-CF bronchiectasis aims to reduce inflammation via either ICS-induced immunosuppression or antibiotic-associated immunomodulation and/or suppression of pathogenic organisms. Both strategies, pursued long-term alone or some cases concomitantly, have inherent risks, and the relative risks and benefits of these differential approaches are poorly studied to date. Ultimately, our study will provide patients and their physicians with greater understanding of the risks and benefits of these therapeutic choices.</detailed_description>
