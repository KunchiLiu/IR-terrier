	<brief_title>IL-2 in Refractory Autoimmune Encephalitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autoimmune encephalitis is a recently recognized etiology of encephalitis which is mediated by various autoantibodies targeting neural cells or synapses. The responses to immunotherapy is generally good, considerable proportion of patients with autoimmune encephalitis have unfavorable clinical outcomes. Recently, depletion of regulatory T cell (Treg cell) is reported in variable autoimmune diseases and multiple studies have shown that low-dose interleukin-2(IL-2) specifically activates Treg cells to control autoimmunity and inflammation. Protocol: This study is a single arm open-label study assessing clinical responses to the administration of low-dose IL-2 in autoimmune encephalitis patients who are refractory to first- and second-line immunotherapy. Objective: To assess the efficacy of low-dose IL-2 in autoimmune encephalitis, resistant to first- and second- line immunotherapy. Methods: This is a single arm open-label study. Each patients will receive four cycles of subcutaneous Proleukin (Interleukin-2, IL-2) (Week-1; 1.5 million IU (MIU)/d from Day-1 to Day-5, Week-3, -6, -9; 3MIU/d from Day-1 to Day-5) in the hospital. The patients will be followed up for 3 months (Week-21). Primary outcome - clinical efficacy by modified Rankin Scale Secondary outcome - Immunologic follow-up of Treg cells before, during, and after IL-2 therapy, quality of life, cognitive function, side effect of low-dose IL-2</detailed_description>
