	<detailed_description>Endpoints: Primary: - To determine if erlotinib given orally along with concurrent external beam radiation therapy, prolongs local tumour control as determined by CT evaluation compared to treatment with external beam radiation therapy alone Secondary: - To confirm the safety profile of erlotinib along with concurrent external beam radiation therapy. - To evaluate if erlotinib along with concurrent external beam radiation therapy, improve quality of life as assessed with the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the EORTC QLQ-LC13. - To evaluate if PET-CT examination can be used to predict response to treatment. - To evaluate overall survival in the different groups Trial Design: Open multicenter two-armed randomized phase II trial.</detailed_description>
