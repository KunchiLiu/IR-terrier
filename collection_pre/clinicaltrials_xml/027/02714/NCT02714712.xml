	<brief_summary>The scavenger receptor type B class I (SR-BI) is a receptor for high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and one of entry factors for hepatitis C virus (HCV). The investigators aimed to examine the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the SCARB1 gene, which encodes SR-BI, with virologic responses to pegylated interferon-based treatment in Asian chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SR-BI and Antiviral Treatment Response in HCV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Purpose of study: To examine the impacts of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) relevant to SR-BI on CHC patients. 2. Study Design To enroll 400 CHC patients during a 3-year period 3. Specify objectives of study when collecting extra specimen from participants Collect blood samples for genomic DNA to examine the SR-BI gene polymorphisms. 4. Expected Endpoints of Treatment Sustained virologic response (SVR) means undetectable serum HCV RNA levels 24 weeks after completion of antiviral therapy.</detailed_description>
