	<brief_summary>The inherited retinal dystrophies are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of conditions, which often present in childhood. These disorders can be usefully divided according to whether they (i) are stationary or progressive; and (ii) exhibit predominantly rod or cone involvement, or central receptor disease. The underlying molecular genetic basis of the majority of monogenic inherited retinal disease has now been characterised. Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) is a diagnosis for a group of severe, autosomal recessively inherited rod - cone dystrophies that typically result in complete visual loss in the third or fourth decade of life. One form, LCA2, is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding RPE56, an RPE-specific 65-kDa isomerase. Non-functional RPE65 results in photoreceptor cells that are unable to respond to light resulting in these patients being visually impaired. Proof of principle studies for RPE65 gene replacement therapy has been demonstrated with the use of recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (rAAV2/2) vectors in animal models. Furthermore clinical trials of gene replacement therapy in RPE65 associated LCA (RPE65-LCA) have shown significant promise. All three clinical trials showed improvement in visual function over the first year, however longer term follow up demonstrated progressive visual loss and that initial improvements were not maintained. Greater efficacy was noted in animal models and we feel the relatively lower efficacy of treatment in participants was most likely due to insufficient production of RPE65 protein from AAV2/2 hRPE65 in the human eye. As the maximal tolerated vector dose had been reached for AAV2/2 hRPE65, an optimised therapeutic vector (AAV2/5-OPTIRPE65) has been developed to drive higher transgene expression levels. (Professor Robin Ali and Prof James Bainbridge - unpublished data). In preparation for human clinical trials, a detailed prospective phenotypic study will be undertaken to investigate the natural history of RPE65-LCA. Such a study will help identify suitable patients for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore through greater phenotyping an optimal window for intervention and specific parameters to help quantify effect and identify clinical end points may have been ascertained .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Natural History Study of Patients With Leber Congenital Amaurosis Associated With Mutations in RPE65</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Researchers have been very successful in the continued studies with previously ascertained subjects. Further patients already on the MEH genetic database will also be recruited. Given the rarity of LCA-RPE65 the investigators will also potentially recruit patients referred to Moorfields Hospital by consultants around the World. Subjects will be assessed annually for a total of up to 5 years follow-up. Recruitment target is approximately 15 to 25 genetically confirmed patients. Assessments that will be undertaken depending on age, co-operation and ability to undertake the test include (see schedule of assessments): 8.1 Complete clinical ocular examination, including visual acuity testing (for near and distance), contrast sensitivity, anterior segment slit lamp examination and posterior segment slit lamp examination. 8.2 Colour fundus photography. 8.3 SDOCT imaging. In order to ensure a good volume scan minimal oversampling will be performed but undertake sufficient B scans per volume (n=128). The investigators will then do high-resolution line scans with oversampling, 1 horizontal and 1 vertical, through the centre of the fovea. 8.4 Adaptive optics imaging. 8.5 Electrophysiological assessment incorporating the protocols recommended by the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV). Full-field electroretinogram (FFERG) - a measure of global retinal function - will not be undertaken if previously documented to be undetectable - the majority of patients will have undetectable FFERG. Pattern ERG (PERG) and multifocal ERG (mfERG) will be undertaken on an annual basis to determine change in central retinal function over time (often residual central function till late in disease) - but will not be repeated once found to be undetectable. 8.6 Visual Field Testing. The Octopus 900 perimeter will be used. Static full-field testing will be undertaken employing the GATE strategy, and size V test targets. Further analysis will be undertaken to model the entire hill-of-vision which will enhance the information obtained with full-field static perimetry. 8.7 Mesopic and Scotopic Microperimetry. 8.8 Colour vision testing. 8.9 Vision guided mobility. This will be assessed by measuring the ability of each subject to navigate a simple route in a range of controlled illuminances. 8.10 Quality of Life Questionnaire. 8.11 Blood tests. Molecular confirmation of a mutation within the RPE65 gene by an accredited laboratory may be undertaken. Specific Aims of the study Perform detailed phenotyping, including autofluorescence imaging, microperimetry, AO and OCT imaging, spectral sensitivity and visual field testing, both in previously ascertained patients and newly identified subjects. Obtain OCT and AO images using the latest high-resolution technology in order to gain insights into the in vivo retinal structure and compare these with the functional data obtained Thereby establish well-characterised cohorts of individuals with RPE65-LCA. To use the information gained to provide more accurate advice to patients and assist in identifying potential participants, time points to intervene, and efficacy endpoints that may be used in planned interventions.</detailed_description>
