	<brief_title>Study of S-649266 or Best Available Therapy for the Treatment of Severe Infections Caused by Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative Pathogens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to provide evidence of efficacy of S-649266 in the treatment of serious infections in adult patients with either hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)/ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)/healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI), or bloodstream infections (BSI)/sepsis caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogens.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with clinically documented infection (HAP/VAP/HCAP, cUTI, or BSI/sepsis) caused by a Gramnegative pathogen with evidence of carbapenem resistance Patients who have been treated previously with an empiric antibiotic regiment and failed treatment, both clinically and microbiologically, are eligible for the study, if they have an identified carbapenemresistant Gramnegative pathogen which has either been shown to be nonsusceptible in vitro to each of the antibiotic(s) of the empiric antibiotic regimen or been grown from a culture performed after at least two days of the empiric antibiotic regimen Patient is male (no contraception required) or female and meets one of the following criteria: Surgically sterile by hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy or tubal ligation for the purpose of contraception for at least 6 weeks with appropriate documentation of such surgery Postmenopausal (defined as older than 45 years of age with cessation of regular menstrual periods for 6 months and confirmed by a folliclestimulating hormone level of &gt; 40 mIU/ml, or amenorrhea for at least 12 months) Of childbearing potential and using combined (estrogen and progestogen) or progestogenonly hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (including oral, intravaginal, injectable, implantable, and transdermal contraceptives), or an intrauterine device (IUD), or intrauterine hormonereleasing system (IUS) for the entire duration of the study Of childbearing potential and practice abstinence as a preferred and usual lifestyle, and agrees to continue practicing abstinence from screening up to 14 days after the last dose of study drug Of childbearing potential, whose sole heterosexual partner has been successfully vasectomized and agrees to not have other heterosexual partners for the entire duration of the study Patients meeting specific criteria for each infection site 1. Patients who have a documented history of any moderate or severe hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to any βlactam (Note: for βlactams, a history of a mild rash followed by uneventful reexposure is not a contraindication to enrollment) 2. Patients who need more than 3 systemic antibiotics as part of best available therapy (BAT) for the treatment of the Gramnegative infection (patients with mixed Grampositive or anaerobic infections may receive appropriate concomitant narrow spectrum antibiotics [eg, vancomycin, linezolid, metronidazole, clindamycin]) 3. Patients with coinfection caused by invasive aspergillosis, mucormycosis or other highly lethal mold 4. Patients who have central nervous system (CNS) infection (eg, meningitis, brain abscess, shunt infection) 5. Patients with infection requiring &gt; 3 weeks of antibiotic treatment (eg, bone and joint infection, endocarditis) 6. Patients with cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis 7. Patients in refractory septic shock defined as persistent hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation or despite vasopressive therapy at the time of Randomization 8. Patients with severe neutropenia, ie, polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) &lt; 100 cells/μL 9. Female patients who have a positive pregnancy test at Screening or who are lactating 10. Patients with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score &gt; 30 11. Patients who have received a potentially effective antibiotic regimen for the carbapenemresistant Gramnegative infection for a continuous duration of more than 24 hours in cUTI, or 36 hours in HAP/VAP/HCAP or BSI/sepsis during the 72 hours leading to Randomization 12. Patients with any condition or circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the safety of the patient or the quality of the study data 13. Patients requiring continuing treatment with methotrexate, procainamide, or probenecid 14. Patients who have received another investigational drug or device within 30 days prior to study entry 15. Patients who have previously been randomized in this study or received S649266 16. Patients receiving peritoneal dialysis 17. Patients meeting specific exclusion criteria for each infection site</criteria>
