	<brief_summary>Patients admitted for autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, induction-remission chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplasia or acute lymphoid leukemia, or to receive immunosuppressive therapy for aplastic anemia will be screened with dermatologic examination. In the presence of any skin lesion in the extremities, direct exam and fungal culture will be performed. If these exams indicate the presence of Fusarium species, patients will receive anti-mold azole prophylaxis</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients admitted for autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, induction-remission chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplasia or acute lymphoid leukemia, or to receive immunosuppressive therapy for aplastic anemia will be screened on admission. Patients may be included more than once, provided that a new treatment is administered and &gt;30 days elapses from one to other admission (episode). Screening will consist of a thorough physical examination in the extremities. In case of a skin lesion, direct exam and fungal culture will be performed. Nail samples will be obtained by scrapping the nails with a curette, and samples from interdigital areas will be obtained using swabs. In a first phase no intervention will be performed. In a second phase, if direct exam and /or culture indicate the presence of Fusarium spp., primary antifungal therapy with an anti-mold azole (voriconazole (200 mg BID) or posaconazole (200 mg TID) will be started. Patients will be followed until discharge. The primary endpoint is invasive fusariosis, comparing the observational period with the intervention period.</detailed_description>
