	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center phase III randomized controlled study, designing to access whether the efficacy of EGFR-TKI alone on patients with brain metastasis from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR mutant type is not inferior to EGFR-TKI concurrent with whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), the primary end point is intracranial PFS (iPFS), while secondary outcomes included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), evaluation of cognitive function, quality of life (QoL) and adverse events.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients who was confirmed nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by histology or cytology, harboring EGFR mutant type (19 and/or 21 exon mutation). Patients who was confirmed with asymptomatic, treatment naive brain metastasis (didn't receive any treatment after diagnosed with brain metastasis) by MRI, couldn't receive operation or stereotactic radiosurgery（SRS）. Appraisable disease, that is there must be at least one lesion with the longest diameter&gt;10mm in brain (by brain MRI). Adult patients (18 to 75 years old). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group（ECOG） performance status 0 to 2. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. Haemoglobin &gt; 10g/dl, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1.5 x 10^9/L, platelets &gt; 100 x 10^9/L; total bilirubin &lt; 1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN). Alanine aminotransferase（ALT） and aspartate aminotransferase（AST）&lt; 1.5x ULN in the absence of liver metastases, or &lt; 5x ULN in case of liver metastases. Creatinine clearance &gt; 60ml/min (calculated according to Cockcroftgault formula). Patients should be contraceptive during the period of the trial. Patients who had received brain radiotherapy or EGFRTKI before. Patients who can't receive WBRT. Uncontrolled intracranial hypertension after steroid or dehydration therapy. Patients who take phenytoin, Carbamazepine, Rifampicin, Barbital, or St John's Wort which will interfere with the metabolism of TKI. Patients with interstitial lung disease, significant ocular disease, or serious uncontrolled systematic disease. Patients who can't take oral tablets, with active peptic ulcer diseases. Pregnancy or breastfeeding women.</criteria>
