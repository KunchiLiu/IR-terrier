	<brief_summary>To assess the equivalence of MYL-1401A to Humira® with regards to efficacy in subjects with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MYL-1401A Efficacy and Safety Comparability Study to Humira®</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned based on predefined stratification factors of weight, geographic region, and presence of psoriatic arthritis: Randomization is 2:1 to MYL-1401A or Humira®, respectively. The study will be conducted in the outpatient setting and comprises 3 periods: a screening period of up to 4 weeks, a 52-week treatment period, and a safety follow-up for 8 weeks. A subject will be considered to have completed the study once they have completed the 52-week treatment period and the 8-week follow-up visit.</detailed_description>

Subject has had moderatetosevere chronic plaque psoriasis for at least 6 months Subject has involved BSA ≥10%, PASI ≥12, and sPGA ≥3 (moderate) at Screening and at Baseline 4. Subject has had stable disease for at least 2 months (i.e. without significant changes as defined by the investigator) 5. Subject is a candidate for systemic therapy 6. Subject has had a previous failure, inadequate response, intolerance, or contraindication to at least 1 conventional antipsoriatic systemic therapy 7. Subject is naïve to adalimumab therapy, approved or investigational 8. For females of childbearing potential, a negative serum pregnancy test during Screening and a negative urine pregnancy test at Baseline 1. Subject diagnosed with erythrodermic psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, guttate psoriasis, medicationinduced psoriasis, other skin conditions (e.g. eczema), or other systemic autoimmune disorder inflammatory disease at the time of the screening visit that would interfere with evaluations of the effect of the study treatment on psoriasis 2. Subject has used any of the following medications within specified time periods or will require their use during the study: Topical medications within 2 weeks before the end of the screening period oral psoralen with ultraviolet A (PUVA) phototherapy and/or ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy within 4 weeks before the end of the screening period Nonbiologic systemic therapies within 4 weeks before the end of the screening period (e.g. cyclosporine, methotrexate, and acitretin) Any prior or concomitant adalimumab therapy, approved or investigational Any other investigational agent within 90 days or 5 halflives of Screening (whichever is longer) Any systemic steroid in the 4 weeks before the end of the screening period Note: Lowpotency topical corticosteroids applied to the palms, soles, face, and intertriginous areas are permitted during study participation 3. Subject has received live vaccines during the 4 weeks prior to Screening or has the intention of receiving a live vaccine at any time during the study 4. Subject has a positive test for tuberculosis (TB) during Screening or a known history of active or latent TB, except documented and complete adequate treatment of TB or initiation (&gt;1 month) of adequate prophylaxis of latent TB, with an isoniazidbased regimen Subjects with a positive purified protein derivative (PPD) and a history of Bacillus CalmetteGuérin vaccination are allowed with a negative Interferonγ release assays (IGRA) Subjects with a positive PPD test without a history of Bacillus CalmetteGuérin vaccination or subjects with a positive or indeterminate IGRA are allowed if they have all of the following: No symptoms or signs of active TB, including a negative chest xray within 3 months prior to the first dose of study treatment Documented history of completion of adequate treatment of TB or initiation (&gt;1 month) of adequate prophylaxis of latent TB, with an isoniazidbased regimen prior to receiving study treatment in accordance with local recommendations 5. Underlying condition (including, but not limited to metabolic, hematologic, renal, hepatic, pulmonary, neurologic, endocrine, cardiac, infectious, or gastrointestinal) which, in the opinion of the investigator, significantly immunocompromises the subject and/or places the subject at unacceptable risk for receiving an immunomodulatory therapy 6. Subject has a planned surgical intervention during the duration of the study except those related to the underlying disease and which, in the opinion of the investigator, will not put the subject at further risk or hinder the subject's ability to maintain compliance with study treatment and the visit schedule 7. Subject has an active and serious infection or history of infections as follows: Any active infection: For which nonsystemic antiinfectives were used within 4 weeks prior to randomization. Requiring hospitalization or systemic antiinfectives within 8 weeks prior to randomization Recurrent or chronic infections or other active infection that, in the opinion of the investigator, might cause this study to be detrimental to the subject Invasive fungal infection or mycobacterial infection Opportunistic infections, such as listeriosis, legionellosis, or pneumocystis 8. Subject is positive for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus antibody or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or is positive for hepatitis B core antibody and negative for HBsAg at Screening 9. Subject has a history of clinically significant hematological abnormalities, including cytopenias (e.g. thrombocytopenia, leukopenia) 10. Subject has severe progressive or uncontrolled, clinically significant disease that in the judgment of the investigator renders the subject unsuitable for the study 11. Subject has history of malignancy within 5 years except adequately treated cutaneous squamous or basal cell carcinoma, in situ cervical cancer or in situ breast ductal carcinoma 12. Subject has active neurological disease such as multiple sclerosis, GuillainBarré syndrome, optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, or history of neurologic symptoms suggestive of central nervous system demyelinating disease 13. Subject has moderatetosevere heart failure (New York Heart Association class III/IV) 14. Subject has a history of hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients of Humira® or MYL1401A 15.
