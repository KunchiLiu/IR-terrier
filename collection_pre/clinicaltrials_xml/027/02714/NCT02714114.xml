	<detailed_description>In total 57 women will be included in this trial: 38 vaccinated with an prophylactic HPV vaccine and 19 not vaccinated with a prophylactic HPV vaccine. These women are asked to collect a first-void urine sample with the Colli-PeeTM device (Novosanis). Hereafter, a blood sample of 5-10 cc is collected. The collected urine and blood samples will be used for the development and optimisation of robust analytical protocols for sample preparation and antibody assays.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Female 1826 year Cases (n=38): healthy women, fully vaccinated, i.e. receiving all three doses of the bivalent (Cervarix®) or quadrivalent (Gardasil®) HPV vaccine (according to the KCE (Belgian Knowledge Centre for Health) recommendations: age at first vaccination between 1025 years for the bivalent and 926 years for the quadrivalent vaccine). Cases should be able to prove their vaccination (brand and schedule) with an official document. Control group (n=19): healthy women, selfreported to be not previously vaccinated with a single dose of any prophylactic HPV vaccine available (Gardasil®, Cervarix®, Gardasil9®) Signing informed consent form (ICF). Giving consent to the research team (CEV) to contact his/her general practioner and/or gynaecologist to access details of the participants HPV vaccination (schedule) and results of cervical smears/cytology, HPV tests, colposcopy, and biopsy (included in ICF). Participating in another clinical study at the same time of participating in this study. Not able to understand the information brochure/what the study is about Anything in the opinion of the investigator that would prevent volunteers from completing the study or put the volunteer at risk.</criteria>
