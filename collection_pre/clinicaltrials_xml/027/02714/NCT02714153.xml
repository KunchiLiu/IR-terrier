	<brief_title>Bridge Occlusion Balloon in Lead Extraction Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate the use of an occlusion balloon (Bridge™ Occlusion Balloon, Spectranetics) within the Superior Vena Cava in lead extraction patients. This will be performed in a non-emergent setting to allow for evaluation of how best to integrate this new technology into the investigators clinical practice. The study will focus on the effect of the Bridge balloon on the patient preparation clinical workflow, ease of insertion/positioning/deployment, and the ability to recognize proper inflation and vein sealing under fluoroscopy. Understanding these factors will help build a more robust clinical workflow with the goal of better patient outcomes in the case of an Superior Vena Cava injury. The images and data generated during this study can help in dissemination of the practical use knowledge to fellow lead extractors.</detailed_description>
