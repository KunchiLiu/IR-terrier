	<brief_summary>Mechanical ventilation (MV) if a life-support treatment for critically ill patients that can develop adverse effects. Patient-ventilator asynchronies can be present from the beginning of MV, it can be associated with poor outcome and it can develop clinical changes. The aim of this study is to evaluate if the knowledge of the presence of asynchronies by the healthcare team can help to reduce its incidence, improving outcomes of critically ill patients. A prospective, single-center, before and after study will be conducted in the ICU of Hospital de Sabadell. The study will have 2 phases: a first observational period where the incidence of asynchronies will be assessed, and a second period where a daily information of the presence of asynchronies to the healthcare team will be done with the aim to reduce the incidence. A continous record of asynchronies and clinical variables will be done during ICU stay.</brief_summary>
