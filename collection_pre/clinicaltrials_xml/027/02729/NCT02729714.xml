	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if the study drug, suvorexant, is safe and effective in treating symptoms of insomnia in people with Parkinson's Disease. It is anticipated that a total of 20 subjects, 30 to 80 years of age, with Parkinson's Disease and symptoms of insomnia will participate in the study at this site</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of Suvorexant for Insomnia in Parkinson Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of suvorexant specifically in a cohort of 20 Parkinson's Disease patients between the ages of 30 and 80 (inclusive) who have a complaint of insomnia. After informed consent is given, potential subjects will be screened to ensure they meet eligibility criteria. This will include an overnight polysomnogram, which will serve both as a baseline and a screening polysomnogram. Active drug will be suvorexant 10 mg orally at bed time with an optional up-titration to 15 mg orally at bedtime after 2 weeks. The first treatment period will be 4 weeks long, in which subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive active drug or matching placebo. At the end of treatment period 1, subjects will undergo efficacy assessment with repeat polysomnogram and clinical scales. This will be followed by a 2-week washout period with placebo; this period only will be single-blinded, as subjects only will be blinded to treatment. Subjects will then be crossed over into the alternate treatment group, which will once again be double-blinded; those on active treatment for period 1 will be switched to placebo, and those on placebo in period 1 will be switched to active treatment. Treatment period 2 will also be 4 weeks long, and at the end of this, subjects will undergo final assessment with polysomnogram and clinical scales.</detailed_description>
