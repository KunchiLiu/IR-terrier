	<brief_summary>Balloon predilatation of the aortic valve has been regarded as an essential step during the transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedure. However, recent evidence suggested that aortic valvuloplasty may be harmful and that high success rate may be obtained without prior dilatation of the valve. We hypothesize that TAVI performed without predilatation and using new generation balloon expandable prothesis is associated with a better net clinical benefit in comparison with procedure performed with pre dilatation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TAVI Without Balloon Predilatation (of the Aortic Valve ) SAPIEN 3</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is now the standard of care for inoperable patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and an accepted alternative to surgery for high-risk patients. Despite a high procedure success rate (&gt; 95%), TAVI remained associated with complications directly related to the technique (stroke, aortic regurgitation, vascular access bleeding) or to co morbidities frequently associated with aortic valve disease in elderly and frail patients. Reducing periprocedural complications is thereby the key for the future use of TAVI in lower-risk patients. Methods/design The transcatheter aortic valve implantation without prior balloon dilatation (DIRECTAVI) trial is a randomized controlled open label trial that include 240 patients randomized to TAVI performed with prior balloon dilatation of the valve (control arm) or direct implantation of the valve (test arm). The trial tests the hypothesis that the strategy of direct implantation of the balloon expandable SAPIEN 3 prosthesis is non-inferior to current medical practice using predilatation of the valve. The primary endpoint is related to immediate procedural success criteria and secondary end points include complications at 30-day follow-up (VARC 2 criteria). A subgroup analysis evaluates neurological ischemic events with cerebral MRI imaging (25 patients in each strategy group) performed before and after the procedure. In conclusion, we hope that the study will provide robust evidence of safety and efficiency of TAVI performed without prior dilatation of the aortic valve using the balloon expandable SAPIEN 3 THV and will allow the interventional cardiologist to use this strategy in everyday practice.</detailed_description>
