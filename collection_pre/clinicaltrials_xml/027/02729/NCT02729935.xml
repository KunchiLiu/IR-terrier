	<brief_summary>Catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD) is defined as an urge to void or discomfort in the supra-pubic region; reported postoperatively in patients who have had urinary catheterization intra-operatively. In the present study, the investigators evaluated Parecoxib (P) for preventing CRBD in patients undergoing catheterization after transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants will be randomized into one of two study groups: Group P: 40 mg of intravenous parecoxib 30 min before surgery and Control Group C: an equal volume of saline. Lumber subarachnoid block was administered with 2 ml 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine and 2.5 Âµg Sufentanyl. Intra-operatively, urinary catherization was performed with a 16 Fr Foley's catheter, and the balloon was inflated with 10 ml distilled water. The CRBD was assessed at 0, 1, 2, and 6 h after patient's arrival in the post-anaesthesia care unit. Severity of CRBD was graded as none, mild, moderate and severe.</detailed_description>
