	<brief_summary>The aim of this randomized trial was to compare the degree of surgical smoke obstructing vision and thermal damage caused by two different ESDs (ultrasonic versus monopolar ESD) in colpotomy during total laparoscopic hysterectomy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasonic Versus Monopolar Energy-based Surgical Device in Colpotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According to previous studies performed in porcine and bovine tissues, ultrasonic energy based surgical devices (ESDs) created less surgical smoke, involved less visual obstruction, and produced less lateral thermal damage than monopolar ESDs. However, there was no study comparing ultrasonic ESD and monopolar ESD in laparoscopic colpotomy in terms of surgical smoke and lateral thermal damage. Therefore, the aim of this randomized trial was to compare the degree of surgical smoke obstructing vision and thermal damage caused by two different ESDs (ultrasonic versus monopolar ESD) in colpotomy during total laparoscopic hysterectomy.</detailed_description>
