	<brief_title>Efficacy of Tolvaptan on ADPKD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In response to the results of the Tolvaptan Efficacy and Safety in Management of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease and Its Outcomes (TEMPO 3:4), the use of tolvaptan has been approved in Japan since March 2014 to treat autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). In March 2015, tolvaptan was approved by the Canadian Government, European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). Additionally, approval in European countries is anticipated. Kyorin University Hospital started administering tolvaptan to patients in May 2014. As the dosing conditions in the clinical setting are different from those in the TEMPO study, this will enable the investigation of factors that were not addressed in the TEMPO study. A longitudinal clinical study to investigate the changes before and after administration of tolvaptan in patients whose clinical course is monitored prior to the approval of tolvaptan will employ a method different from that used in the TEMPO study. The proposed clinical study should ideally be conducted jointly by multiple centers. However, since April 2014, only a few hospitals have employed the volumetric method using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure total kidney volume (TKV). Also, very few hospitals adopted the volumetric method to measure TKV prior to approval. Consequently, this study is to be performed solely by Kyorin University. This is a prospective comparative study "to investigate the therapeutic effect before and after administering tolvaptan to patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease" based on the "Ethical Guidelines for Medical and Health Research Involving Human Subjects" promulgated on December 22, 2014 by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. The study includes ADPKD patients who participated in the preceding studies conducted by Kyorin University School of Medicine Urology Department, ADPKD Research Section, and the Radiology Department (prospective, retrospective studies).</detailed_description>
