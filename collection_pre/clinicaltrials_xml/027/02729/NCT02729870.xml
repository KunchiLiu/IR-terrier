	<brief_title>Oral Glucose Intervention for Children With Gastroenteritis and Ketosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More than 1.7 million children with acute gastroenteritis present for emergency department (ED) care annually in the United States. Gastroenteritis treatment regimens have been outlined in guidelines endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics, European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN), and Center for Disease Control (CDC). A fundamental principle included in these guidelines is the administration of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to the vast majority of children with gastroenteritis; however, surveys have shown that a gap exists between guidelines and practice. Fasting ketoacidosis is an increasingly recognized metabolic derangement for children presenting with symptoms suggestive of gastroenteritis and mild to moderate dehydration. Ketoacidosis frequently occurs and likely adds comorbid symptoms of lethargy, vomiting, and malaise. These symptoms likely impair successful oral rehydration interventions. These symptoms may also lead to overestimations of the severity of dehydration. Rapid recognition of ketoacidosis is now possible with point of care testing beta-hydroxybutyrate. This investigation will determine if an oral glucose gel intervention will improve the Point Of Care (POC) beta-hydroxybutyrate from baseline. Secondary outcomes measured will include net fluid volume intake estimates, need for IV hydration, and need for hospitalization.</detailed_description>
