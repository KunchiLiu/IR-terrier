	<brief_summary>This study evaluates oral antimicrobial agents for the treatment of non-bacteremic acute urinary tract infection caused by Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase producing Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae in Post-kidney transplantation. Patients are treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics follow by oral sitafloxacin or IV ertapenem.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sitafloxacin and Ertapenem Treatment for Acute Urinary Tract Infection Caused by E. Coli or K. Pneumoniae in Post-kidney Transplantation Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective randomized controlled trial of patients with a presumptive diagnosis of acute urinary tract infection caused by Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase-producing Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae in Post-kidney transplantation. Intravenous (IV) antibiotic is initially given to all patients. After day 3, patients were randomized to receive either oral sitafloxacin (100 mg twice daily) or intravenous ertapenem. The course of treatment will complete within 14 days.</detailed_description>
