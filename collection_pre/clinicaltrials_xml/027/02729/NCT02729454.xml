	<brief_summary>Introduction Although drug therapy is the mainstay of treatment for Parkinson's disease, the therapy also has its importance by means of exercises which maintains the muscular activity and preserve mobility. One of the techniques that has been used for physical therapy is the mental practice of the mental simulation of movement, aiming at learning or improvement of motor skills through the cortex areas of activation responsible for the movement of preparation before it is executed. In patients with Parkinson's disease motor anticipation this system is compromised, culminating in the march changes and increased risk of falls. Objective: To evaluate the effects of mental practice on physical therapy on the march and the risk of falls in people with Parkinson's disease. Method: The study is defined as a randomized clinical trial with systematic recruitment. Recruitment will be conducted at the Clinic of Neurology, Hospital das clinics Federal University of Pernambuco (Pro-Parkinson Project: Neurology) and the intervention will be held at the same hospital physiotherapy clinic. Both the control group and the trial will be subjected to 15 therapy sessions twice a week, lasting 40 minutes for physical therapy and 15 for mental practice.</brief_summary>
