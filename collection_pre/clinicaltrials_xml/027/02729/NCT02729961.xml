	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of ceritinib when given together with brentuximab vedotin to see how well they work in treating treatment-naive patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Ceritinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as brentuximab vedotin, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving ceritinib together with brentuximab vedotin may be a better treatment for ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ceritinib With Brentuximab Vedotin in Treating Patients With ALK-Positive Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To define a dose of ceritinib administered concurrently with brentuximab vedotin that has an acceptable toxicity profile (based on dose-limiting toxicity [DLT] rate) and sufficient efficacy (based on response rate) among patients with treatment-naive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), ALK-positive. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the antitumor activity of ceritinib and brentuximab vedotin combination in treatment-naive patients with ALCL, ALK-positive. II. To assess the utility of the molecular marker of ALCL, ALK-positive in patient's plasma before, during and after therapy for disease risk assessment and post-treatment monitoring. OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of ceritinib followed by a phase II study. Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive ceritinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 8-21 of course 1 and on days 1-21 for all subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 17 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months up to 3 years.</detailed_description>

highly effective methods of contraception include: Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject; periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment; in case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment Male sterilization (at least six months prior to screening) with the appropriate postvasectomy documentation of absence of sperm in the ejaculate;
