	<brief_summary>Growing evidence supports the use of inhaled cannabis for neuropathic pain; the lack of standard inhaled dosing holds a major obstacle in cannabis becoming a pharmacological treatment for neuropathic pain. The objective of this study is to explore the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and ease of use of a portable metered-dose inhaler, (i.e. CannaHALER) for cannabis in a cohort of 12 healthy volunteers. In a single escalating dose methodology, open-label study, patients will inhale a single 10 ± 0.1 mg / 15 ± 0.1 mg / 20 ± 0.1 mg / 25 ± 0.1 mg dose of cannabis using the Kite Systems cannaHALER cannabis Inhaler device. Blood samples will be taken at baseline and up to 30 minutes. Adverse events will be monitored following the inhalation.</brief_summary>
