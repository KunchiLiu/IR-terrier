	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn whether daily use of Duavee速 is accepted and tolerated by peri- and post-menopausal women at moderate risk for development of breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study of the Effect of Duavee速 on Benign Breast Tissue Proliferation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Duavee速 is tissue specific estrogen complex of bazedoxifene plus conjugated estrogen which is FDA approved for relief of menopausal symptoms and prevention of osteoporosis in women with a uterus who have not been diagnosed with estrogen dependent neoplasia. The overall purpose of this research is to demonstrate in a preliminary fashion that despite reduction in menopausal symptoms, (Duavee速) does not increase and may decrease proliferation in benign breast tissue in a cohort of peri- or post-menopausal women at moderately increased risk for breast cancer. If this pilot shows rapid accrual, good retention, and lack of significant increase in the risk biomarker Ki-67 in benign breast tissue, a larger prevention trial is envisioned</detailed_description>
