	<brief_summary>Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is multi-pad system that allows fast optimization of stimulation patterns for achieving strong dorsiflexion/plantar flexion and automatic real-time control of ankle joint during FES assisted walking. The main aim of the present study is to compare the effects of functional electrical stimulation gait training after stroke and overground conventional physical therapy. With the assumption that the advanced method of functional electrical stimulation will improve gait parameters and functionality in patients with foot drop before and after FES treatment the objectives of this study are to examine the effects of functional electrical stimulation using FES:a method on indicators of walk and function in patients with foot drop before and after FES treatment.</brief_summary>
