	<brief_summary>The natural history of brain affection in myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2 is still unknown. The investigators designed a 5-year longitudinal neuropsychological and neuroimaging follow-up study to address this issue. Myotonic dystrophy type 1, myotonic dystrophy type 2 patients, and healthy controls were enrolled. All participants undergo clinical-neurological examinations, neuropsychological analyses according to a 13-item neuropsychological test battery, and 3T-brain MRI including voxel-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging at baseline and at follow-up using identical examination protocols.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tracking the Brain in Myotonic Dystrophies: a 5-year Longitudinal Follow-up Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is unknown whether brain affection in myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2 is due to neurodevelopmental defects, neurodegeneration, or both. An exact definition of the nature and dynamic of brain affection is of urgent need for the identification of clinical trial outcome parameters and the design of therapy compounds. The investigators planned a 5-year longitudinal study to examine the natural history of functional and structural brain affection. Myotonic dystrophy type 1, myotonic dystrophy type 2 patients, and healthy controls were enrolled. All participants undergo clinical-neurological examinations, neuropsychological analyses according to a 13-item neuropsychological test battery, and 3T-brain MRI at baseline and at follow-up using identical examination protocols. The intended time span between baseline and follow-up examinations is 5 years minimum. To investigate gray and white matter affection, voxel-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging are performed, and data are statistically analyzed including (i) group comparisons between patients and controls at baseline and follow-up, and (ii) group comparisons using difference maps to focus on isolated disease-related effects over time.</detailed_description>
