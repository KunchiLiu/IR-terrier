	<brief_summary>This single-arm,multicenter Phase 2 trial will treat the patients who have relapsed or refractory liver cancer with an infusion of the patient's own T cells that have been genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor(CAR)that will bind to tumour cells that express the EPCAM protein on the cell surface.The study will determine if these modified T cells help the body's immune system eliminate tumour cells.The trial will also study the safety of treatment with CAR-T,how long CAR-T cells stay in the patient's body and the impact of this treatment on survival.</brief_summary>
