	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the use of rapid tests for hematocrit and clotting function in women undergoing surgery for placenta accreta. Half of participants will have these rapid tests performed during surgery to guide blood product transfusion and the other half will have standard lab tests performed to guide transfusion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of ROTEM Intraoperatively in Women With Placenta Accreta</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Placenta accreta has become an increasingly common pregnancy complication. Serious complications are common in patients with placenta accreta, including hemorrhage, transfusion of blood products, abdominal organ injury, bladder surgery, and ICU admission. Hemorrhage, or excessive blood loss, is the most common complication and often results in impaired ability for the body to form blood clots normally. The development of rapid testing of hematocrit and clotting function may allow for earlier identification of patients who have severe blood loss and development of clotting abnormalities. The investigators are testing whether use of this technology in patients undergoing surgery for placenta accreta, with earlier identification of patients with severe blood loss or clotting abnormality, will result in a lower need for transfusion and fewer complications.</detailed_description>
