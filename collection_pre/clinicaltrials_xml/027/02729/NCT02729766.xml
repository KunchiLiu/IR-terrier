	<brief_summary>Empagliflozin (Jardiance)® is a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2)-Inhibitor, which is a new treatment option developed for patients with diabetes mellitus type 2. The SGLT2 is expressed in the proximal tubule and reabsorbs approximately 90 percent of the filtered glucose. The inhibition of SGLT2 results in renal excretion of glucose with subsequent osmotic diuresis. This mechanism could result in a therapeutic effect in patients with hypotonic hyponatremia as in the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion (SIAD). Because patients with SIAD usually have several comorbidities and different medications, studies investigating the physiological effects are difficult to interpret. Therefore a model to study the possible physiological effect of SGLT2-inhibitors in hypotonic hyponatremia as in SIAD is needed. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether empagliflozin (Jardiance)® has an effect on serum sodium levels of healthy volunteers with induced hypotonic hyponatremia.</brief_summary>
