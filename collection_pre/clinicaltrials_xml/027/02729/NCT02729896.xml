	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of obinutuzumab (G) + atezolizumab (Atezo) + polatuzumab vedotin (Pola) in participants with relapsed or refractory FL or DLBCL. The study will include an initial dose-escalation phase designed to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for polatuzumab vedotin in this treatment combination, followed by an expansion phase in which polatuzumab vedotin will be given at the RP2D. All participants will receive induction treatment with G + Atezo + Pola for 6 cycles. FL participants achieving a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) at the end of induction (EOI) and DLBCL participants achieving a CR or PR at EOI will be eligible to receive post-induction treatment with obinutuzumab + atezolizumab.</brief_summary>
