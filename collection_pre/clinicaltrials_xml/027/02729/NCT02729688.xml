	<brief_summary>Objective of this study are to compare the interface pressure by applying ordinary elastic bandage (OEB) and CPG-EB. In addition, investigators compared the percentage of patients who could apply the optimal pressure with OEB and CPG-EB.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of a Pressure Indicator Guided and a Conventional Bandaging in Treatment of Venous Leg Ulcer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For treatment of venous ulcer, it was shown that compression bandaging of 35-45 mmHg sub-bandage pressure at the ankle was shown in several studies to be safe and effective.The efficacy of compression bandage considerably depends on the applied pressure and it is therefore largely dependent on the individual applying bandages. The lower pressure leads to treatment failure while the higher pressure leads to skin complication. The use of objective devices to proof that the bandage is sufficiently applied is not available for every patients. To help the patients to apply the bandage with optimal pressure, investigators developed the customized pressure guide elastic bandage (CPG-EB) by using sub-bandage pressure guidance. Objective of this study are to compare the interface pressure by applying ordinary elastic bandage (OEB) and CPG-EB. In addition,investigators compared the percentage of inexperienced staffs who could apply the optimal pressure with OEB and CPG-EB.</detailed_description>
