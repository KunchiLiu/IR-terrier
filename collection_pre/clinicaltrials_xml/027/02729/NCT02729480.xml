	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of Wireless CranioFacial Nerve Stimulation (CFNS) for the Treatment of CranioFacial Neuropathic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be randomized at enrollment into either a delayed or immediate continuation group. The immediate continuation group will immediately continue with the stimulation after a 30-day trial period and will be monitored for a total of 12 months. The delayed activation group will have their device turned off after the 30-day trial period for the next 3-months. At the 3-month visit, both groups be evaluated and the delayed activation group will have their devices reactivated. Subjects will have neuropathic pain of various etiologies, including trauma, surgery or post-herpetic infections. Stimulators will be placed at the site target of the painful area, including the epifascial plane under the skin but above the muscles in the vicinity of the targeted branches of; A. Branches of Trigeminal Nerves in the Ophthalmic, Maxillary, or Mandibular B. Sensory branches of Facial Nerves C. Branches of the Occipital Nerves (Greater and/or Lesser) D. Branches of the Cervical Plexus (Superficial and/or Deep)</detailed_description>
