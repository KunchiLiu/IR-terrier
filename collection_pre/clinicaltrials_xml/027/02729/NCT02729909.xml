	<brief_title>Lubiprostone for Chronic Idiopathic Constipation Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called lubiprostone. Lubiprostone is being tested to treat people who have chronic idiopathic constipation. This study will look at the frequency of spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) in people who take lubiprostone compared to placebo. The study will enroll approximately 204 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) equally to one of the two treatment groups, which will remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need): - Lubiprostone 24 Î¼g - Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a capsule that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient All participants will be asked to take one capsule with breakfast and one capsule with dinner each day throughout the study. All participants will be asked to record each time they have a SBM and all details of each SBM (including the consistency of the stool and the difficulty they have in passing it) in a diary. This multi-center trial will be conducted in Mexico. The overall time to participate in this study is 8 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>
