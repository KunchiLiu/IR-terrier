	<brief_summary>Chronic low back pain is potentially disabling for the elderly, and physical exercises are considered the best treatment for this problem. The Pilates method has been proven effective in the improvement of pain and function in patients with low back pain. However, the evidence about the effectiveness of Pilates method in the treatment of elderly patients with low back pain is scarce. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of the Pilates method compared to aerobic exercise in elderly with chronic non-specific low back pain. This randomized controlled trial with two arms and blinded assessor will include 74 patients aged between 65 and 85 years, of both sexes, complaining of chronic non-specific low back pain persisting for more than three months and pain intensity greater than 3 points in the Pain Numerical Rating Scale. The elderly will be randomized into two groups: Pilates Group (n = 37) with exercises based on Pilates method; and Aerobic Group (n = 37) with aerobic exercises, stretching and relaxation. Both groups will hold treatment twice a week with duration of 60 minutes for eight weeks. The primary outcomes will be: pain intensity and general disability assessed eight weeks after randomization. Secondary outcomes will be: pain intensity and general disability evaluated six months after randomization; global impression of improvement, specific disability and dynamic balance, muscle strength of the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius and lateral hip rotators and pressure pain threshold evaluated eight weeks and six months after randomization. We expect that the results of this study contribute to the clinical decision-making with respect to pain reduction and, consequently, improving balance and functionality of elderly with chronic low back pain.</brief_summary>
