	<brief_summary>TP-0903 is a novel oral inhibitor that targets AXL kinase. Preclinical studies have shown promising antitumor activity of TP-0903 as a single agent against a variety of tumor types in both in vitro and in vivo studies. This first-in-human study is conducted to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of TP-0903 administered orally to patients with advanced solid tumors. The study will investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary anti-tumor activity profiles.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>First-in-human Study of Oral TP-0903 (a Novel Inhibitor of AXL Kinase) in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 1, first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic study of TP-0903 administered once daily for the first 21 out of 28 days. There are 2 stages in this study. In Stage 1, sequential cohorts of three (3) patients will be treated with escalated doses until the MTD is established. In the absence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), the dose will be increased using a modified Fibonacci dose escalation scheme. Once the MTD has been established, up to 10 additional patients may be enrolled at the MTD dose level for confirmation of safety (Stage 2). Patients who successfully complete a 4-week treatment cycle without evidence of significant treatment-related toxicity or progressive disease will be permitted to continue to receive treatment with the same dose and dosing schedule.</detailed_description>
