	<brief_summary>The scleral buckle surgery is an effective way in treating retinal detachment (RD) patients. Retrobulbar block has been proved effective in scleral buckle surgery. Though retrobulbar anesthesia saves operative time and money compared to general analgesia, the intraoperative pain is frequent and a proportion of postoperative pain is often ignored. Ketorolac has been demonstrated to be a preemptive analgesia in other diseases such as adenotonsillectomy, posterior lumbar spinal fusion, laser-assisted subepithelial keratectomy (LASEK), and so forth. The aim of the investigators study is to determine the safety and preemptive analgesic effect of ketorolac in the perioperative pain control of patients undergoing RD surgery under retrobulbar anesthesia.</brief_summary>
