	<brief_title>The Efficacy and Safety Study of Acupuncture for Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both Dong's extra-point acupuncture therapy and Diane-35 could improve the symptom of patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome, but until now there is no definite evidence to indicate acupuncture could play the same role in improving ovarian function. So we design this study to observe the change of follicular development, ovary size and sex hormone( testosterone, follitropin, luteinizing hormone) before and after the acupuncture treatment, and do the noninferiority comparison with Diane-35 to definite the efficacy and advantage of acupuncture.</detailed_description>
