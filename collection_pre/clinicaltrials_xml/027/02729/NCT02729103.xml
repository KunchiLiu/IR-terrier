	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate treatment patterns, mortality, healthcare resource utilization, and costs in patients with prostate cancer with bone metastases (primary objectives). Additionally, this study will evaluate opioid/analgesic use among lines of therapy in this patient population (secondary objective). The study is descriptive in nature and is meant to provide a greater understanding of the patterns of therapy observed in real-world clinical practice (in the absence of clear guideline recommendations with regards to treatment sequencing), to contribute to a greater understanding of the major cost drivers (thus better-informing payers), and to examine real-world mortality in such patients.</brief_summary>
