	<brief_summary>This study conducted in order to validate the functionality and accuracy of the smARTrack™ System in a real-life ICU setting. The smARTrack™ Feeding Tube System is a novel system with nasogastric tube developed by ART Healthcare Ltd, based on sensor-lined tubes that transmit real-time information to an external console. The smARTrack™ feeding tube is equipped with reflux sensors which alert when gastric contents regurgitating into the esophagus. In addition, the smARTrack™ feeding tube is equipped with sensors designed to provide information about the location of the tube thus assisting in reducing the incident of misplacement during first positioning. The smARTrack™ feeding tube is also automatically and in real-time stops feeding if the feeding tube moves out of position during ongoing use or detect gastric content in esophagus. Furthermore, smARTrack™ Feeding Tube System can guide operator to correctly re-position the tube.</brief_summary>
