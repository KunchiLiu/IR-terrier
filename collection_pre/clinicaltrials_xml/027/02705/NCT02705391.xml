	<brief_summary>We intend to investigate the clinical application of two emerging imaging modalities for which the technical capability is currently in place at Mayo Clinic. The treatment of Ewing Sarcoma (ES), Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patients on this study will involve multi-disciplinary contributions from nationally recognized sarcoma experts in Radiation Oncology, Radiology, Orthopedic Surgery, Pediatric Oncology, Medical Oncology and Pathology. Patients will undergo additional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at the same time as the standard imaging. The ability to compare several imaging modalities within a single cohort of patients maximizes the potential of the study to impact the future management of sarcoma patients. The collaborative nature of this study, with essential contributions from many departments will undoubtedly improve the coordinated care of sarcoma patients and naturally disseminate the advanced imaging experience that is acquired.</brief_summary>
