	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to perform a randomized trial comparing the use of the algorithm, with dosing of warfarin in standard manual dosage clinical practice, in a high quality anticoagulant setting (PSM). This is done for safety concerns and to ensure good performance of the algorithm when used in a clinical setup. The results from the study are expected to increase our knowledge of efficacy by using the algorithm in clinical practice.</brief_summary>
