	<brief_summary>This study is a Phase Ib/II open label, single arm, adaptive multi-centre trial of copanlisib in combination with trastuzumab in pretreated recurrent or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. Patients with HER2 positive, metastatic or incurable recurrent breast cancer, following disease progression during, or after, treatment with at least one systemic treatment regimen in the metastatic or recurrent setting, will be treated with copanlisib (at 30, 45 or 60 mg flat dosing IV weekly - depending on the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) determined in the Phase Ib part of the study) plus trastuzumab (4 mg/kg IV Cycle 1 Day 1 and then 2 mg/kg IV weekly starting from day 8).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase Ib/II Trial of coPANlisib in Combination With Trastuzumab in HER2-positive Breast Cancer. (Panther Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase Ib One of three dose levels of copanlisib is assigned at registration according to the dose escalation scheme. Phase II The copanlisib dose for the Phase II part of the trial will be based on the MTD established in the Phase Ib part of the study. Clinical and laboratory parameters will be assessed to evaluate disease response and toxicity of study therapy. Safety assessments will be performed throughout the study. Efficacy assessments (radiological examination) will be performed on all patients every 8 weeks for the first 24 weeks and every 12 weeks thereafter. Following baseline cardiac assessment, cardiac safety monitoring will include physical exam (with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification for patients with diagnosed congestive heart failure) during each cycle, Multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan or Echocardiogram (ECHO) and 12 lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) within 7 days of Day 1 of every third cycle starting at cycle 3 (Cycle 3, Cycle 6, etc.).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients are eligible to be included in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria: 1. Adult women ≥18 years of age with histologically confirmed, recurrent, or metastatic, HER2positive breast cancer. Eligible recurrent disease is recurrent disease that is considered incurable by the treating oncologist. Many local only recurrences are treated with curative intent; a treatment plan with curative intent for a local only recurrence would indicate that the patient is not eligible for this clinical trial. A local only recurrence must be considered incurable by the treating oncologist for the patient to be eligible. 2. Documented HER2 overexpression by local laboratory (IHC 3+ or FISH or CISH positive). 3. At least one measurable lesion according to RECIST criteria (Version 1.1). Patients with bone only disease are not eligible. 4. Patient has received at least one trastuzumab based or TDM1based treatment regimen in the setting of metastatic disease or incurable locoregional recurrence. A trastuzumab based or TDM1based treatment regimen is considered as any treatment regimen that includes trastuzumab or TDM1. Patients must have had at least 1 line of therapy for metastatic and/or incurable locoregional recurrent disease to be eligible. A patient is eligible regardless of the period of time from adjuvant therapy so long as she has disease that is progressing after at least 1 line of trastuzumabbased therapy in the setting of metastatic disease and/or incurable locoregional recurrence. 5. Disease progression during or following the most recent anticancer therapy. 6. ECOG performance status ≤2. 7. Life expectancy of at least 3 months. 8. Availability of fresh tissue and/or archival tumour tissue at screening. 9. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception when sexually active. This applies from signing of the informed consent form until at least 100 days after the last study drug administration. The investigator or a designated associate is required to advise the patient how to achieve an adequate birth control. Highly effective contraception is defined in the study as methods that achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. Such methods include: combined (oestrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal) progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable and implantable), intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine hormone releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal occlusion, successfully vasectomised partner and sexual abstinence. In addition, the use of condoms by patients or their partners is required unless the woman has had a hysterectomy. 10. Adequate baseline laboratory values collected no more than 14 days before starting study treatment: Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN (&lt;3 x ULN for patients with liver involvement). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤2.5 x ULN (≤5 x ULN for patients with liver involvement from breast cancer). Lipase ≤1.5 x ULN. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥30 mL/min/1.73m2 according to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) abbreviated formula. If not on target, this evaluation may be repeated once after at least 24 hours either according to the MDRD abbreviated formula or by 24 hour sampling. If the later result is within acceptable range, it may be used to fulfil the inclusion criteria instead. International normalized ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤1.5 x ULN. Patients who are therapeutically treated with an agent such as warfarin or heparin will be allowed to participate provided that no prior evidence of underlying abnormality in coagulation parameters exists. Close monitoring of these patients (Day 15 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of each cycle) will be performed until INR/PTT is stable based on a measurement that is predose as defined by the local standard of care. Platelet count ≥75 x 109/L. For patients with breast cancer bone marrow infiltration, platelet count ≥50 x 109/L. Haemoglobin (Hb) ≥8 g/dL. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1 x 109/L. For patients with malignant bone marrow infiltration, ANC count ≥0.75 x 109/L. Fasting blood glucose &lt;125 mg/dL (≤6.9 mmol/L) if not diabetic or &lt;160 mg/dL (≤8.9 mmol/L) if diabetic 11. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), above the Institutions lower limit of normal, as determined by ECHO or MUGA. 12. Patients must have recovered from clinically significant side effects associated with prior radiotherapy and chemotherapy. 5.1.1 Additional criteria for Phase II: 13. PIK3CA mutation confirmed by central laboratory. 14. Phase Ib subjects (who are confirmed PIK3CA mutation carriers) must have been treated at the MTD in order to proceed with enrolment/registration to the Phase II study. Patients who meet any of the following criteria at the time of screening will be excluded from study registration: 1.
