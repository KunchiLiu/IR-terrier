	<brief_summary>This research project is relevant to the identification of the relationship, and its significance, between patient morality and a number of demographic, clinical and corporate characteristics. Two separate data sets have been compiled linking the existing intervention and employment data, one focusing on the admitting nurse and another one considering all the nurses involved in each intervention. Several statistical experiments will take place to support or reject the main hypothesis: higher nurse education, satisfaction and staffing levels result to lower patient mortality.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nurse Graduateness and Patient Outcomes: a Cross Sectional Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary research objective is to investigate the relationship between the education, satisfaction and staffing level of the nurses and the mortality rate across HMC. The relationship between mortality will be investigated against some additional demographic characteristics of the patient and the nurses as well as a umber of clinical parameters like the length of stay and the severity of the interventions. To achieve that data will be retrospectively collected from the Human Resources database containing the nurse education and demographic information and will combine it to the intervention data coming from the clinical information systems of all major public hospitals in Qatar excluding accident and emergency cases to avoid confounding. Rigorous statistical analysis will be conducted to obtain the significance of this relationship within expected confidence intervals. The end result of that process is to find whether there is a significant positive or negative relationship between nurse education and mortality rate. For confounding purposes Accident and Emergency data have been excluded, we have performed several adjusted and unadjusted Logistic Regression tests and taking into consideration the clustering effect of the data.</detailed_description>
