	<brief_title>Video Based Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants will be enrolled at the VA Portland and have a baseline assessment. The baseline will assess neurological disorders (including Parkinsonism) and current stress. All participants will attend 10 weeks of mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) through video feed on the Portland VA campus. During the week prior to the first class and the week after the last class, participants will complete questionnaires regarding stress, collect saliva samples, and, for the Parkinson's patient, monitor motor symptoms of PD using diaries and inertial sensors. A final visit will assess stress, neurological diseases, and Parkinsonism.</detailed_description>
