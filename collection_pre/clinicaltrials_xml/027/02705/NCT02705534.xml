	<brief_summary>The investigators will treat 50 patients with cirrhosis due to hepatitis C genotype 1, with sofosbuvir 400 mg daily, ledipasvir 90 mg daily and weight-based ribavirin (1000 mg/d if &lt;75 kg, 1200 mg/d if &gt;75 kg, divided in two daily doses) for 12 weeks and calculate the sustained viral response rate at 12 weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sofosbuvir, Ledipasvir, Ribavirin for Hepatitis C Cirrhotics, Genotype 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cirrhosis due to Hepatitis C virus (HCV) presents a rather difficult treatment problem as many cannot tolerate interferon, the previous standard of care. The new direct acting antivirals have provided these patients with a new hope. One such combination is sofosbuvir (SOF) 400 mg and ledipasvir (LDV) 90 mg given once daily with or without weight-based ribavirin (RBV) for 12 or 24 weeks only for HCV genotype 1 patients. The current recommendation for cirrhotics (genotype 1) is SOF/LDV/RBV for 24 weeks but that recommendation is based on the lack of data for shorter periods. In order to evaluate the response rate to the combination of SOF/LDV/RBV the investigators decided to treat 50 HCV genotype 1 cirrhotics with this combination for 12 weeks. Patients with MELD score &gt; 20 are excluded. The investigators will calculate the sustained viral response rate at 12 weeks (SVR12).</detailed_description>
