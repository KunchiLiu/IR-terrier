	<brief_summary>A direct application of jejunal tube feeding is necessary especially in patients with gastroparesis due of existing diabetes mellitus, postoperative or severe underlying disease. Since the jejunal tube feedings, the secretion of gastric juice can be increased, the use of probes that allow both: jejunal nutrition, as well as a gastric outflow of secretions are beneficial. While in a randomized trial of Schwab et al. it could be shown that the use of Freka-Trilumina® compared to Dobbhoff probe by so-called drag technique is significantly faster there are currently no comparative data to use the Easy-In® probe subsequently developed , which is directly introduced through the working channel of the endoscope, and thus shortening the procedure time.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Two Endoscopically Placed Nasojejunal Probes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of probes nasojejunal has increasingly become important especially in critically ill patients because of the beneficial effect in patients e.g. with necrotizing pancreatitis, according trauma or major surgical procedures. A direct application of jejunal tube feeding is necessary especially in patients with gastroparesis due of existing diabetes mellitus, postoperative or severe underlying disease. Since the jejunal tube feedings, the secretion of gastric juice can be increased, the use of probes that allow both: jejunal nutrition, as well as a gastric outflow of secretions are beneficial. While in a randomized trial of Schwab et al. it could be shown that the use of Freka-Trilumina® compared to Dobbhoff probe by so-called drag technique is significantly faster there are currently no comparative data to use the Easy-In® probe subsequently developed , which is directly introduced through the working channel of the endoscope, and thus shortening the procedure time. In the presented study should be investigated to what extent the use of imported directly via the working channel Easy-Inn® probe, application time and thus the investigation period may be shortened compared to the usual nasojenunal probes.</detailed_description>
