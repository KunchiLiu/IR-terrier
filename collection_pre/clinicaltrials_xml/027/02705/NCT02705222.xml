	<brief_title>Comparison Between D&amp;C and Hysteroscopy in Management of AUB in Perimenopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Perimenopausal women complaining of abnormal uterine bleeding will be selected for assessment through detailed history taking, general and abdominal examination, local gynecological examination, transvaginal sonography (TVS) scanning and routine blood investigations. Eligible participants in our study will be those who complain of menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, polymenorrhoea or polymenorrhagia without local gynecological cause with failure of medical treatment for at least 3 months. All women participating in the study will be randomly allocated into two groups; dilatation and curettage (D&amp;C) group and hysteroscopy group. For women in the D&amp;C group, cervical dilatation and fractional endometrial curettage will be done under total intravenous (IV) anesthesia in operation theater and the curetting will be sent for histopathological examination. For women in the hysteroscopy group, hysteroscopy will be done under total IV anesthesia in operation theater hysteroscopic-guided curettings will also be taken and sent for histopathological examination.</detailed_description>
