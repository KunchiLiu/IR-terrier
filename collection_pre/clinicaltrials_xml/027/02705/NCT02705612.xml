	<brief_title>Phase II Clinical Trial of Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy Combined Nimotuzumab for Stage IIB-IVA Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For locally advanced cervical cancer, radical radiation with concurrent chemotherapy remains the standard treatment recommended by NCCN. However, in more than 35% of cases, tumor persistence recurrence or metastasis would occur after chemoradiation. Nimotuzumab, belongs to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, has proved to be useful in multiple solid tumors, such as NPC, colorectal cancer, etc. In recent years, nimotuzumab was also applied in recurrence or metastasis cervical cancer. It was proved to be well tolerated and might have a role in the treatment of advanced cervical cancer. However, there is no publication about nimotuzumab used in locally advanced cervical cancer.</detailed_description>
