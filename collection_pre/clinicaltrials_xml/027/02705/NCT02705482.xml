	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate MEDI0562 in Combination With Immune Therapeutic Agents in Adult Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1 multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and antitumor activity of MEDI0562 in combination with immune therapeutic agents in adult subjects with select advanced solid tumors.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must meet all of the following criteria: 1. Written and signed informed consent. 2. Age ≥ 18 years at the time of study entry. 3. Subjects must have received and have progressed, are refractory, or are intolerant to standard therapy appropriate for the specific tumor type. Subjects should not have received more than 3 prior lines of systemic therapy for recurrent or metastatic. 4. Subjects in the doseescalation phase, must have histologic documentation of advanced solid tumors, excluding primary CNS tumors and hematologic malignancies. 5. Subjects in the doseexpansion phase, must have histologic diagnosis of advanced relapsed or refractory solid tumors as specified in the protocol. 6. Subjects who have received prior therapy with regimens containing CTLA 4, PD L1, or PD 1 antagonists are permitted to enroll if additional protocol criteria are met. 7. Subjects must have at least 1 lesion that is measurable using RECIST guidelines. 8. Subjects must consent to provide archived tumor specimens for correlative biomarker studies. In the setting where archival material is unavailable or unsuitable for use, subjects must consent and undergo fresh tumor biopsy. 9. All subjects are encouraged to consent to and provide both pretreatment and on treatment tumor biopsies. 10. ECOG Performance score of 0 or 1 11. In the opinion of the investigator likely to complete ≥ 8 weeks of treatment. 12. Adequate hematologic, renal and hepatic function as determined by blood laboratory values. 13. At the time of Day 1 of the study, subjects with CNS metastases must have been treated and must be asymptomatic and meet the following: 1. No concurrent treatment, inclusive of, but not limited to surgery, radiation, and/or corticosteroids 2. At least 42 days without progression of CNS metastases as evidenced by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) after last day of treatment 3. At least 14 days since last dose of corticosteroids Note: Subjects with leptomeningeal disease or cord compression are excluded from the study. 14. Female subjects of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner must use at least 1 highly effective method of contraception from screening, and must agree to continue using such precautions for 180 days after the final dose of investigational product. 15. Nonsterilized male subjects who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must use male condom plus, if locally available, spermicide from Day 1 and for 180 days after receipt of the final dose of investigational product. Any of the following would exclude the subject from participation in the study: 1. Prior treatment with TNFRSF agonists including but not limited to OX40, CD27, CD137 (41BB), CD357, GITR 2. History of severe allergic reactions to any unknown allergens or any components of the study drug formulations 3. Active or prior documented autoimmune disease within the past 2 years. 4. Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study, unless it is an observational clinical study or the follow up period of an interventional study 5. Receipt of any conventional or investigational anticancer therapy not otherwise specified above within 28 days prior to the first dose of MEDI0562 and durvalumab or tremelimumab combination treatment; in the case of mAbs, 28 days or 5 half lives, whichever is shorter, prior to the first dose of MEDI0562 and durvalumab or tremelimumab combination treatment 6. Any concurrent chemotherapy, IMT, or biologic or hormonal therapy for cancer treatment. 7. Unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy. 8. Systemic therapeutic anticoagulation or daily aspirin dose exceeding 325 mg/per day. 9. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days prior to the first dose of MEDI0562. The following are exceptions to this criterion: 1. Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (e.g., intraarticular injection) 2. Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent 3. Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan premedication) 10. History of primary immunodeficiency, solid organ transplantation, or tuberculosis 11. Test results indicating active infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B or C defined by positive serologic testing and confirmatory viral nucleic acid testing 12. Receipt of live, attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to the first dose of investigational products. 13. Pregnant or breastfeeding women 14. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to first dose of MEDI0562 or still recovering from prior surgery. 15. Other invasive malignancy within 2 years except for noninvasive malignancies such as cervical carcinoma in situ, nonmelanomatous carcinoma of the skin or ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast that has/have been surgically cured 16. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase risk of incurring AEs from the combination of MEDI0562 and durvalumab or tremelimumab, or compromise the ability of the subject to give written informed consent. 17. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with evaluation of the investigational product or interpretation of subject safety or study results.</criteria>
