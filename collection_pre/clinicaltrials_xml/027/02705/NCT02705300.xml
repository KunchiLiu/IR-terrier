	<brief_summary>Treatment with FOLFOXIRI (5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, irinotecan) can be effective, but it has serious side effects, which may require hospitalization. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the addition of tocotrienol can reduce the side effects to FOLFOXIRI otherwise leading to hospitalization.</brief_summary>
