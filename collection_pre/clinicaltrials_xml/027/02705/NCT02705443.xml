	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to further clarify existing research on the early identification and documentation of suspected deep tissue injury (sDTI). Basic principles of physiology along with prior research suggests that sDTI has quantifiable amounts of heat (or lack thereof) relative to surrounding tissue that will exhibit characteristic thermal signatures (temperature). These signatures will be measured and quantitatively recorded using long-wave infrared thermography (LWIT) to not only identify sDTI, but to also learn more about their pathophysiological evolution. Additionally, the LWIT physiological data will be cross-compared to the gold standard of visual assessment and other current standards of wound evaluation.</brief_summary>
