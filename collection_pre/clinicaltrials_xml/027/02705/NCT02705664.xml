	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to compare subject adherence and satisfaction for two modes of treatment toenails infection (Onychomycosis) with Loceryl Nail Lacquer (Loceryl NL) and a Fungal Nail Treatment Set containing Urea 40% ointment (Urea) and Bifonazole cream 1% (Bifonazole).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Onychomycosis With Loceryl (Amorolfine) Nail Lacquer 5% Versus a Two-course Treatment With Urea 40% Ointment and Bifonazole Cream 1%</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 20 subjects are to be included in 1 site in Iceland Methodology: Subjects will receive following treatments on the right or left toenails: - Loceryl Nail Lacquer (Loceryl NL) to be applied once weekly for 7 weeks on all affected toenails of one foot (including great toenail) - Fungal Nail Treatment Set to be used on all affected toenails (including great toenail) of the opposite foot in two phases: - Phase I: Urea ointment (Urea) to be applied once a day under occlusion for 2-3 weeks depending on the achievement of optimal diseased toenail plates removal - Phase II: Bifonazole cream to (Bifonazole) be applied for 4 weeks on affected toenails (after the maximum 3-week treatment period with Urea ointment)</detailed_description>
