	<brief_title>Study of Mogamulizumab + Nivolumab in Subjects w/Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, Phase 1/2 open-label, dose-finding and cohort expansion study of the anti-CCR4 antibody mogamulizumab in combination therapy with the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab in adult subjects with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Phase 1 will identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the highest protocol-defined dose in absence of exceeding the MTD, of the combination regimen of mogamulizumab and nivolumab subjects. Phase 1 will enroll up to 12 subjects. Phase 2 will explore the safety, efficacy and anti-tumor activity of the highest tolerated dose of the combination regimen. Phase 2 will enroll up to 184 subjects.</detailed_description>
