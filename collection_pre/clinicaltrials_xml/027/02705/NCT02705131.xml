	<brief_title>Balance Chiropractic Therapy for Cervical Spondylotic Radiculopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators propose a multi center randomized, parallel-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the balance chiropractic therapy for CSR. Participants aged 18 to 65, who are in conformity with the diagnostic criteria of CSR and the pain score regarding visual analog scales is more than 4 points and less than 8 points, will be included and randomly allocated into two groups: test group and control group. Participants in the test group will be treated with the balance chiropractic therapy, while the control group will receive the traction therapy. The primary outcome is pain severity (measured with a visual analogue scale (VAS)). Secondary outcomes will include cervical curvature (measured by Borden index), a composite of functional status(measured by Neck Disability Index ,NDI), individual patients health status(evaluated by SF-36 health survey ), and adverse events as reported in the trial.</detailed_description>
