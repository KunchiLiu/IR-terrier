	<criteria>Diagnosed with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension due to Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, or pure autonomic failure, (i.e. neurogenic orthostatic hypotension) At screening, subject must meet the diagnostic criteria of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, as demonstrated by a â‰¥ 30 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure (SBP) within 5 minutes of standing Impaired autonomic reflexes, as determined by absence of BP overshoot during phase IV of the Valsalva maneuver Systemic illnesses known to produce autonomic neuropathy, including but not limited to diabetes mellitus, amyloidosis, monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance, and autoimmune neuropathies. Concomitant use of vasoconstricting agents for the purpose of increasing BP such as ephedrine, dihydroergotamine, or midodrine must stop taking these drugs at least 2 days or five halflives (whichever is longer) prior to dosing on Day 1 and throughout the duration of the study. Concomitant use of antihypertensive medication for the treatment of essential hypertension unrelated to autonomic dysfunction.
