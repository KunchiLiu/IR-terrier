	<brief_title>IMR Assessment in Patients With New Diagnosis of Left Ventricle Dilatation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Authors will enroll at the moment of coronary artery angiography patients without history of ischemic heart disease and new diagnosis (at transthoracic echocardiography) of left ventricular dilation. All patients will undergo coronary artery angiography. To be enrolled, it is necessary to have the absence of significant coronary artery stenosis (angiographic evaluation of the lesion &gt;40%) in all the vessels (main and side branch). The Authors will proceed to perform the evaluation of the index of microvascular resistance (IMR). The target vessel will be the left anterior descending artery. An intracoronary pressure/temperature sensor-tipped guidewire will be used. Thermodilution curves will be obtained during maximal hyperemia. The IMR will be calculated from the ratio of the mean distal coronary pressure at maximal hyperemia to the inverse of mean hyperemic transit time.</detailed_description>
