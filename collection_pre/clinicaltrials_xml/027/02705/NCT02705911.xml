	<brief_summary>The purpose of this RCT which will be performed in 60 healthy adults is I. To assess the training effects of 8 weeks of isometric handgrip exercise on BP; and to test whether it yields at least similar effects on BP compared to current exercise recommendations. II. To assess whether isometric handgrip training yields larger BP reductions beyond the supervised training period at 6 months of follow-up. III. To determine whether changes in BP following acute exercise and chronic training can be explained by changes in important physiological mechanisms known to mediate or to be associated with BP?</brief_summary>
