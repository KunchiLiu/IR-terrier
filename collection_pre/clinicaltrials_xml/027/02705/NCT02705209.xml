	<brief_summary>The beneficial analgesic effects of Rubefacenciae (redden skin substances), is known since 1830 as a treatment for pain, cramps, and disorders of the musculoskeletal system. Herbal cataplasms containing rubefacient substances, such as Cayenne pepper, are commonly used as natural medications to treat painful or aching areas in the case of acute or chronic back pain, and rheumatisms. In Vienna and lower Austria, a Cayenne Pepper Cataplasm (CPC) application containing Cayenne pepper and Kaolin powder in mixed proportion, is commonly used to treat musculoskeletal conditions of pain especially of the low back. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to test effects of a series of ten applications of CPC prepared with 5% of pepper, investigating the resulting effect on: skin temperature, skin sensory functions, pain threshold, and proprioception. Placebo control condition (0% cayenne pepper) was also tested. It was hypothesized that a series of 20-minute application of a CPC will have significant effects on the measured parameters. 40 subjects will be randomized into Treatment/control group.</brief_summary>
