	<brief_summary>In this project we want to evaluate the effect of mannitol on graft function after renal transplantation. Due to the unclear situation regarding data of Mannitoleffect and lack of standardization during the kidney transplant, there is an indication for performing a randomized trial. We are planning to perform a double-blind randomized controlled trial . In the study, mannitol 20% with a dose of 1g / kg / KG will be compared to placebo with NaCl 0.9% in the dose of 5 ml / kg / KG. Patients will be randomized to receive either the mannitol or NaCl. The follow-up of the study is a week. Data will be collected, compared and published at the end of the study. It is planned to include a total of 100 patients in the study.</brief_summary>
