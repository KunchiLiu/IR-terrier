	<brief_title>MINDSPACE Strategy for Risk Optimization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this project, the investigators will draw on the science that has provided a foundation for behavioral economics as a guide to activation interventions. Specifically, the investigators will use the MINDSPACE framework that was created by some of the founders of behavioral economics. That framework details nine approaches to behavioral activation that have particularly solid evidence bases. Two of these, salience and incentives, the investigative team identified as most promising and practical for stroke activation. Aims: 1. Use electronic health record data to construct Framingham stroke risk scores in both Richard L. Roudebush Veterans Affairs Medical Center and Eskenazi Health System. 2. Conduct iterative testing with high risk stroke patients from both health systems to refine two different stroke risk messages based on the behavioral strategies of salience and incentives. 3. Conduct a randomized trial of four mailed stroke risk messages, comparing the impact on patient activation of: 1) a standard stroke risk message, 2) a salience-focused stroke risk message, 3) an incentive-focused stroke risk message, and 4) a salience plus incentive message. 4. Compare the proportion in each messaging group that completes a stroke risk factor relevant healthcare system visit within two months of receiving the stroke risk message.</detailed_description>
