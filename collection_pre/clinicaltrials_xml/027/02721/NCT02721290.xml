	<brief_summary>In this study, we will be comparing two approaches to the femoral block. The first or classical approach and one that is the most popular in our institution is used by combining ultrasound guidance and neurostimulator to do the block. The second is performed with the ultrasound alone aiming at the inferolateral aspect of the femoral artery with the needle and injecting. The primary endpoint of the study is the sensitive cutaneous block distribution using both techniques.</brief_summary>
