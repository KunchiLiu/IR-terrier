	<brief_summary>Can nicotinamide riboside (750 mg/day for 12 weeks) affect the levels of NAD+ in the brain as measured by 31P MRS?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of 31P MRS to Assess Brain NAD+ in Healthy Collegiate Football Players</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy collegiate football players will take Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) or placebo twice daily for 84 days. Pre- and post-intervention evaluations include physical assessment, blood tests for safety and toxicity monitoring, blood tests for biomarkers, neurologic testing, quality of life questionnaires, and the 31P MRI exam.</detailed_description>
