	<brief_summary>While the scientific community understands quite well why muscles ache after prolonged exercise, the origins of mental fatigue remain totally mysterious. Existing theories remain at a psychological level, with scarce supporting evidence. Mental fatigue typically occurs after long episodes during which humans exert control on motor or cognitive processes, instead of executing routine or stimulus-driven behaviours. However, work organization (especially in risky job like airplane control or medical profession) and pathologies due to an overload of work (like burn-out) seems to be directly linked to neural fatigue. One of the consequences of neural fatigue is to alter decision-making. As an example, the choice between an immediate monetary reward and a larger but delayed monetary reward (the so called intertemporal choices) are susceptible to fatigue state of its underpinning neural network. The investigators are proposing an exploratory study of neural fatigue, induced either in a natural way (by performing cognitive tasks for hours) or by transcranial stimulation, using three main physiological measures (Electro-encephalography to measure neural activity, indirect calorimetry to measure the metabolic cost of a cognitive effort, and pupillometry to measure cognitive effort). This study should allow to better understand the consequences of neural fatigue on cognitive functions like decision making as well as the associated physiological variables.</brief_summary>
