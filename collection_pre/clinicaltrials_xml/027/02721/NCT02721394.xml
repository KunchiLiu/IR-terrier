	<brief_summary>The current project aims to assess the feasibility of conducting Functional Communication Training in the UK with a small sample of young children (aged under 9) in an NHS setting. Two delivery formats will be assessed in order to demonstrate the feasibility of conducting FCT via different delivery methods within an NHS context. Participants will be four children aged under 9 who have an identified intellectual / developmental disability and display either self-injury, property destruction, or aggression at home. In addition, one family carer per child will be coached to implement the intervention, either following researcher intervention, or from the beginning. Data will be collected on challenging behaviour, communication responses, family carer confidence in managing behaviour, fidelity of intervention implementation, family quality of life, and acceptability of the intervention.</brief_summary>
