	<detailed_description>In a cross sectional design participants will be studied on one occasion after a 3-day diet run-in. On the study day they will present in the fasting state, have an intravenous catheter placed for blood draws and have baseline blood samples taken and appetite measures performed. Participants will then undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This will be followed by a breakfast meal. Blood and appetite measures will be performed every half hour for 3 hours. Repeat fMRI will be performed 30 minutes after the meal. After three hours participants will be offered a buffet style lunch and then will be done with the study visit.</detailed_description>
