	<brief_summary>This is a perspective, multicenter,randomized controlledtrial,Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with CMNa combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced squamous cell esophageal carcinoma . Analyses of primary objective (ORR) will be done as defined in the protocol.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial of CMNa Combined With Definitive Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Locally Advanced ESCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary end point of this study is objective response rate.The secondary end point is OS, PFS and the safty of drug. The primary hypothesis is the CMNa will improve ORR and thus improve OS, PFS. Assuming bilateral a=0.05, statistical power of 80%.The total sample size is 104 cases.</detailed_description>

Subjects tumor tissue available for the relevant biomarker detection 1. Female subject who is during pregnancy or lactation, and the subject who have fertility don't take effective contraception during study 2. Any mental illness or nervous system lesions or can't tell treatment response clearly (such as cerebrovascular accident sequelae) 3. Any serious uncontrolled disease and infection, such as severe heart, liver, kidney diseases or diabetes, can't complete the treatment plan 4.

Patients who have obvious esophageal ulcers or have above moderate pains in chestback or have symptoms of esophageal perforation 7. received anticancer treatment of esophageal cancer before the group, including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy (induction of chemotherapy before the group is greater than or equal to two cycles). 8. Not esophageal squamous carcinoma confirmed by pathology or cytology 9. History of active hepatitis 10. Unable to comprehend the study requirement or who are not likely to comply with the study requirements 11. Significant disease which, in the investigator's opinion, would exclude the patient from the study</criteria>
