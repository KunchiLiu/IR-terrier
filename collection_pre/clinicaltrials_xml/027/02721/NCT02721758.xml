	<detailed_description>Cardiac rehabilitation programs help reduce morbidity and mortality following a cardiac event, but only a subset of referred patients chooses to participate. An intervention based on principles of motivational interviewing may help resolve individuals' ambivalence about cardiac rehabilitation. The primary aim is to evaluate the efficacy of a brief motivational intervention (MI) for enhancing intention to enroll in cardiac rehabilitation compared to a usual care (UC) control condition among patients referred to cardiac rehabilitation. It is hypothesized that patients in the MI condition will report greater intention to enroll in cardiac rehabilitation compared to patients in UC. A small-scale feasibility trial will include patients (n = 100) with acute coronary syndrome who are referred to a standard 12-week exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation program in Calgary, Canada. Patients will be randomly assigned to MI or UC. The primary outcome will be self-reported intention to attend cardiac rehabilitation. Secondary outcomes will include beliefs about cardiac rehabilitation, exercise self-efficacy, perceived barriers, and cardiac rehabilitation enrollment.</detailed_description>
