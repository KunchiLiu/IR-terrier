	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of the study is to investigate if physical exercise is associated with myocardial damage, expressed by elevated troponin T, in patients with COPD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Troponin T in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Patients After Physical Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with COPD will perform a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) on treadmill until exhaustion, 8-12 minutes. Venous blood will be drawn before exercise test and 15 minutes, 3 hours and 24 hours after test for analysis of high sensitive Cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT). The investigators will also measure arterial bloodgas, oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide consumption, ventilation, blood pressure, ECG, heart rate and ask for dyspnea-score.</detailed_description>
