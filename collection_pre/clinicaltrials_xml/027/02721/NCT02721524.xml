	<brief_summary>This study aims to compare whether De Vega's Suture annuloplasty is equally effective in reducing the progression of Functional Tricuspid regurgitation as that claimed for Ring annuloplasty in Rheumatic Heart Disease patients with concurrent Mitral valve replacement.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ring Versus Suture Annuloplasty For Functional Tricuspid Regurgitation In Rheumatic Mitral Valve Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Functional Tricuspid regurgitation (FTR) occurs due to annular dilatation in association with left sided valve disease and is more commonly seen than primary pathology in patients with Rheumatic mitral valve disease. FTR occurs due to increased right ventricle after load that leads to either dilatation or geometric deformation of Tricuspid annulus. If left untreated, FTR may worsen and increase morbidity and mortality.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The participants will be all patients between 15 to 75 years of age group diagnosed as a case of Rheumatic Mitral Valve disease with moderate to severe functional Tricuspid regurgitation. Patient with organic Tricuspid Valve (TV) lesion diagnosed in Echocardiography Patient with FTR requiring Mitral Valve repair Patient with FTR requiring concomitant aortic valve replacement Patient with FTR secondary to pathology other than Mitral valve disease</criteria>
