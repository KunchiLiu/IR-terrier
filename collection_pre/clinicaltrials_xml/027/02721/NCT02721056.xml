	<brief_summary>The purpose of this Phase I / II study is to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of NBTXR3 nanoparticles given by intralesional (IL) or intraarterial (IA) injection and activated by Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in the treatment of liver cancers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NBTXR3 Crystalline Nanoparticles and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in the Treatment of Liver Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, open-label, non-comparative and non-randomized study, to be conducted in 2 phases: - a dose-escalation phase, to determine the recommended dose of NBTXR3 and to evaluate its safety/tolerability and preliminary clinical activity; and - a dose-expansion phase, which will be a cohort expansion at the recommended dose of NBTXR3. Patients will receive a single administration of NBTXR3 on day of injection, as a super selective transcatheter arterial or intrahepatic lesion injection activated by Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy starting 24 hours post injection. The total radiotherapy dose will be maximum 45 Gy, delivered as three fractions of 15 Gy each max, over 5 to 7 days (45 Gy, 3x15 Gy, over 5 to 7 days). the visit of End of Treatment (EOT) will take place 12 to 13 weeks after the administration of the last radiotherapy fraction and includes the evaluation of global clinical, radiological and laboratory parameters.</detailed_description>

That is, any previous radiation therapy in which a mean dose to the liver of 15 Gy in conventional fractionation was delivered, or previous doses to critical normal structures that would make reirradiation unsafe Impossibility to follow the dosimetry constraints (mean total liver dose &gt; 15Gy) Presence of arterioveinous intra tumoral shunting Encephalopathy related to liver failure Clinical ascitis Previous or concurrent cancer that is distinct in primary site or histology from Hepatocellular Carcinoma, except cervical carcinoma in situ, treated basal cell carcinoma, or superficial bladder tumors (Ta, Tis &amp;T1) Presence of hepato pulmonary syndrome Auto immune hemolytic anemia Auto immune disorder, excepted auto immune thyroiditis Uncontrolled hypertension or congestive heart failure Active coronary artery disease (myocardial infarction more than 6 months prior to study entry is permitted) Previous gastrointestinal bleed within the past 2 months Known syndrome AIDSrelated illness or serious non controlled acute or chronic illness Active, clinically severe bacterial or fungal infections (&gt; grade 2 CTCAE, version 4.0) Complete initial work up earlier than 4 weeks prior to patient registration Patient whose general health condition does not allow treatment feasibility Patients unable and/or unwilling to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory tests, and other study procedures Patients participating in another clinical investigation at the time of signature of the informed consent.</criteria>
