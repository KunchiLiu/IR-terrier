	<brief_summary>The investigators have recently observed retrospectively that the occurrence of Graves' Orbitopathy in patients with Graves' disease is less frequent in patients with normal cholesterol levels, in line with another recent observation suggesting that statins play a protective role in Graves' patients from developing Graves' Orbitopathy. The present study is designed in order to investigate the possible association between Graves' Orbitopathy and high cholesterol level as well as the relation between Graves' Orbitopathy degree and high cholesterol level</brief_summary>
