	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes depending on catheter ablation strategy for persistent atrial fibrillation. After randomization, investigators will conduct circumferential pulmonary vein isolation alone in a group, and additional posterior box isolation and anterior linear ablation in the other group. Investigators will compare clinical recurrence rate, complication rate, and procedure time, etc.</brief_summary>
