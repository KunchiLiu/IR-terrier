	<brief_summary>Background: Dexmedetomidine is an alpha 2 adrenergic agonist with sedative, anxiolytic, and analgesic properties. This study was designed to evaluate the inhibitory effects of preoperative 0.5 μg/kg dexmedetomidine on hemodynamic responses caused by endotracheal intubation in elderly patients being treated for hypertension. Methods: Forty elderly (≥ 65 years) treated-hypertensive patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status II undergoing elective noncardiac surgery were randomly and assigned to two groups. Group C received normal saline and group D received 0.5 μg/kg dexmedetomidine intravenously over 10 min just before endotracheal intubation. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded preoperatively at ward, immediately after study drug administration, and at 1, 3, and 5 minutes after endotracheal intubation.</brief_summary>
