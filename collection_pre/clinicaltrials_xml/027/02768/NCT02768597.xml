	<brief_summary>The study will compare the outcome of primary reverse shoulder arthroplasty using the Stryker ReUnion System with implantation of either a large (40 mm) or a small (36 mm) glenosphere with either a +2 mm or a +6 mm offset.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing The Outcome of Large-Diameter vs Small-Diameter Glenospheres in Primary Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 220 shoulders will be included in the study (55 shoulders in each of the four groups). Each shoulder will be assessed preoperatively, at 3 weeks, 3 months, one year, two years and five years. The primary end-point will be range of motion at one year. Additional end-points will include dislocation, stress fractures of the acromion, metal ion levels in peripheral blood, neurovascular complications, radiographic notching, implant mechanical failure and revision surgery.</detailed_description>
