	<brief_title>Prospective Comparison Between SADI-S and Gastric Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Morbid obese patients and patients with an initial BMI over 35 with associated comorbidities - as diabetes mellitus - are evaluated for bariatric surgery. Candidates are offered a standard gastric bypass or a single anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy. Patients with higher BMI and those with worse metabolic condition are encouraged to accept the malabsorptive option. Gastric bypass is performed with a 150 cm alimentary limb and a calibrated pouch and anastomosis over a 14 mm bougie. SADI-S is performed with a sleeve gastrectomy over a 54 French (18 mm) gastric bougie and a 250 cm common limb. Patients are managed equally during admission: 6 hours to initiate oral intake, 2 days to remove abdominal drain and 3 days to discharge unless contraindicated. Follow up is performed through visits every 3 months the first 2 postoperative years and every 6 months from the 3rd to the 5th year.</detailed_description>
