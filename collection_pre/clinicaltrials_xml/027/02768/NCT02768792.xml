	<brief_summary>Rationale:The purpose of this research study is to test the effectiveness of the standard high dose cytarabine (HiDAC) on days 1 through 5 followed by a single dose of pembrolizumab on day 14 as induction therapy in patients with relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Patients who achieve a response to treatment will continue on the study drug (pembrolizumab) every 3 weeks for up to 1 year maintenance therapy. Purpose:This is a study about a new investigative drug, pembrolizumab (MK-3475) that is being studied in a clinical research trial together with standard chemotherapy (HiDAC) in relapsed and refractory AML. The study will also explore the association between potential immune biomarkers and clinical outcomes with pembrolizumab; therefore all patients will have blood and bone marrow samples collected before and after treatment to determine the dynamic nature of immune signatures pre and post-treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objective 1. Estimate the objective overall rate of CR (CR+CRi) for age-adjusted HiDAC (age &lt;60 years: 2 gm/m2 IV Q12hours days 1-5; age &gt;60 years: 1.5 gm/m2 IV Q12hours days 1-5) followed by pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on day 14 in relapsed and refractory AML patients Secondary Objectives 1. Estimate the rate of unacceptable toxicity associated with HiDAC followed by pembrolizumab as induction therapy 2. Estimate the objective overall response rates (PR+CR+CRi) for HiDAC followed by pembrolizumab. 3. Characterize the toxicity associated with HiDAC followed by pembrolizumab as induction therapy 4. Characterize the toxicity associated with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3weeks when used as monotherapy maintenance after an initial response to induction phase HiDAC followed by pembrolizumab 5. Estimate the relapse-free survival (RFS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of patients receiving maintenance pembrolizumab 6. Estimate the overall survival (OS) of patients who received induction phase treatment.</detailed_description>

Have histologically or cytologically confirmed recurrent AML as defined by ≥5 % myeloblasts in the bone marrow aspirate and or biopsy. 5. Must have received at least 1 cycle of induction therapy for frontline AML including cytarabine continuous infusion + anthracycline +/ cladribine or etoposide for 1 or 2 cycles, high dose cytarabine with or without fludarabine, cladribine or clofarabine, &gt; 4 cycles of azacitidine/decitabine or the equivalent experimental therapy (the latter as confirmed by the PI) 6. Cytoreduction allowed with hydroxyurea and/or leukapheresis for up to 14 days prior to D1 of treatment under LCCC1522. Patients must be off hydroxyurea for &gt; 12 hours prior to D1 of treatment under LCCC1522 7. Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined below. All screening labs should be performed within 14 days of D1 of treatment under LCCC1522. Serum creatinine ≤1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) OR Measured or calculated creatinine clearance (GFR can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl) ≥60 mL/min for subject with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN unless due to Gilbert's Disease, hemolysis or leukemic infiltration OR Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 ULN AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 5 X ULN International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants or patient has disseminated intravascular coagulation deemed by investigator to be due to leukemia Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants or patient has disseminated intravascular coagulation deemed by investigator to be due to leukemia 8. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of HiDAC treatment and again prior to D1 of pembrolizumab treatment. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. 9. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use adequate method of contraception for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year. The two birth control methods can be two barrier methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal method to prevent pregnancy. Subjects should start using birth control from the screening visit throughout the study period up to 120 days after the last dose of study therapy. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle preferred contraception for the subject. 10. Male subjects must agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with D1 of HiDAC through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy. 11. As determined by the enrolling physician or protocol designee, ability of the patient to understand and comply with study procedures for the entire length of the study. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject. 1. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or using an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment. 2.
