	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the therapeutic effects between the axillary bilateral-breast approach (ABBA) and bilateral axillo-breast approach (BABA) for robotic thyroidectomy.To explore the efficacy, safety, cosmetic results and clinical value by the two approaches.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Between the Axillary Bilateral-breast Approach (ABBA) and Bilateral Axillo-breast Approach (BABA) for Robotic Thyroidectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although several reports on operative outcomes of the robotic technique have appeared, no prospective trials comparing the clinical results of between the axillary bilateral-breast approach (ABBA) and bilateral axillo-breast approach (BABA) for robotic thyroidectomy have been described. The investigators therefore designed a prospective trial comparing outcomes, including surgical outcomes and patient satisfaction, between patients undergoing robotic and conventional open thyroidectomy.</detailed_description>
