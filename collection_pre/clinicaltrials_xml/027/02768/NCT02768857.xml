	<brief_summary>This study evaluated the effects of an integrated program of touch-observation and task-based mirror therapy on sensorimotor function in nerve injury patients. Before the return of protective sense (Value of Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test &gt; 4.31), half of the participants received 15 minutes of mirror therapy program, followed by 20 minutes of regular hand therapy and 20 minutes of physiotherapy.While the other half received 15 minutes protective sensory reeducation programs, 20 minutes of regular hand therapy and 20 minutes of physiotherapy in each treatment session. Once the patients had regained the protective sense (Value of Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test &lt; 4.31), the discriminative sensory reeducation program was started for the participants in both groups. The hypothesis was that using the mirror therapy for sensorimotor reeducation in the early phase after nerve repair would yield better results with regard to the returning of sensation, sensorimotor control ability and hand function than using a classical reeducation program alone.</brief_summary>
