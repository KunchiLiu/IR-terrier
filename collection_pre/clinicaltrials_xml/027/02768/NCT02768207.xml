	<brief_summary>This is a single arm, multicenter, open label, and non-randomized clinical study on adult participants with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The study will be conducted in two phases. Pre-screening phase will assess the BRAF V600 mutation in a new mutation analysis triggered by a mutant plasma cfDNA test result. Treatment phase will assess the clinical outcome for the participants treated with vemurafenib plus cobimetinib. The length of the study will be approximately 36 months.</brief_summary>
