	<brief_summary>Apatinib is an orally administered second-generation blocker of the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues within the intracellular domain of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2). A prospective, open label, phase II multicenter trial of apatinib in heavily pretreated patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer demonstrated that the daily dose of apatinib 500 mg/day is active in pretreated metastatic TNBC with encouraging rates of disease stabilization and PFS. Vinorelbine is a highly active drug in the treatment of MBC, both as a single agent or in combination regimens, and is well tolerated, with a low incidence of severe toxicity. Clinical trials demonstrated oral NVB provided comparable effectiveness to iv NVB. and oral availability allows using different schedules. The NCCN guideline introduces that combination chemotherapy is one of the standard treatment options in metastatic breast cancer, especially in patients with visceral metastases and/or need of rapid symptom or disease control. Theoretically, anti-angiogenesis regimen combined with chemotherapy may present increasing therapeutic effect. Related researches are urgently needed to find optimal combined therapy.</brief_summary>
