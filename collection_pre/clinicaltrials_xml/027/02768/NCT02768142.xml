	<brief_summary>Throughout the history, the neonate was dependent on maternal touch and care for survival. In modern obstetrics, with hospital care the neonates are seldom separated from their mothers after delivery. Early skin to skin (ESTS) contact after delivery was found to increase milk production, lactation and improve maternal and neonatal outcome. Oxytocin is the primary hormone responsible for uterine contraction and prevention of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). ESTS contact increases oxytocin secretion. The rate of cesarean deliveries (CDs) increased dramatically over the past decades. CD was found to decrease postpartum milk production, postpones early lactation and decreases exclusive breastfeeding. During the typical CD, the neonate is usually presented for a short while to the mother and breastfeeding is usually delayed at least a number of hours until after the surgery and the recovery period. Natural CD, enable ESTS contact during the surgery and give the mother the opportunity to start breastfeeding immediately after delivery of the neonate in the surgery suit. Oxytocin secretion increases with ESTS and during breastfeeding. The aim of this study is to examine blood loss that occurs after Natural CD compared to standard CD without an ESTS contact.</brief_summary>
