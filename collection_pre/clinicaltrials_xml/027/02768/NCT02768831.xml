	<brief_summary>In the past 5 years cuffed endotracheal tubes (ETT) have become the standard of care in pediatrics. However, hyperinflation of the cuff can compromise the tracheal mucosal perfusion while an inadequate seal may impact ventilation and potentially increase the risk of aspiration. Hence, the goal after placement of a cuffed ETT is to create a safe and effective tracheal seal. The two ways to measure that are to hold CPAP while listening for an audible leak and measuring the difference between the inspired and expired tidal volumes (TV). This is a prospective study to compare these two methods used to create a tracheal seal and measure the intracuff pressure after a satisfactory tracheal seal is established.</brief_summary>
