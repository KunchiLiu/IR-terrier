	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Knowledge by Video and Handbook of Liver Cancer Patients With First Trans-arterial Chemoembolization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Liver cancer is a serious disease with a high death rate. One of the treatment modalities for liver cancer is TACE. Patients always scare of the first TACE due to their lack of knowledge and inadequate comprehension of the procedure. Hence, they crave to have a good quality in nursing service. Researcher would like to compare the effectiveness knowledge between Video and Handbook regarding patients' health education. Objective: To compare the effectiveness between Video and Handbook on providing knowledge of TACE. Study Design: A prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Setting: Chulabhorn Hospital, Bangkok, THAILAND. Methods : Eighty liver cancer patients are included in the study. They are systematically computerized and randomized into two groups - an experiment or video group (N 40) and a control or Handbook group (N = 40). A 40-item exam is performed to test the patients' knowledge before (x score), after (y score) and 60 days (z score) after the procedure. The 15-min study was taken in an isolated room. The points of interest are the effectiveness of medias on learning achievement and relative growth of knowledge. The relative growth of knowledge (G1, G2 score) was calculated as follows: G1 = 100 (Y-X)/(F-X) % ; G2 = 100 (Z-X)/(F-X)% Retention of knowledge (R) = 100 - (G1 - G2) % Where G = Relative growth of knowledge R = Retention of knowledge X = Pre-test score Y = Post-test score Z = Final-test score F = Total score</detailed_description>
