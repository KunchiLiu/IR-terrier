	<brief_title>Physiology and Therapeutic Management of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Novel approaches to diagnosing and treating Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) are needed for reducing prolonged pharmacological management, minimizing hospitalization and improving developmental outcomes in drug exposed newborns. This study seeks to examine the physiology and symptoms of drug withdrawal (e.g., irritability marked by movement activity; cardio-respiratory instabilities) in infants exposed to drugs in utero and test whether sensory stimuli (tactile, auditory) reduce dysregulated systems in the withdrawing infant. Candidates at-risk for NAS due to fetal drug exposure will be identified to investigators by the infant's Attending physician. Investigators will use a modified-consecutive sampling technique, restricted by equipment and personnel availability, for enrolling infants. Participants will be studied throughout their hospitalization. Effects of stimulation will be examined at different stages of withdrawal. Efficacy of stimulation will be examined as a potential complementary treatment of NAS.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligible subjects are infants currently inpatient in the NICU or Newborn Nursery at University of Massachusetts Memorial Hospital and: Fullterm infants (&gt;37 wks gestational age) and late preterm infants (3437 wks gestational age) Newborns at risk for NAS due to fetaldrug exposure Atrisk infants will be infants who present with confirmed meconium and/or urine toxicology report (documented in medical chart review) for opioids (e.g., methadone, buprenorphine/subutex, oxycodone, heroin); may also have prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, amphetamines, cannabinoids, alcohol, nicotine and/or caffeine. Eligible infants meeting the inclusion criteria above will be excluded from participation in the study if he/she: Born less than &lt;34 weeks. Has a congenital abnormality Has a fetal anomaly Has an adverse pregnancy outcome Has hydrocephalus or intraventricular hemorrhage &gt;grade 2 Has a seizure disorder not related to drug withdrawal Has a clinically significant shunt Has anemia (hemoglobin&lt;8g/dL) Requires mechanical respiratory support Has MRSA or infection at time of the study</criteria>
