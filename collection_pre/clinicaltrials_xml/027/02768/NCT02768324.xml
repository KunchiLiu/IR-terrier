	<brief_summary>Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection injures its own tissues and organs. Common signs and symptoms include fever, increased heart rate, increased breathing rate, and confusion. Clinically, sepsis patients with diarrhea often result in a bad prognosis. Gut microbiota consists of a complex community of microorganisms that live in the digestive tracts of animals. The gut microbiota comprises the largest and most diverse reservoir of mutualistic microorganisms associated with animals. The aims of this study is to determin the effect of gut microbiota on the prognosis of Sepsis, by using 16s pyrosequencing, comparing the blood culture result.</brief_summary>
