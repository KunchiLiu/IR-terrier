	<brief_summary>This is a Phase III, randomised, assessor-blind, parallel group, multicentre trial. At least 180 adult subjects with high-risk Stage II or Stage III / IV breast cancer will be randomised (1:1) to receive either Eurofarma's pegfilgrastim (n = 90) or Neulastim (n = 90) in 8 to 10 sites in Brazil. Subjects will undergo a maximum of 4 cycles of myelosuppressive chemotherapy (21 days per cycle).</brief_summary>

Active uncontrolled infection 6. Known human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity; active hepatitis B or hepatitis C at the Screening Visit 7. Clinically significant impairment of LVEF 8. Severe valvular heart disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled hypertension, or uncontrolled arrhythmias within 6 months of the Screening Visit 9. Significant neurologic or psychiatric disorders including psychotic disorders, dementia, or seizures that would prohibit the understanding and giving of informed consent 10.
