	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Phone Calls Intervention on Diabetic Patients After Ambulatory Discharge of a Tertiary Care Center</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators designed a randomized controlled trial. Patients with stable and controlled type 2 diabetes, and considered to be eligible to discharge from specialized care to primary care will be included. Patients with severe neuropathy, not controlled ischemic heart disease and nephropathy stage IV/V will be excluded. Enrolled patients will be randomized in two groups: follow-up supported by periodic nurse phone calls plus primary care (intervention group) or followed by primary care team (control group). The intervention group will receive regular telephone calls (every 3 months for 1 year) and will have a toll-free number to resolve questions about the disease management. Main outcome is the glycemic control between groups after 1 year of follow-up. Secondary outcomes include: rate of hypoglycaemia, blood pressure control,emergency visits, nephropathy progression and death.</detailed_description>
