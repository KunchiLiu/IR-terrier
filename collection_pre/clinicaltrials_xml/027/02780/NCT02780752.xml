	<brief_summary>Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the biliary ducts in the liver resulting in destruction and fibrosis. PSC is associated with increased serum levels of hyaluronan (HA), an extracellular matrix polymer known to drive inflammation in multiple other tissues and disease models. Inhibition of HA synthesis with oral hymecromone has been shown to prevent progression of autoimmunity in several animal models. This is a prospective, open-label, single-center, pilot safety study of hymecromone in adults 18 years of age or older diagnosed with primary sclerosing cholangitis without evidence of hepatic fibrosis. Participants will be treated for 6 months with study drug. Safety and biomarkers of response will be monitored during therapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age 18 years or older Diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis confirmed by liver biopsy and/or imaging study (MRI cholangiography or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) Gammaglutamyl transferase (GGT) and Alkaline phosphatase &gt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal If history of endoscopically confirmed inflammatory bowel disease, currently stable based on HarveyBradshaw index â‰¤ 2, normal inflammatory markers (ESR, Creactive protein, and fecal calprotectin) and stable nonexcluded medical therapy for at least 6 months. Not currently taking vancomycin for at least 3 months prior to enrollment. Patients on vancomycin can stop for 3 months and then be screened for enrollment. Not currently taking ursodiol for at least 3 months prior to enrollment. Patients on ursodiol can stop for 3 months and then be screened for enrollment. Currently receiving biologic therapies (i.e. infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, etc.) or steroid medications for inflammatory bowel disease Known allergy to hymecromone Established hepatic or biliary fibrosis Cholangiocarcinoma Pregnancy Physician concern that participant may not adhere to the study protocol, based on prior behavior</criteria>
