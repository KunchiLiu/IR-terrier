	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to match genomic aberrations in tumor cells at time of relapse to rationally designed combinations of molecularly targeted agents. This study will be done in two parts: Part I: Tumor will be accessed at study entry via a biopsy and subjected to deep sequencing to identify protocol-specified biomarkers for therapy assignment. Part II: If the tumor contains a genetic change defined by the study as being actionable, and other criteria are met, participants will be assigned to therapy based upon the genetic changes identified in the tumor biopsy.</brief_summary>
