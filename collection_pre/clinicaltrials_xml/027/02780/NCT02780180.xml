	<brief_summary>Heart Failure (HF) a common clinical condition characterized by either by a heart that does not pump sufficiently or becomes stiff. A variety of mechanisms contribute to progressive cardiac remodeling and dysfunction. A new therapeutic approaches by preventing activation of the brain neuromodulatory pathway, may lead to improve HF. QCG001 is a prodrug of EC33, a aminopeptidase A (APA) inhibitor. QCG001 has been shown to be an antihypertensive agent in animal models. This study investigates the safety and efficacy of QGC001 in HF patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite advances in care, prognosis remains poor once overt Heart Failure (HF) has developed. HF is a common clinical condition characterized by either by a heart that does not pump sufficiently or becomes stiff and it is associates with higher incidences of patient illness and death in both case. A variety of mechanisms contribute to progressive cardiac remodeling and dysfunction. A new therapeutic approaches by preventing activation of the brain neuromodulatory pathway, may lead to improve HF. QCG001 is a prodrug of EC33, a specific and selective of the aminopeptidase A (APA) inhibitor. QCG001 has been shown to be an antihypertensive agent in animal models. This study investigates the safety and efficacy of QGC001 up-titrated form 50mg twice daily to a maximum of 500 mg twice daily, on patients with worsening chronic HF during 28 days and 7 days after discontinuation (day 35). 6 European countries are involved in this study (France, Netherlands, Germany, Norway, Poland and United Kingdom) including 10 investigational hospitals. Patients would be followed during 35 days and inclusion period lasts 10 months.</detailed_description>

Eligible subjects must be enrolled short before discharge or within 8 days after discharge from an episode of decompensated HF (index event) defined as 1. an overnight stay in a hospital, emergency department, or medical observation facility with the capability of treating with intravenous medications and observing HF patients, or 2. an unscheduled outpatient visit to a HF management centre, where parenteral therapy is required for HF stabilization. Documented left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 40% measured by any modality within the previous 6 months in the subject's medical history Subjects must also have at least one local measurement of BNP level ≥ 400 pg/mL or NTproBNP level ≥1600 pg/mL (preferred assay, local lab) at any time during the index hospitalization or before randomisation. eGFR &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (MDRD) at screening No decrease in eGFR greater than 20% from admission to the index hospitalisation and up to the randomisation day. Serum potassium 5.0 mmol/L at screening Systolic blood pressure 120 mmHg (average of 3 consecutive measurements) Prescribed to optimal pharmacologic therapy per ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure 2012", or based on the updated current clinical practice, unless contraindicated or nottolerated, and on a stable dose (e.g., recommended not more than double or decrease in dosage) for at least 30 days prior to enrolment. Taking oral loop diuretics at doses &lt; 250 mg furosemide daily (or equivalent) Age &gt; 80 years BMI &gt; 35kg.m2 Patients who require the use of HF IV therapy or oral furosemide &gt; 250 mg (or equivalent) at any time during the 48 hours immediately before randomisation. Patients with unstable angina, myocardial infarction, PTCA, coronary artery bypass graft, cerebral vascular accident, or transient ischemic attack within previous 3 months (90 days) before enrolment. Patients whose primary cause of heart failure is mitral or aortic valve disease or congenital heart disease or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy or infiltrative cardiomyopathy (e.g. amyloidosis, sarcoidosis) or myocarditis. Patients with permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) (per "ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 guidelines for the management of patients with AF") within 3 months (90days) prior to enrolment Patients scheduled for Pacemaker (including ICD, CRT), Angioplasty, CABG or LVAD within the next 3 months Patients with documented chronic obstructive lung disease. eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (MDRD) at screening Decrease in eGFR greater than 20% from admission to the index hospitalisation and up to the randomisation day Serum potassium &gt; 5.0 mmol/L at screening Systolic blood pressure &lt; 120 mmHg or with signs or symptoms of hypotension Symptomatic hypotension or orthostatic hypotension defined by a decrease of more than 30 mm Hg in the standing vs. sitting position at screening and at T0 of the D0 (before having taken the study medication) Insulinrequiring diabetic patients (including type 1 Diabetes) HbA1c ≥ 10% at screening visit History of angioneurotic edema Patients with a life expectancy of less than 12 months per physician judgment Patients involved in any clinical study Patients who take an investigational or nonapproved treatment Women of childbearing potential who are or might be pregnant at the time of the study (method of assessment upon physician's discretion) Patients with a prior cardiac transplant or patients currently on the list for cardiac transplantation</criteria>
