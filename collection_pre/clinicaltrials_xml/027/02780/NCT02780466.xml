	<brief_summary>Septic shock is common in intensive care and its mortality remains high. While new treatments have not improved survival, optimization of known and widely used techniques has allowed reduction in mortality. Thus improving care given to patients starts with making better use of existing resuscitation techniques. Among these practices, mechanical ventilation is widespread in the management of patients with septic shock. In large studies published in recent years in Europe and North America, 40 to 85% of patients receive invasive mechanical ventilation. It therefore appears that a significant proportion of patients are never intubated during treatment and management of their septic shock. There is no specific recommendation from critical care societies concerning mechanical ventilation in the treatment of septic shock. Apart from indisputable situations such as impaired consciousness or acute respiratoire distress, the decision whether to ventilate mechanically or not is left to the discretion of the physician. The aim of this study is to analyze intubation practice in septic shock patients and its impact on 28-day survival. This multicentric and observational study will be conducted in 30 French ICUs.</brief_summary>
