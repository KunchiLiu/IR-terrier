	<brief_summary>Chest compression, a key component of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), has a major role for survival of cardiac arrest patients. According to 2015 American heart association (AHA) guideline, rescuers provide high quality CPR to adult cardiac arrest patients including 5 to 6 cm depth and 100 to 120 beat per minute rate chest compression. However, in CPR situation, chest compression depth and rate vary according to provider's muscle strength. In other words, the individual difference of the degree of physical activity will make the different result for CPR. So, the investigators hypothesize that the core muscles activation using physical fitness improves the quality of chest compression and the quality of CPR, eventually.</brief_summary>
