	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Study of MEDI7734 in Type I Interferon-Mediated Autoimmune Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MEDI7734 is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to and causes temporary depletion of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), a type of white blood cell. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety, drug levels, and pDC levels in subjects who are given a single injection of MEDI7734 or a placebo. The study will be conducted in subjects with at least one of the five following autoimmune diseases: dermatomyositis, polymyositis, Sjogren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, or systemic sclerosis. After a screening period, subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive a single dose of MEDI7734 or matching placebo, administered as a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. After that, subjects will be evaluated periodically at the study site over at least the next 85 days.</detailed_description>

History of latent or active tuberculosis (TB), or a positive QuantiFERONÂ®TB Gold test at screening. 4. Herpes zoster infection within 3 months before randomization 5.
