	<brief_summary>Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a feared complication of premature birth. If discovered in time, the disease can be treated, and impaired vision or blindness can be reduced. Premature infants are therefore examined regularly after birth. However, the examination is painful and stressful for the infant. Painful experiences might lead to a pathological stress response later in life and should therefore be prevented. In this study skin-to-skin contact with a parent is tested for relief of pain and stress in preterm infants being examined for retinopathy of prematurity.</brief_summary>
