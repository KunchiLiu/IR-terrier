	<brief_summary>Major depression is a highly prevalent and severe mental disease. Interventions based on information and communication technologies (ICTs) generate innovative opportunities to prevent and to intervene early the depression in adolescents. In Colombia, there are few preventive mental health interventions scientifically oriented and seeking to demonstrate efficacy in context. The purpose of this study is to determine whether an internet-based program is effective to prevent and to intervene early the depression in adolescents between 13 and 19 years of age in 8 schools of the Antioquia Region, Colombia . Study design: A cluster-randomized clinical trial will be carried out with 600 adolescents. The efficacy, adherence, and acceptability of the internet-based program will be evaluated. A single-blind randomized controlled trial will be conducted with two arms, the intervention arm (n=300), which will receive an internet-based program for depression, and the TAU (Treatment As Usual) arm (n=300).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Internet-based Program for Prevention and Early Intervention of Adolescent Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depression is a highly prevalent and severe mental disease that negatively alters the lives of people, their families, and their social environment. Organizations that promote mental health policies have recognized the potential of new information technologies for the prevention and treatment of mental disorders. In this direction, information and communication technologies (ICTs) generate opportunities for increasing patient well-being through the use of on-line software. Such programs often include interactivity, self-monitoring, information materials (sometimes in multimedia format), and exercises on problem solving, recognition and challenging of dysfunctional thoughts, scheduling of activities, behavioral experiments, and other psycho-educational activities. In Colombia, there are few preventive mental health interventions scientifically oriented and seeking to demonstrate efficacy in context. The purpose of this study is to determine whether an internet-based program is effective to prevent and to intervene early the depression in adolescents between 13 and 19 years of age in 8 schools in the Antioquia Region, Colombia. Study design: A cluster-randomized clinical trial will be carried out with 600 adolescents. The efficacy, adherence, and acceptability of the internet-based program will be evaluated. A single-blind randomized controlled trial will be conducted with two arms, the intervention arm (n=300), which will receive an internet-based program for depression, and the TAU arm (n=300). Follow-up times: T = 0 baseline, T= 3 months (post-intervention), T=12 months.</detailed_description>
