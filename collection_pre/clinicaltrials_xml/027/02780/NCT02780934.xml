	<brief_title>Comparing Pressure Versus Simple Adhesive Dressing After Mohs Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will randomize patients undergoing Mohs surgery to receive either a pressure or a simple adhesive dressing following their procedure. The hypothesis is that patients with the simple adhesive dressings will be more satisfied and comfortable with their wound care on follow-up. These patients are also expected to cite greater convenience managing the simple dressing at home. Finally, the investigators anticipate no difference in the number of postoperative complications between the two groups and expect that there will be a lower cost associated with the simple adhesive dressing as compared to the pressure dressing.</detailed_description>
