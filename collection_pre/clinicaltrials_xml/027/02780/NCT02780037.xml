	<brief_summary>This study examines the short- and long-term-effects of different repeated frames in which an exercise program is offered on behavior (i.e., frequency of exercise) and motivation (i.e., autonomous/controlled) in older people (65+). The frames are manipulated experimentally as either prevention focused (e.g., to prevent worse health), promotion focused (e.g., to gain better health) or neutral (control condition).</brief_summary>
