	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of entinostat in treating pediatric patients with solid tumors that have come back or have not responded to treatment. Entinostat may block some of the enzymes needed for cell division and it may help to kill tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Entinostat in Treating Pediatric Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose of entinostat administered as a single-agent, once weekly to children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors. II. To define and describe the toxicities of entinostat administered as a single agent, once weekly to children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors. III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of entinostat in children with recurrent or refractory cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of entinostat within the confines of a phase 1 study. II. To assess change in histone H3 and H4 acetylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as a marker of the biologic activity of entinostat. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive entinostat orally (PO) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 13 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>

16 years of age and Lansky &gt;= 50 for patients =&lt; 16 years of age; Note: neurologic deficits in patients with CNS tumors must have been relatively stable for at least 7 days prior to study enrollment; patients who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but who are up in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the performance score Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior anticancer therapy and must meet the following minimum duration from prior anticancer directed therapy prior to enrollment; if after the required timeframe, the defined eligibility criteria are met, e.g. blood count criteria, the patient is considered to have recovered adequately Cytotoxic chemotherapy or other anticancer agents known to be myelosuppressive; the duration of this interval must be discussed with the study chair and the studyassigned research coordinator prior to enrollment Solid tumor patients: &gt;= 21 days after the last dose of cytotoxic or myelosuppressive chemotherapy (42 days if prior nitrosourea) Lymphoma patients: a waiting period prior to enrollment is not required for patients receiving standard cytotoxic maintenance chemotherapy (i.e. corticosteroid, vincristine, thioguanine[6MP], and/or methotrexate) &gt;=14 days must have elapsed after the completion of other cytotoxic therapy, with the exception of hydroxyurea, for patients not receiving standard maintenance therapy; additionally, patients must have fully recovered from all acute toxic effects of prior therapy; Note: cytoreduction with hydroxyurea must be discontinued &gt;= 24 hours prior to the start of protocol therapy Anticancer agents not known to be myelosuppressive (e.g. not associated with reduced platelet or absolute neutrophil count [ANC] counts): &gt;= 7 days must have elapsed from the last dose of agent; the duration of this interval must be discussed with the study chair and the studyassigned research coordinator prior to enrollment Antibodies: &gt;= 21 days must have elapsed from infusion of last dose of antibody, and toxicity related to prior antibody therapy must be recovered to grade =&lt; 1 Hematopoietic growth factors: &gt;= 14 days must have elapsed from the last dose of a longacting growth factor (e.g. pegfilgrastim) or 7 days for shortacting growth factor; for agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur; the duration of this interval must be discussed with the study chair and the studyassigned research coordinator Interleukins, interferons and cytokines (other than hematopoietic growth factors): &gt;= 21 days must have elapsed from the last dose of interleukins, interferon or cytokines (other than hematopoietic growth factors) Stem cell infusions (with or without traumatic brain injury [TBI]): Allogeneic (nonautologous) bone marrow or stem cell transplant, or any stem cell infusion including donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) or boost infusion: &gt;= 84 days must have elapsed from infusion and no evidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD) Autologous stem cell infusion including boost infusion: &gt;= 42 days must have elapsed from infusion Cellular therapy: &gt;= 42 days must have elapsed from last dose of any type of cellular therapy (e.g. modified T cells, natural killer [NK] cells, dendritic cells, etc.) External beam radiation (XRT)/External beam irradiation including protons: &gt;= 14 days must have elapsed after local XRT;
