	<brief_summary>This is an open label phase I trial designed to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicities, pharmacokinetics, and activity of the combination of alsertib (MLN8237) and brentuximab vedotin in patients with relapsed/refractory CD30-positive lymphomas and solid malignancies. Cohorts of 3-6 patients will receive escalating or de-escalating doses of MLN8237 based on a 3 + 3 design.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alsertib (MLN8237) and Brentuximab Vedotin for Relapsed/Refractory CD30-Positive Lymphomas and Solid Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an investigator-initiated, open label phase I trial designed to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), pharmacokinetics, and activity of brentuximab vedotin in combination with MLN8237 in patients with relapsed/refractory CD30-positive lymphomas and solid malignancies. Brentuximab vedotin at a fixed dose of 1.8 mg/kg will be administered on Day 1 every three weeks as a 30-minute outpatient intravenous infusion. MLN8237 will be orally administered in two divided doses from Days 1-7. The starting dose (level 0) of MLN8237 will be 60 mg daily given in two divided doses (30 mg qAM, 30 mg qPM).The dose of MLN8237 will be escalated in 20-mg increments up to 100 mg daily and de-escalated in 20-mg decrements to 40 mg daily. The fixed dose of brentuximab vedotin on Day 1 and daily dose of MLN8237 on Day 1-7 will constitute one treatment cycle. If no DLTs are observed in the last study cohort, the cohort will be expanded to include a total of 12 patients. If a de-escalation dose is required because 2 or more patients experience DLTs, the next lower cohort will be studied. If 2 or more patients do not experience DLTs, this dose will be declared the MTD. This cohort will be expanded to include 12 patients in order to study the biological endpoints and clinical benefit of the combination. If at any point during the expansion cohort phase of the trial 33% or more of the patients treated at the MTD/maximum administered dose experience a DLT, accrual of additional patients at this does level will cease and the next lowest dose may be explored.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any studyrelated procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care; Relapsed or refractory CD30positive lymphoma such as Hodgkin's and anaplastic large cell lymphoma or CD30positive cancer such as testicular embryonal carcinoma, cutaneous angiosarcoma, and nasopharyngeal nonkeratinizing carcinoma or any CD30positive solid tumor. CD30 positivity is defined as ≥ 25% CD30 expression by immunohistochemistry. (CD30 analysis will be performed by an inhouse CLIA and CAPaccredited laboratory); Male or female patients aged ≥ 18 years; Adequate cardiac function (cardiac ejection fraction of ≥ 45%); Patients must have received at least two prior therapies for CD30positive lymphoma or solid malignancy; Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1500/mm³, platelets &gt; 100,000/mm³, and hemoglobin &gt; 8 g/dL. Values must be obtained without the need for myeloid growth factor or platelet transfusion support within 14 days of the first dose of the study treatment; however, erythrocyte growth factor is allowed as per the American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines; Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) &lt; 2.5 x ULN. AST and/or ALT may be up to 5 x ULN if liver metastases are present; Adequate renal function as defined by a serum creatinine of &lt; 2.0 mg/dL and calculated creatinine clearance of ≥ 30 mL/minute; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2; Female patients must be either: postmenopausal for at least one year before the screening visit, or surgically sterilized, or willing to use an acceptable method of birth control (i.e., hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the duration of the study; Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., postvasectomy status), must agree to use an acceptable contraceptive method during the course of the study and for 4 months after the last dose of alisertib. Radiation therapy to more than 25% of the bone marrow. Whole pelvic radiation is considered to be over 25%; Prior allogeneic bone marrow or organ transplantation; Expected survival of less than 4 weeks; Known gastrointestinal (GI) disease or GI procedures that could interfere with the oral absorption of or tolerance to alisertib. Examples include but are not limited to partial gastrectomy, history of small intestine surgery, and celiac disease; Known history of uncontrolled sleep apnea syndrome and other conditions that could result in excessive daytime sleepiness, such as severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Known cerebral or meningeal disease (Hodgkin's lymphoma or any other etiology), including signs or symptoms of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; Symptomatic neurologic disease that compromises normal activities of daily living or requires medication; Requirement for constant or intermittent administration of a proton pump inhibitor, a H2 antagonist, or pancreatic enzymes.
