	<brief_summary>Healthy volunteers are observationally wearing an intraoral device with bovine tooth samples once for two hours. Afterwards, Calcium release from the bovine enamel and dentin samples is measured after extraoral erosion. Total protein concentration within the formed salivary pellicles on the bovine samples is determined. Further Salivary parameters (unstimulated and stimulated saliva flow rate, pH, buffer capacity, albumin and total protein content as well as concentration of inorganic calcium, phosphate and fluoride) are being measured. The aim of this study is to investigate whether gender differences in the salivary composition correlate with predisposition to erosion.</brief_summary>
