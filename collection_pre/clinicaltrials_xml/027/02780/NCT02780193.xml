	<detailed_description>Therapy with Omegaven will be initiated and maintained at 1 g/kg/day in subjects with parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis and prolonged parenteral nutrition dependence who qualify for expanded access. It will be infused intravenously through either a central or peripheral catheter in conjunction with parenteral nutrition. If additional non-protein calories are needed, they will be provided as carbohydrates. No other parenteral form of fat emulsion will be used during Omegaven therapy unless the subject is not receiving adequate calories and additional dextrose may not be administered to the subject because of severe persistent hyperglycemia, respiratory compromise, or other clinical conditions, or unless the patient develops essential fatty acid deficiency as confirmed by laboratory parameters. The same standards of care provided to all subjects receiving parenteral nutrition solution will be followed. Regular PN monitoring will be accomplished by analyzing clinical and laboratory parameters, including serum electrolytes, hematological studies, renal function, hepatic function, blood clotting factors, protein and nutrition status and trace mineral status. An essential fatty acid profile and lipid panel will be sampled from the subject to monitor the effects of Omegaven. Blood will be sampled for an essential fatty acid profile and lipid panel before beginning Omegaven, weekly while the patient is on Omegaven and has a direct (conjugated) bilirubin ≥ 2 mg/dL, and then monthly while the patient is on Omegaven and has a direct (conjugated) bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dL. Subjects will also be monitored daily for clinical signs and symptoms of essential fatty acid deficiency, including dermatitis and hair loss. Dose reduction and titration or discontinuation will occur if there is evidence of hypertriglyceridemia (serum triglycerides &gt; 200 mg/dL), allergic response, toxicity or evidence of bleeding that is believed to be caused or worsened by Omegaven. If lipid intolerance develops, defined as serum triglyceride level &gt; 200 mg/dL, lipids will be stopped for at least 4 hours and a repeat serum triglyceride level will be obtained. If the triglycerides continue to remain high a dosage reduction of 25% of the current dose will be considered. Growth indices include weight, length, and head circumference will also be monitored. The Omegaven dose may be discontinued if the subject is receiving adequate enteral nutrition to meet metabolic and growth needs. Subjects will receive follow-up visits per the customary medical (GI) or surgical follow-up schedule for a period of 36 months after discontinuation of Omegaven. Follow up visits will occur at least annually, but may be more frequent based on the subjects' tolerance of and weight gain on enteral nutrition. As previously mentioned, Omegaven will be infused in the same manner as conventional fat emulsions through either a central or peripheral line. The emulsion is isotonic. It is compatible with parenteral nutrition solutions and may be co-infused via y-site. Source containers will be changed every 24 hours and unused product discarded. Omegaven may be infused through a 1.2 micron inline filter.</detailed_description>
