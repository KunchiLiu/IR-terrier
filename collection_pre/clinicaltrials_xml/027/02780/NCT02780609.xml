	<brief_summary>Phase I: The primary purpose of this study phase is to determine the best dose also referred to as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Selinexor when used in combination with high-dose melphalan as a conditioning regimen for hematopoietic cell transplant. Phase II: The primary purpose of this study phase is to assess the complete response (CR) conversion rate.</brief_summary>
