	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the natural history of the hereditary forms of nephrolithiasis and chronic kidney disease (CKD), primary hyperoxaluria (PH), cystinuria, Dent disease and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency (APRTd) and acquired enteric hyperoxaluria (EH). The investigator will measure blood and urinary markers of inflammation and determine relationship to the disease course. Cross-comparisons among the disorders will allow us to better evaluate mechanisms of renal dysfunction in these disorders.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Severe, hereditary forms of nephrolithiasis cause marked excretion of insoluble minerals important in stone formation, including primary hyperoxaluria, cystinuria, Dent disease, and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency (APRTd). Patients with these disorders experience recurring stones from childhood and are at high risk for chronic kidney disease caused by crystal nephropathy. Enteric hyperoxaluria is an acquired disease characterized by hyperoxaluria and calcium oxalate crystal nephropathy associated with chronic kidney disease, and in that respect similar to the inherited stone diseases. The investigators will collect longitudinal data of individual patients in order to provide clues about potentially modifiable factors that influence disease severity and identify factors leading to kidney injury. the investigator will measure blood and urinary markers of inflammation and determine relationship to the disease course. Cross-comparisons among the disorders will allow to better evaluate mechanisms of renal dysfunction in these diseases.</detailed_description>
