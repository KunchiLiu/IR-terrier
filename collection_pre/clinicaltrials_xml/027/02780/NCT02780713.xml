	<brief_summary>This is a phase 1 open label single centre study of AZD9496 administered orally in healthy volunteers. The study design involves single administration of different forms, formulations and doses of AZD9496. The study is designed to investigate these different AZD9496 variants. The study will evaluate the pharmacokinetic profiles and the safety and tolerability of the different forms, formulations and doses of AZD9496 This is a fixed sequence study with 5-sequential treatment periods in healthy volunteers. Each volunteer will receive 5 single doses of AZD9496 in different forms, formulations and doses.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A phase 1, open-label, single centre study to assess the pharmacokinetics, Safety and tolerability of different forms, formulations and doses of AZD9496 in healthy volunteers. This is a fixed sequence study with 5-sequential treatment periods. Each subject will receive 5 single doses of AZD9496 in different forms, formulations and doses. - Treatment period one will assess AZD9496 Variant A: 100mg. - Treatment period two will assess AZD9496 Reference form: 100mg. - Treatment period 3 will assess one of AZD9496 Variants, B, C or D: 100mg. - Treatment period 4 will assess one of AZD9496 Variants, B, C or D: 100mg. - Treatment period 5 will assess one of AZD9496 Variants A, B, C or D: *300mg. *Based on a review of pharmacokinetic and safety results from Treatment Periods 1, 3 and 4, a lower dose of 200 mg may be administered in Treatment Period 5.</detailed_description>

Values for AST, ALT, TBL, GGT and ALP must be at or below the upper limit of normal ranges at screening. 1. History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the study, or influence the results or the subject's ability to participate in the study. 2. History or presence of gastrointestinal (GI), hepatic or renal disease, or any other condition known to interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs. 3. Any clinically significant illness, medical/surgical procedure, or trauma within 4 weeks of the first administration of IMP. 4. Previous history of venous or arterial thromboembolism or thrombophilia. 5. History of endometrial polyps, endometrial cancer, atypical endometrial hyperplasia, or other endometrial disorders unless subjects have undergone total hysterectomy and there is no evidence of active disease (females only). 6. Any clinically significant abnormalities in clinical chemistry (other than Inclusion no.6), hematology, or urinalysis results at screening, as judged by the investigator. 7. Any clinically significant abnormal findings in supine vital signs, after 10 minutes of supine rest, at screening and/or admission to the unit, defined as: (a) Systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg or ≥ 150 mmHg (b) Diastolic blood pressure &lt; 50 mmHg or ≥ 95 mmHg and (c) Heart rate &lt; 45 or &gt; 90 beats per minute 8. Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of the resting 12lead ECG that, as judged by the investigator, that may interfere with the interpretation of QTc interval changes, including abnormal STTwave morphology or pronounced left ventricular hypertrophy. 9. Prolonged QTcF &gt; 460 ms for females and QTcF &gt; 450 ms for males or family history of long QT syndrome. 10. PR (PQ) interval shortening &lt; 110 ms or evidence of ventricular preexcitation). 11. PR (PQ) interval prolongation &gt; 240 ms, intermittent second (Wenckebach block while asleep is not exclusive) or third degree AV block. 12. Persistent or intermittent complete bundle branch block with QRS &gt; 120 ms or evidence of pronounced ventricular hypertrophy or preexcitation. 13.

Known or suspected history of drug abuse, as judged by the investigator. 15. Current smokers or those who have smoked or used nicotine products within the 3 months prior to screening. 16. Known or suspected history of alcohol or drug abuse or excessive intake of alcohol, as judged by the investigator. 17. Positive screen for drugs of abuse, alcohol or cotinine at screening or on each admission to the unit. 18. History of severe allergy/hypersensitivity or ongoing allergy/hypersensitivity, as judged by the investigator or history of hypersensitivity to drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to AZD9496. 19. Excessive intake of caffeine/xanthine containing drinks or food (e.g., coffee, tea, chocolate), as judged by the investigator. 20. Use of drugs with enzymeinducing properties such as St John's Wort within 3 weeks prior to the first administration of IMP. 21. Use of any prescribed or nonprescribed medication including antacids, analgesics (other than paracetamol/acetaminophen), herbal remedies, megadose vitamins (intake of 20 to 600 times the recommended daily dose) and minerals during the 2 weeks prior to the first administration of IMP or longer if the medication has a long halflife Note: Hormonal replacement therapy is not allowed for females. 22.
