	<brief_summary>This study investigates whether an individualized exercise program, including a personal trainer, can improve cardiovascular status quantified with ultrasound to assess coronary flow reserve and other non-invasive techniques. The subjects in the study will be divided into two groups; one group will have a personalized exercise- and nutrition program and the other group will have acess to a gym membership, but no personal trainer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Personalized Training Program on Coronary Flow Reserve in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary heart disease is one of our most common diseases that causes significant morbidity and mortality. Because the risk of serious cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and death, is evident in this patient population, it is of utmost importance to develop diagnostic methods to identify patients at risk. The most appropriate diagnostic methods are those that are safe to implement for both patient and physician, but also accessible and cost-efficient. By using non-invasive techniques such as ultrasound, coronary artery function can be examined as coronary flow reserve (CFR). In the platform of non-invasive techniques used by the investigators for examinations of cardiovascular status, other methods are included, such as measurement of intima-media thickness in the carotid and radial arteries. The investigators goal is to compare the group with the personalized program with its placebo, and to compare the two study-groups with each other, to investigate whether the personalized program provides greater health benefits.</detailed_description>
