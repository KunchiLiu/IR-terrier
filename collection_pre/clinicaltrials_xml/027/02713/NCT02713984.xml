	<brief_summary>Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) therapy has not yet been fully explored in solid tumors. Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2(HER2) is widely expressed in cancers. Investigators have developed anti-HER2 CAR-modified T cells and validated the efficiency targeting HER2-positive cancer in preclinical studies. This study is aimed to confirm its adverse effects including cytokine storm response and any other adverse effects. In addition, CAR-T cells persistence, tumor elimination and disease status after treatment will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
