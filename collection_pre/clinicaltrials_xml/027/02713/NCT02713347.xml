	<brief_summary>Chronic heart failure (CHF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are common serious illnesses. Despite disease-specific medical care for CHF and COPD, people with either illness are often left with poor quality of life (i.e., burdensome symptoms, impaired function). Furthermore, while CHF and COPD are leading causes of hospitalization and mortality, few people with either illness engage in advance care planning, the process of considering and communicating healthcare values and goals. The investigators are conducting a randomized clinical trial to study a symptom management, psychosocial care and advance care planning intervention to improve quality of life. The study is important because it aims to improve quality of life and provision of care according to peoples' goals and preferences in common, burdensome illnesses. Furthermore, this study will generate information that supports the broader dissemination and implementation of the intervention and informs the development of future palliative care and team-based interventions in the VA.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic heart failure (CHF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have commonalities that make them ideal for early palliative care provided alongside disease-specific treatments. Quality of life is reduced in both illnesses because, despite disease-specific treatments, the same symptoms (e.g., shortness of breath, fatigue) often persist in CHF and COPD. Quality of life is also reduced because between 50-60% of people with either illness have clinically significant depressive symptoms. Finally, while CHF and COPD are leading causes of hospitalization and mortality, few people with either illness engage in advance care planning. Providing palliative care concomitantly with other medical care offers an important opportunity to improve quality of life and advance care planning for people with CHF or COPD. For other conditions such as lung cancer, when provided early, prior to the end of life, palliative care improves quality of life, depressive symptoms, and survival while reducing health care utilization. While palliative care has been well-studied in patients with advanced cancer, it has not been adequately studied in CHF or COPD. The goal of this proposal is to determine whether the benefits of early palliative care extend to CHF and COPD. The investigators developed and demonstrated early success with a patient-centered palliative care intervention to improve quality of life (i.e., symptoms, function) and advance care planning in CHF and COPD. The intervention consists of the following components: (1) algorithm-guided management of breathlessness, fatigue, and pain, provided by a nurse; the algorithms supplement disease-focused treatments with palliative and behavioral treatments; (2) a 6-session psychosocial care program targeting adjustment to illness and depression, provided by a social worker; and (3) engagement of patients and providers in advance care planning. The nurse and social worker are teamed with a palliative care specialist and representative primary care provider in brief weekly meetings. The team is integrated into primary care through nurse interaction with primary care providers and through electronic medical record (CPRS) communication. The investigators will conduct a hybrid effectiveness and implementation study. Population-based sampling methods will be used to enroll 300 Veterans with CHF or COPD who have poor quality of life and are at high risk for hospitalization or death. The primary aim is to test the effectiveness of the intervention in a randomized controlled trial (intervention vs. enhanced usual care) in two VA health care systems. In a secondary aim, the investigators will examine the implementation of the intervention to guide future implementation and dissemination, increase the relevance to operational partners, and maximize the effectiveness of subsequent palliative care and team-based interventions. Aim 1: Determine the effect of the intervention on (a) quality of life as a primary outcome, and (b) depression, symptom burden, advance care planning communication and documentation, disease-specific health status, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and mortality as secondary outcomes. Aim 2: Examine the implementation of the intervention. Aim 2a: Assess the degree, barriers, and facilitators of implementation of various components. Identify which intervention components and processes are most critical from the perspectives of patients, intervention team members, and primary care providers whose patients received the intervention. Aim 2b. Evaluate the resources (e.g., personnel time and other costs) associated with the intervention, and estimate the resources needed for implementation and maintenance in other VA settings. The proposed study is significant because it addresses patient-centered needs in illnesses that are major sources of disability. The study is innovative because it tests the effectiveness of palliative care in CHF and COPD, leading causes of death among Veterans. In addition, the intervention is integrated into primary care, and the intervention components are structured to ease replication, implementation, and dissemination.</detailed_description>
