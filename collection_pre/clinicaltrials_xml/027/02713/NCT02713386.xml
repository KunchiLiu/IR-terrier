	<brief_summary>This phase I/II partially randomized trial studies the side effects and the best dose of ruxolitinib phosphate when given together with paclitaxel and carboplatin and to see how well they work in treating patients with stage III-IV epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Ruxolitinib phosphate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving ruxolitinib phosphate together with paclitaxel and carboplatin may be a better treatment for epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ruxolitinib Phosphate, Paclitaxel, and Carboplatin in Treating Patients With Stage III-IV Epithelial Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether treatment with ruxolitinib in combination with conventional neoadjuvant and post-surgical chemotherapy is safe and tolerable in the primary therapy for epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma. (Phase I) II. Demonstrate whether treatment with ruxolitinib in combination with conventional neoadjuvant and post-surgical chemotherapy results in a prolonged progression-free survival when compared to chemotherapy alone, in primary therapy for epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma. (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine if continuation of ruxolitinib as maintenance therapy in participants who complete 6 cycles of standard chemotherapy in combination with ruxolitinib and have not experienced unacceptable toxicity or disease progression is safe and tolerable. (Phase I) II. Determine the impact of ruxolitinib in combination with chemotherapy on progression-free survival as a function of proposed exploratory biomarkers - ALDH+ CD133+ (possibly also CD24+ CK19+) co-staining by AQUA immunofluorescence (IF); ratio of tumor expression of CD8:FOXP3 by immunohistochemistry (IHC); and tumor CD3, CD4, TAI-1, HLA class I and II, CD68 expression by IHC in archived tumor tissue and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 levels in pre-treatment serum. (Phase II) III. Investigate the prognostic significance of exploratory laboratory parameters in terms of both progression-free survival and overall survival in women receiving conventional chemotherapy alone. (Phase II) IV. Determine whether treatment with ruxolitinib in combination with conventional chemotherapy is associated with total gross resection rate at time of interval cytoreductive surgery. (Phase II) V. Determine whether treatment with ruxolitinib in combination with conventional chemotherapy is associated with complete pathologic response defined at interval cytoreductive surgery. (Phase II) VI. Demonstrate whether treatment with ruxolitinib in combination with conventional chemotherapy results in an improvement in overall survival in primary management of epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma. (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of ruxolitinib phosphate, followed by a phase II study. PHASE I (COURSES 1-3): Patients receive ruxolitinib phosphate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21, paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15, and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 6 weeks after completion of course 3, patients undergo tumor reductive surgery (TRS). PHASE I (COURSES 4-6): Within 4 weeks of TRS, patients receive ruxolitinib phosphate PO BID on days 1-21, paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15, and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. If TRS is not performed due to non-response or medical contraindications and criteria for discontinuation of protocol therapy have not been met, patients should resume ruxolitinib phosphate, paclitaxel, and carboplatin within 6 weeks of completing course 3 of therapy. MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Within 3 weeks after completion of course 6, patients receive ruxolitinib phosphate PO BID. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I (COURSES 1-3): Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo TRS. ARM I (COURSES 4-6): Within 4 weeks of surgery (within 6 weeks of completion of course 3 in patients who do not undergo TRS), patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II (COURSES 1-3): Patients receive ruxolitinib phosphate PO BID on days 1-21 and paclitaxel and carboplatin as in arm I. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo TRS. ARM II (COURSES 4-6): Within 4 weeks of surgery (within 6 weeks of completion of course 3 in patients who do not undergo TRS), patients receive ruxolitinib phosphate PO BID on days 1-21 and paclitaxel and carboplatin as in arm I. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients in phase I are followed up until resolution of adverse events, and patients in phase II are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>
