	<brief_title>Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line Medicaid Incentive Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous research on providing incentives for healthy behaviors has shown that financial incentives can increase treatment participation and boost outcomes when they are tied to participation in evidence based treatments. However, most of this research has been done in laboratory settings and in relatively small clinical trials. This study is designed to test the hypotheses that incentives can increase both participation in smoking cessation treatment and resulting cessation rates, when they are offered to Wisconsin BadgerCare Plus (Medicaid) smokers as part of their health care. If successful, this treatment approach could be used more broadly to reduce the considerable financial and personal costs associated with smoking-related disease. Participants in the study are randomized to receive no incentive for participation in treatment and successful quitting or incentives.</detailed_description>
