	<brief_title>Advanced Cancer Patients Decision Making and Family Communication About Secondary Findings From Tumor Genomic Profiling</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will conduct a prospective, observational study with advanced cancer patients undergoing tumor genomic profiling (n = 300) and their family members (anticipated n â‰ˆ 150). Data collection will occur through an embedded mixed methods design, in which both quantitative (i.e., survey) and qualitative (i.e., semi-structured interview) data are collected at the same timepoint in order to obtain a more complete understanding of specific processes and outcomes. They will be recruited from those who already enrolled in protocol #12-245, and who agree to receive their secondary findings through Consent Part C of this existing protocol.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients: 18 years of age or older Has consented to MSK IRB protocol #12245, Consent A and Part C on the same day Has not received secondary findings as a result of MSK IRB protocol #12245, Consent Part C as per EMR and/or patient report Diagnosed with stage IV solid tumor or metastatic cancer as per EMR and/or clinician judgment Englishfluent; the surveys were designed and validated in English and are not currently available in other languages. Translation of questionnaires into other languages would require reestablishing the reliability and validity of these measures. Therefore, participants must be able to communicate in English to complete the surveys. Family members: 18 years of age or older as per self report Nominated by the patient participant as a family member with whom the secondary findings have been shared (spouses/partners are eligible as "family members" for the purposes of this study) Englishfluent; the surveys were designed and validated in English and are not currently available in other languages. Translation of questionnaires into other languages would require reestablishing the reliability and validity of these measures. Therefore, participants must be able to communicate in English to complete the surveys. Received genetic testing in the past that resulted in a pathogenic finding or a variant of unknown significance as reported in the EMR. Major psychiatric illness or cognitive impairment that in the judgment of the investigator or study staff would preclude study participation Any patients who are unable to comply with the study procedures as determined by the study investigators or study staff.</criteria>
