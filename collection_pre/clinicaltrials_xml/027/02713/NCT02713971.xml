	<brief_summary>Background: In this study, a new biofeedback system for balance and gait rehabilitation (Gamepad) was developed. The system, based on wearable inertial sensors, provides users with real-time visual and acoustic feedback about their movement during functional tasks. Gamepad was applied on subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) in a pilot randomized controlled trial to investigate its feasibility and efficacy versus conventional physiotherapy. The investigators hypothesized that Gamepad system can be easily applied in clinical settings and that biofeedback training with Gamepad provides larger improvements of balance and gait in PD subjects, respect to conventional physiotherapy. Methods: Forty-two PD patients underwent a 20-session training for balance and gait (45 minutes per session, 3 sessions per week). Participants were randomized into Gamepad Group (biofeedback rehabilitation with Gamepad system), and Control Group (conventional physiotherapy). Clinical and instrumental assessments were performed by a blind examiner pre-, post-intervention and at 1-month follow-up.</brief_summary>
