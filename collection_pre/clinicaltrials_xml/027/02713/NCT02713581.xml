	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to search for, in vitro, elements associated with IgG-dependent monocyte activation (signaling pathway activation, expression of pro-coagulant and pro-inflammatory factors) and to describe their prevalence in female patients with a history of proximal venous thromboembolism (proximal deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) compared to control women.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of this study include to compare the IgG-dependent monocyte activation profiles as a function of laboratory thrombophilia parameters. Essentially: Is IgG-dependent cell activation associated with the presence of anti-phospholipid antibodies (or their subtypes?), or do these profiles indicate something beyond the nosology of anti-phospholipid syndrome?</detailed_description>
