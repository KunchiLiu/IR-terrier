	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to find out if combining thermal ablation (using a laser to heat tumor tissue in order to shrink the tumor size) and spine stereotactic radiosurgery (SSRS--a method for giving radiation) can help control cancer that has spread to the spine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thermal Ablation and Stereotactic Spine Radiosurgery (SSRS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SSRS Simulation: If you are eligible and agree to take part in this study, you will have a computed tomography (CT) simulation. A simulation is like a planning session for your SSRS. For this, a bag filled with small foam beads is formed to your body and then the air is vacuumed out. This creates a mold that you will lie in so that the doctors can plan the radiation treatment that you will receive. This mold will then be used to keep you from moving during SSRS. If the study doctor thinks it is needed, a meshed plastic mask will also be used to fit to your head and neck area to help accuracy during SSRS. If a mask is used, you will still be able to breathe normally. Thermal Ablation: You will then have the thermal ablation procedure. Thermal ablation heats the tumor tissue using a laser, and this helps to shrink the tumor by destroying tumor cells. This procedure will be performed while you are under general anesthesia. You will sign a separate consent for thermal ablation that explains the details of the procedure and its risks. When you are on the operating table, images will be taken of the compressed area and transferred to a computer. This will be used to help guide the laser. This procedure should last about 6 hours. After that, you will be admitted to the hospital. Spine Stereotactic Radiosurgery: Within 2 weeks after thermal ablation, you will have SSRS. You will lie in the mold and/or mask that was made for you during the simulation. Radiation treatment will last up to 2 hours. Multiple images will be used to make sure you are in the right position before you receive treatment. The procedure itself usually takes less than 30 minutes. After treatment, you will be free to leave the clinic. You will sign a separate consent for this procedure that explains the risks. Follow-Up: You will have follow-up visits at Months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and then every 6 months after that. At each follow-up visit: - You will have a neurological exam. - You will complete the same 3 questionnaires from screening. - You will have an MRI of the spine to check the status of disease. If you are unable to return for follow-up visits, you will be called and asked about your medical history and will complete the 3 questionnaires over the phone. This call should take about 20 minutes each time at the schedule above. Length of Study Participation: Your active participation in this study will be over after you complete the follow-up visits/calls. This is an investigational study. Thermal ablation is FDA approved for treatment of soft tissue tumors. SSRS is delivered using established and commercially available methods, to patients with cancer that has spread to the spine. The combination of thermal ablation and SSRS to treat cancer that has spread to the spine with tumor in the spinal canal is investigational. Up to 60 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. At least 18 years of age. 2. Histologic diagnosis of solid malignant tumor (not one of the more radiosensitive histologic subtypes, see Exclusion Criteria), including but not limited to nonsmall cell lung cancer, breast, prostate, renal cell, melanoma, gastrointestinal, sarcoma, thyroid, head and neck primary, and unknown primary tumors. 3. Quantification of the degree of epidural spinal cord compression as grade 1C, 2, or 3 by MRI, with and without contrast sequences. Axial T2 sequence is encouraged but not required. 4. The vertebral body site to be treated must be located from T2T12. 5. No more than 3 contiguous or discontiguous vertebral levels involved with metastasis in the spine to be irradiated in a single session or 3 sessions. 6. Motor strength &gt;/=4 out of 5 in extremity or extremities affected by the level of the spinal cord compression (see section 4 for grading method). 7. ECOG performance status &lt;/=2 or Karnofsky performance status (KPS) &gt;/=50 8. Life expectancy &gt;3 months. 9. Inoperable disease because of patient refusal, neurosurgical evaluation, or any other medical reasons. 10. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) before study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. 11. Prior conventional radiation to the same site is allowed as long as there is a greater than 3 months interval. 12. All patients must sign informed consent forms verifying that they are aware of the investigational nature of this study in keeping with the rules and policies of MD Anderson Cancer Center. The only acceptable consent form is one approved by the MD Anderson institutional review board. 13. Patients who do not have other options of treatment, based on consensus recommendation of the multidisciplinary spine SRS (SSRS) tumor board. Patients will have an appropriate medical oncologist for their disease. 1. Primary tumors of radiosensitive histology (lymphoma, multiple myeloma, small cell carcinoma, germ cell tumors), as conventional radiation is likely to be effective in such cases. 2. Prior conventional irradiation of the spine site and level to be treated with an interval shorter than 3 months. 3. Lesions located outside of the spinal segments of T2 to T12. 4. Prior surgery to the same levels of spine. 5. Inability to lie flat on a treatment table for &gt;60 minutes. 6. Unable to undergo MRI of the spine 7. Pregnancy (because radiation has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects). 8. Frank cord compression or cord compression from bone components or configuration and acute neurological deficits (defined as motor strength &lt;4/5 in extremity or extremities affected by the level of the spinal cord compression).</criteria>
