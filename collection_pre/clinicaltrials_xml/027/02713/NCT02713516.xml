	<brief_summary>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with fear provoking exposures is the most effective therapy for anxiety disorders. Investigators aim to enhance this therapy with the use of virtual reality exposures and to make therapy more available and accessible for patients with anxiety disorders. The societal benefit of increased access to therapy is that, if successful, it will increase the number of patients who receive appropriate treatment for an anxiety disorder.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Virtual Reality System to Increase Access to Exposure Therapy for Anxiety and OCD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty children with CADs or OCD who have received less than 3 treatment sessions and a parent will be recruited to pilot the VR system. Participants will be identified through the Mayo Clinic Pediatric Anxiety Disorders Clinic. Each patient will participate in a single (up to) 2-hour visit. During the first 30 minutes the patient and parent will be introduced to the VR system and the rationale for this feasibility study. Next, a therapist will lead the patient through exposure exercises using the VR system for up to 30 minutes. During the next period, up to 30 minutes, the therapist will go to a different room and the patient, with support from their parent, will complete exposure exercises using the VR system that the therapist directed them to complete. During the exposures the interviewer will observe, code and record the patient's interaction with the VR system. For the remaining time (up to 30 minutes) the interviewer will interview the patient about his or her experience with the VR system and then will ask for observations and opinions from the parent.</detailed_description>
