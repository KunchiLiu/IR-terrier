	<brief_summary>This prospective Medical College of Wisconsin Cancer Center study will evaluate stress levels in breast cancer patients undergoing genetic testing. It aims to establish baseline stress levels, evaluate pre- and post-test stress levels at multiple time points, focus on the changes in stress levels for the different resulting subgroups. This will help the clinical staff to provide better care for patients both medically and psychologically through potential interventions to decrease stress.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating the Effects of Genetic Testing on Patients' Stress Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women (ACS, 2013). Genetic screening has also become increasingly important in treating breast cancer patients, with 5-10% of breast cancers linked to mutations in BRCA1/2 genes(Miki, 1994) (Wooster, 1995). As the field of genetic testing has rapidly expanded and multigene panels are now available, it is unclear what psychological consequences have resulted from the knowledge gained from these tests. RATIONALE: Breast cancer clinicians frequently employ genetic testing with breast cancer patients. It is unclear what psychological consequences have resulted from the knowledge gained from these tests. A literature review reveals that results are contradictory in terms of determining stress levels related to test results. This is due to different study methodologies. The Medical College of Wisconsin Cancer Center researchers will generate more definitive answers through a prospective study that will establish baseline stress levels, evaluate pre- and post- test stress levels at multiple time points, focus on the changes in stress levels for the different resulting subgroups. Evaluating the impact of genetic testing on stress levels will help health care professionals to better understand the consequences of genetic testing, and thus, provide better care for patients both medically and psychologically through potential interventions to decrease stress. STUDY PROCEDURES: Patients will be contacted by phone after their genetic counseling appointment is made, prior to their visit by a member of the research team. After giving informed consent, patients will be provided with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) for Adults handout to measure their baseline anxiety, as well as the Health Anxiety Inventory and the Cancer Worry Scale to measure their baseline health anxiety and several additional demographic questions. Subjects will complete the validated questionnaires privately and then return them to the genetic counselor. The data collected at this time point will measure their stress levels before genetic counseling and testing. Patients will be contacted by phone four more times to take the HAI and CWS survey over the phone (one week after receiving genetic testing results, which is three weeks after the consult; at five weeks; three months and six months).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Females 18 years or older.

Prior genetic testing for breast cancer. Patient is a referral for genetic testing from an outside hospital system for whom there is no access to outside medical records. Past medical history of breast cancer (not including a current diagnosis of breast cancer within the past six months). Current or past history of ovarian cancer. Known family history of a BRCA1/2 mutation or cancer susceptibility genetic mutation.
