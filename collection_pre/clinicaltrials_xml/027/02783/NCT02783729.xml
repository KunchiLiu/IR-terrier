	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate using polysomnography (PSG) that 10 mg lemborexant is superior to zolpidem tartrate extended release 6.25 mg (Ambien CR®) on objective sleep maintenance as assessed by wake after sleep onset in the second half of the night (WASO2H) after the last 2 nights of treatment in participants 55 years and older with insomnia disorder.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Lemborexant in Subjects 55 Years and Older With Insomnia Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active comparator, parallel-group study of 2 dose levels of lemborexant for approximately 6 weeks in approximately 950 participants, 55 years or older with insomnia disorder. Participants will be males 65 years or older or females 55 years or older. At least 60% of the participants will be age 65 years or older. The study will have 2 phases: The Prerandomization Phase and the Randomization Phase. Including both phases, the study will last for a minimum of 65 and a maximum of 81 days per participant.</detailed_description>

Meets the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition criteria for Insomnia Disorder, as follows: Complains of dissatisfaction with nighttime sleep, in the form of difficulty staying asleep and/or awakening earlier in the morning than desired despite adequate opportunity for sleep (Note that if the complaint is limited to difficulty initiating sleep, the participant is not eligible) Frequency of complaint ≥ 3 times per week Duration of complaint ≥ 3 months Associated with complaint of daytime impairment 3. History of subjective wake after sleep onset (sWASO) typically ≥ 60 minutes on at least 3 nights per week in the previous 4 weeks 4. Reports regular time spent in bed, either sleeping or trying to sleep, between 7 and 9 hours 5. Reports habitual bedtime, defined as the time the participant attempts to sleep, between 21:00 and 24:00 and habitual waketime between 05:00 and 09:00 6. Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score ≥ 15 7. Confirmation of current insomnia symptoms as determined from responses on the Sleep Diary before the second screening visit 8. Confirmation of regular bedtime and waketime as determined from responses on the Sleep Diary 9. Confirmation of sufficient duration of time spent in bed, as determined from responses on the Sleep Diary 10. Objective (PSG) evidence of insomnia as follows: 1. Wake after sleep onset (WASO) average ≥ 60 minutes on the 2 consecutive PSGs, with neither night &lt; 45 minutes, AND 2. Sleep Efficiency (SE) average ≤ 85% on the 2 consecutive PSGs, with neither night &gt; 87.5% Exclusion Criteria 1. A current diagnosis of sleeprelated breathing disorder, periodic limb movement disorder, restless legs syndrome, circadian rhythm sleep disorder, or narcolepsy, or an exclusionary score on screening instruments to rule out individuals with symptoms of certain sleep disorders other than insomnia 2. Reports symptoms potentially related to narcolepsy, that in the clinical opinion of the investigator indicates the need for referral for a diagnostic evaluation for the presence of narcolepsy 3. On the Munich Parasomnia Scale (MUPS), (a) a history of symptoms of Rapid Eye Movement (REM) Behavior Disorder, sleeprelated violent behavior, sleepdriving, or sleepeating, or (b) symptoms of another parasomnia that in the investigator's opinion make the participant unsuitable for the study 4. ApneaHypopnea Index &gt; 15 or Periodic Limb Movement with Arousal Index &gt; 15 as measured on the PSG at the second screening visit 5. Beck Depression Inventory II (BDIII) score &gt; 19 at Screening 6. Beck Anxiety Index (BAI) score &gt; 15 at Screening 7. Habitually naps during the day more than 3 times per week 8. Is a female of childbearing potential Note: All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are postmenopausal (defined as amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, and are postmenopausal without other known or suspected cause), or have been sterilized surgically (ie, bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy, all with surgery at least 1 month before dosing). 9. Excessive caffeine use that in the opinion of the investigator contributes to the participant's insomnia, or habitually consumes caffeinecontaining beverages after 18:00 and is unwilling to forego caffeine after 18:00 for the duration of his/her participation in the study 10. History of drug or alcohol dependency or abuse within approximately the previous 2 years 11. Reports habitually consuming more than 14 drinks containing alcohol per week (females) or more than 21 drinks containing alcohol per week (males), or unwilling to limit alcohol intake to no more than 2 drinks per day or forego having alcohol within the 3 hours before bedtime for the duration of his/her participation in the study 12. Current evidence of clinically significant disease (eg, cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal, neurological or psychiatric disease or malignancy other than basal cell carcinoma) or chronic pain that in the opinion of the investigator(s) could affect the participant's safety or interfere with the study assessments, including the ability to perform tasks on the cognitive performance assessment battery (PAB) 13. Comorbid nocturia resulting in frequent need to get out of bed to use the bathroom during the night 14. Used any prohibited prescription or overthecounter concomitant medications within 1 week before the first dose of study medication. (A list of prohibited concomitant medications is presented in Appendix 3 of the protocol) 15. Used any modality of treatment for insomnia, including cognitive behavioral therapy or marijuana within 2 weeks before Screening 16. Failed treatment with suvorexant (Belsomra®) (efficacy and/or safety) following treatment with an appropriate dose and of adequate duration in the opinion of the investigator 17. Transmeridian travel across more than 3 time zones in the 2 weeks before Screening, or between Screening and Baseline, or plans to travel across more than 3 time zones during the study 18. Previously participated in any clinical trial of lemborexant</criteria>
