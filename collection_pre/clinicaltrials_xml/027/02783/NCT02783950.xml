	<brief_summary>To determine the impact of Decipher test results on adjuvant treatment decisions of high-risk post-RP patients with undetectable post-op prostate specific antigen (PSA) compared to clinical factors alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genomics in Michigan Impacting Observation or Radiation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective, randomized trial will compare the receipt of adjuvant therapy for high-risk radical prostatectomy (RP) patients who undergo Decipher testing to those who do not. 350 subjects from within the statewide Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC) will be randomized to either a Genomic Classifier (Decipher) or Usual-Care-Based (UC) strategy for a period of three months. If enrolled during the Genomic Classifier period, both subjects and their treating physician will be provided Decipher results and CAPRA-S scores. In the UC periods, CAPRA-S scores but not Decipher results will be provided.</detailed_description>
