	<brief_summary>The overarching goal of this proposal is to address the MedEvac foundation priority of educational techniques and technologies and improve Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) safety by determining if overall sleep quality and intra-shift fatigue of HEMS clinicians can be improved with real-time assessment and intervention. Aim 1: To determine the short-term impact of an enhanced SleepTrackTXT intervention on HEMS clinician fatigue reported in real-time during and at the end of shift work. Aim 2: To determine the long-term impact of the SleepTrackTXT intervention on sleep quality and sleep health indicators including hours of sleep and recovery between shift work.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Air-Medical Sleep Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will examine short term impact by examining self-reported fatigue captured at the start, during, and end of scheduled shifts. The investigators will determine longer-term impact on sleep quality by comparing scores on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) taken at baseline and then again at 4 months.</detailed_description>
