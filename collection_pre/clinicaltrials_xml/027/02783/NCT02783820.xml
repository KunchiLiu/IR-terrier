	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetic Profile of Ascending Oral Doses of MMV390048, Part A</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic properties of escalating single doses of reformulated MMV390048 when administered to healthy men and women of non-childbearing potential (WNCBP) under fasted conditions (Part A). Primary objectives: • To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single ascending doses of MMV390048 administered orally to healthy subjects (men and WNCBP) under fasted conditions Secondary objectives: • To describe the pharmacokinetics of MMV390048 in healthy subjects (men and WNCBP) after single oral dose administration</detailed_description>

Men or WNCBP age 18 to 55 years, in good health as determined by past medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests at screening. 3. Male subjects agree to use acceptable methods of contraception if the male subject's partner could become pregnant from the time of the first administration of study medication until 130 (90+40) days following administration of the investigational medicinal product. One of the following acceptable methods of contraception must be utilized: Condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) Surgical sterilization (vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia) and a barrier method (condom or occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps]. The subject's female partner uses oral contraceptives (combination estrogen/progesterone pills), injectable progesterone or subdermal implants and a barrier method (condom or occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps]. The subject's female partner uses medically prescribed topicallyapplied transdermal contraceptive patch and a barrier method (condom or occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps].

The subject's female partner has undergone documented placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system. In addition, a barrier method (condom or occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps]. True abstinence: when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Abstinent subjects have to agree to use 1 of the abovementioned contraceptive methods, if they start sexual relationships during the study and for up to 100 days after the last dose of study drug. 4. Women subjects must be of nonchildbearing potential (WNCBP) as per one of the following definitions: Natural (spontaneous) postmenopausal defined as being amenorrhoeic for at least 12 months without an alternative medical cause with a screening follicle stimulating hormone level consistent with local laboratory levels for postmenopause. Premenopausal with irreversible surgical sterilization by hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or salpingectomy at least 6 months before screening (as determined by subject medical history). 5. Haematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis results at screening that are within the local laboratory reference range or, if outside the range, not clinically significant as judged by the Investigator. More specifically, serum creatinine, hepatic transaminase enzymes (AST ALT), and total bilirubin (unless the subject has documented Gilbert syndrome) should not exceed the upper laboratory norm and haemoglobin must be equal to or higher than the lower limit of the normal range. 6. Total body weight greater than 50 kg and a body mass index (BMI) within the range of 18 to 32 kg/m2 (inclusive). 7. Nonsmoker or exsmoker for more than 90 days prior to screening, or smoke no more than 5 cigarettes per day as determined by history. Must be able to abstain from smoking during the inpatient stay. 8. Willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures. 9. Agree to stay in contact with the study site for the duration of the study and up to 2 weeks following the end of study visit, provide updated contact information as necessary, and have no current plans to move away from the study area for the duration of the study. 1. Male subjects with a female partner(s) who is (are) pregnant or lactating from the time of the administration of study medication. 2. Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, including women whose career, lifestyle, or sexual orientation precludes intercourse with a male partner and women whose partners have been sterilized by vasectomy or other means. 3. Evidence or history of clinically significant haematological, renal, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal (including gallbladder), cardiovascular (including a family history of long QT syndrome or sudden death), hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or allergic disease (including drug or food allergies, anaphylaxis or other severe allergic reactions but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at the time of dosing). 4. History of malignancy of any organ system (other than localised basal cell carcinoma of the skin), treated or untreated, within the past five years, regardless of whether there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases. 5. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study. 6. Any surgical or medical condition possibly affecting drug absorption (e.g. cholecystectomy, gastrectomy, bowel disease, etc.), distribution, metabolism or excretion. 7. Previous splenectomy. 8. A history of photosensitivity. 9.
