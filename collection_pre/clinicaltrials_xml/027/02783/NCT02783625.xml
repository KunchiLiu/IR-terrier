	<brief_title>Trial of Duvelisib in Combination With Either Romidepsin or Bortezomib in Relapsed/Refractory T-cell Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The phase I portion of the study is designed to determine the MTD of duvelisib with romidepsin and duvelisib with bortezomib. All patients must have a relapsed or refractory T-cell lymphoma. The design is a standard 3+3 dose escalation of two parallel phase I studies. Patients will be enrolled in Arms A (Romidepsin + duvelisib) and B (Bortezomib + duvelisib) of the study starting at dose level 1. Three to six patients will be initially treated in each dose level until the MTD is determined. If dose level 3 is achieved without exceeding one dose limiting toxicity (DLT) after 1 cycle that dose level will be deemed the "optimal dose" and the study will proceed to the cohort expansion phase. Should patients be found to develop significant toxicity or not tolerate therapy at the MTD with repeated cycles of therapy, the "optimal dose" may be determined to be at dose levels less than the MTD. Patients with measurable disease treated in the phase I at the optimal dose will be counted towards the accrual of the expansion cohorts by disease subtype and all efficacy and toxicity endpoints. Cohort Expansion Phase: The expansion cohorts will further assess toxicity and safety and allow a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of the combination to provide background for a potential future subtype specific phase II study. The assessment of efficacy will be descriptive.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pathologically confirmed Tcell lymphomas at the enrolling institution, including stage ≥ Ib CTCL, which has relapsed or progressed after at least one systemic therapy. Age ≥ 18 Previous systemic anticancer therapy must have been discontinued at least 3 weeks prior to treatment. For the cohort expansion phase, in progressing subjects, a 2 week washout may be allowed after discussion with the MSK Principal Investigator. Previous radiation and/or surgery must have been discontinued or completed at least 2 weeks prior to treatment in this study and adverse effects must have resolved to Grade 1 or baseline. Lymph node or other diagnostic biopsies within 2 weeks are not considered exclusionary. ECOG ≤ 2 Meet the following laboratory criteria without use of growth factor support or platelet transfusions for 1 week: i) Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.0 K/mcl, ii) Platelet count ≥ 80 K/μl (in the expansion cohorts, if thrombocytopenia is due to bone marrow involvement platelet count must be ≥ 50 K/μL), iii) Phase 1 patients who are not enrolled on the expansion cohorts must have calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50ml/min by CockcroftGault formula. Expansion cohort subjects must have calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 40ml/min by CockcroftGault formula. iv) Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN);AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 3 x ULN Measurable disease for expansion cohorts and lead in phases only. i) Lymphoma (includes CTCL patients who are without evidence of the disease in the skin): CT or PET/CT by modified Cheson criteria with incorporation of PET. ii) CTCL: mSWAT &gt;0, or absolute Sezary count ≥ 1000 cells/μL. Short course systemic corticosteroids for disease control, improvement of performance status or noncancer indication (&lt; 7 days) must have been discontinued at least 6 days prior to study treatment. Stable ongoing corticosteroid use (≥ 30 days) up to an equivalent dose of 20 mg of prednisone is permissible. i) Topical steroids that have been used for &gt; 3 weeks may be continued (CTCL only). Women of reproductive potential† must have a negative serum or urine β human chorionic gonadotropin (βhCG) pregnancy test. All women of reproductive potential, all sexually active male patients, and all partners of patients must agree to use adequate methods of birth control (e.g. latex condoms) throughout the study and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug. A female of reproductive potential is a sexually mature female who: has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e. has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months). Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form. Pregnant females. (Lactating females must agree not to breast feed while taking the study medications). Prior use of duvelisib if discontinued due to toxicity. For the romidepsin arm of the study, prior therapy with romidepsin if discontinued due to toxicity. For the bortezomib arm of the study, prior therapy with a proteasome inhibitor if discontinued due to toxicity. For the bortezomib arm of the study, patients with grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy. Concurrent use of other anticancer agents or treatments. History of chronic liver disease, venoocclusive disease, or current alcohol abuse. Administration of a live vaccine within 6 weeks of first dose of study drug. Prior surgery or gastrointestinal dysfunction that may affect drug absorption (e.g., gastric bypass surgery, gastrectomy) Known seropositive and requiring antiviral therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Subjects with chronic hepatitis B or C as defined as test . Subjects with positive Hep B serology. Subjects with a negative HBsAg and a positive HBcAb require an undetectable/negative hepatitis B DNA test (e.g., polymerase chain reaction [PCR] test) to be enrolled, and will require prophylactic antiviral treatment (e.g., F) initiated prior to the first dose of study drug, an continued until approximately 6 to 12 months after completion of study drug(s). Patients with positive hepatitis C virus Ab Subjects with active EBV unrelated to underlying lymphoma (positive serology for antiEBV VCA IgM antibody and negative for antiEBV EBNA IgG antibody, or clinical manifestations and positive EBV PCR consistent with active EBV infection. Subject with active CMV (positive serology for antiCMV IgM antibody and negative for antiCMV IgG antibody and positive CMV PCR with clinical manifestations consistent with active CMV infection) and requiring therapy will be excluded from participation in the study. Carriers will be monitored per institutional guidelines. Concurrent malignancy requiring active therapy. Patients with more than one type of lymphoma may be enrolled after discussion with the MSK Principal Investigator. Known central nervous system or meningeal involvement (in the absence of symptoms, investigation into central nervous system involvement is not required).
