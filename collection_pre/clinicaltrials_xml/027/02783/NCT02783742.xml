	<brief_title>Provider-Patient Communication Coaching</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator will recruit providers at Duke University and randomly assign them to receive (1) a communication coaching intervention or (2) a waitlist intervention. The investigator will survey all providers at Baseline and Follow Up. Providers randomized to the intervention arm will attend face-to-face meetings with study coaches, and have some of their encounters with patients shadowed by a coach or audio recorded. Providers will obtain verbal consent from patients to participate in the study (i.e. have their encounter shadowed or audio recorded). Providers will then be provided feedback by coaches on their communication during these encounters. Providers randomized to the waitlist intervention arm will be offered the option of receiving this intervention after they complete the follow up survey.</detailed_description>
