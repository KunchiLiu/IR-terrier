	<brief_summary>In 1997, the global prevalence of diabetes was estimated to be 125 million and this has risen to around 400 million in 2015. In addition diabetes has a number of complications including heart disease, blindness, kidney failure and amputation. This represents a significant burden on healthcare services. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The aim of GoDARTS is to recruit participants with T2D to a registry to provide a platform with which to investigate the genetics of T2D, its complications and response to treatment. This study will investigate the genetic basis of diabetic neuropathic pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research in Tayside Scotland (DOLORisk Dundee)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GoDARTS is the genetics arm of the DARTS study, which was set up to identify all diabetes patients in the Tayside region. Its aim is to improve diabetes care over and above existing practices. Participants are invited to attend to provide blood samples for DNA/RNA analysis, provide baseline anthropometric, biochemical, blood pressure and heart rate measurements as well as completing a lifestyle questionnaire containing smoking, menopausal and physical activity items. Consent is also obtained to allow anonymous linkage to electronic medical records (EMR) through use of the Community Health Index (CHI) number, a unique patient identifier that is issued to everyone registered with a general practitioner in Scotland. GoDARTS is the first EMR linked cohort in the world and provides access to individual participant longitudinal data including biochemical, comorbidity and prescription records. These are live databases and are constantly being updated. This allows for the study of genetic factors influencing T2D, its comorbidities and response to therapy. Consent has also been obtained for re-contact by collaborators, allowing for further studies of related phenotypes to take place. One of these studies is DOLORisk Dundee which aims to identify genetic and environmental risk factors for neuropathic pain.</detailed_description>
