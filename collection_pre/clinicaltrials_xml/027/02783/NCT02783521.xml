	<brief_summary>The investigators propose to 1) assess the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of a gender- and culturally-sensitive weight loss intervention in 48 overweight/obese Hispanic males ages 18-64 over 12 weeks; 2) assess participant characteristics and process measures related to the uptake of mobile-health (mHealth) technology in overweight/obese Hispanic males over 12 weeks; and 3) assess pathologic changes in the liver in Hispanic men enrolled in a 12-week weight loss intervention using a non-invasive MRI as a therapeutic response biomarker.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gender- and Culturally-Sensitive Weight Loss Intervention for Hispanic Males</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the U.S., Hispanic males have the highest rate of overweight and obesity when compared to males of other racial/ethnic groups placing them at greater risk for obesity-related disease. Yet, current literature is lacking to inform on best practices to engage Hispanic males in weight loss and/or to promote a successful weight loss trajectory. Without this information the health disparities associated with obesity and obesity-related chronic disease will continue. Evidence exists to support behavioral weight loss in reducing obesity-related health risks. There are limited data to suggest these programs are effective for men and no data to support the feasibility and effectiveness of these programs among Hispanic males despite this being the fastest growing and highest burdened group for obesity-related disease within the U.S. population. Using existing practice guidelines and evidence from recently completed in-depth qualitative interviews in overweight/obese Hispanic males, the investigators will test a novel intervention approach to address this gap in knowledge. The investigators propose to 1) assess the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of a gender- and culturally-sensitive weight loss intervention in 48 overweight/obese Hispanic males ages 18-64 over 12 weeks; 2) assess participant characteristics and process measures related to the uptake of mobile-health (mHealth) technology in overweight/obese Hispanic males over 12 weeks; and 3) assess pathologic changes in the liver in Hispanic men enrolled in a 12-week weight loss intervention using a non-invasive MRI as a therapeutic response biomarker. This project will challenge current research paradigms for Hispanic males by testing a gender- and culturally-sensitive weight loss intervention and providing highly impactful formative research on the use of novel mHealth self-monitoring technologies to facilitate dietary/physical activity behavior changes. Given the Hispanic population is the fastest growing in the U.S., efforts to identify strategies to promote weight control among Hispanic males has potential to significantly impact public health. The expected outcome of the proposed project is the identification of feasible and appropriate weight loss intervention strategies to improve engagement and weight management in this vulnerable ethnic group.</detailed_description>
