	<brief_title>MMV390048 and Its Antimalarial Activity Against Plasmodium Falciparum in Healthy Adult Subjects, Part B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pharmacodynamic profiling will also be studied to characterize the effects of MMV390048 on P. falciparum clearance kinetics in healthy subjects using the Induced Blood Stage Malaria (IBSM) challenge model to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration of MMV390048 for P. falciparum (Part B). An approximation of this concentration in healthy subjects will help to identify the optimal dose of MMV390048 for subsequent Phase 2 studies in patients. The challenge model will enable characterization of the exposure-response relationship for MMV390048 and will also provide data regarding the safety and tolerability of MMV390048 in a controlled disease-like setting.</detailed_description>
