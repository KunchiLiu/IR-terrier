	<brief_summary>It is well known that medical errors account for a large amount of patient harm within the hospital setting. This is a significant problem within the emergency context. A system that acts as a prompt, guide and scribe for the obstetric emergency has been developed called 'Mednav'. Mednav is a navigation device for the management of medical emergencies; developed at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital since 2010. This is a device which acts similar to a satellite navigation devices in the automobile industry navigating you from A to B, MedNav navigates the clinician from the unwell patient to the well patient.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Mednav, a Medical Navigation System, Aid Non-technical and Technical Skills in the Simulated Obstetric Emergency?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Potential participants will be identified by those attending mandatory training/teaching. 2 weeks before their mandatory training they will be emailed with the study information leaflet and a link to a video which explains how to use Mednav. On the morning of the mandatory training/teaching they will be approached by the practice development midwife/Chief or Principle investigator who will give them a copy of the consent form and again the study information leaflet and show the Mednav video. Eligibility criteria will be checked and the study explained, before taking written informed consent. Participants will personally sign and date the consent form, before any study specific procedures are performed. Once the team is decided, the investigators will then randomise them to use of Mednav or no mednav, The participants will then undertake a simulated management of post partum haemorrhage which will be recorded for later review. Faculty will record the timing of completion of key technical skills. A team of 8 assessors will review these simulated scenario recordings. Assessors will complete validated questionnaires to assess teamwork. Assessors will be asked to complete a technical skills list, showing timing and completion of various technical aspects of managing post partum Haemorrhage. The end of the study will be when the required sample size has been recruited or significance found on interim data analysis.</detailed_description>
