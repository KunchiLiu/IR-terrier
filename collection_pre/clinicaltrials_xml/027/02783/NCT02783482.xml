	<brief_title>Study of Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) GC5107 in Subjects With Primary Humoral Immunodeficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a prospective, open-label, single-arm, historically controlled, multicenter phase 3 study measuring the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics and tolerability of GC5107 in subjects with Primary Humoral Immunodeficiency disease (PHID). Subjects will receive intravenous infusions of the investigational product at the same dose and interval as used for their previous Immunoglobulin intravenous (IGIV) maintenance therapy. GC5107 will be administered every 21 or 28 days for a period of 12 months.</detailed_description>
