	<brief_summary>Assessing blood glucose control in women with gestational diabetes can be challenging. The standard of care remains visual inspection of blood glucose paper diaries of self-performed capillary monitoring during regular meeting in High Risk pregnancy clinics. The researchers are interested in preforming a randomized control trial comparing women with the diagnosis of gestational diabetes with regular High-Risk clinic surveillance to digital monitoring using an application in a Smart-phone and submitting those values via email in addition to the regular clinic appointments. The Primary outcome of the trial is to assess the compliance of the research group as compared to the control group.</brief_summary>
