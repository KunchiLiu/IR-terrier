	<brief_title>Effect General and Regional Anesthesia on Glycocalyx</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study II: Effect general and regional anaesthesia on GCX Hypothesis to be tested: Regional anaesthesia affects GCX less than general anaesthesia. The aim of the study: Comparison of two anaesthesia techniques with respect to GCX. Type of the study: Observational. Subjects: Adult patients ASA 2-3 undergoing elective total knee replacement surgery under general or regional anaesthesia. Sample size calculation (based on expected difference in PRB, alpha error I = 0,05 and study power = 0,99) = 52 patients. Investigators plan to enroll of 60 consecutive patients to reach 30 patients with each type of anaesthesia. Intervention: none. Data to be recorded and analysed: Demographics, ASA, physiologic functions (during surgery and 24 hours after surgery), fluids given, sublingual microcirculation by SDF imaging will be recorded at time points: before anaesthesia, 24 hours after anaesthesia, clinical outcome indicators, microcirculatory data and Perfused Boundary Region.</detailed_description>
