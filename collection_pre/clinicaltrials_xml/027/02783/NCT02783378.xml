The Gaviscon is supplied by the service, at no cost to the patient time 30: FLACC time 36: FLACC time 42: FLACC time 48: FLACC, satisfaction scale, remove pH monitoring Calculation of the number of participants : since there is never such a study was carried out, we started this pilot study. An analysis will be carried out after 15 patients. Analysis of the results : the results of the first and second 24 hour data will be compared (automatically by computer analysis).</detailed_description>
