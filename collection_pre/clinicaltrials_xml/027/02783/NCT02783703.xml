	<brief_title>Racial Differences in MCT for Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obese African Americans (AA) with metabolic syndrome (MS) are known to have more hyperinsulinemia (HI) and insulin resistance (IR) than Caucasian Americans (CA). Racial disparities in type 2 diabetes (T2D) outcomes adversely affect AA. Medium chain triglycerides (MCT) are a safe and effective treatment for IR and MS but are not widely used. The investigators' main aims are to determine the effects of MCT on insulin secretion and clearance, insulin sensitivity, beta cell function, and the disposition index using the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIVGTT) and Bergman's minimal model analysis. The study team will investigate the racial differences in the metabolic and clinical responses to MCT between AA and CA subjects with MS. The investigators aim to enroll 12 obese subjects (6 AA, 6 CA) with MS in an isocaloric study in which participants will receive MCT supplementation daily for 6 weeks while maintaining stable weight. Insulin secretion dynamics and insulin sensitivity will be assessed before and after the intervention by FSIVGTT. The investigators hope to show that MCT can effectively reduce HI and IR in CA and AA. These pilot data will provide the basis for a NIH grant submission to further investigate the treatment of MS with MCT in a mixed racial population.</detailed_description>
