	<brief_title>EFficacy and Impact on Function of Two Different Doses of Nab-paclitaxEl in Elderly With advanCed breasT Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label, randomized phase II trial evaluates in parallel two doses of nab-Paclitaxel (100 and 125mg/m2) given weekly for 3 weeks every 28 days, in elderly women aged 65 years or older, as first line treatment for advanced breast cancer (locally recurrent or metastatic). A short geriatric evaluation of co-morbidity and functional status will be performed before study entry. The functional status will be monitored at baseline and at every cycles during treatment.</detailed_description>
