	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate two validated interventions for the treatment of insomnia in cancer survivors of breast, colon, lung and prostate cancer. Moreover, it will provide an opportunity to assess the efficacy of both of these interventions in a group setting in patients of varied ethnic backgrounds including African-Americans, Latinos and Caucasians. The results of this study will help clinicians provide future interventions specific to cancer type and ethnicity in order to better serve the needs of our cancer survivors and improve their quality of life.</detailed_description>
