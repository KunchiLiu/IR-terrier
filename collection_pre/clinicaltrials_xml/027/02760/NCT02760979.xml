	<brief_title>The Efficacy of Denosumab in Decreasing Periprosthetic Bone Loss in Patients With Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Periprosthetic bone resorption after Total Knee Arthroplasty occurs as a consequence of prosthetic implant on the bone. Some of this patients (up to 13%) develop an aseptic failure of the prosthesis needing revision surgery. 2 groups of patients are treated with Placebo and Denosumab in a double blind prospective trial. Densitometry, Knee society score (KSS), Western Ontario McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36) were done in both groups at 0,3,6 and 12 months after surgery.</detailed_description>
