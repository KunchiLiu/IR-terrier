	<brief_summary>The overall objective is to determine the impact of EED on zinc absorption and homeostasis, and its impact on the absorptive capacity of vitamin A absorption of young children (18-24 months of age) in an austere setting with high rates of diarrhea, stunting, and micro-nutrient deficiencies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of EED on Zn Absorption and Retention in Children From a Standard Dose</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participating children are screened for EED using the lactulose:mannitol ratio test and assigned to one of two groups: +EED or -EED. All participants will be given standard, physiological dose of 3 mg zinc sulfate with a zinc stable isotope tracer on study day 8. On study day 11, 0.5 mg of 13C10-retinyl-acetate will be administered orally to all participants. Spot urine samples will be collected twice daily from study days 11-14. Complete fecal collections will be obtained for days 11-14. Duplicate diets of all foods consumed will be collected on days 11-14. On study day 14, a blood sample will be taken for analysis of vitamin A isotope status.</detailed_description>
