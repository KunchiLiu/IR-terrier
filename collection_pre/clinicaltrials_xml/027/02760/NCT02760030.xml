	<brief_summary>This phase II clinical trial studies how well fulvestrant and palbociclib works in treating older patients with breast cancer that responds to hormone treatment (hormone responsive) that cannot be removed by surgery. Estrogen can cause the growth of estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using fulvestrant may fight estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. Palbociclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving fulvestrant together with palbociclib may be an effective treatment for hormone responsive breast cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine treatment failure-free survival (TFFS) rate at one year of combination therapy with pure estrogen antagonist, fulvestrant and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, palbociclib as primary endocrine therapy in patients 70 years or older with newly diagnosed non-metastatic hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) negative breast cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine 1- and 2-year progression free survival. II. To determine safety and toxicity of this combination in the population of patients 70 years or older. III. To determine whether longitudinal changes in geriatric assessment measures correlate with tolerability of this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly (IM) on days 1 and 15. Patients also receive palbociclib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 weeks.</detailed_description>
