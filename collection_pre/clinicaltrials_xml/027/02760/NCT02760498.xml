	<criteria>Key At least 1 measurable lesion Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤1 Adequate bone marrow function Adequate renal function Adequate hepatic function Archived or newly obtained tumor material Patients must consent to undergo biopsies of externally visible CSCC lesions (Group 2 only) Surgical or radiological treatment of lesions contraindicated Key Ongoing or recent (within 5 years) evidence of significant autoimmune disease that required treatment with systemic immunosuppressive treatments, which may suggest risk for immunerelated adverse events Prior treatment with an agent that blocks the PD1/PDL1pathway Prior treatment with a BRAF inhibitor Prior treatment with other immunemodulating agents within fewer than 4 weeks prior to the first dose of REGN2810, or associated with immunemediated adverse events that were ≥ grade 1 within 90 days prior to the first dose of REGN2810, or associated with toxicity that resulted in discontinuation of the immunemodulating agent. Examples of immunemodulating agents include therapeutic vaccines, cytokine treatments, or agents that target cytotoxic Tlymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4), 41BB (CD137), or OX40. Untreated brain metastasis(es) that may be considered active Immunosuppressive corticosteroid doses (&gt;10 mg prednisone daily or equivalent) within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of REGN2810 Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and/or chronic/active infection with hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus History of pneumonitis within the last 5 years Allergic reactions or acute hypersensitivity reaction attributed to antibody treatments Known allergy to doxycycline or tetracycline Patients with a history of solid organ transplant Any medical comorbidity, physical examination finding, or metabolic dysfunction, or clinical laboratory abnormality that renders the patient unsuitable Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
