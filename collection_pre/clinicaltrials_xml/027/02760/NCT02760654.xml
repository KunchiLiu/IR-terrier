	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot randomized wait-list controlled trial is to test the efficacy of an online cognitive behavioral pain management website called Proactive Self-Management Program for Effects of Cancer Treatment (PROPSECT) to reduce worst pain intensity for individuals with chronic painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and to explore the mediating effect of PROSPECT-induced changes in anxiety, fatigue, depression, and sleep disturbance on worst pain intensity. Another aim of this study is to determine whether PROSPECT will decrease CIPN symptom severity (e.g. non-painful numbness and tingling), average pain severity, and physical impairment. Lastly, since this intervention has never been tested in individuals with painful CIPN, the investigators will assess patients' perceptions of acceptability and satisfaction with the intervention.</brief_summary>
