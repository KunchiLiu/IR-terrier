	<brief_summary>Using a population of patients from another study, who was originally randomized to 2 different types of nonoperative treatment after an acute achilles tendon rupture, the length of the achilles tendon is examined using ultrasound, and foot pressure mapping is performed, 4-5 years after the injury.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Foot Pressure Mapping and Tendon Length After Nonoperative Treatment of Acute Achilles Tendon Rupture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 56 patients from an earlier study (see reference) on Achilles tendon rupture using nonoperative treatment with or without early weight bearing was invited for an additional follow up, where we examine the length of the Achilles tendon using ultrasound, as well as functional influence of the injury, using foot pressure mapping (FPM) during barefoot gait. Additionally the mobility of the ankle is measured with the Achilles Tendon Resting Angle (ATRA) as well as passive plantar- and dorsiflexion. Strength is measured using Heel Raise Work (height of lift, number of lifts and the total work), and supplemented with calf circumference.</detailed_description>
