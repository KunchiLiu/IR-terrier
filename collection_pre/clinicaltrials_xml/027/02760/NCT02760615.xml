	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate in a step-wise approach the disease drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential for vedolizumab to indirectly affect the exposure of cytochrome P-450 (CYP) substrate drugs by modulating pro-inflammatory cytokines in participants with ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) who are treated with vedolizumab.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 4, Vedolizumab-4002 Post-marketing, Disease-Drug-Drug Interaction Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab, which is being tested to assess the possibility of drug-drug interactions when administered with other medications. The study will be conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 will enroll approximately 40 participants: 20 healthy participants and 20 participants with UC or CD who are not currently being treated with vedolizumab. All participants will receive the following medications: - Caffeine 100 mg - Losartan 50 mg - Omeprazole 20 mg - Dextromethorphan 30 mg - Midazolam 2 mg Part 2 will enroll approximately 20 participants on established vedolizumab intravenous (IV) maintenance treatment of 300 mg once every 8 weeks for the treatment of UC or CD. Participants will receive the same medications and dosages as in Part 1 in addition to their scheduled vedolizumab 300 mg IV. For Part 1 Subjects will be kept in the study unit from Check-in (Day -1) through at least 24 hours after dosing for safety and for each subject in Part 1 of this study will be approximately 6 weeks, including Screening. for each subject in Part 1 of this study will be approximately 6 weeks, including Screening. For Part 2 Subjects will be kept in the study unit from Check-in (Day -1) through at least 24 hours after dosing for safety and PK assessments before discharge. The total confinement period will be 3 days. The total duration for each subject in Part 2 of this study will be approximately 12 weeks, including Screening.</detailed_description>
