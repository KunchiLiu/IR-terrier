	<brief_title>Validation of the Peripheral Arterial Tone to Detect Sleep-disordered Breathing in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF&lt;45%) and predicted sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) receive a diagnostic device (WatchPAT 200 (TM)) and polysomnography (PSG) simultaneously during on night in a hospital sleep lab. The WatchPAT 200 (TM) is a wrist worn diagnostic device for detecting SDB. Its main part is the measurement of the peripheral arterial tone (PAT) via a plethysmographic based finger-mounted probe. It can measure the level of sympathetic activation of the autonomic nervous system. Pulse rate, oxygen saturation and snoring/body position levels are calculated, too. A software program (zzzPAT (TM)) with a special algorithm analyzes the raw data and creates a sleep report. Therefore the property of the WatchPAT 200 (TM) proclaims that the WatchPAT 200 (TM) can detect sleep events and SDB. The PSG is scored by sleep lab physicians/technicians blinded to the zzzPAT (TM)-software results using current American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines. Both results will be compared and the results of the device will be validated and evaluated against the results of the "Gold Standard" polysomnography.</detailed_description>
