	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Multiple Ascending Doses of AZD9567.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 1, randomised, single-blind, multiple ascending dose, double-dummy sequential group study in healthy subjects . The study is planned to have 4 cohorts with the option to include two additional cohorts if deemed necessary. Nine subjects participated in the first cohort (7 subjects randomised to receive AZD9567 and 2 subjects randomised to receive prednisolone 20 mg)and eleven subjects will participate in subsequent cohorts (7 subjects will be randomised to receive AZD9567 and 4 subjects randomised to receive prednisolone 20 mg). Four dose levels of AZD9567 are planned to be tested in the study therefore the two additional cohorts will be used in case any previous dose needs to be repeated or a new lower dose explored. Therefore a maximum of 64 individuals could be included in the study (9 in the 1st cohort (as stated on version 2.0 of this protocol) and 11 in the subsequent cohorts (as stated on version 3.0)). Subjects will be dosed for 5 consecutive days and a follow-up visit will occur 10-14 days after the last dose.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or nonchildbearing potential female subject, aged 18 to 55 years (both inclusive) with suitable veins for cannulation or repeated venipuncture. Explanatory note: Female subjects must be of nonchildbearing potential, confirmed at screening by fulfilling study predefined criteria 2. Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 29.9 kg/m2 inclusive and weigh at least 50 kg and no more than 100 kg inclusive. 3. Serum cortisol levels within normal limits at Screening (collected as part of the clinical chemistry panel) at the discretion of the Investigator. 4. Able to understand, read and speak the language of the ICD approved by the EC/IRB 5. Provision of signed and dated, written informed consent prior to any study specific procedures. 1. History of any clinically important disorder which, in opinion of the Investigator, may either put the subject at risk or influence the results or the subject's ability to participate in the study. 2. History or presence of gastrointestinal (GI), hepatic or renal disease, or any other condition known to interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs. 3. History or presence of dyspepsia or oral intolerance to steroids. 4. History of or active or latent tuberculosis (TB), or at risk for having acquired TB (social workers or prison staff in countries with endemic rates of TB, having lived with patients with known TB). 5. History suggesting abnormal immune function, as judged by the Investigator. 6. History of severe affective disorder including depressive or maniacdepressive illness. 7. History of previous steroid psychosis 8. Any clinically important illness, medical/surgical procedure, or trauma within 4 weeks of the first administration of IMP. 9. Any latent or chronic infections or at risk of infection, or history of skin abscesses within 90 days prior to the first administration of IMP at the discretion of the Investigator. 10. Any clinically important laboratory abnormalities (serum biochemistry, hematology, coagulation or urinalysis results) at Screening or prior to randomisation, as judged by the Investigator. Explanatory note: In particular a subject with an abnormal value (2x upper level of normal) for alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum creatinine (1.2x upper level of normal), and/or above the upper level of normal in serum bilirubin, or with an abnormal value for haemoglobin (Hb), white blood cell (WBC) and/or absolute neutrophil count below the normal limit will be excluded. 11. Any positive result at Screening for serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C antibody and/or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 12. Abnormal vital signs after 10 minutes supine rest. Explanatory note: Deviations from normal vital signs within the following ranges will not be allowed as any of the following: Systolic BP (SBP) &lt; 90mmHg or &gt; 140 mmHg Diastolic BP (DBP) &lt; 50mmHg or &gt; 90 mmHg Heart rate &lt; 50 or &gt; 90 beats per minute (bpm) 13. Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of the resting ECG and 12lead ECG that may interfere with the interpretation of QTc changes Explanatory note: this also includes abnormal STTwave morphology, particularly in the protocol defined primary lead or left ventricular hypertrophy. 14. Prolonged QTcF &gt; 450 ms or family history of long QT syndrome. 15. PR(PQ) interval shortening &lt; 120 ms (PR &gt; 110 ms but &lt; 120 ms is acceptable if there is no evidence of ventricular preexcitation). 16. PR (PQ) interval prolongation (&gt; 240 ms) intermittent second (Wenckebach block while asleep is not exclusive) or third degree AV block, or AV dissociation. 17. Persistent or intermittent complete bundle branch block (BBB), incomplete bundle branch block (IBBB), or intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD) with QRS &gt; 110 ms. Explanatory note: Subjects with QRS &gt; 110 ms but &lt; 115 ms are acceptable if there is no evidence of, for example, ventricular hypertrophy or preexcitation. 18. Known or suspected history of drug abuse in the last 6 months, as judged by the Investigator. 19. Smokers that smoke â‰¥ 5 cigarettes/pipes per day, or use tobacco in any other form. Smoking will not be allowed during the study treatment period (Day 2 to Day 6) (1 ecigarette = 1 cigarette). 20. History of alcohol abuse or excessive intake of alcohol, as judged by the Investigator. 21. Positive screen for drugs of abuse or alcohol at Screening or on admission to the clinical unit. 22. History of severe allergy/hypersensitivity or ongoing clinically important allergy/hypersensitivity to drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to study drugs. 23. Excessive intake of caffeine containing drinks or food (e.g., coffee, tea, chocolate), as judged by the Investigator. 24. Receipt of live or live attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the first administration of IMP. 25. Use of drugs with enzyme inducing properties such as St John's Wort within 3 weeks prior to the first administration of IMP. 26. Use of any prescribed or nonprescribed medication during the two weeks prior to the first administration of IMP or longer if the medication has a long halflife. Explanatory note: the prohibited medication includes antacids, analgesics (other than paracetamol/acetaminophen), herbal remedies, megadose vitamins (intake of 20 to 600 times the recommended daily dose) and minerals 27.

Subjects consented and screened, but not randomised in this study or a previous phase I study, are not excluded. 29. Vulnerable subject, e.g., kept in detention, protected adult under guardianship, trusteeship, or committed to an institution by governmental or juridical order. 30. Involvement of any Astra Zeneca or PAREXEL or study site employee or their close relatives. 31. Judgment by the Investigator that the subject should not participate in the study Explanatory note: for example, if the subject has any ongoing or recent (i.e., during the screening period) minor medical complaints that may interfere with the interpretation of study data, or is considered unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and requirements, the subject should not be randomised. 32.
