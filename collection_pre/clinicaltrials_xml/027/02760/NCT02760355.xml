	<brief_summary>In this pilot study, the investigators plan to treat patients with chronic hepatitis C due to HCV genotype 3 infection using an interferon-free regimen consisting in the administration of ribavirin and sofosbuvir/ledipasvir - a combination of a nucleotide RNA polymerase inhibitor with a non-structural protein 5A inhibitor. Patients will undergo a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, using tracers, and indirect calorimetry to assess whether the viral suppression induced by this regimen will be capable of reversing the glucose metabolic alterations induced by HCV in both the liver and extrahepatic compartments. Adipose and muscle tissue biopsies will also be performed to assess some specific molecular changes induced by HCV.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extrahepatic Insulin Resistance in Chronic Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidemiological studies have shown that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection induces insulin resistance, which may progress to type 2 diabetes in susceptible individuals. Despite the fact that HCV infects the liver, insulin resistance in these patients appears to originate mostly in extrahepatic tissues, particularly in muscles and adipose tissues. The aim of this trial is to assess the relative contribution of hepatic vs. extrahepatic tissues to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in chronic hepatitis C. To do so, 20 patients will be enrolled in a single-arm, open-label study. Study subjects will include 10 patients without any feature of the metabolic syndrome, and another 10 with the metabolic syndrome. All patients will receive the same regimen consisting of Ledipasvir 90 mg/Sofosbuvir 400 mg, one tablet once a day, associated with body weight-dose adjusted, 200 mg-tablets of ribavirin (1,000 mg in two administration in patients &lt;75 Kg of body weight, or 1,200 mg in two administrations for those &gt;75 Kg) for 12 weeks. Insulin resistance will be investigated at baseline (before treatment) and after 6 weeks of treatment using a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp with deuterated glucose: results obtained at 6 weeks - i.e. at the time of complete viral suppression - will be compared to basal conditions i.e. before antiviral treatment.</detailed_description>
