	<brief_summary>Anthocyanins are naturally existing, polyphenolic compounds found in the vacuolar sap of the epidermal tissues of flowers and fruits, with a pink, red, blue, or purple color. Recently, study of anthocyanin pigments has drawn more and more interest since several epidemiological studies have demonstrated their health-promoting properties, such as reducing lipid accumulation and decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation. Nevertheless, there is a clear need for advancing understanding with regard to effective amounts of intake for these phytochemicals. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of anthocyanin in healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
