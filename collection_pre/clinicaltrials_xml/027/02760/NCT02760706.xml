	<brief_summary>Study hypothesis: Post-processed SDCT images provide additional diagnostic value over conventional CT datasets. The CT examination would be a clinically-necessary, standard-of-care CT performed as per the clinical indication. The protocol and scan parameters for the CT exam will be similar to that of an equivalent scan performed with any other CT scanner. There would be no additional scanner of injection of any drug specifically for the study. The conventional CT images generated by the scanner will be used for clinical purposes as routinely practiced.</brief_summary>
