	<criteria>Histologically documented diagnosis of DLBCL. Phase 1: any DLBCL subtype. Phase 2: activated Bcell or unclassifiable subtypes confirmed by immunohistochemistry using the Hans algorithm Relapsed or refractory DLBCL, defined as having received at least 1 but no more than 3 prior treatment regimens and ineligible for highdose chemotherapy/autologous stem cell transplant. Fluorodeoxyglucoseavid disease (based on local evaluation) per the Lugano Classification. Fluorodeoxyglucoseavid disease is defined as disease with a 5point scale score of 4 or 5. Archived tumor tissue (block or 1520 unstained slides) available, or be willing to undergo an incisional or excisional lymph node biopsy of accessible adenopathy (or, in less accessible lymph nodes, 4 to 8 core biopsies). At least 1 measurable (≥ 2 cm in longest dimension) lesion on CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2. Transformed DLBCL or DLBCL with coexistent histologies (eg, follicular or mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue lymphoma). Primary mediastinal (thymic) large Bcell lymphoma. Known central nervous system lymphoma (either primary or metastatic). Allogeneic stem cell transplant within the previous 6 months, or active graft versus host disease following allogeneic transplant. Use of immunosuppressive therapy within 28 days of starting study treatment. Immunosuppressive therapy includes but is not limited to cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, or highdose corticosteroids. Subjects receiving corticosteroids must be at a dose level ≤ 20 mg/day within 7 days of initiating study treatment. Prior or concurrent therapy with a Janus kinase inhibitor, Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or lenalidomide (Phase 2 only)</criteria>
