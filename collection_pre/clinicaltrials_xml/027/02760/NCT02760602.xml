	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Alzheimer Disease</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Has a diagnosis by the study investigator of a clinical syndrome of cognitive impairment consistent with prodromal AD per International Working Group (IWG) diagnostic criteria or MCI due to AD per National Institute on AgingAlzheimer's Association (NIAAA) diagnostic criteria. Scores 1728 on MoCA at screening. Scores &lt;27 on free recall cutoff score from the FCSRT (Picture version) at screening. Scores â‰¤4 on Modified Hachinski Ischemia Scale (MHIS). Scores &gt;0 on the FAQ. Has a florbetapir PET scan or CSF result at screening consistent with the presence of amyloid pathology. Has had MRI or computerized tomography (CT) of brain within previous 2 years showing pathology that would be inconsistent with a diagnosis of AD. Has known allergy to humanized monoclonal antibodies. Has an ongoing clinically significant laboratory abnormality, as determined by the investigator. Has screening MRI with results showing &gt;4 amyloid related imaging abnormalities H (ARIAH) microhemorrhages or presence of ARIAE. Has any contraindications for MRI studies, including claustrophobia, the presence of metal (ferromagnetic) implants, or a cardiac pacemaker that is not compatible with MRI. Has received treatment with a stable dose of an achetylcholinesterase (AChEI) inhibitor or memantine for less than 2 months before randomization. (If a participant has recently stopped AChEIs and/or memantine, he or she must have discontinued treatment at least 2 months before randomization.)</criteria>
