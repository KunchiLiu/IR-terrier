	<brief_title>PRogram In Support of Moms: An Innovative Stepped-Care Approach for Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upwards of 1 in 5 women suffer from depression during pregnancy or within a year after giving birth. It has negative effects on birth outcomes, infant attachment, and children's behavior/development. Maternal suicide causes 20% of postpartum deaths in depressed women. Although the vast majority of perinatal women are amenable to being screened for depression, screening alone does not improve treatment rates or patient outcomes. Ob/Gyn practices need supports in place to adequately address depression in their patient populations. Thus, the Investigators developed and pilot tested the PRogram In Support of Moms (PRISM), to create a comprehensive intervention that is proactive, multifaceted, and practical. PRSIM aims to improve perinatal depression treatment and treatment response rates through: (1) access to immediate resource provision/referrals and psychiatric telephone consultation for Ob/Gyn providers; (2) clinic-specific implementation of stepped care, including training support and toolkits; and, (3) proactive treatment engagement, patient monitoring, and stepped treatment response to depression screening/assessment. PRISM builds on a low-cost and widely disseminated population-based model for delivering psychiatric care in primary care settings developed by our team. Because it uses existing infrastructure and resources, PRISM, has the potential to be feasible, sustainable and transportable to other practice settings. The Investigators will compare PRISM vs. enhanced usual care (access to resource provision/referrals and psychiatric telephone consultation) in a clinical trial in which Investigators will randomize 12 Ob/Gyn practices to either PRISM or enhanced usual care intervention. Provider and staff participants will participate in either PRISM or enhanced usual care, depending on what intervention their practice is assigned to. The Investigators will compare the effectiveness of PRISM vs. enhanced usual care to improve depression severity and treatment participation in pregnancy through 12 months postpartum among 300 patients (n=150/group, 25 per clinic). The Investigators will also determine change in knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward depression screening and treatment in the PRISM group compared to enhanced usual care group.</detailed_description>
