	<brief_summary>The First Twenty® (TF20) was recently developed as a not-for-profit, web-mobile program for firefighters (FFs) specifically focused on improving fitness and nutrition knowledge and practices. The program was designed by FFs with backgrounds in tactical fitness, marketing and program development professionals, and nutrition and exercise scientists. Preliminary data suggests the program is well-received by FFs and results in significant improvement in body composition and physical fitness. One innovative approach for the eventual dissemination of TF20 to VFFs is through their fitness-for duty medical exams. The synergy created by linking the TF20 intervention components, feedback to the VFFs from their medical exam, and health messages from their physician is predicted to maximize the impact of this much-needed intervention. The goal of the proposed project is to tailor TF20 for use in a clinic based setting (CB-TF20) for VFFs and to pilot test it in comparison to the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7 (LS7), a web-based diet and physical activity knowledge/behavior and lifestyle program. The specific aims are to: 1) Conduct formative research with key stakeholders in the VFF community (e.g., physicians, department leadership, VFFs) to determine best practices for implementing a clinic-based, web-mobile health and wellness program with VFFs and medical providers; 2) Develop a clinic-based version of TF20 (CB-TF20) and beta-test it with VFFs; and, 3) Conduct a 6 month, 2-arm, pilot cluster (i.e., department) randomized clinical trial (PCRCT) to determine the comparative effectiveness of the revised CB-TF20 to LS7 on body composition, Framingham Risk Scores, and diet/physical activity knowledge and behaviors among VFF with BMI &gt;25.0kg/m2; and conduct an evaluation of the CB-TF20 materials and technology. This innovative R34 study is a critical step in providing a much needed intervention for VFFs and those providing their annual examinations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The First Twenty (TF20) for Volunteer Firefighters in a Clinic Based Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The US fire service serves as the front line of defense against any domestic emergency and volunteer firefighters comprise the majority of firefighters, often with negative consequences for the health of personnel. While rates of overweight and obesity remain high among firefighters and cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of line of duty deaths, few resources tailored to the unique culture and needs of firefighters are available to help occupational medicine physicians who provide their fitness for duty examinations. By engaging firefighters and occupational medicine clinicians in tailoring an internet/mobile intervention and pilot testing the program with a sample of volunteer firefighters, the investigators will be poised to implement a full-scale clinical trial with the developed program.</detailed_description>
