	<brief_title>Dietary Prevention of Photodamage in Skin With Grapes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine whether oral grape powder will result in a reduction in biomarkers associated with basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Biomarkers taken from non-sun-exposed skin and UV-exposed skin before and after treatment will be compared. The ultimate goal of this study will be to generate new knowledge of the photoprotective effect of grape powder on UV exposure. The results may be employed as the basis for a larger clinical trial to evaluate the potential of grapes to prevent non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) and sun damage.</detailed_description>
