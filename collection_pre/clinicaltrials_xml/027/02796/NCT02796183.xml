	<brief_title>The Efficacy of Subconjunctival Bevacizumab in Diabetic Macular Edema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At baseline, the macular thicknesses of both eyes of the patients with persistant diabetic macular edema were measured by optical coherence tomography. After 3.75mg bevacizumab was injected into subconjunctival space of the eyes with diabetic macular edema. The measurements of the macular thicknesses were repeated by optical coherence tomography in 15th, 30th, 60th day after injections. The macular thickness measurements before and after injection were compared.</detailed_description>
