	<brief_summary>Recombinant factor VIII Fc (rFVIIIFc) and recombinant factor IX Fc (rFIXFc) are extended half-life coagulation factors approved by Health Canada in 2014 for the treatment of severe hemophilia A and B, respectively. The objectives of this observational study is to describe the change in annual factor consumption, clinical and patient-reported outcomes for patients who switch from recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) and recombinant factor IX (rFIX) to rFVIIIFc/ rFIXFc in Canada, and to explore clinicians' and patients' reasons for switching or not switching.</brief_summary>
