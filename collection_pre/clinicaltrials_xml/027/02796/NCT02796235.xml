	<brief_summary>Venous Thromboembolic Disease (VTE) in SCI patients is very common, its prevalence is 60 to 80% against 10-20% in the general population. The risk of VTE is very important in the first weeks after spinal cord injury, and then declines with a prevalence of VTE slightly higher than the general population after 12 weeks. However there is no prospective study of incidence of VTE in SCI patients after 3 months. The investigators wish to conduct such a study during the year following spinal cord injury with performing venous Doppler ultrasound of the lower limbs 6, 9 and 12 months of the initial injuryassociated with a standardized clinical assessment, to know the incidence of VTE and determine prognostic factors for VTE.</brief_summary>
