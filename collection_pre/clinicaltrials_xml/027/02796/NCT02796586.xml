	<brief_title>Group Versus Individual Contraceptive Counseling for Resettled African Refugee Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thousands of women refugees arrive in the United States each year, yet there is very little known about reproductive health and family planning needs of these women after resettlement. This randomized controlled pilot study, in a population of resettled African refugee women, will evaluate differences between group and individual contraceptive counseling on the decision to use contraception, satisfaction with counseling method, and modern family planning knowledge. Participants will arrive to clinic during an assigned "intervention day." An intake and exit survey will be performed before and after their counseling session. Demographics, attitudes towards contraception, and knowledge regarding contraceptive methods will be assessed via questionnaire. Participants will be randomized to either group or individual contraceptive counseling. After each session, participants will have the option to privately choose a reversible method of contraception free of charge. Telephone survey follow-up with participants will occur every three months for one year. Follow-up surveys will include questions regarding method continuation, method satisfaction and and modern contraceptive knowledge.</detailed_description>
