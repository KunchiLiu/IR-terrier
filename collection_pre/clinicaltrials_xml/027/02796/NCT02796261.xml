	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of eflornithine in combination with lomustine, compared to lomustine taken alone, in treating patients whose anaplastic astrocytoma has recurred/progressed after radiation and temozolomide chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate Eflornithine + Lomustine vs Lomustine in Recurrent Anaplastic Astrocytoma (AA) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will consist of 4 study periods of up to 50 months in total, consisting of: Screening Period - A maximum screening duration of 4 weeks. Treatment Period - Treatment Arm A up to 24 months; Treatment Arm B up to 12 months. End of Treatment Visit - A minimum of 4 weeks post last treatment for both arms. Follow-Up Period - Up to 24 months. A total of approximately 280 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either eflornithine + lomustine or lomustine alone.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for participation in this study: Surgical or biopsyproven diagnosis of WHO grade 3 AA. Unequivocal evidence of first AA tumor progression or recurrence ≤ 3 months prior to randomization based on MRI criteria for tumor progression using enlarging Gdcontrast enhancement and/or T2 hypersensitivity (Appendix 4). Patients with nonmeasurable Gd contrast enhancing tumors will only be eligible if there is no necrosis seen on MRI and/or histopathological confirmation of AA per standard of care procedures is obtained within 4 weeks prior to randomization. First tumor progression or recurrence following surgical resection or biopsy, if resection is not feasible, EBRT and temozolomide chemotherapy. Completion of EBRT ≥ 6 months prior to randomization. A patient whose AA tumor has progressed or recurred and has had another surgical resection prior to randomization will be eligible if a) pathology review confirms AA, b) postsurgical MRI demonstrates measurable tumor on T2/FLAIR, and c) MRI performed after surgery is within 4 weeks prior to randomization. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score of &gt; 70. Patients who meet any of the following exclusion criteria are not eligible for study participation: MRI defining progression is consistent with a diagnosis of glioblastoma or radiation necrosis. Patients who are considered to be refractory to EBRT and temozolomide but who have not progressed. Prior systemic therapy for recurrence of AA. Presence of extracranial or leptomeningeal disease. Prior lomustine use. Any other clinical condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would make the patient unsuitable for the study. Pregnant or breastfeeding.</criteria>
