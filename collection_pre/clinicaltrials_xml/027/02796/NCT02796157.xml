	<brief_summary>PCI of diffuse long coronary lesions still remains challenging because of relatively high risk of in-stent restenosis and stent thrombosis compared to short coronary lesions. The purpose of the study is to compare an incidence of composite of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) at 1 year between Absorb everolimus-eluting BVS and Xience EES after coronary intervention in long lesions more than 28 mm.</brief_summary>
