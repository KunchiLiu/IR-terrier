	<detailed_description>The current state of mobile communication and technology is a tool to support home programs for chronic disease management, useful to facilitate access to these types of programs, because the investigators could obtain telematics information about the parameters, reducing cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Once the patient qualifies for inclusion in the study and has signed informed consent it is included in a list where randomized 7 patients in the experimental group (home-based cardiac rehabilitation Nuubo monitoring vest) and 7 patients are assigned to traditional cardiac rehabilitation group.</detailed_description>
