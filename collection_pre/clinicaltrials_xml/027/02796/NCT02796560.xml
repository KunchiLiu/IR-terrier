	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and tolerance of generic travoprost with its brand name formulation. In this open label, randomized, crossover study, the primary outcome will be intraocular pressure and the secondary outcome will be tolerance to the drops, as measured by a subjective questionnaire. Patients will be randomized to receive either brand name or generic travoprost during the first visit. At the second visit 3 weeks later, their intraocular pressure will be measured and a questionnaire will be completed on the tolerance of the medication. Patients will then receive the other formulation of travoprost. At the third and final visit, another 3 weeks later, their intraocular pressure will be measured and a questionnaire will be completed on the tolerance of the second medication.</brief_summary>
