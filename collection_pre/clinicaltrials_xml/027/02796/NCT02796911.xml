	<brief_summary>Objective: Periodontally accelerated osteogenic orthodontics(PAOO) will minimize treatment time. The current study will be carried to evaluate the effectiveness of different bone grafts with a modified, less invasive corticotomy technique in the treatment of adult patients with moderate crowding. Subjects and Methods: Thirty orthodontic patients will be selected. Patients were randomly classified into three groups. Group I will be treated with a modified technique of corticotomy, whereas group II will be treated with the same technique combined with PAOO using bovine derived xenograft, and group III will be treated with the same technique combined with PAOO using with bioactive glass. The total duration of active orthodontic treatment will be estimated. Probing depth, bone density and root length will be also evaluated. The measurements will be recorded.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Study of Different Bone Grafts in Accelerating Tooth Movement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: Periodontally accelerated osteogenic orthodontics(PAOO) combines periodontal therapy with orthodontic therapy, which will minimize treatment time. The current study will be carried to evaluate the effectiveness of bovine derived xenograft versus bioactive glass with a modified, less invasive corticotomy technique in the treatment of adult patients with moderate crowding. Subjects and Methods: Thirty orthodontic patients will be selected. Patients were randomly classified into three groups. Group I will be treated with a modified technique of corticotomy on the labial side only, whereas group II will be treated with the same technique combined with PAOO using bovine derived xenograft, and group III will be treated with the same technique combined with PAOO using with bioactive glass. The total duration of active orthodontic treatment will be estimated from the time of starting the active orthodontic treatment, immediately following the corticotomy procedure, to the time of debonding. Probing depth will be evaluated clinically whereas bone density and root length will be evaluated radiographically. The measurements will be recorded at day of surgery (baseline) (T1), post-treatment at time of debonding (T2), and 9 months post-treatment (T3).</detailed_description>
