	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the ease of use of the new calorimeter (Quark RMR 2.0 (COSMED, Italy)) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients compared to currently used calorimeters (i.e. Quark RMR 1.0(COSMED, Italy) or Deltatrac Metabolic Monitor (Datex, Finland)), as well as the stability and the feasibility of the measurements in various clinically relevant situations. Time needed to prepare and start indirect calorimetry (IC) measurement will be compared as the measure of the ease of use of the calorimeter.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background and Aims: This study aims at evaluating the ease of use of the new calorimeter for the measurement of energy expenditure (EE) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. EE in ICU patients is highly variable depending on the severity of the disease and treatments. Clinicians need to measure EE by indirect calorimetry (IC) to optimize nutritional support for the better clinical outcome. However, indirect calorimeters available on the market have insufficient accuracy for clinical and research use. Difficulties of handling and interpretation of results often limit IC in ICU patients. An accurate, easy-to-use calorimeter has been developed to meet these needs. The Study Device: The new calorimeter (Quark RMR 2.0, COSMED) is capable of IC measurements in mechanically ventilated patients without warm-up and limited calibration. The disposable in-line pneumotach flow meter and direct sampling of respiratory gas from the ventilator circuit enables the accurate measurement of oxygen consumption volume (VO2) and CO2 production volume (VCO2) to derive the energy expenditure. The software interface to manage the device and the collected data provides easy-to-use, user-friendly interface. This calorimeter bears an European Commission (EC) Conformity Mark, and will be used in the way it is intended to be used as described in the instruction manual. Currently used indirect calorimeters at each study center will be used as the comparator.</detailed_description>
