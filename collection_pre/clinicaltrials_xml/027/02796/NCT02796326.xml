	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to prospectively assess the use of a modified tracheal balloon dilator that allows gas flow (oxygenation and ventilation) through the device while inflated during dilatation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modified Endotracheal Balloon Dilator to Improve Patient Oxygenation and Allow Ventilation During Airway Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim is to determine the incidence of, and time to, arterial desaturation (defined as peripheral plethysmography below 90%). Secondary aims include quantitative and qualitative (waveform) end-tidal capnography levels throughout the procedure, quantitative assessment of dilatation, and incidence of adverse events.</detailed_description>
