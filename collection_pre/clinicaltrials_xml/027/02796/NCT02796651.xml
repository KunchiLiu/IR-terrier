	<brief_summary>To assess the bronchodilation of three doses of formoterol fumarate (6 μg, 12 μg and 24 μg) twice daily (BID) administered via Pressair® compared to placebo and to open-label nebulized formoterol fumarate (20 μg and 40 μg).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Formoterol Dose Ranging Study (ACHIEVE Duaklir USA Phase IIb).</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, 5-period incomplete unbalanced crossover, placebo and active comparator (open-label) controlled, multicenter clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of three doses of formoterol fumarate (6 μg, 12 μg and 24 μg) BID administered via Pressair® compared to placebo and to open-label formoterol fumarate (20 μg BID and 40 μg single dose) administered as an inhalation solution via a standard jet nebulizer (with a mouthpiece) connected to an air compressor (Perforomist® Inhalation Solution). The drug product is an inhalation powder comprising of micronized aclidinium bromide and micronized formoterol fumarate with α-lactose monohydrate as the carrier, presented in a breathactuated device-metered dry-powder inhaler (DPI). It has been approved under the trademarks of Genuair® and/or Pressair® in some territories.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult male or nonpregnant, nonlactating female patients aged ≥40. Patients with a diagnosis of COPD (GOLD guidelines, 2016) for a period of at least 6 months prior to Visit 1. Patients with moderate to severe stable COPD: postbronchodilator FEV1 ≥ 30% and &lt;80% of the predicted normal and postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt; 70% at Visit 1. Patients with reversible airway obstruction defined as an increase in FEV1 of at least 12% and 200 mL over the baseline value after four inhalations of albuterol sulfate 108 µg via a pMDI at Visit 1. Current or formersmokers, with a smoking history of ≥ 10 packyears. Patients able to perform acceptable and repeatable pulmonary function testing for FEV1 according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) 2005 criteria at Visit 1. Patients eligible and able to participate in the study and who had signed an Informed Consent Form prior to initiation of any studyrelated procedures. Patients with asthma. Any respiratory tract infection (including the upper respiratory tract) or COPD exacerbation (including the mild COPD exacerbation) within 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 or during the runin period. Patients hospitalized for a COPD exacerbation (an emergency room visit for longer than 24 hours is considered a hospitalization) within 3 months prior to Visit 1. Clinically significant respiratory conditions other than COPD. Patients who in the investigator's opinion may need to start a pulmonary rehabilitation program during the study and/or patients who started/finished it within 3 months prior to Visit 1. Use of longterm oxygen therapy (≥ 15 hours/day). Patients who do not maintain regular day/night, waking/sleeping cycles including night shift workers. Clinically significant cardiovascular conditions. Patients with uncontrolled Type I or Type II diabetes, uncontrolled hypoor hyperthyroidism, hypokalaemia, or hyperadrenergic state, uncontrolled hypertension. Patients with history of long QT syndrome or whose QTc (calculated according to Fridericia's Formula QTc=QT/RR1/3) &gt; 470 ms as indicated in the centralized reading report assessed at Visit 1. Patients with clinically significant abnormalities in the laboratory tests, ECG parameters (other than QTc) or in the physical examination at Visit 1 that might compromise patient safety. Patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to an inhaled medication or any component thereof, including paradoxical bronchospasm. Patients with known narrowangle glaucoma, symptomatic bladder neck obstruction, acute urinary retention or symptomatic unstable prostate hypertrophy. History of malignancy of any organ system (including lung cancer), treated or untreated, within the past 5 years other than basal or squamous cell skin cancer. Patients with any other serious or uncontrolled physical or mental dysfunction. Patients with a history (within 2 years prior to screening) of drug and/or alcohol abuse that may prevent study compliance based on the Investigator judgment. Patients unlikely to be cooperative or who cannot comply with the study procedures. Patients treated with any investigational drug within 30 days (or 6 halflives, whichever is longer) prior to Visit 1. Patients who intended to use any concomitant medication not permitted by this protocol or who had not undergone the required washout period for a particular prohibited medication. Patients unable to give consent, or patients of consenting age but under guardianship, or vulnerable patients. Any other conditions that, in the investigator's opinion, might render the patient to be unsuitable for the study. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to AstraZeneca staff and/or site staff), or patients employed by or relatives of the employees of the site or sponsor.
