	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to assess the relationship between rhinovirus specific T-cell immunity and the human host response to primary rhinovirus challenge and subsequent secondary challenge with either homologous or heterologous rhinovirus serotypes. The overall hypothesis that will be addressed by the mechanistic studies in this proposal is that T helper and Tfh cells directed against conserved RV epitopes expand upon RV exposure and some of these cells persist as stable cross-reactive memory populations capable of displaying lineage-specific protective functions upon re-infection with related or unrelated strains of RV. The human specimens collected in this study will be analyzed with a variety of state-of-the-art techniques to provide an in depth description of T-cell responses to rhinovirus infection, and the correlation of these responses with viral infection, antibody responses, and illness. Beyond this objective, by using a systems biology approach, we aim to gain new insight into the role of diverse cell types involved in adaptive immunity to rhinovirus.</detailed_description>
