	<brief_summary>Glucagon like peptide 1 is produced in enteroendocrine L cells in the small intestine stimulated by peroral food intake. GLP-1 induces insulin secretion, and analogues are used in the treatment of DM2 (type 2 diabetes mellitus). Recently it was found, that levels of GLP-1 are increased in response to acipimox. The hypothesis is that G protein coupled receptors on enteroendocrine L cells bind acipimox and thereby induce GLP-1 secretion. In a controlled, open, randomized experiment, eight healthy, overweight men will be studied on an intervention day, where they receive acipimox, and on a control day. The study day includes an OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test), blood samples before and after the OGTT and a biopsy from adipose tissue.</brief_summary>
