	<brief_summary>This research trial studies prescribed physical activity in improving sleep and physical performance in patients undergoing stem cell transplant. A wearable physical activity monitor can be used to record minutes of activity and sleep. Gathering data over time using a physical activity monitor may help doctors learn if prescribed physical activity helps improve sleep and physical performance in patients undergoing stem cell transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prescribed Physical Activity in Improving Sleep and Physical Performance in Patients Undergoing Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate whether prescribed physical activity, as part of standard care, improves sleep and functional outcomes in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) (stem cell transplantation) patients during a typical 30-day hospitalization period. OUTLINE: Data including demographics, type of HCT (e.g., allogeneic or autologous), preexisting physical conditions (e.g., chronic joint injury), chronic renal failure (CRF), steroid use data, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) and Karnofsky performance status (KPS) scores are collected from patients' medical charts at time of enrollment. Patients are prescribed participation in a primarily self-directed physical activity program which encourages them to spend 6 hours out of bed daily and to perform 30 minutes of light-to-moderate daily aerobic activity. Patients who are able to maintain independent mobility undergo physical therapist assessment 2 times a week until hospital discharge. Patients wear a physical activity monitoring device and daily activity and sleep data are collected continuously during hospital length of stay (LOS).</detailed_description>
