	<brief_summary>Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) is a way of feeding a person intravenously, and is required when the gastrointestinal tract is not able to function properly. TPN contains carbohydrates, protein, and fat and lipids. It also contains minerals and vitamins. The lipid that is currently used at the University Health Network home TPN program is Intralipid20%, which is based on Soybean oil, contains polyunsaturated fats and is a good source of energy and essential fatty acids, including omega 3 and 6 fatty acids, which needed by the body. However, long term use on Intralipid20% has been shown to have negative effects on antioxidant status, inflammation, liver, and the immune system. SMOFlipid20% is a lipid emulsion that has been designed to maximize the ratio of omega 3 to omega 6 fatty acids, in an effort to avoid potentially harmful effects associated with Intralipid20%. In previous studies, it has been shown that SMOFlipid20% is safe and has positive benefits on the liver enzymes. There are no studies so far which follow patient who is on SMOFlipid20% long term. The investigators hope to show that with long term use of SMOFlipid20% is better for liver function compared to Intralipid20%.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Two Intravenous Lipid Emulsions in Home Parenteral Nutrition Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective double-blind, crossover, randomized clinical trial of 13 months duration per participant to compare between 2 commercially available lipid emulsion, Intralipid vs SMOF, in patient receiving home parenteral nutrition (HPN). All subjects are stable HPN patients who receive Intralipid as lipid emulsion in their solutions. The subjects will be randomized to two groups. One group will receive Intralipid for 6 months, followed by 28 days of wash-out period, and then will receive SMOF for 6 months. Another groups will receive SMOF in first 6 months, followed by 28 days of wash-out period, then will receive Intralipid for 6 months. During wash-out period for both groups, the patients will receive Intralipid as standard lipid emulsion. Each patient will have 4 clinic visits at Toronto General Hospital for clinical interview, nutritional measurements, routine blood tests, and special blood tests at baseline then at 6, 7, 13 months. Also, the patients will be asked to have routine blood tests after month 3 and month 9. The patients will fill the food record which will be collected later after completion of each period, month 6 and 13 of the study. The investigators will be calling patients during both periods to check compliance and update on their condition including the adverse events.</detailed_description>
