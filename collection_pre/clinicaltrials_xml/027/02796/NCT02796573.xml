	<brief_summary>Depression is a prevalent and disabling disorder with great cost to the individual and the society. Lately, the use of internet interventions as guided self-help has demonstrated remarkable results. However, certain shortcomings such as lack of personal adaptation has been identified. The presents study aims to investigate the potential of blending Internet based interventions with face-to-face consultations using cognitive behavioural therapy (B-CBT). The main hypotheses are, that that B-CBT will be as clinically effective as TAU, and that it will be acceptable to patients and clinicians. The study is designed as a two arm randomised non-inferiority trial comparing internet based B-CBT for depression to treatment as usual (TAU) defined as 12 sessions of face-to-face CBT.</brief_summary>
