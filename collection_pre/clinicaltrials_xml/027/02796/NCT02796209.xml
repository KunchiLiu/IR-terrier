	<brief_summary>Atomoxetine, a selective norepinephrine transporter (NET) blocker, increases standing blood pressure and improves neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (NOH)-related symptoms to a greater extent than midodrine, the current standard of care. Atomoxetine could be a new therapeutic alternative for the treatment of NOH in patients with autonomic failure, particularly those with multiple system atrophy (MSA). The proposed study consists of an open-label, dose-optimization phase followed by a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 crossover phase.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension (defined by a reduction of â‰¥30 mmHg drop in SBP within 3 minutes of standing, associated with impaired autonomic reflexes as assessed by autonomic function tests. Pregnancy or breastfeeding Hypersensitivity to atomoxetine (severe allergic reaction, rash, urticaria, anaphylaxis) Use of other norepinephrine transporter inhibitors such as Wellbutrin (Bupropion), Cymbalta (Duloxetine), Effexor (venlafaxine), Pristiq (desvenlafaxine), Savella (milnacipran) Previous history (within 14 days prior to enrollment) and current use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors Concomitant use of strong CYP2D6 inhibitors such as delavirdine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, quinidine Preexisting sustained severe hypertension (BP 140/80 mmhg in the sitting position) Impaired hepatic function (aspartate amino transaminase [AST] and/or alanine amino transaminase [ALT] &gt;2 x upper limit of normal range) Impaired renal function (serum creatinine equal or more than 1.6 mg/dl) Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment Congestive heart failure (LV hypertrophy acceptable) History of serious neurologic disease such as cerebral hemorrhage, or stroke Inability to comply with the protocol, e.g., uncooperative attitude, inability to return for followup visits, unlikelihood of completing the study, and mental conditions rendering the subject unable to understand the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study Patients with narrow angle glaucoma Patients with or a history of pheochromocytoma</criteria>
