	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine whether a Strengthening our Vows (SOV) intervention will reduce HIV exposures from concurrent partnership (CP) when compared to the control Good Health Package Plus (GHPP), in addition to couples' voluntary HIV counseling and testing (CVCT), among concordant HIV-negative couples living in Zambia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a randomized control study to evaluate novel interventions to reduce risk factors associated with HIV, neglected tropical and non-communicable diseases among couples in Zambia. The aim of this study is to determine whether a Strengthening our Vows (SOV) intervention will reduce HIV exposures from concurrent partnership (CP) when compared to the control Good Health Package Plus (GHPP), in addition to couples' voluntary HIV counseling and testing (CVCT), among concordant HIV-negative couples. Investigators seeks to compare the impact of the SOV intervention and the GHPP intervention on reduction in a composite of risk factors associated with HIV acquisition from concurrent partners, compare the impact of GHPP and SOV on knowledge and use of hygiene and sanitation measures and hypertension and diabetes screening and management, and compare self-reported couples' testing (CVCT) with outside partners in the SOV and GHPP arms. Couples will receive SOV or GHPP based on the pre-randomization of the clinic which they attend for standard of care HIV counseling and testing. The Strengthening our Vows (SOV) intervention will seek to establish a dialogue or norm where couples will be able to protect each other from HIV infection from outside partners. The Good Health Package Plus (GHPP) intervention focuses on strategies to improve household health related to diarrheal diseases, helminths, schistosomiasis, diabetes, and hypertension.</detailed_description>
