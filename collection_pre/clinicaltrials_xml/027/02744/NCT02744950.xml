	<brief_summary>Surgical defects on the scalp require closure via various techniques of suture placement. A traditional technique requires both dermal (deep) and epidermal (superficial) placement of sutures to close the defect; this is referred to as intermediate or complex linear repair. However, the scalp is a location with high tension, and thus the closures take an hour or longer to perform. A type of suture placement referred to as the "pulley stitch" requires placement of a few stitches along the defect. The pulley stitch can be used in areas of high tension to close a large defect. The purpose of this study is to compare the scar results and time taken to perform scalp closures via only pulley stitches or via intermediate/complex linear repairs. To my knowledge, no such study has been performed to compare the two techniques. Such a study would be useful in demonstrating comparable scar appearance and reduce the time to perform scalp closures.</brief_summary>
