	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well ibrutinib and brentuximab vedotin work in treating patients with Hodgkin lymphoma that has returned (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as brentuximab vedotin, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving ibrutinib together with brentuximab vedotin may be a better treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ibrutinib and Brentuximab Vedotin in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the anti-tumor activity of the two agent combination ibrutinib and brentuximab vedotin, as assessed by complete response (CR) rate. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the safety and tolerability of the two agent combination through evaluation of toxicities, including type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course and duration. II. Obtain estimates of overall response rate (ORR), response duration and survival (overall and progression-free). III. Describe outcomes of patients who ultimately undergo autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation following treatment with ibrutinib/brentuximab vedotin. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Collect deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)/ribonucleic acid (RNA) from lymphoma specimens and serial plasma samples for future biomarker evaluation. OUTLINE: Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2 years.</detailed_description>
