	<brief_title>MR Imaging of Fat Deposition in Adolescents With First Time Antipsychotic Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atypical Antipsychotics (AAPs) are known to cause metabolic dysfunction, and adolescents are especially vulnerable to this effect. The anthropometric measures routinely used to monitor these metabolic side effects may, in fact, underestimate risk in the pediatric population as they are not a good index of hepatic and visceral adipose tissue. This study will measure fat accumulation over a 12 week period in adolescents and young adults taking an AAP for the first time. MRI imaging will measure hepatic, and visceral adipose tissue at baseline and study end. An Oral Glucose Tolerance Test will measure glucose resistance and insulin sensitivity. In an exploratory fashion, investigators will also image the brain to assess for volumetric changes which may occur in association with AAP treatment and changes in metabolic indices.</detailed_description>
