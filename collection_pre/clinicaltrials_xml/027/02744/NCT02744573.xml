	<brief_title>Evaluation Of The Analgesia Nociception Index vs. Surgical Pleth Index Under General And Regional Anaesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While sophisticated haemodynamic monitoring as well as depth of neuromuscular block and sedation are established in daily clinical routine monitoring of analgesia remains poorly represented. The surgical pleth index (SPI) algorithm takes into account both central and peripheral sympathetic tone via the normalised heart beat interval and the plethysmographic pulse wave amplitude and has been described before. A more detailed investigation on the SPI and its behaviour under a posture maneuver shows the limitation of the device. Another device developed calculates the "analgesia nociception index" (ANI) by heart rate variability and was launched into the market in 2010. However, the effect of posture - to our knowledge - has not yet been studied. The change of body positioning during surgery is regularly necessary in order to improve surgical access to anatomic structures. These alterations in positioning are known to be accompanied by changes in haemodynamic parameters. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ANI in patients undergoing elective surgery in lithotomy position.</detailed_description>
