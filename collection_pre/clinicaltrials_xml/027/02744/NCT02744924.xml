	<brief_title>Intervention to Increase Physical Activity in Older Adults Using Citizen-science and Modern Technology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The World Health organization recommends that all adults should aim for 30 minutes of moderate physical activity on at least five days of the week. The importance of physical activity for promoting heath is complicated when considering inactive older adults and chronic conditions. A problematic cycle emerges where physical inactivity increases the likelihood for developing chronic conditions, and, in turn, many chronic conditions are associated with symptoms that make physical activity more difficult. The investigators aim to develop and implement a physical activity promotion intervention for older adults with or without chronic disease living in an urban environment that considers individual, interpersonal and environmental factors and makes use of a citizen-science approach and modern PA-monitoring devices.</detailed_description>
