	<brief_summary>Telehealth, increasingly recognized in the neurology field as a solution to access issues for people with Parkinson's disease, improves access to speech therapy, particularly those living in rural areas or with travel barriers. The SpeechVive device, developed by SpeechVive, Inc., is a treatment solution that is easy to use and effective. In an NIH funded study, the SpeechVive device improved communication in 90% of individuals with PD by improving volume, articulation, and speech rate. The investigators propose to eliminate the one drawback of the SpeechVive device, namely that it currently must be programmed by a speech-language pathologist for each patient in person. The overall goal of this project is to develop a telehealth platform for the SpeechVive device that will enable video conferencing for treatment and remote programming of the SpeechVive device for each patient. Once the platform has been developed, the investigators will conduct a study to examine effectiveness and the patient and caregiver satisfaction with telepractice using the SpeechVive device.</brief_summary>
