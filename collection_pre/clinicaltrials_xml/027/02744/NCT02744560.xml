	<brief_summary>Thalassemics can develop liver fibrosis because of iron overload and hepatitis C infection. The latter is the main risk factor for liver fibrosis in transfusion dependent thalassemics. Excess liver iron is clearly recognized as a co factor for the development of advanced fibrosis in patients with hepatitis virus C infection. Magnetic resonance imaging represents the most available noninvasive technique to assess the level of iron in the liver.there is evidence that suggests Spirulina may help to protect against liver damage, cirrhosis and liver failure in those with chronic liver disease.</brief_summary>
