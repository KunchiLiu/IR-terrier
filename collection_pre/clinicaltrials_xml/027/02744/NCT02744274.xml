	<brief_summary>The aim of this pilot study is to investigate the efficacy of acupuncture in prevention of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy. The study adapted a single center, randomized, assessor- and participant-blinded, controlled, and parallel-design approach to investigate whether acupuncture can prevent or postpone the occurrence of peripheral neuropathy and improve quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Acupuncture in Prevention of Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy - a Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background and purpose: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a disabling side effect of several commonly used antineoplastic agents. CIPN prevalence was 68.1% within the first month of the end of chemotherapy, 60% at 3 months, and 30.0% at 6 months or later. Oxaliplatin as a chemotherapeutic drug for colorectal cancer has neurotoxicity on peripheral nerve system. A definite portion of patients suffered neurologic symptoms including paresthesia, dysesthesia over limbs and perioral area accompanied with muscles cramps or spasm sometimes; however, had impact on quality of life, daily functions, quality of sleep and lead to distress and depression. There is no drug to prevent peripheral neuropathy. Clinical observations reveal that acupuncture could decrease peripheral neuropathy, improve quality of life, and promote motivation of complete chemotherapy course. Material and methods: A total of 32 volunteers of patients with colorectal cancer will be recruited from the Chinese medicine or Western medicine clinics in China Medical University Hospital. These patients will be randomized to receive verum acupuncture or sham acupuncture treatment two times biweekly, prior to beginning chemotherapy and the weeks that drugs administered, for 26 treatments in total. Questionnaires, neurological examination and Von Frey Filament Test will be completed at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks after initiation of intervention, 12 and 24 weeks after completion of acupuncture completion. Predict results: Investigators expect that the efficacy of verum acupuncture is superior to sham acupuncture in prevent or postpone occurrence of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy and able to improve numbness, paresthesia, quality of life. The effectiveness of acupuncture can be detected by questionnaires, Von Frey Filament Test and neurological testing.</detailed_description>
