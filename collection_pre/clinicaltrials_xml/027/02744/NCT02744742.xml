	<brief_summary>Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) appears to be an efficient tool to cure refractory anemia with excess blasts-1 (RAEB-1), refractory anemia with excess blasts-2 (RAEB-2) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) secondary to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). At present, the best conditioning regimen for RAEB-1, RAEB-2 and AML secondary to MDS undergoing allo-HSCT remains in discussion. In this study, the safety and efficacy of Decitabine + BUCY and BUCY myeloablative conditioning regimens in patients with RAEB-1, REAB-2 and AML Secondary to MDS undergoing allo-HSCT are evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decitabine+BUCY vs BUCY Conditioning Regimen for RAEB-1, REAB-2 and AML Secondary to MDS Undergoing Allo-HSCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allo-HSCT appears to be an efficient tool to cure patients with MDS and AML secondary to MDS. At present, the best conditioning regimen for MDS and AML secondary to MDS undergoing allo-HSCT remains in discussion. BUCY conditioning regimen is the standard myeloablative regimen for MDS and AML secondary to MDS undergoing allo-HSCT. However, it appears to have higher relapse rate. To reduce the relapse rate, decitabine is added in the conditioning regimen. In this study, the safety and efficacy of Decitabine + BUCY and BUCY myeloablative conditioning regimens in RAEB-1, REAB-2 and AML secondary to MDS undergoing allo-HSCT are evaluated.</detailed_description>
