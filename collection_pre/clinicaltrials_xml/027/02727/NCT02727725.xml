	<brief_summary>- The purpose of this study is to show that the novel TRAMINER (T(Rho) and Magnetization Transfer and Inversion Recovery) sequence provides at least as good visualization and detection of sub-endocardial scarring, fibrosis, and acute infarction as the current gold standard Inversion Recovery (IR) Turbo-Flash sequence. - The hypothesis is that the TRAMINER sequence has the same or higher sensitivity in detecting small sub-endocardial scarring than the inversion recovery segmented gradient echo sequence known as IR-Turbo Fast low angle shot (IR Turbo-Flash), which is the accepted current gold standard for the detection of myocardial viability.</brief_summary>
