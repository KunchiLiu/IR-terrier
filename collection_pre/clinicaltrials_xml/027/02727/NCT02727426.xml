	<brief_summary>It is well accepted that high-salt (HS) intake is an essential risk factor in development and progression of hypertension. Results of some recent studies suggest that some of the deleterious effects of a HS diet are independent of elevated blood pressure (BP) and may occur in normotensive individuals and are associated with impaired endothelial function. However, the effects of acute salt loading on endothelial function and vascular reactivity in young healthy individuals are still scarce and inconsistent. The purpose of present study is to determine whether one week of HS intake affects microvascular reactivity in young healthy subjects without changes in BP. In addition, the investigators sought to evaluate if potential HS diet-induced microvascular dysfunction is associated with changes in oxidative stress level and/or with modification of immunological response in young healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
