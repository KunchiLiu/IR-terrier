	<brief_title>Effect of OMM on Anandamide Levels in Saliva</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Endocannabinoid System is a signaling system composed of: 2 G-Protein coupled receptors (CB1 and CB2), substances acting on the cannabinoid receptors, and the enzymes and proteins involved in regulating endocannabinoids in tissue and at the receptors. The substances acting the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 are called endocannabinoids. The present study examines the effects of Osteopathic Manipulative Lymphatic Pump Techniques on levels of anandamide, an endocannabinoid, in saliva samples of adult subjects. Based on existing research, the investigators hypothesize that subjects who undergo osteopathic lymphatic treatment will have increased levels of anandamide. Establishing the levels of endocannabinoids in these subjects will allow for a direct measure of the efficacy of the Osteopathic Manipulative Lymphatic techniques. In addition to the quantification of endocannabinoid levels in saliva, a series of 16, 100 mm analog scales will be used to assess the cannabinomimetic effects in the subject pre and post OMM treatment/control and it will be correlated to changes in endocannabinoid levels.</detailed_description>
