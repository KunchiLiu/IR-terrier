	<brief_title>Protocol for the Treatment of Metastatic Ewing Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study for the treatment of Ewing metastatic sarcoma with and induction phase with Vincristine (VIN), Adriamycin (ADM), Ciclofosfamide(CYC), Ifosfamide(IFO), Etoposide(ETO) and radiotherapy (RT)followed by a consolidation phase with Busulfan and Melfalan (BUMEL) and Peripheral Blood Stem Cells Transplantation (PBSCT) and a subsequent maintenance phase with Ciclofosfamide and Celecoxib for High Risk (HR) patients. Very High Risk (VHR) patients will receive a prior frontline therapy with Temozolomide and Irinotecan (TEMIRI), while patient with lung metastasis only will undergo to total lung irradiation after PBSCT</detailed_description>
