	<brief_summary>This study intends to compare the combination of general anesthesia (GA) and single-shot bilateral thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) by ropivacaine in the patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery ( OPCAB) with traditional general anesthesia (GA) perioperative management of patients, committed to reducing patient's physical and psychological stress by surgical trauma, achieve the purpose of fast recovery, in order to establish an more effective perioperative management during off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery, improve patients' satisfaction and to accelerate postoperative rehabilitation safely.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study intends to compare the combination of general anesthesia (GA) and single-shot bilateral thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) by ropivacaine in the patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery ( OPCAB) with traditional general anesthesia (GA) perioperative management of patients, committed to reducing patient's physical and psychological stress by surgical trauma, achieve the purpose of fast recovery, in order to establish an more effective perioperative management during off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery, improve patients' satisfaction and to accelerate postoperative rehabilitation safely. Patients included in the study (approximately 60 cases) will be randomly divided into PVB(T2/3+T5/6)+GA experimental group (A), PVB(T3/4)+GA experimental group (B)the conventional GA control group (C). All groups received the preoperative preparation, anesthesia and postoperative treatment according to the traditional manner, the group A of patients has been received bilateral thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB T2/3+T5/6) by ropivacaine(0.3%,10ml*4), group B will received bilateral thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB T3/4)by ropivacaine(0.3%,20ml*2).,while the group C will received the conventional general anesthesia management without block.</detailed_description>
