	<brief_summary>In functional dyspepsia (FD), abnormal cognitive and emotional changes such increased sensitization, anxiety, and depression scores have been reported in addition to the peripheral changes in gastrointestinal tract functions. In this study, investigators will evaluate the activity of autonomic nervous system, emotional response, and visual attention to food and non-food images in 30 male and female FD patients and 30 age/gender-matched healthy volunteers. These data will provide a new finding of the influence of impaired cognitive processing of food on symptom generation in functional gastrointestinal disorder patients.</brief_summary>
