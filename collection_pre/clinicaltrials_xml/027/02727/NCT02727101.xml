	<brief_summary>The goal of the present study is to evaluate ("screen") a large number (12) of different dual therapies of perampanel + another AED ("PMP+") for a large, 75-100% seizure frequency reduction. The design of the study will differ from usual AED studies. The study will be (i) open label, with (ii) a small n per group, n=6, with (iii) outcome measures a 'blockbuster effect': (a) ≥75 seizure frequency reduction; and (b) seizure freedom.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perampanel for Treatment of Adults With Refractory Focal Epilepsy : a Pilot Study.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators will compare rates of seizure freedom and &gt;75% seizure frequency reduction among 12 treatment arms consisting of 6 subjects each with refractory focal epilepsy treated with perampanel and one other AED ("PMP+"). Treatment arms will include (1) Perampanel +phenobarbital, (2) PMP+valproate, (3) PMP+ lamotrigine, (4) PMP + topiramate, (5) PMP + tiagabine, (6) PMP + levetiracetam, (7) PMP + zonisamide, (8) PMP + pregabalin, (9) PMP + lacosamide, (10) PMP+ clobazam, (11) PMP + ezogabine; and (12) PMP + eslicarbazepine. Each group of 6 will be followed for 12 weeks of baseline observation on baseline medication. Seizure frequency will be counted, using subjects' self-reported seizure diaries. PMP will be titrated to 8-12 mg/day, with the final dose determined by side effects and tolerability of PMP at 8-12 mg/day doses. Titration will occur at the rate of 2 mg/week or two weeks (in accordance with FDA labeling), as tolerated. Subjects will be observed for 12 weeks of maintenance treatment on the target PMP doses. Seizure frequency will be compared between the 12 weeks of baseline observation and 12 weeks of maintenance treatment.</detailed_description>
