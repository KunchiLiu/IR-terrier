	<brief_summary>GSK3179106 is a potent and relatively selective inhibitor of RET kinase which has been designed to be a safe and effective therapy for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients . This is a randomized, double-blind (sponsor unblind), placebo-controlled, dose escalating, four period, single-dose crossover, first time in human study to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of GSK3179106 in normal healthy subjects. The study will be composed of 2 cohorts, each having screening (21 days prior to first dose of study drug), Treatment, and follow-up periods (7-10 days after their last dose [Day 1 of dosing period 4]). The Treatment period will include 4 dosing periods. Subjects will participate in either Cohort 1 or Cohort 2. The total duration of the study for each subject will be approximately 10 weeks. A sufficient number of healthy subjects will be screened to enrol 16 subjects who complete the planned study procedures. Each dosing period will be staggered so that only 2 of the 8 subjects will be administered study drug initially. Once 24 hours (h) have elapsed, and provided there are no safety concerns, the remainder of subjects scheduled for that dosing period may be dosed. A review of safety and tolerability will occur prior to administration of the next dose level. This same procedure will be followed for each escalating dosing period. Subjects assigned to Cohort 1 will participate in 1 placebo and 3 dose escalating periods. Subjects assigned to Cohort 2 will participate in up to 4 dosing periods which include up to 2 escalating doses and placebo in Periods 1 and 2, and a pilot food effect in Periods 3 and 4. Within each cohort, subjects will return for their next scheduled dosing period approximately 14 days after administration of the study drug during the prior dosing period. Cohort 2 will proceed after completion of the treatment periods in Cohort 1. Each subject will be enrolled in only one cohort. The planned dose range is 10 milligram (mg) to 200 mg in Cohort 1. The actual doses to be administered may be adjusted based on safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic data at previous dose levels; these dose adjustments may involve either an increase or a decrease in the planned dose for both Cohorts 1 and 2. There are no formal hypotheses being tested in this study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Healthy as determined by the investigator based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s) which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the investigator, in consultation with the medical monitor, agree and document that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. History of regular bowel habits. Male or Female Males: Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential must comply with the following contraception requirements from the time of first dose of study medication until at least five halflives of study medication after the last dose of study medication. 1. Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia. 2. Male condom plus partner use of one of the contraceptive options below: Contraceptive subdermal implant, Intrauterine device or intrauterine system, Oral Contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone Injectable progestogen, Contraceptive vaginal ring. This is an allinclusive list of those methods that meet the following GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) definition of highly effective: having a failure rate of less than 1 percentage (%) per year when used consistently and correctly and, when applicable, in accordance with the product label. For nonproduct methods (e.g., male sterility), the investigator determines what is consistent and correct use. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception. Females: A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of nonreproductive potential defined as: Premenopausal females with one of the following: Documented tubal ligation Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with followup confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion Hysterectomy Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels consistent with menopause (refer to laboratory reference ranges for confirmatory levels). Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrolment. Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and in this protocol. Alanine Transferase (ALT) and bilirubin &gt;1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%). Previous diagnosis of IBS. Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate &lt;60 milliliters per minute 1.73 square meter (mL/min/1.73m^2). Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones). History of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), dyspepsia, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, GI surgery that could affect motility A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 months of screening. A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen. A positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody. History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: an average weekly intake of &gt;14 standard drinks. One standard drink is equivalent to 10 grams (g) of alcohol: 285 ml of beer, 100 ml of wine or 30 ml of 40% alcohol by volume distilled spirits. Current smoker or use of nicotine containing products within the past 3 months or unable to abstain from smoking tobacco or the use of nicotinecontaining products while on study. Unable to refrain from consumption of red wine, seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice and/or pummelos, exotic citrus fruits, grapefruit hybrids or fruit juices from 1 day prior to the first dose of study drug on Day 1 of each dosing period, until completion of the last PK blood sample time point for that dose period. Corrected QT interval to Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &gt;450 milliseconds (msec) History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. Unable to refrain from the use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication for each dosing period until Day 4 of each dosing period, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety. Paracetamol (&lt;=2 grams per day) is acceptable. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer).
