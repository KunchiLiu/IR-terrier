	<brief_summary>Oocyte maturation requires a lot of energy, which is provided by the mitochondria via the synthesis of ATP. The majority of patients with advanced maternal age (AMA) have poor egg quality. One of the reasons depends on oxidative phosphorylation of Pyruvate to undergo maturation; on the contrary, the cells of the cumulus (CC) show great activity glycolytic so that these cells are able to provide ATP(adenosine triphosphate and energy substrates to the oocyte. The goal of this work is to analyze the mitochondrial function and energy production in oocyte donors compared with a group of women of advanced maternal age subject to a same ovarian stimulation Protocol</brief_summary>
