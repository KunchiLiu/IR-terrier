	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac rhythm disturbance in adults, with prevalence expected to rise significantly the coming decades. The occurrence of AF is associated with significantly increased mortality as well as morbidity of which cerebrovascular accidents is the most important. Unfortunately treatment options remain limited. Anti-arrhythmic drugs are widely used but have limited efficacy and the potential for toxicity and adverse events are recognized. Recent year's catheter ablation of AF continues to gain acceptance for symptomatic treatment, but recurrence rate are high with need for continuous medication. Thus there is a need to better understand what causes development and triggers episodes of AF as well to introduce new treatment options. Cardiometabolic factors such as obesity, inactivity and sleep apnea (SA) have therefore gained interest. Many patients with AF have chronic sleep apnea, and in the present study we want to explore the interaction between SA and AF. The hypothesis of the present study is that SA may trigger AF and that treatment of SA will reduce the overall burden of AF as well as reduce the recurrence of AF after pulmonary vein ablation. To test the hypothesis we will implant a Reveal device that continuously records the hearts rhythm of 100 patients with paroxysmal AF and concomitant SA. Initially the influence of SA on onset of AF will be examined, and the patients will then be randomized to treatment of SA or not and the influence on total AF burden recorded both before and after ablation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sleep Disordered Breathing in Patients With Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For the present project we have established a research team from 2 different university hospitals. This team, including high ranked, internationally renowned scientist from both clinical and basic sciences, will make a framework for PhD candidates and will ensure the patient cohort. Patients with paroxysmal AF and SA will be examined with an extensive diagnostic battery including advanced cardiac imaging tools allowing a proper description of the heart. Then a Reveal that continuously monitor the rhythm of the heart will be inserted, allowing the influence of SA, physical activity, inflammatory parameters, and other external variables on total AF burden to be examined. The patients will then be randomized to treatment of SA with a CPAP or not, and the AF burden recorded 5 months before ablation and 6 months after. The present investigations carried out, are expected to results in better understanding of the interaction between AF and SA and may lay the scientific basis for better diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for patients with AF. In addition, given the advantage of continuous RevealÂ® recording of the patient's heart rhythm, the present study will examine possible triggers of AF such as activity level and inflammatory substances, and examine the role of structural abnormalities in the heart as assessed by echocardiography and MRI for the triggering of AF episodes. An overall aim is therefore a better phenotyping of the patient which could aid in a more person-specific treatment approach, with direct consequences both for the individual patient and for the society.</detailed_description>
