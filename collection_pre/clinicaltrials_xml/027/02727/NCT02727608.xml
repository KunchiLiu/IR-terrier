	<brief_title>Complement Inhibitor Eculizumab in Clinical Islet Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a dual centre, single arm, exploratory study of the possibility to use eculizumab (Soliris) to prevent/reduce destruction of islets of Langerhans after portal infusion of the islets in patients with diabetics accepted for islet transplant. Ten patients from 2 centres (Uppsala University Hospital and Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm) will be transplanted. The purpose of the study is to investigate if selective complement inhibition by eculizumab combined with standard anticoagulation during and after transplantation can further reduce the extent of early tissue loss after portal infusion of islets.</detailed_description>
