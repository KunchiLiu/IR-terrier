	<brief_summary>The heart is essentially a hydraulic pump which ensures adequate delivery of blood through generating pressure and forward flow of blood. The energy delivered by the heart is uncommonly measured clinically, and todays gold standard involves placing a plastic catheter into the lung arteries. The investigators have developed an ultrasound based approach to calculate this energy without the need for catheters through the heart. This novel approach is called ultrapower. Ultrapower involves the instantaneous multiplication of the cardiac output and the arterial blood pressure. The study aims to use the ultrasound based approach to investigate Cardiac Power in the coronary artery bypass graft population.</brief_summary>
