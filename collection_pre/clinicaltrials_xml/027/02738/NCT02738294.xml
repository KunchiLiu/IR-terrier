	<brief_summary>The aim of the present study was to assess whether it was necessary to conduct magnifying endoscopy with narrow band imaging (ME-NBI) targeted biopsy compared with endoscopic forceps biopsy (EFB) from white light endoscopy in diagnosing early gastric cancer (EGC). Meanwhile, the investigators proposed the most cost-effective way to diagnose EGC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Necessity Assessment of ME-NBI Targeted Biopsy Compared With EFB</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ME-NBI has been widely used for the diagnosis of stomach diseases, especially in the early diagnosis of gastric cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate diagnostic efficacy of ME-NBI targeted biopsy and ME-NBI combined with targeted biopsy compared with EFB from white light endoscopy and ME-NBI combined with EFB. A prospective study was conducted encompassing suspected EGC. All patients were performed white light endoscopic examination with EFB and then ME-NBI with ME-NBI targeted biopsy. Outcome measures were assessed and compared, including diagnostic efficacy of EFB from white light endoscopy,ME-NBI combined with EFB, ME-NBI targeted biopsy and ME-NBI combined with targeted biopsy.</detailed_description>
