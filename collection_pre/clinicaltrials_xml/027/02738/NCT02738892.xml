	<brief_summary>This prospective non-intervention cohort study will enroll women in the first or early second trimester of pregnancy and follow them through delivery and 42 days postpartum. Infants will also be followed until 42 days after delivery. Detailed medical and obstetrical information will be collected, as well as biological samples, in order to better elucidate the biological mechanisms leading to preterm delivery among Zambian women, in an effort to identify new strategies for prevention.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After consenting to study participation, women will complete a brief, interviewer-administered questionnaire. Detailed medical and obstetrical history will be collected. Participants will be provided standard of care. Blood, urine, and vaginal specimens will also be collected for the biorepository from those who consent to participate. Throughout the study, participants will receive education about nutrition, pregnancy health, and the signs and symptoms of complications of pregnancy, including preterm labor and preterm premature rupture of membranes. Antenatal, intrapartum, and immediate postpartum study visits for will be scheduled at 24, 32, and 36 weeks gestation, and also at the time of delivery and discharge from the hospital after delivery. During antenatal each study visit (i.e., at 24, 32, and 36 weeks gestation), participants will receive the routinely recommended screening and treatment. This will consist of weight, blood pressure, and urine screening, as well as measurements of fetal growth (fundal height) and fetal well being (fetal heart rate) at each visit. A limited fetal ultrasound will be performed prior to 20 weeks gestation to determine gestational age, and a cervical length evaluation will be performed at 20-22 weeks gestation. At the 24-week visit, participants will also be screened for depression using the Edinburgh Depression Scale. At the time of delivery, the study team will obtain detailed information about the clinical management of the participant's delivery, as well as the delivery outcome for both the mother and her infant(s). Information on interval complications and mortality at the time that the mother and/or her infant(s) are discharged from hospital will also be obtained. There are six follow-up visits scheduled for participants who are not found to have a short cervix. These visits will occur at 24, 32, and 36 weeks gestation, delivery, discharge from hospital, and 42 days postpartum. There are eight follow-up visits scheduled for participants who are found to have a short cervix. These visits will occur at 24, 28, 32, 34, and 36 weeks gestation, delivery, discharge from hospital, and 42 days postpartum. For participants who consent to participate in the biorepository, blood, urine, and vaginal specimens will be collected at the 24 and 32 week visits.</detailed_description>
