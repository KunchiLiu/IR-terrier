	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability and Immunogenicity of ACI-24 Vaccine in Adults With Down Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective multi-center, placebo controlled, double-blind and randomized dose escalation study of 2 doses of ACI-24 versus Placebo over 24 months with a total of 21 visits. All subjects will receive the study medication (ACI-24 or Placebo) 7 times via s.c. injection (12 months) and will be followed up for 12 months after the last dose with a final safety and efficacy assessment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males or females with Down Syndrome aged ≥25 to ≤45 years, with a cytogenetic diagnosis being either Trisomy 21 or Complete Unbalanced Translocation of the Chromosome 21. Subjects and their study partner/legal representative in the opinion of the investigator able to understand and to provide written informed consent. Written informed consent obtained from subjects and their study partner/legal representative before any trialrelated activities. In the opinion of the investigator able to fully participate in the trial and sufficiently proficient in English to be capable of reliably completing study assessments. Subjects have a study partner/legal representative who have direct contact with the subjects at least 10 hours per week and who can be asked questions about the subjects. Subjects weighing less than 40 kg. IQ less than 40 (as assessed by Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test, Second Edition (KBIT2). Any current psychiatric or neurologic diagnosis other than Down Syndrome. (History of minor (but not major) depression according to DSMIV criteria is permitted, but must be on stable treatment for 3 months prior to screening.) Any medical condition likely to significantly hamper the evaluation of safety of the study drug. DSMIV criteria for drug or alcohol abuse or dependence currently met within the past five years. History or presence of uncontrolled seizure disorder or encephalitis. (History of seizures that are well controlled (no seizures in past 3 years) on antiepileptic medications is permitted). History of malignant neoplasms within 3 years prior to study entry or where there is current evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease. History of persistent cognitive deficits immediately following head trauma. History of inflammatory neurology disorders including meningoencephalitis. History of autoimmune disease with potential for CNS involvement. MRI scan at screening showing a single area of cerebral vasogenic edema, superficial siderosis, or evidence of a prior macrohemorrhage, or showing more than four cerebral microhemorrhages (regardless of their anatomical location or diagnostic characterization as "possible" or "definite"). MRI examination cannot be done for any reason, including metal implants contraindicated for MRI studies and/or severe claustrophobia. Significant hearing or visual impairment or other issues judged relevant by the investigator preventing to comply with the protocol and to perform the outcome measures. Severe infections or a major surgical operation within 3 months prior to screening. History of chronic or recurrent infections or immunological or inflammatory conditions which could hamper interpretation of safety. (Celiac disease on a gluten free diet for at least 3 months prior to baseline will be allowed). Any vaccine received within the past 2 months before baseline, except influenza vaccine which if indicated must be given at least 2 weeks prior to baseline. Clinically significant arrhythmias or other abnormalities on ECG at screening. (Minor abnormalities documented as clinically insignificant by the investigator will be allowed.) Clinically significant abnormal vital signs including sustained sitting blood pressure greater than 160/90 mmHg. Clinically significant abnormal hematology and biochemistry values including, but not limited to, elevations greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal value of AST, ALT, or creatinine. Subjects with treated hypothyroidism not on a stable dose of medication for at least 3 months prior to screening and having clinically significant abnormal serum T4 and TSH at screening. Subjects with diabetes mellitus controlled by diet, oral medication or insulin with an HbA1c of ≥ 8.0% and random serum glucose value of &gt; 170 mg/dl. Subjects who have been receiving any experimental drug for Down Syndrome with a washout less than 30 days or less than five halflives of the drug, whichever is longer. Female subjects being pregnant as confirmed by serum testing at screening or planning to be pregnant or lactating. Female subjects not using a reliable method of contraception (unless abstaining). Patient receiving any anticoagulant drug, or aspirin at doses greater than 100 mg daily in the 7 days prior to lumbar puncture (in order to avoid risk of bleeding during scheduled or unscheduled lumbar puncture) Use of antidepressants other than SSRI/SNRIs, antipsychotics (typical or atypical), GABA agonists (e.g. gabapentin), stimulants (e.g. methylphenidate, modafinil), oral steroids, immunosuppressant or immunomodulating drugs, regular use of Benzodiazepines (e.g. lorazepam). Use of Cholinesterase Inhibitor or use of Glutamatergic drugs (Topiramate, Memantine, Lamotrigine) if not on stable dose for at least 3 months prior to screening. Subjects who have donated blood or blood products during the 30 days prior to screening who plan to donate blood while participating in the study or within four weeks after completion of the study.</criteria>
