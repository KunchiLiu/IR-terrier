	<brief_summary>This pilot study will use mobile-health technology to deliver an intervention designed for lasting physical activity behavior change. The study will assess the feasibility of using the Physical Activity Behavior Change(PABC) intervention for Veterans with lower limb amputation. This intervention will be delivered using wrist-worn wearable activity sensors and a home-based tablet computer to allow real-time physical activity feedback and video interface between the participants and the therapist.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Physical Activity Behavior Change for Older Adults After Dysvascular Amputation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study will assess the feasibility of using the Physical Activity Behavior Change(PABC) intervention for Veterans with dysvascular lower limb amputation. In addition, preliminary efficacy of the PABC intervention will be assessed using a two-group randomized cross-over design. Testing will occur at baseline (pre-intervention), three months (end of intervention), and six months. The primary aim is to determine feasibility of using the PABC intervention with Veterans who have dysvascular amputation by measuring: 1. participant retention 2. dose goal attainment 3. participant acceptability 4. safety The secondary aim is to preliminary assess efficacy of the PABC intervention by measuring accelerometer-based physical activity and self-report disability effect sizes.</detailed_description>
