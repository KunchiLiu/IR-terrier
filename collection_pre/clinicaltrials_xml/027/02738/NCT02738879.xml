	<brief_summary>This is a trial of continuing sitagliptin versus withdrawing sitagliptin in participants with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and inadequate glycemic control who initiate and titrate insulin glargine (LANTUS®) based on a treat-to-target algorithm to achieve fasting glucose levels of 72-100 mg/dL (4-5.6 mmol/L). A primary hypothesis of this trial is that after 30 weeks, continuing sitagliptin results in a greater reduction of hemoglobin A1C (A1C) relative to withdrawing sitagliptin.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Have T2DM based on American Diabetes Association guidelines Be on one of the following treatment regimens: 1. Stable dose of sitagliptin (100 mg/day) and metformin IR or XR (metformin) (≥1500 mg/day) either coadministered or as a fixed dose combination (FDC) for ≥12 weeks with A1C between 7.5% and 11.0%, inclusive. OR 2. Stable dose of metformin (≥1500 mg/day) and another dipeptidyl peptidase4 (DPP4) inhibitor (at maximum labeled dose, other than sitagliptin, either coadministered or as a FDC, for ≥12 weeks with A1C between 7.5% and 11.0%, inclusive. OR 3. Stable dose of sitagliptin (100 mg/day) and metformin (≥1500 mg/day) either coadministered or as a FDC, and a sulfonylurea for ≥12 weeks OR stable dose of metformin (≥1500 mg/day) and a sulfonylurea administered as a FDC and sitagliptin (100 mg/day) with A1C between 7.0% and 10.0%, inclusive. OR 4. Stable dose of metformin (≥1500 mg/day) and another DPP4 inhibitor (at maximum labeled dose), other than sitagliptin, either coadministered or as a FDC, and a sulfonylurea for ≥12 weeks OR stable dose of metformin (≥1500 mg/day) and a sulfonylurea administered as a FDC and another DPP4 inhibitor other than sitagliptin with A1C between 7.0% and 10.0%, inclusive OR 5. Stable dose of metformin (≥1500 mg/day) and a sulfonylurea either coadministered or as a FDC for ≥12 weeks with A1C between 7.5% and 11.0%, inclusive. Meet one of the following categories: 1. The participant is a male 2. The participant is a female who is not of reproductive potential 3. The participant is a female who is of reproductive potential and agrees to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving study drug and for 14 days after the last dose of study drug by practicing abstinence from heterosexual activity OR use (or have her partner use) acceptable contraception during heterosexual activity Has been treated with any antihyperglycemic agent (AHA) other than protocolspecified agents (i.e., other than metformin, DPP4 inhibitor, or sulfonylurea agent) within the prior 12 weeks. Has a history of 2 or more episodes of hypoglycemia resulting in seizure, coma, or loss of consciousness, OR has had recurrent (≥3 times per week) episodes of hypoglycemia over the past 8 weeks. Has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or ketoacidosis, or has a history of latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA), is assessed by the investigator as possibly having T1DM or LADA confirmed with a Cpeptide &lt;0.7 ng/mL (&lt;0.23 nmol/L), or has a history of other specific types of diabetes (e.g., genetic syndromes, secondary pancreatic diabetes, diabetes due to endocrinopathies, drug or chemicalinduced, or postorgan transplant). Is assessed by the investigator to be not appropriate for, or does not agree to target, a fasting glucose of 72100 mg/dL (4.05.6 mmol/L).</criteria>
