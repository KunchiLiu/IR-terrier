	<brief_title>Kryptonite - a Novel Osteosynthesis Method for Median Sternotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study was to investigate the beneficial effect of bone cement in combination with wire cerclage on the stability of the sternum following median sternotomy. It has been shown previously that wire cerclage alone does not provide a stabile osteosynthesis following median sternotomy. The hypothesis is that if a stabile osteosynthesis can be achieved patient recovery can be hastened and patient discomfort and pain reduced. One half of the patients received only wire cerclage the other both bone cement and wire cerclage. The stability of the sternum was evaluated using radiostereometric analysis, PET-CT and patient reported outcomes in the form of SF-36 and VAS.</detailed_description>
