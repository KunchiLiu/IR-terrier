	<brief_title>Extension Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Multi-dose Intravenous ARC-520 in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis B (HBV) Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open-label, multi-center extension study of intravenous ARC-520 in combination with entecavir or tenofovir in patients with chronic HBV infection. Patients who successfully completed the Heparc-2002/Heparc-2003 studies and responded to therapy are eligible to participate. Patients who have signed a Human Research Ethics Committee approved informed consent and have met all of the protocol eligibility criteria will continue receiving daily oral entecavir or tenofovir and IV injections of ARC-520. Study visits will occur once every 4 weeks for a total of 9 visits for monitoring and ARC-520 administration . Patients will undergo the following evaluations at regular intervals during the study: medical history, physical examinations, vital sign measurements (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature), weight, adverse events (AEs), 12-lead electrocardiogramss (ECGs), concomitant medications, blood sample collection for hematology, coagulation, chemistry, creatine kinase, troponin, hemoglobin A1c, exploratory pharmacodynamic (PD) measures, urinalysis, HBV serology, immunogenicity, and pregnancy testing for females of childbearing potential.
