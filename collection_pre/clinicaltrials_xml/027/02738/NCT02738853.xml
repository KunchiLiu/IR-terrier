	<brief_summary>The study objective is to evaluate safety and efficacy of the Medtronic TAVR 2.0 system in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who are considered at high through extreme risk for surgical aortic valve replacement</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Medtronic TAVR 2.0 US Clinical Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective, single arm, multi-site study. Patients will be seen at pre and post procedure, discharge, 30 days, 6 months, 1 year, and annually up to 5 years.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Aortic Valve Stenosis</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Severe aortic stenosis, defined as aortic valve area of &lt;1.0 cm2 (or aortic valve area index of &lt;0.6 cm2/m2) by the continuity equation, AND mean gradient &gt;40 mmHg OR maximal aortic valve velocity &gt;4.0 m/sec by resting echocardiogram 2. STS score of ≥8 OR documented heart team agreement of ≥ high risk for AVR due to frailty or comorbidities 3. Symptoms of aortic stenosis AND NYHA Functional Class II or greater 4. The subject and the treating physician agree that the subject will return for all required post procedure followup visits. 1. Any condition considered a contraindication for placement of a bioprosthetic valve (eg, subject is indicated for mechanical prosthetic valve) 2. A known hypersensitivity or contraindication to any of the following which cannot be adequately pre medicated: aspirin or heparin (HIT/HITTS) and bivalirudin ticlopidine and clopidogrel nitinol (titanium or nickel) contrast media 3. Blood dyscrasias as defined: leukopenia (WBC &lt;1000 mm3), thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;50,000 cells/mm3), history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy, or hypercoagulable states 4. Untreated clinically significant coronary artery disease requiring revascularization 5. Severe left ventricular dysfunction with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;20% by echocardiography, contrast ventriculography, or radionuclide ventriculography 6. End stage renal disease requiring chronic dialysis or creatinine clearance &lt;20 cc/min. 7. Ongoing sepsis, including active endocarditis 8. Any percutaneous coronary or peripheral interventional procedure with a bare metal or drug eluting stent performed within 30 days prior to study procedure 9. Symptomatic carotid or vertebral artery disease or successful treatment of carotid stenosis within 10 weeks of Heart Team assessment 10. Cardiogenic shock manifested by low cardiac output, vasopressor dependence, or mechanical hemodynamic support 11. Recent (within 6 months of Heart Team assessment) cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack (TIA) 12. Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding that would preclude anticoagulation 13. Subject refuses a blood transfusion 14. Severe dementia (resulting in either inability to provide informed consent for the study/procedure, prevents independent lifestyle outside of a chronic care facility, or will fundamentally complicate rehabilitation from the procedure or compliance with followup visits) 15. Estimated life expectancy of less than 12 months due to associated noncardiac comorbid conditions 16. Other medical, social, or psychological conditions that in the opinion of the investigator precludes the subject from appropriate consent or adherence to the protocol required followup exams 17. Currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study (excluding registries) 18. Evidence of an acute myocardial infarction ≤30 days before the study procedure 19. Need for emergency surgery for any reason 20. Liver failure (ChildPugh class C) 21. Subject is pregnant or breast feeding 22. Pre existing prosthetic heart valve in any position 23. Mixed aortic valve disease (aortic stenosis with severe aortic regurgitation) 24. Severe mitral regurgitation 25. Severe tricuspid regurgitation 26. Moderate or severe mitral stenosis 27. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy 28. Echocardiographic or MultiSlice Computed Tomography (MSCT) evidence of intracardiac mass, thrombus, or vegetation 29. Congenital bicuspid or unicuspid valve verified by echocardiography 30. Access vessel diameter &lt;5.5 mm or &lt;6.0 mm for patent LIMA</criteria>
