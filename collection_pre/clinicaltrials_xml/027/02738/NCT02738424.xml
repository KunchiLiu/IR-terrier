	<brief_summary>Lumbar spine bone marrow is well explored in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) but some bone marrow diseases are hard to analyze with this method. Furthermore, there is heterogeneity in normal bone marrow, called apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Histological and technical factors appear to be the cause, but the possible influence of the employed post-processing software has never yet been evaluated. The purpose of this study is to determine if there is variability in lumbar bone ADC related to the post-processing software.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lumbar spine bone marrow is well explored in MRI. Some bone marrow diseases are hard to analyze in conventional MRI, and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) could be an additional diagnostic feature. However, according to the literature, there is heterogeneity in normal bone marrow of the quantitative parameter that it provides, called apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Histological and technical factors appear to be the cause, but the possible influence of the employed post-processing software has never yet been evaluated. The purpose of this study is to determine if there is variability in lumbar bone ADC related to the post-processing software.</detailed_description>
