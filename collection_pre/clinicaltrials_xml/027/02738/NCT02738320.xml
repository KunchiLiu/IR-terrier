	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Patients who have been admitted as an inpatient into the departments of Medicine or Surgery at the UC Irvine Medical Center, and whose discharge plan is to a nursing home. Family members of these patients, if they are involved in the choice of nursing home, were also recruited to the study, either as joint decision makers with the patients or as proxy decision makers for the patient. Patients less than 50 years of age. Patients unable to use NHCPlus technology or participate in the nursing home choice decision (i.e. nonEnglish speaking, severely visual or hearing impaired, dementia, or other debilitating illnesses) will be excluded unless they have a representative/proxy who will be involved in the decision to select the nursing home.</criteria>
