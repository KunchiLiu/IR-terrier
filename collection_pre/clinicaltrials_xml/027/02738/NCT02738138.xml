	<criteria>1. Male or female, at least 18 years of age at time of Screening. 2. Screening laboratory result indicating HCV GT1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6infection. 3. Subject has positive antiHCV Ab and plasma HCV RNA viral load greater than or equal to 1000 IU/mL at Screening visit. 4. Subjects must be HCV treatmentnaïve (i.e., subject has never received a single dose of any approved or investigational antiHCV medication) or HCV treatmentexperienced (subject who has failed prior IFN or pegIFN with or without RBV, or SOF plus RBV with or without pegIFN). GT3 subjects must be HCV treatmentnaïve. Previous HCV treatment must have been completed greater than or equal to 2 months prior to Screening. 5. Subjects naïve to ART must have CD4+ count great than or equal to 500 cells/mm^3 (or CD4+ % greater than or equal to 29%) at Screening; or Subjects on a stable ART regimen must have CD4+ count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm^3 (or CD4+ % greater than or equal to 14%) at Screening; and Plasma HIV1 RNA below LLOQ at Screening and at least once during the 12 months prior to Screening. 1. Recent (within 6 months prior to study drug administration) history of drug or alcohol abuse that could preclude adherence to the protocol in the opinion of the investigator. 2. Positive test result at Screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). 3. Positive Human Immunodeficiency virus, type 2 (HIV2) Ab at Screening. 4. Receipt of any other investigational or commercially available direct acting antiHCV agents other than sofosbuvir (e.g., telaprevir, boceprevir, simeprevir, paritaprevir, grazoprevir, daclatasvir, ledipasvir, ombitasvir, elbasvir or dasabuvir). 5. Consideration by the investigator, for any reason, that the subject is an unsuitable candidate to receive ABT493/ABT530.</criteria>
