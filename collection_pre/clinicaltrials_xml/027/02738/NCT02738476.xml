	<brief_title>Outcomes of MAKOplasty Patellofemoral Arthroplasty in Younger Active Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose of this investigation is to report the short-term clinical outcomes of patellofemoral arthroplasty implanted using the MAKOplasty knee resurfacing system. The secondary purpose is to compare the short-term outcomes, complication rates, and survival rates of this operation to those of our historical controls of patients who underwent either osteochondral autograft transfer or autologous chondrocyte implantation for full-thickness patellofemoral articular cartilage lesions. The investigators believe these data will provide strong evidence to improve the selection criteria for patellofemoral arthroplasty. All patients will complete validated questionnaires from the Cincinnati Knee Rating System, including the Sports Activity and Function Form, the Occupational Rating Form, and the Symptom Rating Form. Patients will also complete the SF-12 general health questionnaire. In addition to the above mentioned rating systems, patients will also complete questionnaires on post-surgical expectations and general fitness level.</detailed_description>

Patient agrees to comply with postoperative rehabilitation program. Obesity (body mass index greater than 35). Arthroscopically demonstrated fullthickness articular cartilage lesions (Grade 2B or 3AB) in the other compartments of the knee.

Disabling or widespread osteoarthritis or other joint disease in any other joint. Presence of a significant connective tissue disease, autoimmune disease, HIVpositive, or immune deficiency syndrome. Any contraindications to surgery or other medical disorder that in the opinion of the principal investigator would interfere with the conduct of the study.</criteria>
