	<brief_summary>Concurrent chemoradiotheray is the standard care for patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but often accompanying with high toxicity and poor tolerability. Radiosensitization of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) has been proved in preclinical studies, and the safety of TKI combined with thoracic radiotherapy has also been evaluated in several phase II trials. The aim of study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of thoracic radiotherapy combined with TKI in wild-type EGFR patients who refused or unsuitable for concurrent chemoradiotherapy.</brief_summary>

Has measurable lesion [according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, must have at least one evaluable lesion with the longest dimension &gt;= 10mm; if the evaluable lesion is lymph node, the shortest dimension should be measured and &gt;=15mm]; 4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 01; 5. Expectancy life &gt;= 3 months; 1. Had systemic anitNSCLC treatments; 2. Had be treated by HERtargeting agents; 3. Had local radiotherapy for NSCLC; 4. Has upper gastrointestinal physiological disorders, or malabsorption syndrome, or intolerance of oral medication, or active peptic ulcer; 5. Diagnosed other malignant tumor besides NSCLC within 5 years prior the study treatment (except having simple surgical resection with 5year disease free survival, cured in situ of cervical carcinoma, cured basal cell carcinoma and bladder epithelial tumor); 6. Any evidence to indicate moderate or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); 7. Known hypersensitivity to EGFRTKI agents or relevant components in the formulation; 8. Uncontrolled eye inflammation or infection, or any potential circumstances lead to eye inflammation or infection; 9. Pregnancy or breastfeeding women; 10. Ingredients mixed with small cell lung cancer patients; 11. Evidence of any other disease, neurological or metabolic dysfunction, physical examination or laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicated the use of an investigational drug or puts the subject at high risk for treatmentrelated complications.</criteria>
