	<brief_summary>Systemic arterial hypertension is a disease with high prevalence in several countries, including Brazil. Many studies have correlated hypertension with accelerated loss of cognitive function, especially executive functions. There is some evidence that working memory (WM) is compromised in these populations. However, some computerized training has been developed to rehabilitate the WM, and among them the investigators highlight the Cogmed. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of Cogmed training in the performance of WM and attention of hypertensive patients, as well as the impact of training in the structure and brain function.</brief_summary>
