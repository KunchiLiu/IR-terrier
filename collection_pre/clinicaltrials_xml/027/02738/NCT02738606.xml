	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to compare the effect of having liver resection with standard of care chemotherapy to having standard of care chemotherapy alone in patients whose colorectal cancer has spread to their liver and lungs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Liver Resection Versus No Surgery in Patients With Liver and Unresectable Pulmonary Metastases From Colorectal Cancer (Liver Resection With Unresectable Lung Nodules From Colorectal Adenocarcinoma - LUNA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group. You will have an equal chance to be assigned to either group. - If you are assigned to Group 1, you will have liver resection surgery, followed by standard of care chemotherapy. The chemotherapy you receive will depend on what the doctor thinks is in your best interest. - If you are assigned to Group 2, you will receive standard of care chemotherapy that your doctor thinks is in your best interest. You will sign a separate consent form explaining how the standard of care chemotherapy works, the chemotherapy schedule, and its risks. Group 1: If you are in Group 1, you will have standard of care liver resection surgery. A portion of the liver that is affected by the tumor will be removed either with many small incisions or one large incision. An ultrasound device will be used to help the doctor see the affected area. The study doctor will explain this procedure in more detail and you will sign a separate consent form explaining the standard of care surgery and its risks. Study Visits: Both groups will have study visits every 3-6 months while on study. The following tests and procedures will be performed: - You will have a physical exam. - You will have a chest x-ray or CT scan to check status of disease. - You will have an abdominal and pelvic CT scan, PET/CT scan, or an MRI scan to check the status of the disease. - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing. - You will complete the quality of life survey you completed during screening. Length of Study: You will be on study for up to 3 years. You will be taken off study if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur. This is an investigational study. Liver resection surgery for patients with colorectal cancer that is able to be resected can be done with standard techniques using FDA-approved devices. Liver resection surgery for patients with colorectal cancer that can only be partially resected is considered investigational. Up to 80 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with synchronous or metachronous diagnosis of resectable liver metastases by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen: a) Patients requiring percutaneous or intraoperative ablation of liver metastases &lt; 2 cm in size are eligible. b) Patients who underwent prior liver resection or ablation for colorectal liver metastases are eligible. 2. Patients previously treated with systemic chemotherapy and/or biologic agents for colorectal cancer are eligible. 3. The primary tumor in the colon or rectum may be intact or resected. 4. Lowvolume lung metastases are defined as solid pulmonary nodules &lt; 2 cm with nonspiculated contours, no benignappearing calcifications, and &lt;/= 14 in number, diagnosed by computed tomography of the chest or positron emission tomography (PET). 5. Lung metastases will be unresectable due to anatomic location, distribution, or patients' comorbidities, as determined by review of imaging by a faculty member in the Department of Thoracic &amp; Cardiovascular Surgery. 6. Patients 18 years of age and older. 7. Patients must sign a studyspecific consent form. 8. Patients will undergo CT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to evaluate lung and liver metastases within 30 days of registration. For patients who cannot tolerate CT contrast or have hepatic steatosis that reduces the sensitivity of CT, MRI of the liver will be performed. 1. Radiographic evidence of disease other than liver and lungs, with the exception of mediastinal lymph nodes &lt; 2 cm and hepatoduodenal ligament lymphadenopathy, diagnosed by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or positron emission tomography. 2. Inadequate liver function, as evidenced by serum bilirubin &gt;/= 2 mg/dL, international normalized ratio (INR) &gt;/= 1.7, and/or platelet count &lt; 50,000/microL. 3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 34. 4. Patient refusal to participate in randomization. 5. Pregnant women are excluded from this study. 6. Planned stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for the pulmonary metastases.</criteria>
