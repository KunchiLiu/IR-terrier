	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To demonstrate the noninferiority in the efficacy of Toujeo® to Tresiba® in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) change. Secondary Objectives: - To assess the effects of the insulin Toujeo® in comparison with insulin Tresiba® on: - Change in Fasting plasma glucose (FPG); - Change in Fasting self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) and 4-point SMPG and 8-point SMPG profile; - Percentage of patients reaching HbA1c targets &lt;7% or ≤6.5%; - Percentage of patients reaching HbA1c targets &lt;7% or ≤6.5% without severe and/or confirmed hypoglycemia - Percentage of patients requiring rescue therapy. - To assess the frequency of occurrence and diurnal distribution of hypoglycemia by American Diabetes Association (ADA) category of hypoglycemia. - To assess the safety in each treatment group. - To assess the treatment effects in each treatment group on Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : Adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) inadequately controlled with OADs therapy with/without GLP1 receptor agonist at stable dose for at least 3 months. Signed written informed consent. Exclusion criteria: Age &lt;18 years. HbA1c &lt;7.5% or &gt;10.5% (at screening visit). Body mass index (BMI) &lt;25 kg/m^2 or &gt;40 kg/m^2. History of T2DM for less than 1 year before screening. Less than 6 months before screening on OADs treatment and GLP1 receptor agonist (if taken). Current or previous insulin use except for a maximum of 8 consecutive days or totally 15 days (eg, acute illness, surgery) during the last year prior to screening. Initiation of new glucoselowering medications and/or weight loss drug in the last 3 months before screening visit. Patient receiving only noninsulin antihyperglycemic drugs not approved for combination with insulin according to local labelling/local treatment guideline. History of hypoglycemia unawareness or repeated episodes of severe hypoglycemia or metabolic acidosis, including hospitalization for diabetic ketoacidosis during the last 12 months prior to screening. Unstable proliferative diabetic retinopathy or any other rapidly progressive diabetic retinopathy or macular edema likely to require treatment (eg, laser, surgical treatment, or injectable drugs) during the study period. End stage renal disease. Any acute or chronic condition that in the opinion of Investigator would affect the patient safety, compliance, or study results. Any contraindication to use of Toujeo® or Tresiba® as defined in the national product label, hypersensitivity to Toujeo® or Tresiba® active ingredients or one of the excipients. Pregnant or breastfeeding women. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
