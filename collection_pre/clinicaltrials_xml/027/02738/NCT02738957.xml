	<brief_title>Effect of Prenatal Counseling on Breastfeeding Rates in Twins</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In singleton pregnancies, three randomized studies have recently examined the influence of antenatal breastfeeding education on the breastfeeding rates (Su et al. 2007; Mattar et al. 2007; Wong et al. 2014). Two of these studies did not find differences in the total breastfeeding rates between the groups that received and did not receive antenatal breastfeeding education at the infants' age of 6 months old (Su et al. 2007; Wong et al. 2014). However, Su et al. found higher exclusive breastfeeding rates for 6-months-old infants in the group that received antenatal counseling. In contrast, Mattar et al. 2007 found significantly difference in breastfeeding rates with individual counseling compared to non-counseling or only breastfeeding educational material with no counseling. Few studies have investigated breastfeeding in twins specifically, and even fewer have focused on the duration of breastfeeding of twin infants. Furthermore, in our literature search, we did not find studies of breastfeeding of twins investigating the effect of antenatal education on breastfeeding twins. Our hypothesis is that mothers of twins receiving specific antenatal counseling on breastfeeding should have a higher rate of breastfeeding than mothers who do not receive antenatal breastfeeding counseling. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of specific antenatal breastfeeding counseling on the breastfeeding rates in twin pregnancies.</detailed_description>
