	<brief_summary>ONASSIST is a registry of coronary ill patients who have had a functional test measuring anti-platelet effect and/or a genetic profile of response to anti-platelet drugs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Registry of Coronary Artery Ill Patients With Platelet Test Results</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Onassist Project is an assistance for cardiologists that establishes an individual risk of stent thrombosis for each patient based on: - a functional approach (evaluation of the antiplatelet effect of the antiplatelet regimen by multiple tests) and - a pharmacogenomic approach (genetic profile of response to antiplatelet agents) It provides advices for specific therapeutics after identification of adverse drug interactions, treatment compliance issues and true genetic, functional or mixed resistance. This individualized strategy allow to adjust the choice of the drugs and their optimal dosage considering the best benefit - risk ratio. Follow up are regularly made to identify markers of MACE (major adverse cardiac event) or bleeding.</detailed_description>
