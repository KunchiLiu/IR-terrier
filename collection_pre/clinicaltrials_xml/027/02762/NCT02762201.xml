	<brief_summary>This study aims to compare the therapeutic efficiency of implant-secured removable partial denture (PASI) with the therapeutic efficiency of the metalic standard removable partial denture (PAC) in the treatment of intermediate extended-gap (4 adjacent teeth). The therapeutic efficiency will be assessed by the 5 years-prosthetic success rate.</brief_summary>
