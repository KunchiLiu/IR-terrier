	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to investigate the effects of virtual reality based mirror therapy (VMT) on individuals with acquired brain injury when compared to a control group receiving traditional mirror therapy (TMT). This is a randomized controlled pilot study in which patients with hemiplegia will be assigned to VMT or TMT and the impact on upper extremity function will be observed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Virtual Reality Mirror Therapy for Those With Acquired Brain Injury: A Clinical Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators are currently running a mirror therapy pilot project in the Hamilton Health Sciences Rehabilitation Program. Mirror therapy has been successfully used with people that have injuries such as strokes or other types of brain injuries that affect movement on one side of their body. Mirror therapy involves placing a mirror over the affected limb and angling it to reflect the unaffected limb. This creates a visual illusion that moving the unaffected limb also results in movement in the affected limb. This is theorized to aid recovery of the motor system in the brain. Virtual Reality (VR) can also be used with people with strokes and brain injuries and many studies of VR have shown positive results. In this study, the investigators will combine VR and mirror therapy. The investigators have designed a special new system that uses VR headset to make it appear that both limbs are moving when only the unaffected limb is moving. The investigators are going to do this by having people complete virtual tasks wearing this specially programmed headset. The tasks are everyday activities that a person might perform using two hands. Ultimately, the investigators hope to determine whether there is any difference between VR mirror therapy and regular mirror therapy in improving upper limb function.</detailed_description>
