	<criteria>1. Signed Informed Consent 2. Target population: Healthy (current nonsmokers) subjects as determined by medical history, surgical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory determinations. 3. Subjects with body mass index of 18 to 32 kg/m2, inclusive 4. Men, and women of nonchildbearing potential. Women must have documented proof that they are not of childbearing potential and must not be breastfeeding. 5. Males who are sexually active with women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with study drug(s) plus 5 halflives of the study drug (3 days) plus 90 days (duration of sperm turnover) for a total of 93 days (approximately 14 weeks) after treatment completion. Female partners of male subjects are expected to use one of the highly effective methods of contraception listed in the protocol. 1. History of any chronic or acute illness, recent infection, gastrointestinal disease, smoking and alcohol abuse, any significant drug allergy or allergy to digoxin, flurbiprofen, midazolam, omeprazole, or montelukast, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors, immunologic or related compounds. 2. History of billiary disorder, asthma, bleeding disorder, cancer 3. Received live vaccine during last 12 weeks, active tuberculosis (TB) in last 3 years 4. Medical history indicative of an increased risk of arrhythmia. 5. Evidence of organ dysfunction or any clinically significant deviation from normal in physical examination, vital signs, ECG or clinical laboratory determinations beyond what is consistent with the target population.</criteria>
