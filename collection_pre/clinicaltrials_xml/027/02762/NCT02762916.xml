	<brief_summary>The current increase in chronic diseases calls for changes to the health system. It is necessary to promote expert patient in chronic disease. The expansion of new technologies gives us new tools to face new challenges, providing efficiency, expertise and autonomy. The characteristics of peripheral arterial disease make possible to promote expert patient and the self-management. In order to bring these concepts together the telemedicine program was created to promote expert patient for increasing the quality of life and satisfaction of patients and improving the efficiency of the health system. Methods: Randomized clinical trial on patients with peripheral arterial disease in intermittent claudication grade. They were randomized into two groups: intervention arm (IA) using CONTECI program for self-managing and control arm (CA), followed as usual vascular visits.</brief_summary>
