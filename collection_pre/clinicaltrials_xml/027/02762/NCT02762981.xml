	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of the combination of CORT125134, a novel glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist, and nab-paclitaxel in patients with solid tumors and to determine the preliminary efficacy of the combination of CORT125134 and nab-paclitaxel in patients with solid tumors. The structure for the study is a single arm, non-randomized, open-label, multicenter trial with no control group. The study will be conducted at approximately 8 sites with approximately 82 evaluable patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate CORT125134 in Combination With Nab-paclitaxel in Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is conducted in two parts: Part 1, a dose escalation phase, in which the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Development Regimen will be determined in up to 42 patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Treatment will be administered in 28-day cycles, with the exception of the first cycle, which will have a lead-in of 7 days dosing of CORT125134. CORT125134 is administered orally (PO) once daily for 28 days. Nab-paclitaxel will be administered intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8 and 15. Part 2, a dose expansion phase in which a preliminary estimate of efficacy will be made in expansion groups of approximately 20 patients each. Enrollment in Part 2 of the study (dose expansion) will occur once the development regimen has been determined.</detailed_description>
