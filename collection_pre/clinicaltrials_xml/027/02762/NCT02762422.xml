	<brief_summary>Blood donation has been proposed to be associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, but the effects of phlebotomy on vascular function in human subjects have not been well characterized. A prospective randomized double-blind study was undertaken to determine the effects of iron loss and red blood cell loss induced by serial phlebotomy on vascular endothelial function in the brachial artery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Serial Phlebotomy in Voluntary Blood Donors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>84 Fe-replete, non-anemic subjects were randomly assigned to one of three experimental serial phlebotomy procedures designed to induce Fe loss or RBC loss. Brachial artery reactivity (BAR, %) in response to transient oxidative stress induced by oral methionine was measured with high-resolution duplex ultrasound imaging before and after study phlebotomy procedures.</detailed_description>
