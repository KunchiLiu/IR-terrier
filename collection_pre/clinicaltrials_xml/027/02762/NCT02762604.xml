	<brief_summary>The investigators propose a single-blind randomized clinical trial to determine if seniors show improved mobility (walking speed) and cognition following motor imagery (imagined walking) training. They hypothesize that imagined walking can be used as a rehabilitative tool for improving walking speed and cognition in the elderly, because it engages and strengthens similar neural systems as actual walking and cognition.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Motor Imagery Intervention for Improving Gait and Cognition in the Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed research aims to establish the efficacy of an imagined gait protocol for improving gait and cognition in the elderly. This imagined gait protocol involves imagined gait in single (imagined walking; iW) and dual-task (imagined walking while talking; iWWT) situations. A single-blind randomized clinical trial of 58 cognitively-healthy elderly with pre-post measures of gait, cognition, and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) during imagined gait is proposed. The overall hypothesis is that imagined gait can be used as a rehabilitative tool for improving gait and cognition in the elderly because it engages and strengthens similar neural systems as actual gait and cognition. The first aim of this study is to establish the efficacy of our imagined gait protocol to improve gait and cognition in the elderly. We predict that our imagined gait intervention will improve gait velocity during actual walking and walking-while-talking conditions to a greater extent than the active control (visual imagery) intervention. We also predict that our imagined gait intervention will cognitive performance during dual-task walking conditions. The second aim of this study is to determine neuroplasticity changes in response to our imagined gait protocol. We predict that the neural systems engaged during imagined gait will change following our imagined gait intervention.</detailed_description>
