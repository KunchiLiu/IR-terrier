	<brief_summary>Selection of the optimal treatment for gastric outlet obstruction in patients with radically unresectable gastric cancer remains controversial because previous studies comparing the two procedures had a small sample size as well as they included various etiologies such as gastrointestinal (GI) cancer, duodenal cancer and pancreaticobiliary cancer in selecting the patient population. Therefore, to establish the standard of care for patients with radically unresectable gastric cancer with gastric outlet obstruction, a larger prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial using a single type of stent is warranted.</brief_summary>

Patients with GOOSS score 02 Patients with symptoms consistent with gastric outlet obstruction including persistent nausea and vomiting Patients with findings consistent with malignant gastric outlet obstruction on imaging studies including upper GI endoscopy, upper GIseries or abdominal computed tomography (CT) Patients who are eligible to undergo both gastroduodenal stent placement and gastrojejunostomy (eligibility will be determined by agreement by at least one gastroenterological surgeon and at least one radiologist) Patients who have been provided with an explanation of the procedures of the clinical trial, voluntarily decided participation and signed the informed consent form Pregnant or lactating women Women of childbearing potential with positive pregnancy test at baseline. Postmenopausal women should have at least 12 months of amenorrhea to be considered not of childbearing potential.
