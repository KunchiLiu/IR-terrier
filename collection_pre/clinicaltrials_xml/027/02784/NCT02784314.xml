	<brief_summary>In this observational cost efficacy study, the investigator compare the Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy (LRP) versus Robotic-Assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy (RALP). Every cost of care that include hospitalization related or post operative medical consumption are obtained and recorded up to 5 years follow up. Functional results (continence, potency, quality of life) are obtained through standardised questionnaires. Carcinologic results are estimated by Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) relapse and salvage treatments. Economic evaluation will be made to estimate direct costs of the four postoperative year along with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per successful surgical treatment (preserved urinary continence and erectile function and PSA &lt; 0.2).</brief_summary>
