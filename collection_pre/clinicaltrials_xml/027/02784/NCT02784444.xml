	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double-blinded study of three doses of MSDC-0602K (62.5, 125 and 250 mg) or placebo given orally once daily to subjects with biopsy proven NASH with fibrosis and no cirrhosis. Subjects will be stratified by presence of T2DM (Yes/No), use of Vitamin E ≥ 400 IU (Yes/No) and fibrosis score (1 or ≥ 2) to ensure equal representation across all groups. The primary efficacy endpoint, hepatic histological improvement in NAS defined as a decrease of at least 2 points with no concurrent worsening of fibrosis stage,will be assessed at 12 months. Visits to the clinic will be at baseline, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, with one 2- week follow-up visit.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability &amp; Efficacy of MSDC 0602K in Patients With NASH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blinded study of three doses of MSDC-0602K (62.5, 125 and 250 mg) or placebo given orally once daily to subjects with biopsy proven NASH with fibrosis and no cirrhosis. Subjects will be stratified by presence of T2DM (Yes/No), use of Vitamin E ≥ 400 IU (Yes/No) and fibrosis score (1 or ≥ 2) to ensure equal representation across all groups. The primary efficacy endpoint, as well as 5 secondary endpoints, will be assessed at 12 months. Visits to the clinic will be at baseline, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, with one 2- week follow-up visit. Subjects with biopsy proven NASH (NAS ≥ 4; at least one point in each category) with F1 to F3 fibrosis score will be enrolled into the study. Subjects with demonstrated cirrhosis, hepatitis C, or excess alcohol consumption will be excluded from the trial. Females should be postmenopausal or surgically sterilized. Patients must have signed an informed consent. Approximately 200 subjects will be randomized with the intent to have 180 subjects complete the 12 month assessment (4 groups; approximately 45 subjects/group) at 37 sites in the US. Subjects who do not complete the study will not be replaced. Size #00 opaque gelatin capsules will be prepared using MSDC-0602K tablets or matching placebo capsules containing micro-crystalline cellulose. All doses will be taken orally with about 8 ounces (one glassful) of room temperature water at least 30 minutes before breakfast. Dose levels for MSDC-0602K will be 62.5mg, 125 mg, and 250 mg. Each patient will self-administer one capsule per day. This study will be comprised of a maximum 21-day Screening period, a treatment period of 360 days and a 14-day follow-up period. The total duration of the study for each patient will be approximately 402 days, including follow-up. Safety will be assessed by periodic measurement of vital signs, 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG), physical examinations and questions regarding potential adverse events (AEs). Fasting blood samples for clinical chemistries and hematology will be collected at each study visit (Screening and Study Visits 1-8). Samples for urinalysis will be collected at Screening and all Study Visits except Visits 2 and 3 (Days 1, 90, 180, 270 and 360). Blood samples for trough PK analysis of MSDC-0602 and MSDC 0597 (the hydroxymetabolite) will be taken at Study Visits 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 (Days 30, 90, 180, 270 and 360).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult subjects between the ages of 1875 years, inclusive. Histological evidence of NASH, based on biopsy, with a NAS (NASH CRN scoring) ≥ 4 with a score of at least 1 in each component of NAS. Histological evidence of liver fibrosis defined as NASH CRN System Stage 1 to 3. Male and female subjects with NASH and a fibrosis score of F1 to F3 (NASH CRN scoring) with interpretable liver biopsy within 6 months prior to start of study. If no usable liver biopsy is available within 6 months prior to start of study, subjects must agree to have a liver biopsy performed at Screening for those eligible subjects who meet all other entry criteria. All eligible subjects must agree to have one liver biopsy at the end of study treatment (one year). If the subjects have type 2 diabetes, they must be under stable and reasonable control. Male and female subjects with reasonably controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) are defined as under physician's care for diabetes with glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c] ≤ 9.5%. If the subjects are taking permitted antidiabetic therapies, they must be on stable doses of the following antidiabetics for a period of at least 3 months prior to the diagnostic liver biopsy: metformin, GLP1 agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, sulfonylureas, or DPP4 inhibitors. Refer to Section 4.3 for additional clarification about the use of antidiabetics. Male and female subjects who are taking Vitamin E should be on a stable dose of Vitamin E (if ≥ 400 IU) for a period of at least 3 months prior to the diagnostic liver biopsy. Females should be either postmenopausal (at least 12 months since last menses) or surgically sterilized (bilateral tubal ligation or hysterectomy). Menopausal status will be verified by a folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) test. If FSH levels are below 40 mIU/mL, some method of birth control must be used. Those with bilateral tubal ligation must also use a barrier method of birth control. In addition, all females must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and Day 1 regardless of childbearing potential. For postmenopausal women only, if FSH levels are above 40 mIU/mL and serum pregnancy results are indeterminant, the subject will be assessed as not pregnant. Males with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraceptive methods (including a condom, plus one other form of contraception) if engaging in sexual intercourse. Body Mass Index (BMI) &lt; 45 kg/m2. Willing and able to sign an informed consent document indicating understanding the purpose of and procedures required for the study and willingness to participate in the study.

Use of any diabetes medications other than metformin, GLP1 agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, sulfonylureas, or DPP4 inhibitors three months prior to the baseline diagnostic liver biopsy or during the study unless as specified in the protocol. Use of insulin or PPARγ agonists (pioglitazone or rosiglitazone) are not allowed. Refer to Section 4.3 for additional clarification about the use of antidiabetics. Use of concomitant medications with a known significant metabolism by CYP2C8 or CPY2C9 including: paclitaxel, phenytoin, warfarin, celecoxib, tolbutamide, and replaglinide. History of diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar nonketotic coma. History of heart failure (including CHF) or previous cardiovascular event (myocardial infarct, bypass surgery, or PTCA) within the past 6 months prior to Screening. Serum creatinine &gt;2 mg/dL. Current or recurrent disease that may affect the action, absorption or disposition of the study treatment, or clinical or laboratory assessments. Current or history of severe or unstable disorder (medical or psychiatric) requiring treatment that may make the patient unlikely to complete the study. Blood pressure greater than 160/100 mmHg.
