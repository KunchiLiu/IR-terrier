	<brief_summary>Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) and port-a-cath (PAC) are the most commonly medical devices used for the administration of chemotherapy. Placement of these devices via central venous access is sometimes responsible for complications. The incidence of these complications is correlated with the device holding time. A strategy of iterative PICC placement could significantly reduce these complications.</brief_summary>
