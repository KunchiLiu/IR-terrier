	<criteria>Men or women 18 to 75 years of age at the time of informed consent signature Confirmed diagnosis of RA according to 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) RA classification criteria of at least 6 months duration Positive RF and/or antiCCP (anticyclic citrullinated peptide) Persistently active disease defined as greater than equal to (&gt;=) 6 swollen joints (of 66 counted) and &gt;= 6 tender joints (of 68 counted) Highsensitivity Creactive protein (hsCRP) &gt;= 3.6 milligram per liter (mg/L) Treatment for &gt;= 12 weeks with 10 to 25 mg/week MTX at a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to dosing with the investigational medicinal product (IMP) and maintained throughout the trial Women of childbearing potential must use acceptable methods of contraception for 4 weeks prior to randomization, throughout the trial, and for 90 days after the last dose of IMP. For the purposes of this trial Females who are postmenopausal (agerelated amenorrhea &gt;= 12 consecutive months and increased folliclestimulating hormone [FSH] greater than (&gt;) 40 milli international units per milliliter [mIU/mL]), or who have undergone hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy are exempt from pregnancy testing. If necessary to confirm postmenopausal status, an FSH will be drawn at Screening Acceptable contraception is defined as use of either 2 barrier methods (eg, female diaphragm and male condom), or 1 barrier method in conjunction with one of the following: spermicide, an intrauterine device, or hormonal contraceptives (implant or oral) Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at the Screening Visit and a negative urine pregnancy test at Day 1/randomization before dosing. Use of oral corticosteroids &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent, use of injectable corticosteroids, or change in dose of corticosteroids within 2 weeks prior to Screening or during Screening Initiation or change in dose for nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) within 2 weeks prior to Screening Treatment with tofacitinib, other Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitors, or a biologic diseasemodifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD; eg, antitumor necrosis factor alpha [antiTNFÎ±], tocilizumab [antiinterleukin6 receptor], abatacept [CTLA4Fc]), or other immunosuppressive drugs(sulfasalazine would be acceptable at a stable dose) other than methotrexate within 3 months prior to Screening or during Screening Treatment with antiCD20 therapy (eg, rituximab) within 12 months prior to Screening or during Screening Immunologic disorder other than Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), with the exception of secondary Sjogren's syndrome associated with RA, and wellcontrolled diabetes or thyroid disorder, or any other condition requiring oral, intravenous, intramuscular, or intraarticular corticosteroid therapy Vaccination with live or liveattenuated virus vaccine within 1 month prior to Screening Active, clinically significant, viral, bacterial, or fungal infection, or any major episode of infection requiring hospitalization or treatment with parenteral antiinfectives within 4 weeks of Screening or during Screening, or completion of oral antiinfectives within 2 weeks before or during Screening, or a history of recurrent infections (ie, 3 or more of the same type of infection in a 12month rolling period). Vaginal candidiasis, onychomycosis, and genital or oral herpes simplex virus considered by the Investigator to be sufficiently controlled would not be exclusionary History of or positive testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C antibody and/or polymerase chain reaction, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (+) and/or hepatitis B core total, and/or IgM antibody (+) at Screening History of or current diagnosis of active tuberculosis (TB); undergoing treatment for latent TB infection (LTBI); untreated LTBI (as determined by documented results within 3 months of the Screening Visit of a positive TB skin test with purified protein derivative with induration &gt;= 5 millimeter (mm), a positive QuantiFERONTB test or positive or borderline TSPOT [Elispot] test); or positive QuantiFERONTB test at Screening. Subjects with documented completed appropriate LTBI treatment would not be excluded and are not required to be tested Subjects with current household contacts with active TB will also be excluded Indeterminate QuantiFERONTB or TSPOT tests may be repeated once, and will be considered positive if retest results are positive or indeterminate History of cancer, except adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin (no more than 3 lesions requiring treatment in lifetime) or carcinoma in situ/cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of the uterine cervix, unless considered cured &gt; 5 years Clinically significant abnormality on electrocardiogram (ECG), or an active infective process or any other clinically significant abnormality on Screening chest Xray (CXR) taken within 4 weeks of the first dose, per Investigator opinion. If a CXR has been taken within the previous 3 months and results are available and normal, the CXR does not need to be carried out B cell (CD19) count less than (&lt;) 50% of the lower limit of normal at Screening Significant cytopenia including absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1,500/ mm^3, platelet count &lt; 100,000/mm^3, or absolute lymphocyte count &lt; 1,000/mm^3</criteria>
