	<brief_summary>Design: Single center, double-blind, sham-controlled trial that will randomize symptomatic patients with a coronary chronic total occlusion (CTO) to CTO percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or a sham procedure. All patients will receive optimal medical therapy. Treatment:CTO PCI, as per standard clinical practice. Control: Patients randomized to sham-procedure will undergo only bilateral arterial access, without angiography or PCI being performed. Secondary Endpoints: (1) Greater improvement in SAQ-7 Summary scores during the entire duration of follow-up (6 months) using a repeated measures analysis (2) Greater improvement in individual components of patients' health status (3) Greater improvement in exercise capacity (4) Similar incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), both peri-procedural and long-term</brief_summary>
