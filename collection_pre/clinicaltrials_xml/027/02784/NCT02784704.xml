	<criteria>Male or female participant hospitalized for cIAI At least 18 years of age Evidence of a systemic inflammatory response Abdominal pain or flank pain (with or without rebound tenderness), or pain caused by cIAI that is referred to another anatomic area Able to provide informed consent If male: must agree to use an effective barrier method of contraception during the study and for 14 days following the last dose if sexually active with a female of childbearing potential If female, not pregnant or nursing or, if of childbearing potential: either will commit to use at least two medically accepted, effective methods of birth control (for example, condom, oral contraceptive, indwelling intrauterine device, hormonal implant /patch, injections, approved cervical ring) during study drug dosing and for 14 days following last study drug dose or practicing sexual abstinence Unlikely to survive the 68 week study period Creatinine clearance of ≤50 milliliter (mL)/minute Presence or possible signs of significant hepatic disease Immunocompromised condition, including known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positivity, transplant recipients, and hematological malignancy History of moderate or severe hypersensitivity reactions to tetracyclines, carbapenems, βlactam antibiotics, or to any of the excipients contained in the study drug formulations Participation in any investigational drug or device study within 30 days prior to study entry Known or suspected current central nervous system (CNS) disorder that may predispose to seizures or lower seizure threshold (for example, severe cerebral arteriosclerosis, epilepsy) Antibioticrelated exclusions: 1. Receipt of effective antibacterial drug therapy for cIAI for a continuous duration of &gt;24hours during the 72hours preceding randomization [however, participants with documented cIAI (that is, known baseline pathogen) who have received at least 72hours of antibiotic therapy and are considered treatment failures may be enrolled. Treatment failure is defined as persistent fever and/or clinical symptoms; or the development of a new intraabdominal abscess after ≥72hours of antibiotic therapy], or 2. Receipt of meropenem or any other carbapenem, or tigecycline for the current infection, or 3. Need for concomitant systemic antimicrobial agents effective in cIAI other than study drug Refusal of mechanical ventilation, dialysis or hemofiltration, cardioversion, or any other resuscitative measures and drug/fluid therapy at time of consent Known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease or associated visceral abscess The anticipated need for systemic antibiotics for a duration of more than 14 days Systemic malignancy that required chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation therapy, or antineoplastic therapy within the previous 3 months or that is anticipated to begin prior to the TestofCure (TOC) visit Known at study entry to have cIAI caused by a pathogen(s) resistant to one of the study drugs</criteria>
