	<brief_title>Study of Ruxolitinib for Patients With Myelofibrosis (MF)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If participant agrees to take part in this study, they will continue to receive ruxolitinib as prescribed in Study 2007-0169. In addition, participant will have study visits (described below) to help researchers collect data about any side effects they may be having and what effect, if any, ruxolitinib is having on them and/or the disease. Study Drug Administration: Each study cycle is 28 days. Participant will take ruxolitinib tablets by mouth with a cup of water (about 8 ounces) either 1 or 2 times each day. Participant will continue to receive ruxolitinib at the same dose and schedule that they were assigned in Study 2007-0169. The study staff will remind participant to which schedule they have been assigned. Participant will also be given a study drug diary to write down when they take each dose of ruxolitinib and if they miss or vomit any doses. Participant should bring this diary with them to each clinic visit at MD Anderson. Study Visits: At every visit, participant will be asked about any side effects they may be having and about any new drugs (over-the-counter drugs, prescription drugs, and/or herbal/dietary supplements) that they take or are planning to take. Every 6 cycles (± 30 days): - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - Participant will complete 2 questionnaires about their quality of life. They should take about 10 minutes to complete. Every 3 cycles, participant will be called by the study doctor or a member of the study staff and asked about any side effects that they may be having and to answer any questions that they might have about the study. This call should last about 10 minutes. On Day 1 of Cycle 3 and then every 3 cycles after that (Cycles 6, 9, 12, and so on) (+/- 14 days), blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. Participant may choose to have these blood draws performed at a local lab or clinic closer to their home. The results of this testing will then be sent to the study doctor at MD Anderson. The study doctor will discuss this option with participant. Length of Study: Participant may continue taking ruxolitinib for as long as the doctor thinks it is in their best interest. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if they are unable to follow study directions. Patient's participation on the study will be over after follow-up. End-of-Study Visit: As soon as possible after participant's last dose of study drug, if the doctor thinks it is needed: - Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - Participant will have a complete physical exam. - Participant will complete the 2 questionnaires about their quality of life. This is an investigational study. Ruxolitinib is FDA approved and commercially available to treat MF. It is considered investigational to collect data about the long-term effects of ruxolitinib. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work. Up to 14 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
