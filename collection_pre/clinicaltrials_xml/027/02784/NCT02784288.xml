	<brief_title>Phase II Treatment Stratification Trial Using Neck Dissection-Driven Selection to Improve Quality of Life for Low Risk Patients With HPV+ Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators will determine whether treatment stratification by neck dissection, to more accurately pathologically stage patients, minimizing the number of treatment modalities in patients with low risk oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, can improve quality of life. After enrollment, all patients will undergo neck dissection and primary site biopsy. Pathology will be reviewed and patients will be stratified into one of three treatment 1. Patients with a single lymph node that measures less than six centimeters, have no extracapsular extension in the lymph node, and have no perineural or perivascular invasion of the primary biopsy will undergo transoral surgery of the primary site. 2. Patients who have 2 positive nodes with no extracapsular extension, or have perineural or perivascular invasion of the primary biopsy will undergo radiation. 3. Patients who have extracapsular extension in any number of lymph nodes or in those patients in whom negative margins are unable to be obtained after the completion of transoral surgery will undergo chemoradiation. After completion of therapy (surgical, radiation, or combined modality) patients will be followed closely on an outpatient basis including regular exams, quality of life questionnaires, and interval surveillance imaging as clinically indicated. Swallowing function will also be addressed by videofluoroscopy one year after completion of therapy. Blood/plasma and oral rinses for correlative studies will be collected at 3-month intervals during 3 years of follow up.</detailed_description>
