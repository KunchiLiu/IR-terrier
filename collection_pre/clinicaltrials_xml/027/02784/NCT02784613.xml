	<brief_summary>This is an unblinded study to be conducted at a single research center, San Diego Sexual Medicine. Subjects meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will receive 60 mg ospemifene daily for twenty weeks. After the informed consent is signed, a baseline physical examination, and vulvoscopy with detailed photography of the vulva, vestibule and vagina, will be performed. Physical examination and vulvoscopy with detailed photography of the vulva, vestibule and vagina, will be repeated prospectively every 4 weeks for a total of 20 weeks. Therefore, physical examination and vulvoscopy with detailed photography of the vulva, vestibule and vagina will be performed prospectively at baseline (vulvoscopy session 1), 4 weeks (vulvoscopy session 2), 8 weeks (vulvoscopy session 3), 12, weeks (vulvoscopy session 4), 16 weeks (vulvoscopy session 5) and 20 weeks (vulvoscopy session 6) following daily administration of 60 mg ospemifene.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vulvoscopy Changes of the Vulva, Vestibule and Vagina With Daily Ospemifene in Women With Dyspareunia From VVA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ospemifene is indicated for post-menopausal women diagnosed with vulvar vaginal atrophy (VVA) and dyspareunia. While ospemifene clinically significantly reduces pain associated with dyspareunia, there has been little prospective documentation using vulvoscopy with detailed photography of the visible changes to the vulva, vestibule and vaginal region with daily administration of 60 mg ospemifene in post-menopausal women with VVA and dyspareunia. This study will include a total of 6 prospective photographic sessions of the vulva, vestibule and vagina over the 20 weeks administration of 60 mg ospemifene in the study. Comparisons will be made of baseline photography (vulvoscopy session 0) with photography at 4 weeks (vulvoscopy session 1), 8 weeks (vulvoscopy session 2), 12 weeks (vulvoscopy session 3), 16 weeks (vulvoscopy session 4) and 20 weeks (vulvoscopy session 5). Currently there have been limited prospective studies using vulvoscopy with detailed photography demonstrating visible changes to the vulva, vestibule and vagina following oral administration of 60 mg ospemifene in post-menopausal women with VVA and dyspareunia. Information regarding visible changes to the vulva, vestibule and vagina may be very important to the patient and to the health care provider to best understand the beneficial effects of ospemifene and to ensure patient compliance with treatment.</detailed_description>
