	<brief_summary>This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group comparison study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cyclo-Z for the treatment of subjects with obese type 2 diabetes. The study will consist of 3 phases: - Screening phase (2 weeks) - Treatment phase (12 weeks) - Follow-up phase (2 weeks) Following a 2-week screening period, subjects who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned into one of the following treatment arms: - Dose A: Cyclo-Z containing 23 mg zinc plus 3 mg CHP - 16 subjects - Dose B: Cyclo-Z containing 23 mg zinc plus 9 mg CHP - 16 subjects - Dose C: Cyclo-Z containing 23 mg zinc plus 15 mg CHP - 16 subjects - Dose D: Placebo - 16 subjects The assigned dose will be orally administered to subjects once a day before bedtime for 12 consecutive weeks. After the randomization at Week 0 (Visit 2), subjects will visit their respective trial sites at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 (Visits 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9).</brief_summary>
