	<brief_summary>Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with nasal polyps is a particularly challenging form of chronic rhinosinusitis in several ways. Patients have significantly more severe symptom burden and worse quality of life than patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps. Many patients return to the health care providers with persistent symptoms after repeated medical and surgical treatment. Patients have usually tried several different types of treatments, ranging from less invasive procedures to extensive surgical treatment. The surgical treatment is often repeated several times. The most common surgical treatment is functional endoscopic sinus surgery, another established procedure is Vidian neurectomy. The main object of this pilot study is to investigate the safety of onabotulinumtoxin A towards the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) in CRS patients with nasal polyps. Efficacy data will also be collected to provide indication on whether future placebo-controlled studies should be performed. Onabotulinumtoxin A inhibits the secretion of acetylcholine, blocking the parasympathetic reflex cascade in the SPG. As a result, the investigators expect less mucosal swelling, secretion and nasal polyps. The duration of such a blockade is believed to last for 3-9 months and will not lead to damage of the nerve. This study opens up for improved treatment with less complications.</brief_summary>
