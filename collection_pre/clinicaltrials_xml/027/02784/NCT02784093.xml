	<brief_summary>Fecal impaction (FI) is a common cause of lower gastrointestinal tract obstruction, and it is the result of chronic or severe constipation and most commonly found in the elderly population. Gastrografin is a water soluble contrast mediate that is used as a radiologic contrast agent and may be administered orally or rectally. It has been shown to confer a therapeutic beneﬁt in adhesive small bowel obstruction (SBO). The investigators speculate that gastrografin given enterally may be more effective than enema in the treatment of fecal impaction induced intestinal obstruction.</brief_summary>
