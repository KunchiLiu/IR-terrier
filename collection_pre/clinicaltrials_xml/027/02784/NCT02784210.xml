	<brief_summary>Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. MS lesions can appear on the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans in many ways. Sometimes they light up from the outer edge and fill inward. This is called ring enhancement. Researchers think this type of lesion may not heal as well as others. Corticosteroids are the standard treatment to reduce symptoms of MS relapse. But there is no standard treatment for people with enhancing MS lesions without signs of MS relapse. Researchers want to see if a short-term high-dose course of corticosteroids helps heal those lesions. Objective: To study the effects of short-term high-dose corticosteroids on ring-enhancing MS. Eligibility: Adults ages 35 and older who: Have MS and a rim-enhancing lesion on a prior brain MRI Are enrolled in another NINDS protocol Design: Participants will be screened under another protocol Participants will be randomly assigned to get either no treatment or 3 days of treatment with a corticosteroid. Participants will have: 1 baseline visit 3 dosing visits over 3 days if assigned to get treatment. Participants will get methylprednisolone by IV each day. They will get medicine to protect their stomach. 1 visit each month for 7 months Visits include medical history and physical exam. Participants will have blood and urine tests. Participants will also have neurological exams and MRIs. Participants lie on a table that slides into a cylinder. They are in the scanner 1.5 2 hours. They get a dye through a catheter: A needle guides a thin plastic tube into an arm vein.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives. The primary aim of this pilot study is to assess the effects of short-term, high-dose corticosteroid administration on the 12-week evolution of multiple sclerosis lesions with centripetal enhancement pattern on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in particular with respect to the development of a hypointense rim on 7-tesla phase images. In our prior work, the phase rim has been associated with persistent deleterious inflammation with poor repair and ongoing neurodegeneration within lesions. Study population. Up to 30 multiple sclerosis patients with asymptomatic contrast-enhancing lesions will be enrolled. Patients will be randomly assigned to either 3 days of intravenous methylprednisolone (1000 mg/day) or to no treatment. Design. Patients will undergo serial brain MRIs with gadolinium-based contrast agent on both 3- and 7- tesla scanners over an approximate 25-week period. 3-tesla scans will be obtained at baseline and every 4 weeks until week 25. 7-tesla scans will be obtained at baseline and at weeks 1, 13, and 25. Participants with one or more centripetal/rim-enhancing lesions at the baseline scan will be randomized and followed. Clinical evaluation and blood testing will be performed at baseline and weeks 1, 13, and 25. Outcome measures. The primary outcome measure is the presence or absence, on the week-13 7-tesla scan, of a hypointense phase rim in each of the lesions followed over time. Secondary outcome measures include the persistence of gadolinium enhancement at week 1, the presence or absence of a hypointense phase rim at week 25, and the lesion volume, intralesional median R1 relaxation rate, and at weeks 13 and 25. From 3-tesla scans, we will measure the time evolution of normalized intralesional proton density-weighted, T2-weighted, T1-weighted signal, as well as the R1 relaxation rate and magnetization transfer ratio. We will also assess for the presence or absence of a hypointense phase at 3T. Additional exploratory outcome measures, including clinical and immunological assessments, will also be collected.</detailed_description>
