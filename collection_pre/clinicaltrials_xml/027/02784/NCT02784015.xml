	<brief_title>Response Based Treatment for Children With Unresectable Localized Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Response after initial chemotherapy is one of the important prognostic factor in many cancers. In this study, treatment will be tailored according to the treatment responses which are assessed by tumor volume reduction, necrosis rate or residual fludeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in positron emission tomography (PET) scan.</detailed_description>
