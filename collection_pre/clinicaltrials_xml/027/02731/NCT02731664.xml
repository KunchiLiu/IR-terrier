	<brief_summary>The inhibitory effect of low dose GLP-1 is investigated on prandial motility of the stomach, duodenum and jejunum in vivo in humans. Supplementary in vitro studies on the mechanism of action of the GLP-1 inhibition of motility as carried out on muscle strips from the upper gastrointestinal tract in man.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GLP-1 Inhibits Prandial Antro-duodeno-jejunal Motility in Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twelve healthy volunteers will undergo antroduodenojejunal manometry. Baseline recording with infusion of saline for 1 hour is compared with infusion of GLP-1 0.7 and 1.2 pmol per kg minute for another 1 hour. Plasma GLP-1 and GLP-2 is measured by RIA. Responses to GLP-1 will be measured after food intake as prandial response to GLP-1. The outcome will be evaluated as change in motility index from baseline to meal-stimulated conditions and during influence of GLP-1. Further in vitro studies of gastrointestinal muscle strips, precontracted with bethanechol or electric field stimulation, are planned to investigate the response to GLP-1 or GLP-1 analogue ROSE-010. GLP-1 and GLP-2 receptor immunoreactivity is localized by immunohistochemistry. Receptor mediated mechanisms are studied with GLP-1 receptor blocker exendin(9-39)amide, nitro-monomethyl arginine to block nitric oxide synthase and tetrodotoxin to block sodium channels and nerve conduction.</detailed_description>
