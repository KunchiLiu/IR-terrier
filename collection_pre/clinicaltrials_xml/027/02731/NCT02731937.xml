	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to collect clinical raw scan data and Scanner user feedback using dual energy CT (computed tomography) scan modes on the investigational CT scanner. Additionally, image quality using prototype reconstruction algorithms that are in development will be evaluated and compared to standard-of-care images acquired with regulatory cleared diagnostic CT scanners for feasibility assessment and engineering development. Compared to standard clinical single energy (kilovolt,kV) scanning, dual energy (kV) scanning s provides more information about the material composition of the scanned patient and may allow for improved tissue, tumor characterization, and improved image quality.</brief_summary>
