	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the short-and long-term effects of the home-based pulmonary rehabilitation on peripheral muscle strength, functional capacity and quality of life in patients with bronchiectasis. The participants will be randomized into two groups: control group (usual care and recommendations for practice exercise) and training group, that will perform aerobic (stepping training) and resistance training (lower and upper limbs) for eight weeks, three times a week. At baseline, immediately after finishing and after six months the patients will undergo assessments.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short-and Long-term Effects of a Home-based Rehabilitation Program in Patients With Bronchiectasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Home-based pulmonary rehabilitation (HBPR) has been used in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and pulmonary fibrosis. Results from HBPR have been similar to those observe in the outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation such improvement in exercise capacity, symptoms and quality of life. However, HBPR has not yet been investigated in patients with bronchiectasis, a progressive and debilitating disease with a high socioeconomic impact. Objective: To investigate the short-and long-term effects of the home rehabilitation program in peripheral muscle strength, functional capacity and quality of life in patients with bronchiectasis. Methods: Patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis will be recruited from the Obstructive Diseases Outpatient Clinic of the Hospital das Clínicas - Medicine School, University of São Paulo. Participants will be randomized into two groups: control group (usual care and recommendations for performing exercises and respiratory physiotherapy) and training group, that will perform aerobic (stepping training) and resistance training (lower and upper limbs) for eight weeks, three times a week. All patients will receive a phone call once a week and patients allocated to the training group, additionally, will get a home visit every 15 days. At baseline, immediately after finishing and after six months of the HBPR patients will undergo to assessments. Expected results: HBPR will have positive effects on exercise tolerance and quality of life. Also, this study will contribute to future guidelines on the recommendation of HBPR for patients with bronchiectasis.</detailed_description>
