	<brief_summary>Chronic intestinal pseudo obstruction(CIPO) is a serious motility disorder with life-threatening condition, and it is often related with bacterial overgrowth. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) results in restoration of the normal intestinal microbial community structure. The investigators planned to observe the eﬃcacy of FMT in the treatment of a series CIPO patients. Patients received FMT on 6 consecutive days through nasojejunal tubes and followed up for 8 weeks after treatment. Rate of clinical improvement and remission, feeding tolerance of enteral nutrition, CT score of intestinal obstruction, and gastrointestinal quality-of-life index(GIQLI) were evaluated.</brief_summary>
