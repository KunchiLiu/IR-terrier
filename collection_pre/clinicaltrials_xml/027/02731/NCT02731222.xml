	<brief_summary>The objective of the present study is to determine the degree of correlation between clinical severity of chronic venous insufficiency and prevalence of onychodystrophy. The achievement of the study will require previously a synthetic exposition of the two diseases, emphasizing those factors affecting the proposed analysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevalence of Onychodystrophy in Patients With Chronic Venous Disease of the Lower Limbs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The final goal of this work is to determine if patients with increased clinical severity of chronic venous insufficiency have also a higher prevalence of onychodystrophy. Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI) is a vascular disease that responds to a number of different clinical syndromes and is manifested in the lower extremity, whose nexus is venous hypertension (HTV). Onychodystrophy on the feet is a progressive non-infectious condition associated with various factors, which increases with age. Predominantly occurs in females, presents poor aesthetic appearance and often annoyed with footwear. The work that is intended to perform is observational, descriptive, analytical, cross-sectional and unicentric. In order to prove the feasibility, the researcher will conduct a previous pilot study. The study will undertake a preliminary investigation work (pilot study) to be performed with a total of 40 patients (aged 40 to 85) who are attending the service of Angiology and Vascular Surgery of the Hospital de Sant Pau. These patients will be selected to verify their data and then the researchers will perform a statistical study from a descriptive and inferential point of view.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Venous Insufficiency</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Subjects with an age range between 40 and 85 years. Patients who attend the service of Angiology, Vascular Surgery and Endovascular with chronic venous disease or chronic venous insufficiency in lower extremity and presenting a clinical degree among C0 to C6 scale of the classification CEAP (ClinicEtiology AnatomyPathophysiology) while at the same time they manifest venous reflux, when exposed to the echoDoppler scan. Patients agreeing to voluntarily participate in the study and that sign the informed consent document. Congenital Onychopathy Presence in any nail plate of fungal, viral or bacterial infections Emergence of digital foot deformities Manifestation of biomechanical problems Presence of degenerative joint disease (arthrosis, arthritis) Patients who make or have made routine use of inappropriate or poorly adjusted footwear and especially, those who have onychodystrophy attributable clearly, and directly to the footwear Individuals presenting a Greek foot and especially, those that manifest this onychodystrophy in the second toe. Patients in which onychodystrophy is due to surgical iatrogenic event Individuals presenting subungual tumours (exostosis, tumor Glomus, chondroma, whitlow melanic). Patients who take or have taken any drug that is directly associated with a cause of onychodystrophy Patients with a history of skin diseases such as psoriasis, Lichen Planus or alopecia areata, that are associated in general with nail manifestations. Patients with a background of physical or chemical trauma on the nails of the feet that have clearly given rise to onychodystrophy. Individuals, who have any type of amputation of the lower limbs. Patients with a history of nail foot surgery (less than a year) or showing any digital amputation (total or partial). Individuals that, despite complying with all the requirements of the study, decline to participate or refuse to sign the informed consent document. People with any medical illness or psychiatric disorder which, in the opinion of the investigator, preclude them from understand the reason for the selection or were unable to give informed consent to participate in the study Subjects with postthrombotic syndrome. The affected lower limb with varicose veins that has undergone surgery with any invasive procedure will be excluded. Patients presenting prosthesis or nail cosmetics are also excluded of the study</criteria>
