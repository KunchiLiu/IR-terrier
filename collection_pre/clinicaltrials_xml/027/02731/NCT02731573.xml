	<brief_summary>This study is aimed to assess the anti-infective efficacy of D-PLEX over a period of 3 months post operation as well as the safety over a period of 6 months, by preventing sternal infection post cardiac surgery in patients above the age of 18, including high risk patients for infection. This study is a 2 parts study: part 1 is a single arm, part 2 is randomized controlled study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of D-PLEX in the Prevention of Sternal Infection Post Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>D-PLEX is a new formulation of extended controlled release Doxycycline, which is impregnated into a synthetic, β Tri-Calcium Phosphate (β-TCP). The components of the extended controlled release antibiotic formulation are doxycycline hyclate, poly (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) or PLGA, and a lipid matrix comprised of cholesterol, and 2 phosphatidyl-choline phospholipids, specifically dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and distearoyl phosphatidylcholine (DSPC). Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria and provide signed informed consent, will be enrolled into the study and will be treated with D-PLEX concomitantly with standard of care. D-PLEX will be administered as a single application during a cardiac surgery (index procedure) immediately prior to sternal closure, as an adjunct to the standard care. The study will assess the efficacy and safety of the controlled release antibiotic (doxycycline) by the reduction in the number of sternal infections observed during the treatment period in any subject above the age of 18 years, including patients with high risk for infection. Additional follow up for prolonged safety assessments only, will be done as follows until 24 weeks.</detailed_description>
