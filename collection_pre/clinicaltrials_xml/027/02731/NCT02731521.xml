	<brief_summary>The Investigators will examine the disease specificity of 2-hydroxyglutarate in non-glioma brain lesions, and the clinical utility of 2-hydroxyglutarate, glycine and citrate in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutated gliomas and IDH wild type gliomas.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) imaging will identify glioma, tumor progression and response to therapy noninvasively at an earlier time point than currently detectable with standard MR imaging. This utility of 2HG can be used for improving the patient care in a more effective manner when the 2HG imaging is incorporated in regular clinical MR scans in brain tumor patients. We aim to translate the 2HG MRS protocol into two clinical MR centers at UTSouthwestern Medical Center: The Mary Nell and Ralph B. Rogers Magnetic Resonance Center with Philips 1.5Tesla and 3Tesla scanners and The Algur H. Meadows Diagnostic Imaging Center with a GE 3Tesla scanner. In addition, we will perform Magnetic Resonance (MR) scans in patients with neurological diseases that can mimic gliomas, including stroke, epilepsy, encephalitis, and brain metastases in order to establish the specificity of 2HG to malignant gliomas.</detailed_description>
