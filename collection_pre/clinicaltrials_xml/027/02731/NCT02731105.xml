	<brief_title>Pilot Study of Tolerability and Effectivity of Two Combination Topical Acne Products</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At baseline, data will be collected regarding demographics and medical/medication histories, lesions will be counted and a medical examination will be done. Female patients who could be pregnant will be tested by using a pregnancy test. Each patient receives two tubes with different medication that has to be applied on the left or right side of their face each by themselves at home once a day(Acnatac® Gel, Duac® Gel, Epiduo® Gel). Patients and study-center staff will be instructed not to reveal the treatment allocation to the investigator, and patients will be instructed not to apply the product in their presence Follow-up visits will be conducted on days 0, 7 and 21. On these days the investigator measures erythema and dryness/scaling using the Investigators´Global Assessment, the severity of burning/ stinging and itching by using Study Subject Self-Assessment, records the number of acneiform lesions, measures health-related quality of life using DLQI-Score, skin hydration using Corneometer, transepidermal water loss (TEWL) using Tewameter®, skin surface pH using pH-Meter and skin sebum excretion using Sebumeter. On days 0, 7, and 21 it will be collected information about current use of any other medication. Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be monitored at each visit. On day 21 there will be made a last pregnancy test. Checking compliance will be made regularly.</detailed_description>
