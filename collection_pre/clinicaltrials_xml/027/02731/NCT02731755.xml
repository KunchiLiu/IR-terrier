	<brief_summary>A diet rich in whole grain is inversely associated with cardiovascular disease risk. Whole grains contain a wide range dietary components including potentially vasoactive phenolic acids. In this proposed human trial, the investigators aim to establish whether consumption of one portion of phenolic acid-rich oats leads to acute improvements (i.e. 1-24h post-intake) in markers of cardiovascular disease risk relative to an energy matched control intervention in healthy men with high-normal to mildly elevated blood pressure.</brief_summary>
