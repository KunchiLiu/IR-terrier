	<brief_summary>The aim of the investigators work is to describe the urodynamic results in the CKD (chronic kidney disease) grade 4 patients and to verify observations that urinary catheter may improve kidney function in those patients. 100 patients with CKD grade 4 will do urodynamic examination. All patients will be randomized into two groups / the intervention group that will be inserted urinary catheter for 2 weeks and the follow up group. Kidney function will be monitored by creatinin values and the investigators will measure the time to dialysis in the two groups.</brief_summary>
