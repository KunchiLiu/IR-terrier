	<brief_summary>The aims of the study are to reduce acute radiation induced side effects, i.e. pneumonitis and esophagitis grade II or higher by the use of proton therapy compared to photon radiotherapy of equal total dose. Secondary endpoints include evaluation of quality of life, loco-regional control, survival and late radiation induced side effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proton Therapy to Reduce Acute Normal Tissue Toxicity in Locally Advanced Non-small-cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients in this trial undergo primary radiochemotherapy for locally advanced NSCLC. As early and intermediate late effects of radiotherapy do not only hamper quality of life but can, in the case of radiation induced pneumonitis, be potentially lethal, a reduction of these side effects is desirable. Patients in this trial are 1:1 randomised to intensity modulated radiotherapy with photons or proton therapy. The primary aim of the study is to show a decrease of pneumonitis and or esophagitis grade 2 or higher by proton therapy. The observed incidence of both these side effects is 39% with photon therapy. The estimated incidence with proton therapy is around 12 %. Simultaneous chemotherapy will be applied to current clinical standards.</detailed_description>
