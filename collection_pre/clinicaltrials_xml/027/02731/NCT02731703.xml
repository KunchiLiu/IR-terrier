	<brief_summary>This study will identify and enroll patients already scheduled to receive guided maxillary implant placement with palateless overdenture. Standard clinical practice will be followed for this multi-stage process. The study purpose is to evaluate the degree of satisfaction during the standard progression in order to determine at which post edentulous stage patients achieve maximum satisfaction using the Oral Health Impact Profile 49 (OHIP 49).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Conventional, Overdenture and Palateless Overdenture Oral Health Impact Comparison Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The OHIP 49 will be administered at pre-treatment (edentulous condition) and after each visit (i.e., newly fabricated conventional denture, conversion to a 4 implant retained overdenture and finally a 4 implant retained palateless overdenture). Participants will have an interim denture fabricated to be worn for 10-12 weeks. During this time, participants will have 4 implants placed and continue wearing the interim denture. At 8 weeks after implant placement, participants will have locator attachments placed on implants and the interim denture snapped into place, termed the 'overdenture.' After 10-12 weeks of wearing this overdenture, patients will receive a new denture, termed 'final palateless overdenture,' which consists of a denture snapped into the 4 implants without a palate. Participants will be evaluated at a 10-12 week followup from insertion of this prosthesis. Participants will complete questionnaires at each stage of treatment. Estimated duration of patient participation is approximately 8 months (31weeks) with understanding of flexibility based on laboratory fabricated denture frameworks and adjustments needed for approval of esthetics.</detailed_description>
