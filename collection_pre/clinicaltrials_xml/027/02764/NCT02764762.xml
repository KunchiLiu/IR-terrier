	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of triple combination therapy with an anti-integrin [vedolizumab intravenous (IV)], a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist [adalimumab subcutaneously (SC)], and an immunomodulator (oral methotrexate) on endoscopic remission in participants with newly-diagnosed Crohn's disease stratified at higher risk for complications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Triple Combination Therapy in High Risk Crohn's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab. Vedolizumab is being tested to treat people who have Crohn's Disease. This study will look at the endoscopic remission and mucosal healing of gastrointestinal tract of people who take vedolizumab as triple combination therapy with adalimumab and methotrexate. The study will enroll approximately 60 patients. Participants will receive triple combination therapy which includes: - Vedolizumab 300 mg - Adalimumab 160/80/40 mg - Methotrexate 15 mg All participants will receive vedolizumab IV infusion on Weeks 0, 2, 6, 14 and 22 along with adalimumab 160 mg, SC injection at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, then 40 mg once at Week 4 and every 2 weeks thereafter until Week 26 along with methotrexate tablets orally, once weekly from Weeks 0 up to Week 34. In monotherapy phase, all participants will receive vedolizumab IV infusion once at Weeks 30, 38, 46, 54, 62, 70, 78, 86, 94 and 102. This multi-center trial will be conducted in United States and Canada. The overall time to participate in this study is 128 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, plus a final visit 18 weeks after last dose of study drug for a safety follow-up assessment. Participants will also participate in a long-term safety questionnaire, by phone, at 18 weeks and 26 weeks (6 months) from the last dose of study drug.</detailed_description>
