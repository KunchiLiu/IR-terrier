	<brief_summary>This is a single center, prospective study: The 'CardioGard Cannula' Gaseous emboli capture results - shows an improvement from the control group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Performance of the CARDIOGARD Cannula</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients referred for CPB procedure will be offered to participate in the study. Patients will be asked to sign an informed consent form (ICF), prior to performing any study related procedures. The point of enrollment is the time at which a patient signs and dates the ICF. Following enrollment, the patient will undergo screening evaluation (including Neurological assessment) to determine eligibility. Screening failures will be identified on a screening log. Patients who are found to meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will compose the evaluable cohort of the study. Screening failure subjects will not be counted as part of the target patient sample size nor will they be included in the analysis. Patients in the randomized phase will have surgery with the CardioGard Cannula or comparator cannulae and will remain blinded to their group assignment through the 30 days follow-up evaluation.</detailed_description>
