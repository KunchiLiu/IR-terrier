	<brief_summary>Epidemiological studies suggest that the consumption of (poly)phenols rich foods such as cocoa, tea, fruits and vegetables is associated with lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol and decreased cardiovascular risk. Cranberries are a rich source of (poly)phenols, including anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins and phenolic acids. Whether cranberries can improve vascular function when given over relevant time periods and in relevant populations is not known. Therefore, it is the overall hypothesis of the study proposal that chronic consumption of cranberries can improve endothelial function, a prognostically validated surrogate of cardiovascular risk. This study also aims to reveal which cranberry (poly)phenols have bioactive properties in healthy men. Consequently, plasma and urine metabolite peaks will be correlated with vascular outcomes and genome-wide expression microarrays will be performed to reveal cell signaling pathways associated with cranberry (poly)phenol-mediated cardioprotective events.</brief_summary>
