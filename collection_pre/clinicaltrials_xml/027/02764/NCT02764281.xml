	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methotrexate, etoposide, pegaspargase and dexamethasone (MEDA) chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Auto-HSCT) in patients with stage IV extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MEDA Chemotherapy and Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for Stage IV Natural Killer/T-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTCL), nasal type, is a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with relatively high incidence in China. L-asparaginase based chemotherapy improved overall response and prolonged the long-term survival for patients with stage IV. But the optimal treatment schedule has not been established. This study is designed with four cycles MEDA chemotherapy, followed by Auto-HSCT for stage IV patients with newly onset, relapsed or refractory diseases. The efficacy and safety of this protocol in the treatment of will be measured.</detailed_description>
