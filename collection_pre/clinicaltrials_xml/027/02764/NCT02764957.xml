	<brief_summary>Metabolic syndrome (Mets) is an assemblage of risk factors which can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Green coffee extract (GCE) is derived from unroasted coffee beans and has substantial amounts of polyphenols primarily chlorogenic acids (CGA). It has been shown that GCE and CGA can exert a positive influence over Mets components including blood pressure, blood glucose, inflammation, oxidative stress, insulin resistance and blood lipids. Up to our knowledge no study has been conducted on humans in the field of GCA influences on Mets patients. Therefore, this study is planned to evaluate GCA supplementation effects on anthropometric measurements, glycemic control, blood pressure, lipid profile, oxidative stress, systemic and vascular inflammation in patients with metabolic syndrome.</brief_summary>
