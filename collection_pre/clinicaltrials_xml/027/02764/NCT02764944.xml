	<brief_title>Endoscopic Full Thickness Resection Without Exposure to Peritoneum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current endoscopic full-thickness resection (EFTR) methods are limited by their transmural communication and exposure of tumor to peritoneum. Recently, endo-laparoscopic full-thickness resection with simple suturing technique which did not expose gastric mucosa to peritoneum (simple non-exposure EFTR) was developed. This new technique includes the steps of laparoscopic seromuscular suturing with a barbed suture thread (V-Loc), which results in inversion of the stomach wall; EFTR of the inverted stomach wall from inside the stomach; and finally, endoscopic mucosal suturing with endoloops and clips. This study evaluates the feasibility of simple non-exposure EFTR technique in patients with gastric tumor. This study is single arm study and will be performed in single center.</detailed_description>
