	<brief_title>Isobaric Spinal Ropivacaine Versus Hyperbaric Spinal Bupivacaine in Total Knee Arthroplasty in Geriatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>52 patients physical status II-III according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists classification aged 65 years and above of average height, and scheduled for total knee replacement under spinal anesthesia. Patients were randomly assigned into two equal groups of 26 patients each according to the type of local anesthetic injected in the subarachnoid space , Group I : patients who received an intrathecal injection of 12.5 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine , Group II: patients who received an intrathecal injection of 15 mg of 0.5% ropivacaine. The investigators compared both groups as regards the extent and duration of sensory and motor block and hemodynamics including heart rate (HR) , non invasive mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and respiratory depression.</detailed_description>
