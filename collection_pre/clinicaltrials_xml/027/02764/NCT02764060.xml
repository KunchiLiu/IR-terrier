	<brief_title>The Effect of Tongue Cleaning in Periodontitis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Volatile sulphur compounds (VSC's) are the most important causes of bad breath. Since the micro-organisms that produce VSC's are also periodopathogens, intuitively, one would think that there is a positive correlation between VSC levels in exhaled breath and periodontitis. However, not all periodontitis patients have bad breath. A possible explanation can be a positive relationship between tongue coating an bad breath. In the past, tongue cleaning was already researched in an oral healthy population. This research aimed to examine in periodontitis patients with visible tongue coating the changes in microbial load (aerobic and anaerobic) of the 14 day use of a tongue scraper versus the use of a regular toothbrush to clean the tongue. Additionally changes in tongue coating; and patient perception about tongue cleaning was researched.</detailed_description>
