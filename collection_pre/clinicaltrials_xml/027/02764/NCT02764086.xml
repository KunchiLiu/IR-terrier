	<brief_summary>This is a prospective non-randomised Phase I/II study with patients recruited to escalated dose cohorts. Escalated dose to the iGTV (internal gross tumour volume), with 60 Gy to the conventional PTV (planning target volume), will be delivered to successive cohorts of participants (6-12 participants/cohort) until the maximum tolerated oesophageal dose is determined. The minimum dose will be 60 Gy delivered via intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volume modulated arc therapy (VMAT), planned on an Average Intensity Projection (AVIP) dataset. Standard of care chemotherapy. In the initial part of this study patients can receive either neo-adjuvant chemotherapy or no chemotherapy at all. Following initial toxicity evaluation, the study will be extended to include a concurrent chemotherapy arm.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>INTENSE: A Phase I/II Study of INhomogeneous Targeted Dose Escalation in Non-Small CEll Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective non-randomised Phase I/II cohort study; please see above for Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapy treatment details Each cohort will require a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 12 patients. Once 6 patients have been treated in a cohort a two-month break is taken before toxicity is analysed. - If 2 or fewer patients experience a grade ≥3 toxicity, the next cohort will be enrolled and will receive an escalated dose (+5 Gy at each escalation up to a maximum of 75 Gy) - If 3 of the 6 patients experience a grade ≥3 toxicity, a further 6 patients will be recruited into that dose level - If 4 or more patients experience a grade ≥3 toxicity then the MTD is fixed at the dose level of the previous cohort If the cohort is extended to 12 patients, the following rules apply: - If 4 or fewer patients experience a grade ≥3 toxicity, the next cohort will be enrolled and will receive an escalated dose. - If 5 of the 12 patients experience a grade ≥3 toxicity, then the MTD is fixed at that dose level and recruitment continues up to a total of 24 patients at that dose level. - If 6 or more patients experience a grade ≥3 toxicity, then the MTD is fixed at the dose level of the previous cohort. Once the maximum dose cohort is established, patients will continue to be recruited at that dose level up to a total of 24 patients. Once the maximum dose cohort is established patients will continue to be recruited at that dose level up to a total of 24 patients. The first concurrent chemotherapy cohort will open 6 months after the first neo-adjuvant /no chemotherapy cohort have completed radiation therapy. The concurrent and neo-adjuvant /no chemotherapy arms will then be escalated independently of each other. For each chemotherapy arm the following number of patients will be required: - Minimum number (if maximum dose level reached) = 36 (6 at 65 Gy, 6 at 70 Gy and 24 at 75 Gy) - Maximum number (if maximum dose level reached) = 48 (12 at 65 Gy, 12 at 70 Gy and 24 at 75 Gy) A maximum of 48 patients are required to complete each chemotherapy arm (neo-adjuvant or none /concurrent) of the trial. Acute toxicity will be assessed weekly during treatment and at 2, 4 and 8 weeks post-treatment Late toxicities will be assessed at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months post-treatment and annually thereafter until disease relapse / patient withdrawal / patient death.</detailed_description>

Females of child bearing potential (see Appendix H) must not be pregnant and must be prepared to take adequate contraception methods during treatment. Males whose female partners are of childbearing potential must be prepared to take adequate contraception methods during treatment. Examples of effective contraception methods are a condom or a diaphragm with spermicidal jelly, or oral, injectable or implanted birth control. 11. Provision of written consent in line with ICHGCP guidelines 1. Previous thoracic radiation therapy 2. Known coexisting or prior malignancy which is likely to interfere with treatment or assessment of outcomes 3. Known distant metastases or metastatic pleural effusion 4. Pancoast tumours (tumour of the pulmonary apex) 5. Supraclavicular nodal involvement 6. Spinal cord involvement 7. Patients with syndromes or conditions associated with increased radiosensitivity or development of lung fibrosis 8. Suitable for SABR 9. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis/usual interstitial pneumonia 10. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness that is likely to interfere with treatment or assessment of outcomes 11. Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements 12. Pregnant or lactating at the time of proposed randomisation 13. Evidence of any other significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding that makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the study, or if it is felt by the research / medical team that the patient may not be able to comply with the protocol</criteria>
