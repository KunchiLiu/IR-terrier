	<brief_title>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (TDCS) for Auditory Hallucinations in Early Onset Schizophrenia (EOS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Early onset schizophrenia (EOS) involves positives symptoms such as psychotic behaviors, as well as negative symptoms such as disruptions to normal emotions and behaviors. Antipsychotics are the primary method of treatment in pediatric populations, but can produce unpleasant or dangerous side effects. Medication response is highly variable. Recent evidence demonstrates transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) relieving auditory hallucinations (AH) associated with schizophrenia in adults, and to a lesser degree negative and cognitive symptomology. Such studies provide important scientific and technical knowledge that may be applied to pediatric populations. Hypothesis: 1. Primary: Youths with EOS will demonstrate amelioration of AH after administration of tDCS. 2. TDCS will be well-tolerated in pediatric populations with minimal adverse side effects.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) Disorders (SCID) primary diagnosis of DSMIV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental DisordersVersion IV) schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder Ages 8 to 25 yearsold Persistent auditory hallucinations Full Scale intelligent quotient (IQ) greater than 60. Stable antipsychotic medication for &gt; 4 weeks If female and not infertile patient must agree to use one of the following forms of contraception for the duration of study participation: systemic hormonal treatment or an interuterine device (IUD). Legal guardian has provided written informed consent and the subject has provided written informed assent when able. Expectation that a majority of subjects will be able to assent but the potential for the younger children and/or those that are of borderline intellectual functioning will not be able to assent. History of alcohol, substance dependence or abuse in the past 90 days Open skin wounds that would preclude use of TDCS electrodes If female, pregnancy or breast feeding, as determined during eligibility prescreen call Subjects exhibiting significant ongoing severe disruptive, aggressive, selfinjurious, or sexually inappropriate behavior will not be eligible for enrollment. Presence of any medical condition that would make treatment with tDCS less safe. This includes any implanted metal device or any cardiac pacemaker. Subjects with a history of a seizure disorder are permitted if the subject has been seizure free for 6 months and is currently treated with an anticonvulsant that has been stable for 4 weeks. Presence of any other condition that would make the participants unable to comply with the requirements of the study for any reason. This may include an appreciable hearing or visual impairment.</criteria>
