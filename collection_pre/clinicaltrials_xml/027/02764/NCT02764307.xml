	<brief_summary>Background: Nebulizers design influences efficiency of aerosol delivery. Performance of nebulizers is commonly tested by breathing simulators with static parameters. However, breathing patterns vary in adults. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate drug deposition of different types of nebulizers testing with breathing patterns of healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aerosol Delivery in Different Types of Nebulizers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Material and Methods The study was approved by Chang Gung Memorial Foundation Institutional Review Broad. Ten healthy subjects, aged 20.6Â±0.5 years, were recruited. Four nebulizers: 1. a constant jet nebulizer (Neb-easy, Galemed Corp., Taiwan); 2. a breath enhanced nebulizer (Pari LC plus, Pari Inc., Germany); 3. a manual-actuated nebulizer (A-T Neb, Atlantean Corporation, Taiwan); and 4. a breath-actuated nebulizer (AeroElipes, Trudell Medical Inc, Canada) were evaluated.</detailed_description>
