	<brief_summary>Objective: In this study the investigators aim at investigating: 1. probiotics ability to modulate the microbiome and microbial translocation, 2. if probiotics affect the level of cholesterol, triglycerides as markers of cardiovascular risk factors and 3. if a reduction of microbial translocation is associated with a reduction of inflammation in the gastro-intestinal tract. Design: The study is a prospective clinical intervention trial of 40 HIV-infected patients. Method: The investigator will administer the bacteria Lactobacillus Rhamnosus in capsular form to each patient 2 times a day in 8 weeks. At baseline and at the 8th week of the intervention, the investigators will collect blood samples, feces samples and make a positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance scans.</brief_summary>
