	<brief_summary>Whilst the effects of manipulating the macronutrient content of foods on appetite and energy intake has been relatively well studied at rest, little is known about these responses in a post-exercise context. The effect of post-exercise nutrition on recovery from or adaptation to exercise has been well studied. However, many exercisers do so for weight management and thus any post-exercise nutrition might impact on energy balance and might need to be carefully considered. This study will examine the impact of manipulating the composition of a recovery drink consumed after resistance exercise on subsequent appetite and energy intake.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Resistance Exercise, Recovery Drinks and Appetite</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects perform a bout of lower body resistance exercise lasting ~50 min and immediately post-exercise they consume one of two recovery drinks over a 5 min period. Over the next 60 min subjective appetite responses will be measured and then 60 min after drink ingestion, subjects will consume an ad-libitum meal.</detailed_description>
