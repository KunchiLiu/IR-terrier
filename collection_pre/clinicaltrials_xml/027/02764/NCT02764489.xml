	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to: - 1. To compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Factor Eight Inhibitor Bypassing Activity (FEIBA component Factor II (FII) and safety of FEIBA reconstituted in a reduced volume of sterile water for injection (SWFI) versus regular volume SWFI, administered at the standard infusion rate of 2 U/min/kg - 2. To evaluate the safety of infusing reduced volume FEIBA at increased rates of 4 and 10 U/min/kg in comparison to the standard rate of 2 U/min/kg</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Participant is ≥ 18 to ≤ 65 years old at the time of screening 2. Hemophilia A or B of any severity, with a documented &gt;3 months history of inhibitors requiring the use of bypassing agents (FEIBA or rFVIIa) 3. HCV negative; or HCV positive with stable hepatic disease 4. HIV negative; or HIV positive with stable disease and CD4 count ≥ 200 cell/mm^3 at screening 5. Adequate peripheral venous access 6. Participant is willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol 7. If a female of childbearing potential, participant must have a negative blood pregnancy test and agrees to employ adequate birth control measures for the duration of the study. 8. If female of nonchildbearing potential, must be confirmed at screening. 1. Known hypersensitivity to FEIBA or any of its components 2. Clinically symptomatic liver disease. 3. Planned elective surgery during participation in this study (excluding minor procedures that will not need preventative bleeding treatments, such as exchanges of peripherally inserted central catheters) 4. Platelet count &lt; 100,000/μL 5. Clinical or laboratory evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation 6. Prior history or evidence of thromboembolic event: acute myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, etc. 7. Diagnosis of advanced atherosclerosis, malignancy, and/or other diseases that may increase the participant's risk of thromboembolic complications 8. Participant is taking any immunomodulating drug (e.g., corticosteroid agents at a dose equivalent to hydrocortisone &gt; 10 mg/day, or αinterferon) within 30 days prior to enrollment except antiretroviral chemotherapy 9. Herbal supplements that contain antiplatelet activity 10. Participant has participated in another clinical study involving an investigational product (IP) or investigational device within 30 days prior to enrollment or is scheduled to participate in another clinical study involving an IP or investigational device during the course of this study 11. Participant is a family member or employee of the investigator 12. Clinically significant medical, psychiatric or cognitive illness, or recreational drug/alcohol use that, in the opinion of the investigator, would affect participant safety or compliance</criteria>
