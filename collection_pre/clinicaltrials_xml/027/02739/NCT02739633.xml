	<criteria>1. Patient has definitive histologically or cytologically confirmed recurrent and metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. The definitive diagnosis of recurrent and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma will be made by integrating the histopathological data within the context of the clinical and radiographic data. Patients with islet cell neoplasms are excluded. 2. Initial diagnosis of recurrent and metastatic disease must have occurred ≤6 weeks prior to randomization in the study. 3. Patient has one or more lesions measurable by CT scan or MRI (if patient is allergic to CT contrast media). 4. Male or nonpregnant and nonlactating female, and ≥ 20 years of age. 5. Patient must meet the following blood counts at Baseline (obtained ≤14 days prior to randomization): Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 10^9/L Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 (100 × 10^9/L) Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 9 g/dL. 6. Patient has the following blood chemistry levels at Baseline (obtained ≤14 days prior to randomization): AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 × upper limit of normal range (ULN), unless liver metastases are clearly present, then ≤ 5 × ULN is allowed. Total bilirubin ≤ULN 7. Patient has a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ≥ 70. Two observers will be required to assess KPS. If discrepant, the one with the lowest assessment will be considered true. 8. Patient has voluntarily agreed to participate in the study, and signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF) prior to participation in any studyrelated activities. 1. History of malignancy in the last 5 years. Patients with prior history of in situ cancer or basal or squamous cell skin cancer are eligible. Patients with other malignancies are eligible if they were cured by surgery alone or surgery plus radiotherapy and have been continuously diseasefree for at least 5 years. 2. Patients have uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections 3. Patient has known historical or active infection with HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C. 4. Patients have a history of allergy or hypersensitivity to any of Paclitaxel, Gemcitabine, or Cremophor EL. 5. Patients with high cardiovascular risk, including recent coronary stenting or myocardial infarction in the past 6 months. 6. History of Peripheral Artery Disease (e.g,. claudication, Leo Buerger's disease).</criteria>
