	<brief_summary>Introduction: The stability of the pelvis is of great importance in body balance as a whole, can be improved by training the pelvic muscles fillet (MLP), which is characterized by low intensity isometric synchronous and the deep muscles of the trunk. This study aims to determine the effect of a stability program target, with the training of the MLP region on pelvic stability.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study aims to determine the effect of a stability program target, with the training of the MLP region on pelvic stability. Materials and Methods: We recruited 20 volunteers of both sexes were randomly divided into control group (CG) and training group (TG). The evaluations were performed before and after training the MLP. The training was held four isometrics series with a time of 30 seconds with 30 seconds rest in between reps during 10 sessions distributed twice weekly.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>considered individuals of both sexes, aged 18 and 35 absence of low back pain lack of musculoskeletal dysfunction in the lower limbs have never participated in any stabilization training program of the MLP region agree to the Terms Informed consent form (ICF) and the sign voluntarily. the study of abandonment by a participant the disagreement with the terms of IC and its not signing the volunteer does not understand the implementation of dynamic hip stabilization test present cramps or pain during the test and / or training historical column in injury, knee and / or ankle.</criteria>
