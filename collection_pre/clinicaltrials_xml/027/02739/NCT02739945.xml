	<detailed_description>The investigators want to compare changes in CSA of the ulnar nerve at the elbow hypothesizing that US examination is a useful tool to detect unsuccessful release and defining which technique shows the best outcome in the first year postoperatively. The measurement of cross-sectional area (CSA) as a diagnostic tool to detect entrapments syndrome in upper limbs has already been described. US typically demonstrates an abrupt narrowing and displacement of the nerve within the tunnel, possibly in association with a thickened retinaculum or a space-occupying lesions. Previous studies prospectively compared sonographic outcomes after decompression of the median nerve at the wrist.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>history of paresthesia or numbness in the ulnar nerve distribution; weakness or wasting of the small muscles of the hand; a positive elbow flexion provocation test; slowed motor conduction velocity in the ulnar nerve below 50 m/sec. Patients with normal nerve conduction studies; prior surgery for Cubital Tunnel Syndrome; prior traumatic lesions of the elbow; coexistent neurological diseases; bone anormalities (cubitus valgus, deformities from previous elbow fractures, osteoarthritis with medial osteophytes ands loose bodies, heterotopic ossifications); subluxating ulnar nerve; spaceoccupying softtissue lesions.</criteria>
