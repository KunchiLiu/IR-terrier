	<brief_summary>Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is associated with bone changes and very high fracture rates. A component of bone is marrow. Bone marrow fat is increased in patients with CKD compared to those in the normal population of the same age. It is not clear if there will be changes in the marrow fact content in those with CKD on Pioglitazone. In people with normal kidney function, thiazolidinedione group of drugs have had variable effects on bone marrow fat content, as measured by MRS. This is important as changes in marrow fat are likely related to changes in the bone in patients with chronic kidney disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pioglitazone and Lumbar Bone Marrow Fat in Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If patients consent to participate in the ancillary study of marrow fat changes with pioglitazone, those that are randomized to placebo or 15 mg pioglitazone for 12 months (per the criteria in the main study) will also undergo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the lumbar spine at L1, L2 and L3. MR spectroscopy of the lumbar spine (if they choose as this is ancillary study) will be performed 3 times over the course of the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Included subjects will be those who consent to the study of Pioglitazone in ADPKD (Protocol number 1308084213). Therefore inclusion and exclusion criteria are the same as for that study. Subjects will NOT be offered participation in the bone marrow fat study till after they consent for the FDA approved study. Subjects who withdraw from the FDA approved study will be withdrawn from this protocol.
