	<brief_summary>Endoscopic treatment of pancreatic necrosis complicated by trans digestive track (duodenal or gastric) has become a standard technique validated. The rate of high technical and clinical success (76 to 91% in 3 months) and the lower morbidity in the literature explains that validation. However this treatment is done at the cost of a higher median number of treatment sessions (4-5) explaining prolonged hospitalization, delays in rehabilitation and potentially high costs. The constant improvement of therapeutic endoscopy equipment was allowed to see the advent of metal prosthesis completely covered by a membrane allowing them endoscopic extraction with ease. It has thus been recently developed short prostheses, of large diameter (up to 15/16 mm), with broad flange (or stent "diabolo") to be considered for use in the drainage of digestive peri collections. Few studies respectively determined the effectiveness of this type of prosthesis in the drainage of peri digestive collections Under echo endoscopy and treatment of necrosis of pancreatic origin. The purpose of this work is to evaluate multicenter prospective clinical and technical efficiency of laying completely covered stent "diabolo" in echo endoscopy for the treatment of necrosis of pancreatic origin.</brief_summary>
