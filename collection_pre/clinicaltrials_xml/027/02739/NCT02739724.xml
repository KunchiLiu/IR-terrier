	<brief_summary>Introduction Single port access (SPA) is a recent laparoscopic technic evaluated in several pathologies. Benefits of this technic is poorly reported concerning adnexal surgical procedures. Results of both randomised studies including adnexectomy and ovarian cystectomy are discordants. So it seems interesting to conduct a new study about this technic. Aim of this study is to compare postoperative pain after laparoscopic surgery for adnexal pathology by SPA or classic laparoscopy (CL). Materiel and Methods We purpose a monocentric-randomised study. Inclusion criteria are women over 18 years requiring laparoscopic surgery for adnexal pathology with stratification for procedure (adnexectomy or ovarian cystectomy). After informed consent, patients will be randomised in two groups: laparoscopy with SPA and laparoscopy with CL. The main objective is postoperative pain evaluation at 24 hours. Secondary objectives are characteristics and perioperative complications, duration of procedure, postoperative quality of life and immediate postoperative pain. We hypothesis laparoscopy with SPA reduces postoperative pain at 24 hours of 2 pts (analogic scale 0-10). The estimated size of population number is 54 per group and 108 for the study. Expected results We expected a significant decrease of postoperative pain with SPA technic. This data will be interesting to promote use of SPA technic for adnexal surgery.</brief_summary>
