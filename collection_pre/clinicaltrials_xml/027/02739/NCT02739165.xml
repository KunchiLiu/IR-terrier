	<criteria>Main Patients diagnosed with IPF who meet all criteria from (1) through (4) during the course of IPF (1)Unexplained development or worsening of dyspnea within 1 month during the course of IPF (2)Finding of new, bilateral ground glass opacities and/or consolidation on HRCT (3)No apparent Pulmonary infections, pneumothorax, malignant tumors, pulmonary embolism, or left heart failure (4)A decrease* in PaO2 of ≥10 mmHg or SpO2 of ≥4% under the same conditions compared with the level at the previous measurements (*) In cases where no PaO2 or SpO2 test values under the same conditions are available, a patient with a P/F ratio ≤300 in the current episode of acute exacerbation is considered to have met criterion (4) Aged 40 years or older and no older than 85 years at the time of informed consent with either sex Main Have intracranial hemorrhage, pulmonary hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding (continued hematemesis, bloody discharge, gastrointestinal ulcerinduced hemorrhage) Have a history of cerebrovascular disorder (e.g., cerebral hemorrhage or cerebral infarction) within 52 weeks (364 days) before informed consent Patients for whom the completion of hemostatic treatment has not been confirmed after undergoing surgery of the central nervous system or after trauma Have a high risk for fatal or lifethreatening hemorrhage Patients with malignant tumors Have acute exacerbation attributable to drug induced pulmonary disorder, after surgery for malignant tumors, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy Have acute exacerbation due to a thoracic surgical procedure (including thoracoscopic lung biopsy) Have a history of acute exacerbation of IPF Receiving mechanical ventilation through intratracheal intubation Patients who are pregnant or nursing, or who may be pregnant Patients with a platelet count less than 50,000/uL at the time of enrollment Patients with severe renal (serum Cr: ≥4 mg/dL) or hepatic (AST/ALT: ≥500 IU/L or TBil: ≥10 mg/dL) dysfunction Have been administered a commercially available thrombomodulin alfa (recombinant )(Recomodulin® for Intravenous Injection 12800) within 30 days before the start of investigational product administration Have a history of hypersensitivity for investigational product</criteria>
