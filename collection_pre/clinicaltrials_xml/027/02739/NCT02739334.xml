	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn whether a combination of two research-proven programs, a responsive caregiving parenting program and a childhood obesity prevention program, will have an effect on toddlers' healthy nutrition and physical activity behaviors. Investigators hypothesize that the children participating in the intervention will have significantly lower BMI z-scores, lower intake of sugar sweetened beverages, and increased number of servings of fruits and vegetables, and minutes of physical activity.</brief_summary>
