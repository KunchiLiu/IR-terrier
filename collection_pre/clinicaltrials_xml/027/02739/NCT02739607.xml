	<brief_title>Internet-delivered Transdiagnostic Intervention for Anxiety and Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effectiveness of a transdiagnostic intervention will be compared with a wait list control group using a randomized control trial (RCT) design in a culture where this has not been tested before. The treatment approach is mainly emotion-focus, teaching participants how to confront and experience uncomfortable emotions, and how more adaptive coping mechanisms could be used. Because internet-delivered interventions represent an effective way to disseminate evidence-based programs, investigators decided to present our intervention online.</detailed_description>
