	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of a 12-week proprioceptive training program on the neurofunctional control and the incidence of ankle sprains in fencing athletes. The study will be developed in six stages: familiarization, pre intervention, intervention, post intervention follow-up of three and six months. In the pre intervention stage will evaluate muscle strength inverters, everter, dorsal plantar flexors and ankle flexors through the isokinetic dynamometer; the reaction time of these muscles during Lunge Test; neuromuscular control during the Star Excursion Balance Test and performance in Drop Vertical Jump Test. In the intervention athletes will perform proprioceptive training for 12 weeks, three times a week, lasting 30 minutes. In the post intervention, the follow up of three to six months will be held the same pre intervention of the tests and recording the incidence of injuries occurred during the study. The expected result at the end of the study is to improve all variables, increasing the performance of athletes and decreasing the incidence of ankle sprains.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Proprioceptive Training on Neurofunctional Control and Ankle Sprains Incidence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fencing is an agility sport, with higher incidence of injuries in the lower limbs, with the ankle sprain the most prevalent. Injury prevention is very important to improve performance and reduce time off of athletes. Proprioceptive training programs can be added to the training of athletes, since in addition to the easy application and low cost, proprioception serves to stabilize the joint, preventing injuries. Therefore the aim of this study is to investigate the influence of a 12-week proprioceptive training program on the neurofunctional control and the incidence of ankle sprains in fencing athletes. The study will be a randomized clinical trial, with fencing athletes from 14 to 25, a multi-sport club of Porto Alegre/RS, and developed in six stages: familiarization, pre intervention, intervention, post intervention follow-up of three and six months. The first step will be to familiarize themselves with the force of testing and registration of injuries in the previous year. In the pre intervention stage will evaluate muscle strength inverters, everter, dorsal plantar flexors and ankle flexors through the isokinetic dynamometer; the reaction time of these muscles during Lunge Test; neuromuscular control during the Star Excursion Balance Test and performance in Drop Vertical Jump Test. In the intervention athletes will perform proprioceptive training for 12 weeks, three times a week, lasting 30 minutes. In the post intervention, the follow up of three to six months will be held the same pre intervention of the tests and recording the incidence of injuries occurred during the study. For statistical analysis, the data will be presented as mean and standard deviation and submitted to the Shapiro-Wilk test, ANOVA will be held for repeated measures and post hoc Bonferroni to determine differences. The effect size is calculated using Cohen's d test.o significance level is 0.05. The expected result at the end of the study is to improve all variables, increasing the performance of athletes and decreasing the incidence of ankle sprains.</detailed_description>
