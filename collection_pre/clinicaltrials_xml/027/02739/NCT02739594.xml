	<brief_summary>This multicenter, open-label trial will randomize participants with multiple myeloma to a regimen of ibandronate or zoledronate in order to compare the incidence of nephrotoxicity, measured as creatinine clearance (CrCl) reduction greater than (&gt;) 30 percent (%) or an absolute value of 30 milliliters per minute (mL/min) or lower.</brief_summary>
