	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 3, multi-site, non-randomized, open-label study evaluating the safety and efficacy of MK-7625A 1.5 g (ceftolozane 1 g/tazobactam 0.5 g) plus metronidazole 500 mg for the treatment of Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (cIAI) in Japanese participants. Efficacy will be primarily assessed by clinical response defined as complete resolution or significant improvement in signs and symptoms of the index infection.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Has one of the following diagnoses with evidence of intraperitoneal infection: cholecystitis (including gangrenous cholecystitis) with rupture, perforation, or progression of the infection beyond the gallbladder wall; diverticular disease with perforation or abscess; appendiceal perforation or periappendiceal abscess; acute gastric or duodenal perforation, traumatic perforation of the intestine; peritonitis due to perforated viscus or following a prior operative procedure; or Intraabdominal abscess (including liver and spleen). Has evidence of systemic infection Had or has plans to have surgical intervention within 24 hours of the first dose of study drug Has radiographic evidence of perforation or abscess if enrolled preoperatively Is able to have intraabdominal specimen taken at baseline for the microbiological assessment Female participants of child bearing potential must not be pregnant (negative human chorionic gonadotropin test) or breastfeeding and must agree to use adequate contraception for the duration of the study and up to 35 days after the last dose of study drug Male participants must agree to use adequate contraception for the duration of the study and up to 75 days after the last dose of study drug Has simple appendicitis; abdominal wall abscess; small bowel obstruction or ischemic bowel disease without perforation; spontaneous bacterial peritonitis associated with cirrhosis and chronic ascites; acute suppurative cholangitis; infected necrotizing pancreatitis; pancreatic abscess; infectious mononucleosis; cystic fibrosis; or pelvic infections Has complicated intraabdominal infection managed by staged abdominal repair (STAR) or open abdomen drainage Has had acute gastric or duodenal perforation (≤ 24 hours after) or traumatic perforation of the intestine (≤ 12 hours after) operated on after the perforation occurred Is expected to be cured by only surgical intervention without use of systemic antibacterial therapy Has used systemic antibacterial therapy for intraabdominal infection for more than 24 hours prior to the first dose of study drug, unless there is a documented treatment failure with such therapy Has severe impairment of renal function (estimated CrCl &lt; 30 mL/minute), or requirement for peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis or hemofiltration, or oliguria (&lt; 20 mL/hour urine output over 24 hours) Has a concomitant infection at the time of randomization, which requires nonstudy systemic antibacterial therapy in addition to study drug with the exception of an antibacterial with Grampositive activity only (vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid and daptomycin) Has used any postoperative nonstudy antibacterial therapy if enrolled preoperatively Has used more than 1 dose of nonstudy antibacterial therapy following surgery if enrolled postoperatively Has hepatic disease Is unlikely to survive the 4 to 5 week study period Has organic brain or spinal cord disease Has any rapidlyprogressing disease or immediately lifethreatening illness Has an immunocompromising condition (i.e., AIDS, hematological malignancy, or bone marrow transplantation, or immunosuppressive therapy) or is receiving ≥ 40 mg of prednisone per day administered continuously for &gt; 14 days prior to study start Has a history of any moderate or severe hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to any betalactam (βlactam) antibacterial, including cephalosporins, carbapenems, penicillins, or βlactamase inhibitors, or metronidazole, or nitroimidazole derivatives Is receiving or has received disulfiram within 14 days before receiving study drug or who is currently receiving probenecid Has participated in any clinical study of an investigational product within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug Has previously participated in any study of ceftolozane or MK7625A.</criteria>
