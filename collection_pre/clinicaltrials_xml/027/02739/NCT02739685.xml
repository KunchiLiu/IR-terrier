	<brief_summary>The purpose of the current study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of everolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold to everolimus-eluting stents in patients with chronic total occlusion regarding the antirestenotic efficacy at 8 to 10-month angiographic follow-up.</brief_summary>
