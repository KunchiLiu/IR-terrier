	<brief_summary>Currently catheters used in heart catheterization procedures are guided throughout the heart chambers and blood vessels by pictures taken by x-rays. This technology exposes patients to radiation. With this study protocol the investigators will use MRI technology to take real-time pictures to navigate catheters throughout heart chambers. MRI uses electromagnetic energy; therefore, it does not expose participants to radiation energy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation-Free Heart Catheterization Using MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants undergo general anesthesia, and vascular access is obtained in the x-ray catheterization lab. Next the participant is transferred into the MRI scanner where a focused MRI examination is performed. Catheters are then guided into the heart chambers using real-time MRI guidance to perform conventional cardiac catheterization steps. If time allows, additional research MRI is performed before the participant is returned to the x-ray catheterization lab. If any MRI guided catheterization steps are unsuccessful, the clinically indicated step is performed after the participant returns to the x-ray catheterization lab using conventional x-ray guided pictures.</detailed_description>
