	<brief_summary>The primary study aims are to determine the clinical, behavioural and social predictors of SMI development in youth, and to investigate whether neuroimaging can distinguish youth who will develop SMI from those who will not. The study's secondary aims are to examine the proportions of the cohort that make transitions between the different clinical stages of risk, and to determine the proportions that have poor outcomes, defined as ongoing or increased symptoms, secondary substance misuse, poor social or role functioning, i.e., non-participation in education, or employment, and new self-harm. Investigators will study a cohort of 240 youth (aged 14-25, male and female) that includes youth with early mood symptoms or sub-threshold psychotic symptoms (symptomatic group; n=160), youth at risk due to a family history of a SMI (family high risk (FHR); n=40), and healthy controls (HC; n=40). From this cohort, clinical, social and cognitive data, as well as imaging data will be gathered to create a multi-layered "snapshot" of these individuals and provide full-level characterization. Investigators will use the full range of clinical and imaging data generated from this cohort to develop novel prediction algorithms incorporating key variables that predict the development of SMI.</brief_summary>
