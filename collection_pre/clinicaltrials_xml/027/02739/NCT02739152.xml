	<brief_summary>Sepsis is a serious systemic disease defined as a combination of Systemic Inflammation Response Syndrome (SIRS) plus a confirmed or suspected infection. Untreated or inadequately treated cases can lead to severe sepsis or septic shock; being characterized by high mortality and morbidity. Symptoms and signs of sepsis are variable and this makes clinical recognition and assessment very difficult in particular on Emergency Department (ED) patients due to their infectious illness background and the frequent comorbidities. Also, the severity of the condition may not be apparent at initial contact with ED personnel: patients may arrive at ED with mild clinical manifestation and rapidly progress to critical illness, or rather at the opposite others have benign evolution despite a similar symptoms. In these conditions, the main challenge of ED clinicians is differentiating mild infections from life-threatening ones in the heavy workload of ED environment Objective of TRIAGE project is to identify and validate biomarkers able to predict the clinical worsening of patients freshly admitted at Emergency Department. Targeted population is adult patients freshly admitted at ED, whom blood samples will serve to validate candidate markers.</brief_summary>
