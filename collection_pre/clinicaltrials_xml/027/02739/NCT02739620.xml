	<brief_summary>Exercise training has beneficial effects in cancer survivors to minimize some of the side effects of cancer and its treatment and improve long-term prognosis, but there are numerous hurdles for individuals diagnosed with, and being treated for, cancer to participate in exercise programs. The goal of this research study is to begin to evaluate whether exercise training via neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) has beneficial effects on skeletal muscle size and function in cancer survivors.</brief_summary>
