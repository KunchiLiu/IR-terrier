	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether dietary intake of pre-formed advanced glycation end products (AGEs) modulates brain function measured by MRI) and cognitive function measured by a thorough neuropsychological battery. In a 6 months randomized parallel study of adults above the age of 65, with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and type 2 diabetes. The investigators will compare two groups numbering 60 subjects each. Both groups will be advised on a diet appropriate for type 2 diabetes in the elderly by a nutritionist. In addition, the intervention group will be instructed on how to cook a low-AGE diet , with the aim of achieving a 40-50% lower AGE content, and they will be closely followed throughout the study to ensure compliance. Since diet is a modifiable lifestyle, diminishing AGEs consumption by cooking in lower temperatures (higher cooking temperatures being associated with higher AGE production) may be a simple non-invasive intervention which has potential of delaying or preventing cognitive decline which is associated with dementia.</brief_summary>
