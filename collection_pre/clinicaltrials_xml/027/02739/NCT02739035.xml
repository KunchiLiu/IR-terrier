	<brief_summary>Compare the outcome following manipulation under anesthesia for stiffness in a randomized controlled fashion with one group receiving IV dexamethasone and oral celecoxib at the time of manipulation to a control group receiving manipulation alone. Outcomes will include pain, range of motion, as well as subjective outcome scores.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MUA to Treat Postoperative Stiffness After Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stiffness is a potential complication following Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA). While a variety of factors have been cited as possible causes, such as component malrotation or improper soft-tissue balancing, however, an etiology is not always appreciated. Histologic and arthroscopic evidence of fibrosis suggests that an inflammatory process may contribute to loss of knee range of motion following surgery. Manipulation under anesthesia remains standard of care for stiffness following TKA. Manipulation shows improved range of motion for stiffness after total knee arthroplasty, however, patients do not always achieve full range of motion. Furthermore, repeat manipulation and manipulation greater than 8 weeks post-surgically have shown limited improvements. Given a possible role of the host inflammatory response and the importance of early gains in knee range of motion following total knee arthroplasty, limiting the inflammatory response at the time of manipulation may improve outcomes. Investigators would like to assess the role of anti-inflammatory medications to optimize range of motion and outcome for manipulation under anesthesia for stiffness following TKA.</detailed_description>
