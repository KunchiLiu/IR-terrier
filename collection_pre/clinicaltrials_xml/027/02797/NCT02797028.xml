	<brief_title>Investigation of the Atherogenic Effects of Uric Acid-modified in Endothelial Dysfunction and the the Preventional Mechanism by Anthocyanidines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hyperuricemia patients who have the ability to complete the intervention study in the early stage of study were selected as the research subjects. A randomized controlled double blind control method was used to study the effect of one year of anthocyanins intervention. Serum UA levels, oxidative stress, AGEs, and endothelial function are detecting in patients with hyperuricemia who were treated with anthocyanins and placebo. Providing scientific basis of anthocyanins for the treatment with hyperuricemia and delaying atherosclerosis.</detailed_description>
