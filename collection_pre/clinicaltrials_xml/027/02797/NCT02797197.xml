	<brief_summary>Sarcopenia is defined as a loss in skeletal muscle mass and function (strength and/or performance). There is a high prevalence in elderly and in patients with cancer. Several mechanisms are known to explain sarcopenia (inflammation, neurodegenerative process, hormonal disorders, lack of exercise, malnutrition). The consequences were analysed in several studies where sarcopenia appeared to be an independent factor of mortality, and associated with cancer-related fatigue, nosocomial infections, cardio-vascular diseases, and chemotherapy toxicities. Diagnosis is based on the measure of the muscle mass performing an abdominal computed-tomography (CT) scan, and on the measure of the muscle strength using the handgrip test with a "JamarÂ®" hydraulic hand dynamometer. CT scan is more invasive and less easy to reach than handgrip test. This test is used to be performing in elderly but not in cancer patients having chemotherapy. Present prospective study explored the feasibility of systematic handgrip strength testing and short-term changes in muscle strength in digestive cancer patients treated by chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
