	<brief_title>Effects of Sertraline on Brain Connectivity in Adolescents With OCD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To examine FSTC using advanced multi-modal imaging techniques, including resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) and high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI), in 25 medication-free adolescents youths with OCD (ages 8-17) in comparison with 25 matched healthy controls. Hypotheses: (A) Based on the pilot data, adolescents youths with OCD will show lower functional connectivity in FSTC at baseline when compared with controls, and , lower functional connectivity in FSTC will correlate with greater severity on CY-BOCS. (B) Adolescents Youths with OCD will also show abnormalities in structural connectivity in FSTC at baseline when compared with controls, and structural and functional connectivity will be related. (C) The investigators will explore relations between OCD dimensions and functional connectivity measures, and predict that the repeating/ordering dimension will correlate with orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) connections, hoarding will correlate with rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) connections, and forbidden thoughts will correlate with caudal ACC connections. To investigate how sertraline impacts functional connectivity in FSTC in adolescents with OCD. Hypothesis: After 12 weeks of sertraline treatment, functional connectivity measures within FSTC for the OCD group will (on average) increase compared to baseline and will no longer be significantly different when compared with controls. Non-responders may show a different pattern (i.e. failure to show these changes).</detailed_description>
