	<criteria>1. Patients must be ≥18 years of age at Screening 2. Patient has pediatriconset HPP, defined as onset of first sign(s)/symptom (s) of HPP prior to 18 years of age 3. Patients must have a documented diagnosis of HPP as indicated by a documented history of HPPrelated skeletal abnormalities and 1 or more of the following: Documented TNSALP gene mutation(s) from a certified laboratory Serum ALP level below the ageadjusted normal range AND plasma PLP above the upper limit of normal at Screening. 4. Patients must have a plasma PPi level of ≥3.9 µM at Screening 5. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at the time of enrollment 6. Sexually active male and female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of birth control during the study. 1. Currently enrolled in a clinical study involving another study drug or nonapproved use of a drug or device. 2. Participated, within the last 30 days, in a clinical study involving a study drug (other than the study drug used in this study). 3. Have completed or withdrawn from this study or any other study investigating asfotase alfa in the previous 3 years. 4. Women who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding 5. Serum 25OH Vitamin D below 20 ng/mL at Screening 6. Screening serum creatinine or parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels 1.5 times the upper limit of normal 7. Any medical condition, serious concurrent illness and/or injury, in the opinion of the Investigator, may significantly interfere with study compliance or study endpoints. 8. Prior treatment with bisphosphonates within 2 years of study entry for any length of time or for more than 2 consecutive years at any prior timepoint 9. Treatment with PTH, strontium, or sclerostin inhibitors within 6 months prior to the first dose of study drug</criteria>
