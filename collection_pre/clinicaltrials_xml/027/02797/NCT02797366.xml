	<detailed_description>Open label, multi-centre prospective phase II study. Adult patients with primary central nervous system tumours full-filling the inclusion criteria according to the study protocol. The study consists of 2 sequential cohorts evaluated for the feasibility, safety and toxicity, as well as long-term survival data, when using proton beam therapy. - Part I: To assess the feasibility of using pencil beam scanning and evaluating the treatment safety in all aspects, and to assess acute toxicity in a smaller cohort of CNS patients. All toxicity data, QoL and survival data will also be included in the part II cohort. - Part II: The second part of the trial consists of all CNS patients that are referred to the Skandion Clinic after the safety data from the first part has been evaluated by the study steering committee.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: The patient must be at least 18 years old World Health Organization (WHO)/ Eastern Cooperative OncologyGroup (ECOG) performance status 02, Karnofsky score â‰¥60. The patient must be able to understand the information about the treatment and give a written informed consent to participate in the trial. Adequate followup study must be possible; this will exclude a patient who is uncooperative. Must have a life expectancy of at least 3 years based on age and comorbidities as well as diagnosis. For patients considered for reirradiation the life expectancy must be estimated to minimum 6 months. Must have a pathology proven CNS tumour or if not possible, the radiology findings must be evaluated at a multidisciplinary conference at a university hospital. Women of reproductive potential must agree to use an effective method of contraception during therapy such as an intrauterine device or condom. Pregnancy IS not an ineligibility criteria if radiotherapy is indicated and cannot be postponed. Prior CNS radiotherapy is not an ineligibility criteria but reirradiated patients will be included in a subgroup evaluated separately. Patients discussed at multidisciplinary conferences at one of the seven university hospitals in Sweden and found candidates for radiotherapy and one of following diagnoses: Anaplastic glioma grade III with Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) 1p/19q and isocitrate dehydrogenase1 (IDH1) mutation Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) Chordomas and chondrosarcomas Craniopharyngiomas Ependymomas Intracranial germ cell tumours Low grade gliomas grade III Medulloblastoma, Primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET) Meningiomas Neurocytoma Other grade III primary CNS tumour according to WHO classification Pituitary adenomas Schwannomas Spinal tumours Whenever craniospinal irradiation (CSI) is indicated Whenever reirradiation of CNS is considered Exclusion criteria: Concomitant or previous malignancies. Exceptions are adequately treated basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri with a followup time of at least 3 years, or other previous malignancy with a diseasefree interval of at least 5 years. Not able to understand information or manage tests according to study protocol. If necessary, only authorized interpreters may be used to assist in the translation. Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other medical conditions that, in the opinions of the investigator, would preclude the patient from meeting the study requirements.</criteria>
