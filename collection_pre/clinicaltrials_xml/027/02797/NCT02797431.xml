	<brief_summary>A multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of two dosing frequencies of recombinant Interleukin-7 (CYT107) treatment to restore absolute lymphocyte counts in sepsis patients; IRIS-7A (Immune Reconstitution of Immunosuppressed Sepsis patients). A parallel study will be performed in United State of America to allow a common statistical analysis of the primary end points and analysis for the enrolled patient population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immune Reconstitution of Immunosuppressed Sepsis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sepsis is the leading cause of death in critically ill patients in most intensive care units in Europe and the US. Recently, evidence has accumulated that sepsis progresses from a state of hyper-inflammation to a state of immunosuppression. This immunosuppressive phase is characterized by increased incidence of secondary infections often with relatively avirulent opportunistic type pathogens. Currently, new therapeutic approaches to sepsis are occurring using immuno-adjuvants that boost host immunity. One of the most promising agents Interleukin-7 is an essential, non-redundant, pluripotent cytokine produced mainly by bone marrow and thymic stromal cells that is required for T-cell survival.In addition to its anti-apoptotic properties, IL-7 induces potent proliferation of naïve and memory T-cells potentially supporting replenishment of the peripheral T-cell pool which is severely depleted during sepsis. These effects were confirmed in clinical trials at the National Cancer Institute and in HIV+ patients. This clinical study will test the ability of IL-7 to restore the absolute lymphocyte counts in septic patients who have markedly reduced levels of circulating lymphocytes. An effect already confirmed in preclinical models of sepsis.</detailed_description>
