	<brief_title>Whole Blood Specimen Collection From Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Progenity is developing diagnostic products to improve the healthcare of men, women, and children. The commercial objective is to make safe, noninvasive genetic testing available to the public, independent of age and other factors that may contribute to pregnancy or other clinical complications. Sample specimens will not be used to develop genetic lines and/or DNA banks for cloning. Any samples or remnant specimens remaining may be stored indefinitely for future research programs. Eligible subjects (or parent/guardian) will provide written informed consent after which basic demographic and clinical data will be obtained and a whole blood sample will be collected. A subject's participation may end immediately after their blood draw. The amount of whole blood drawn at any visit will be based upon age of the subject and test to be performed. In the event a Subject is pregnant, information regarding the gender of the fetus established by either ultrasound, non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) results, or at delivery will be collected. Clinical data regarding any karyotyping procedure that may occur on the fetus will be recorded.</detailed_description>
