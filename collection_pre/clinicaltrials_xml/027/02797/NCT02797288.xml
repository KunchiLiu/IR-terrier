	<brief_summary>The protocol aims to address the basic mechanisms of Clostridium difficile pathogenesis by identifying how Clostridium difficile toxins inhibit eosinophils that otherwise would protect the gut from damage. This could lead to new and effective approaches to the treatment or prevention of Clostridium difficile colitis that act downstream of fecal microbiota transplants (FMT) or next generation probiotics. Successful fecal transplantation will restore Interleukin-25, Interleukin-4 and eosinophils to the colon</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Biopsies will be obtained from random areas of the sigmoid colon in subjects at the time of fecal transplantation. Follow-up biopsies will be obtained from the sigmoid colon during convalescence 60 days after fecal transplant for subjects who agree to return for optional 60 day follow-up. Biopsies taken for research purposes at each colonoscopy will be analyzed for: cytokines and chemokines, gene expression analysis, immunohistochemistry and high dimensional flow-cytometry.</detailed_description>
