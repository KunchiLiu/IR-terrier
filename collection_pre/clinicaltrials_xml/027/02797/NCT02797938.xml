	<brief_summary>Endotracheal pressure with different cuff shapes can result in different cuff pressure change after head positional change. In this study, 52 patients underwent middle ear surgery with general anesthesia were randomly allocated to two group; patients were intubated with taper guard cuffed tube or cylindrical shaped cuffed tube. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane with air/oxygen and remifentanil. The cuff pressure was initially set at 22 centimeters of water in the neural head position and was measured after the change to the 45 degree head rotation. The change of cuff pressure was compared between two groups</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Endotracheal pressure with different cuff shapes can result in different cuff pressure change after head positional change. In this study, 52 patients underwent middle ear surgery with general anesthesia were randomly allocated to two group; patients were intubated with taper guard cuffed tube or cylindrical shaped cuffed tube. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane with air/O2 and remifentanil. The cuff pressure was initially set at 24 centimeters of water in the neural head position and was measured after the change to the 45 degree head rotation. In addition, sore throat, hoarseness , dysphagia and cough were recorded 0, 6, 12, 24 hr after surgery. The change of cuff pressure was compared between two groups. The side effects associated with tube were compared between two groups.</detailed_description>
