	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate stress response pathways in tissues and melanocytes from patients with vitiligo. Investigators are collecting evidence of UPR and stress response activation in tissues and melanocytes from patients with vitiligo. Individuals with vitiligo will have punch biopsies to study stress response UPR activation and NF-κB signaling to test our hypothesis. In order to characterize differences between disease and normal states, a second arm of control individuals (Arm 2) will be recruited.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Identifying a role for NF-κB signaling in vitiligo may improve therapies for this disfiguring disorder. Current treatments vary in effectiveness and may not always be long lasting cases. The NF-κB pathway and IL-6 itself are the target of several FDA approved drugs, thus opening new therapeutic avenues.</detailed_description>
