	<brief_summary>The current study has the following objectives: 1. To determine additional stroke patient (SP) and stroke caregiver (SC) factors including their perceptions of the stroke experience, hospitalization, and how they cope with its challenges; identify additional appropriate points to intervene (maladaptive coping styles, unrealistic expectations, inappropriate prioritization, misinformation about illness, and self care), and assess SP and SC preferences for the structure, mode of delivery (including potential for phone, video or a combination of these) and timing of an intervention. 2. To develop, [using the preliminary data and information from aim 1], and test the feasibility and acceptability (primary outcomes) of a skills-based intervention for preventing chronic depression, anxiety, PTSD and decreased QoL in dyads at risk.</brief_summary>
