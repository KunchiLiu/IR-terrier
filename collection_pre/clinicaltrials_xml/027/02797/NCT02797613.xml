	<brief_summary>Asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB) is a condition in which bacteria are detected in urine culture without urinary symptoms. The inappropriate use of antibiotic treatment for AB selects bacterial flora to express resistance mutations. Reducing inappropriate antibiotic use for AB is difficult, since the microbiology laboratory cannot distinguish patients with AB. The investigators study will use a restricted laboratory report requesting the physician to call the laboratory for culture results. The restricted report may reduce the rate of inappropriate treatment of AB.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Restricted Reporting for Positive Urine Cultures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Positive urine cultures during the study period will be randomized to restricted microbiology laboratory reporting or standard microbiology laboratory reporting. Physician or patient consent will not be collected. Patient records will be assessed by the investigator to determine if patients have AB or urinary tract infection. Physician antibiotic treatment decision in both groups will be collected.</detailed_description>
