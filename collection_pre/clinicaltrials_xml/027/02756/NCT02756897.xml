	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if venetoclax given in combination with ibrutinib can help to control CLL or SLL. The safety of the drug combination will be also studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Venetoclax and Ibrutinib in Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive the study drugs in study cycles that are 4 weeks (28 days) long. You will take 3 capsules of ibrutinib 1 time every day while you are on study with about 1 cup (8 ounces) of water. If you miss a dose of ibrutinib, it can be taken as soon as possible on the same day with a return to the normal schedule the following day. You should not take extra capsules on the following day to make up the missed dose. Beginning on Day 1 of Cycle 4, you will also take tablets of venetoclax 1 time every day for the rest of the study. Each dose of venetoclax will be taken at about the same time as ibrutinib with about 1 cup (8 ounces) of water, within 30 minutes after you finish eating a low-fat breakfast. In order to lower the risk of side effects, you will start taking venetoclax at a low dose and then it will be increased each week as directed by your doctor until you are taking the full dose. If you vomit within 15 minutes of taking venetoclax and all the tablets are still intact, another dose may be taken. Otherwise, you should not take another dose. In cases where a dose of venetoclax is missed or forgotten, you should take the dose as soon as possible, as long as it is within 8 hours after the dose was planned to have been taken. You will also be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects beginning 3 days before your first dose of venetoclax. You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks. Tumor Lysis Syndrome Monitoring: Starting about 3 days before receiving your first dose of venetoclax (and continuing for at least 5 weeks of treatment), you will be given a drug to lower the risk of a serious side effect called Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS). TLS happens when cancer cells break down rapidly. The break-down products enter the bloodstream and are not flushed out quickly enough. You will have blood tests (about 2 tablespoons each time) before your dose and may have blood tests (about 2 tablespoons) 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after your dose. Based on your test results, your study doctor may have more instructions for you, and you may need to meet with a kidney doctor while you are in the hospital. You will be hospitalized after your first dose of venetoclax to check for or treat TLS. You may need to receive fluids by vein. Study Visits: Every week during Cycle 1, then every 2 weeks in Cycles 2 and 3, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. On Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1, then on Day 1 of Cycles 2 and 3, you will have a physical exam. At the end of Cycles 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 27, then every 6-12 months after that: - You will have a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy to check the status of the disease. - You will have CT or PET scans. Every week during Cycle 4, then every 2 weeks in Cycles 5 and 6, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. Every week during Cycles 4 and 5, then on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 6, you will have a physical exam. On Day 1 of Cycles 7 and beyond: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. Physical exams and blood draws may be done more often if the doctor thinks it is needed. Length of Treatment: You may receive venetoclax for up to 2 years. You may continue receiving ibrutinib for as long as the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. This is an investigational study. Ibrutinib is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of patients with mantle cell lymphoma and in patients with CLL who have received at least 1 prior treatment. Its use in this study is investigational. Venetoclax is not FDA approved or commercially available. The combination of venetoclax and ibrutinib is investigational. The study doctor can describe how the study drugs are designed to work. Up to 78 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with a diagnosis of CLL/SLL who are refractory to and/or relapsed after at least one prior therapy will be eligible (Cohort 1). Untreated patients with highrisk features (del(17p), or mutated TP53, or del(11q), or unmutated IGHV, or &gt;/= 65 years of age) are eligible (Cohort 2) provided they have active disease requiring treatment as defined by the International Working Group for CLL (IWCLL) 2. Age 18 years or older 3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status &lt;/=2 4. Patients must have adequate renal and hepatic function: Total bilirubin &lt;/=1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or &lt;/=3 x ULN for patients with Gilbert's disease, Creatinine clearance &gt;50 mL/min (calculated according to institutional standards or using CockcroftGault formula), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alanine aminotransferase (AST) &lt;/=3.0 x ULN, unless clearly due to disease involvement 5. Platelet count of greater than 20,000/mul, with no platelet transfusion in 2 weeks prior to registration. This criteria is waived if the thrombocytopenia is due to bone marrow involvement with the disease 6. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine beta human chorionic gonadotropin (BetahCG) pregnancy test result within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drugs and must agree to use an effective contraception method during the study and for 30 days following the last dose of study drug. Women of non childbearing potential are those who are postmenopausal greater than 1 year or who have had a bilateral tubal ligation or hysterectomy. Men who have partners of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective contraceptive method during the study and for 30 days following the last dose of study drug 7. Free of prior malignancies for 2 years with exception of patients diagnosed with basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma "in situ" of the cervix or breast, who are eligible even if they are currently treated or have been treated and/or diagnosed in the past 2 years prior to study enrolment. If patients have another malignancy that was treated within the last 2 years, such patients may be enrolled if the likelihood of requiring systemic therapy for this other malignancy within 2 years is less than 10%, as determined by an expert in that particular malignancy at MD Anderson Cancer Center, and after consultation with the Principal Investigator. 8.
