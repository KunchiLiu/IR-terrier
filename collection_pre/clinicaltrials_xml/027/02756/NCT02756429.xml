	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. Because of its major impact on the general morbidity and risk of stroke, AF is a great concern for public health. Several mechanisms, including endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory processes, have been postulated as predisposing factors for AF, as well as for stroke. Both clinical and experimental studies highlight inflammation as a predisposing factor for AF and its complications. Nevertheless, the source of high inflammatory proteins in patients with AF is still unknown. We hypothesized that multilevel intracardiac and extracardiac (left femoral vein, coronary sinus, left atrium, pulmonary vein) measurements of several inflammatory proteins (VEGF) would help assessing the extent and the source of inflammation in AF patients. The measurement of von Willebrand factor (vWF) levels in multiple vascular sites would also help to define the site of endothelial dysfunction and of production of this thrombogenic factor. Although AF is associated with an increased risk of stroke, the risk is not homogeneous. Permanent and persistent AF are associated with similar thromboembolic risk to that of paroxysmal AF.</brief_summary>
