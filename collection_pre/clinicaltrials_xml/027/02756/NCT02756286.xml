	<brief_title>Neurophysiological Attention Test (NAT) for Objective Assessment of Adult ADHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to build upon the success the novel approach and software for analyzing electroencephalography (EEG) data to identify biomarkers of ADHD in adults by further refining the method. Then to test the ability of this new assessment tool to differentiate between adults with ADHD and healthy controls by comparing the classification accuracy of the metrics from the new tool to the classification accuracy of existing behavioral tests for ADHD.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Specific inclusion criteria for ADHD are: 1. meet established Diagnositic and Statistical Manual5 criteria for ADHD predominately inattentive or combined subtype with clinically significant levels of impairment, diagnosed by structured clinical interview, the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, and corroborating information 2.

Exclusion criteria for both groups are: 1.
