	<brief_summary>Ischeic reperfusion injury lead to a cellular dyfunction and increase in soluble glycocalyx of blood flow. syndecan-1 was a marker of glycocalyx. The purpose of this study is to prove the variation of level of serum syndecan-1 between preoperative and postoperative period.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The patients were allocated randomly to receive propofol or desflurane. Also, a total of 6ml of blood sample was obtained for total 6 times in consecutive order. 1. Preoperation (immediate before anesthesia induction) 2. Immediate before tourniquet off 3. 5 min after tourniquet off 4. PACU 5. postoperative 6 hours 6. postoperative 24 hours Serum in blood will be obtained and level of serum cytokine will be evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</detailed_description>
