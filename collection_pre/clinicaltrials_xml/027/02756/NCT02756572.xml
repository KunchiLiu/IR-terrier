	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies how well early stem cell transplantation works in treating patients with high-grade myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia that has come back after a period of improvement or does not respond to treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as filgrastim, cladribine, cytarabine and mitoxantrone hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy before a donor peripheral blood cell transplant helps stop the growth of cells in the bone marrow, including normal blood-forming cells (stem cells) and cancer cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The donated stem cells may also replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells. Early stem cell transplantation may result in more successful treatment for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory High-Grade Myelodysplastic Syndrome or Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the feasibility of "early" allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) for patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate relapse-free survival (RFS), acute graft versus host disease (GVHD), treatment related mortality (TRM), event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and complete remission (with or without measurable disease) among patients who receive early HCT. II. Assess factors that distinguish patients who receive early HCT from those who do not. III. Compare RFS, EFS, OS, acute GVHD, and TRM between patients in the feasibility study and matched patients who were transplanted with standard scheduling. IV. Demonstrate the feasibility of collecting patient-reported outcomes and resource utilization data for trial participants. V. Describe the outcomes of patients enrolled who went on to allogeneic HCT off-study. OUTLINE: RE-INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on days 0-5, mitoxantrone hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1-3, cladribine IV over 2 hours on days 1-5, and cytarabine IV over 2 hours on days 1-5. Treatment continues for a maximum of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Beginning 14-60 days after re-induction chemotherapy, patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -6 to -2 and melphalan IV on days -3 to -2. EARLY TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic HCT after conditioning regimen on day 0. GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive mycophenolate mofetil orally (PO) three times daily (TID) on days 0-30, then twice daily (BID) until day 40, and cyclosporine PO BID on days -3 to 96, with a taper until day 150. Patients also receive sirolimus PO on days -3 to 150, with a taper until day 180. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.</detailed_description>
