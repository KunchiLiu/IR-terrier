	<brief_summary>The investigators will prospectively determine whether the relapse-free and overall survival in patients who have cleared their leukemia-associated mutations treated with standard consolidation chemotherapy is superior to what is expected based on historical controls. The investigators will also prospectively determine the relapse-free and overall survival of patients who have not cleared their mutations. Because the relapse rate of patients with persistent mutations is expected to be high, treatment with either standard of care consolidation therapy alone or alloSCT will be permitted, at the discretion of the treating physician.</brief_summary>
