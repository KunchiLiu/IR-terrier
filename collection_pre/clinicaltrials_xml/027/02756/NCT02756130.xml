	<brief_summary>This clinical trial is a Phase II, single center, open label, proof-of-concept study evaluating the efficacy of birinapant in combination with platinum based chemotherapy. This pilot study is aimed at determining the efficacy of carboplatin and birinapant co-therapy in treating patients with advanced newly diagnosed or recurrent high grade serous carcinomas. Only bio-assay positive patients will be enrolled</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proof-of-concept Study of Birinapant in Combination With Platinum Based Chemotherapy in Subjects With High Grade Serous Carcinomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants with newly diagnosed disease will receive the following treatment Each participant will receive a total of six 21-day cycles of chemotherapy with treatment on day 1 and day 8. Patients will undergo an interval debulking surgery (IDS) after completing 3 cycles of chemotherapy followed by the remaining 3 cycles of chemotherapy. Day 1: Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 IV over 3 hour Carboplatin AUC (area under the curve) 5 IV Birinapant 35 mg/m2 IV over 30 minutes Day 8: Birinapant 35 mg/m2 IV over 30 minutes Participants with recurrent disease will receive the following treatment Day 1: Carboplatin AUC (area under the curve) 5 IV Birinapant 35 mg/m2 IV over 30 minutes Day 8: Birinapant 35 mg/m2 IV over 30 minutes</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants will be eligible for study participation if they meet all of the following inclusion criteria, after participant has provided written informed consent. 1. The participant is female ≥ 18 years of age. 2. All patients must have measurable disease by imaging defined as tumor that can be measured ≥ 10 mm with multiparametric MRI (primary modality of imaging) or CT (as an alternative) or ≥ 10 mm by caliper on physical examination. 3. Participant is capable of understanding and complying with parameters as outlined in the protocol and able to sign and date the informed consent, approved by an Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB), prior to initiation of any screening or studyspecific procedures. 4. The participant must have a histologic diagnosis of advanced, newly diagnosed or recurrent high grade serous cancer (ovarian, tubal, peritoneal, endometrial), to be treated with chemotherapy. 5. Participants must either undergo surgery that would yield fresh tumor or have an image guided biopsy performed to yield fresh tissue for the in vitro organoid bioassay and two biomarker testing (western blot and immunohistochemistry). 6. Only patients with tumors that score positive in the in vitro organoid bioassay will be enrolled in the clinical trial. Patients with tumors that score negative in this bioassay will be considered screening failures and will not be enrolled in the clinical trial. 7. Participant must have either no neuropathy (sensory and motor) or neuropathy less than or equal to Grade 1. 8. The participant must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score between 0 2 at screening. 9. The Participant must have a life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks. 10. Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below: Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 Platelets ≥ 100,000/ mm3 Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL or equivalent Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal (ULN), unless known Gilbert's Syndrome has been diagnosed AST (aspartate aminotransferase) (SGOT)/ALT (alanine aminotransferase) (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 × institutional ULN (≤ 5 × ULN if liver metastasis) Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN or creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 Amylase and Lipase &lt; ULN 11. Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and negative (serum or urine) pregnancy test within 72 hours before the first studydrug dose. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. The serum pregnancy test must be negative for the Participant to be eligible. 12. Female participants of childbearing potential should ensure use of a highly effective method of birth control as defined by the Investigator, for example, those which result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly such as implants, injectable, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence or vasectomized partner during the study and for a period of at least 4 months following the last dose of any drug administered during the study. A participant will be excluded from the study for any one or more of the following reasons: 1. Patients with tumors that score negative in the in vitro organoid bioassay will be excluded. 2. Patients with nonmeasurable disease &lt; 10 mm on multiparametric MRI or CT scan will be excluded. 3. Participants undergoing primary debulking surgery prior to receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy are excluded. 4. Participants with a secondary malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment. Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative treatment are not excluded. 5. Participants who have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to birinapant or its constituents. 6. Participants requiring the use of antitumor necrosis factor (antiTNF) therapies, such as infliximab, or has received treatment with antiTNF therapies within 5 halflives of the drug. 7. Participants with an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic congestive heart failure, hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, autoimmune disease or inflammatory diseases, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. 8. Pregnant women or women who expect to conceive a child are excluded from this study because birinapant is an agent with unknown potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects in humans. Because there is an unknown risk for adverse events (AEs) in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with birinapant, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated on this study. 9. Participants who have a known active infection requiring systemic therapy, including HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. 10. Participants with a history of cranial nerve palsy. 11. Participant is or has an immediate family member (e.g., spouse, parent/legal guardian, sibling or child) who is an investigational site or sponsor staff directly involved with this trial, unless prospective IRB approval (by chair or designee) is granted allowing exception to this criterion for a specific subject. 12. In the opinion of the Investigator, the participant is an unsuitable candidate for this study. 13. Patients who are taking or anticipate taking any maintenance therapy while actively being treated on protocol or while being followed on protocol will be excluded. An example of this would be maintenance therapy with a poly ADP (adenosine diphosphate) ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor such as Olaparib.</criteria>
