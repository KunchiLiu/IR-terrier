	<brief_summary>Although bench data and retrospective studies have provided a promising picture of the possible influence of anesthetic technique on the risk of tumor progression, current evidence from RCTs is inadequate to show whether the type of anesthetics might influence tumor progression.There are many thousands of patients with a cancer diagnosis undergoing surgery every year, and in the context of biological plausibility, it should lead to the urgent undertaking of RCTs to further evaluate the association between the anesthetic management and postoperative malignant glioma progression.</brief_summary>
