	<detailed_description>This non-interventional clinical study (NIS) is conducted to clinically confirm the safety and performance of the Aesculap® APT VEGA System® PS components under routine conditions. The VEGA System® PS is an established TKA design, and there is a long-lasting experience in the use of PE for TKA in general and for APT components in particular; thus a NIS is thought to be sufficient to give the required confirmation. For this NIS only CE-marked medical devices will be used within their intended purpose and no additional invasive or other stressful examinations are to be carried out (acc. to MPG §23b). As part of the post marketing surveillance plan an obligatory Post-Marketing Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) is required for the product under investigation.</detailed_description>
