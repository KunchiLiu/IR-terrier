	<brief_summary>Anxiety and depressive disorders are common in children and adolescents, however they are often unrecognized. Rational emotive behavioral therapy (REBT), a form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is efficient for children and adolescents. School settings are appropriate environments to deliver such interventions for vulnerable youths. Given youth's access and predilection to use technology, a technology-enhanced prevention program was developed. The present study aims to investigate the efficacy of a transdiagnosticREBT prevention program for internalizing symptoms in children and adolescents, implemented in a school setting. Classes from different Romanian public schools will be randomized in either intervention or wait list group. The prevention program will be group-based, delivered in 6 sessions, over 3 weeks. Participants would be assessed baseline and post-intervention. Each of the six modules aimed a different component: Psychoeducation, Relaxation and Breathing, Relationship between cognitive distortions/irrational beliefs and emotions, Cognitive restructuring, Exposure, Maintenance of gaining. Despite specific activities, for each session a cartoon on that subject will be viewed and discussed. Homework would be given at every session. REBT/CBT prevention programs delivered in school settings represent ecological modalities to target vulnerable groups. Technology components added to traditional programs may lead to greater motivation and satisfaction with treatment.</brief_summary>
