	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the anti-myeloma effect of panobinostat given at two different doses (10 mg and 20 mg oral) in combination with carfilzomib (20/56 mg/m2 i.v.) and low dose dexamethasone (20 mg oral) vs carfilzomib plus low-dose dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Safety and efficacy will be evaluated. Treatment will be administered in 4-week cycles until patients discontinue due to disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or for other reasons. Patients who discontinue the study treatment for reasons other than documented disease progression will be followed for disease assessments every 8 weeks until progression. All patients will be followed for survival until 3 years have passed from their entry into the study, or they have discontinued the follow up earlier.</brief_summary>
