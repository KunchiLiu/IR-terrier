	<brief_summary>Prostate tissue biopsy is performed with either transrectal or transperineal approach. These two methods are usually based on tissue sampling with an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy. Transperineal prostate biopsy can be done either with a conventional noncoaxial technique or with a coaxial technique. In conventional transperineal technique, biopsy needle is inserted repeatedly for each tissue sampling. Alternatively, a coaxial needle can be placed over the perineum; then, the direction of the biopsy can be changed by tilting the coaxial needle. In this prospective study, the investigators sought to compare the procedural time and the complication rate of coaxial technique with those of noncoaxial technique in transperineal prostate biopsy.</brief_summary>
