	<brief_summary>Background. Gastric cancer surgery is associated with high risk for postoperative morbidity and mortality. Anastomotic leak (AL) is one of the worst complications associated with relevant short and long-term sequelae. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a biomarker used to monitor bacterial infections and guide antibiotic therapy and has been shown to have better predictive value of AL after colorectal surgery than C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC). Purpose. Investigators designed a monocentric pilot study to test if PCT might be a sensitive and reliable marker of AL after gastric surgery</brief_summary>
