	<brief_title>Overcoming Perfectionism: A Randomised Controlled Trial of an Online CBT Based Guided Self-help Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Perfectionism is elevated across, and increases risk for a range of Axis I disorders, as well as having a direct negative effect on day to day function. A growing body of evidence shows that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) reduces perfectionism and Axis I disorders, with medium to large effect sizes. Given the increased desire for online interventions to facilitate access to evidence-based therapy, web-based CBT self-help interventions for perfectionism have been designed. Existing interventions have not included personalised guidance which has been shown to improve outcome rates. The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of CBT based online guided self-help intervention for perfectionism at reducing symptoms of perfectionism and Axis I disorders post-treatment and at six-month follow-up. A randomised controlled trial method is employed, comparing the treatment arm (online guided self-help) with a waiting list control group. Outcomes are examined at three time points, T1 (baseline), T2 (post-intervention at 12 weeks), T3 (follow-up at 24 weeks). Participants will be recruited through universities, online platforms, and social media, and if eligible will be randomised using an online automatic randomiser.</detailed_description>
