	<brief_summary>Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory reaction caused by infection, trauma, etc. In the process of sepsis, the apoptosis of lymphocyte serves as a vital factor of immune dysfunction. Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNA molecules. Our previous studies have showed the diagnostic and prognostic value of a series circulant miRNAs in human serum in sepsis. The present research further study the regulatory mechanism of those miRNAs in lymphocyte in sepsis. Our research is based on the clinical value of miR-223, miR-15a, miR-16. The investigators discuss the potential role of miR-223, miR-15a, miR-16 in regulating the proliferation and apoptosis of lymphocyte in sepsis and aim to find new targets for sepsis treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Blood samples were collected from the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital. The investigators collected samples in emergency intensive care unit (EICU), surgical intensive care unit (SICU) and respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) between July 2014 to March 2015. Septic patients were divided into sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock according to the diagnostic criteria. Peripheral white blood cells were sorted into monocytes, lymphocytes and neutrophils by using flow cytometry (Flow Cytometry, FCM). Jurkat T cell lines were purchased from Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Institute of basic medical sciences. miRNAs agomirs and antagonists were used to establish miR-223, miR-15a, miR-16 overexpression and knock-out transient transfection cell lines. Western blot was used to detect difference expression of protein expression.</detailed_description>
