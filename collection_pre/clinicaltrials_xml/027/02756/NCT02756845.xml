	<brief_title>Study of Talimogene Laherparepvec In Children With Advanced Non CNS Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 1, multicenter, open-label study of talimogene laherparepvec in pediatric subjects with advanced non-CNS tumors that are amenable to direct injection in the clinical setting. Talimogene laherparepvec will be administered by intralesional injection to approximately 18 to 36 pediatric subjects with advanced non-CNS tumors. Pediatric subjects will be enrolled into cohorts stratified by age and baseline herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) serostatus (3 to 6 subjects/cohort). DLT will be evaluated based on 3 to 6 DLT-evaluable subjects in each cohort The DLT evaluation period is 35 days from the initial administration of talimogene laherparepvec.</detailed_description>
