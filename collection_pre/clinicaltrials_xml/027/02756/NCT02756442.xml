	<brief_summary>Introduction: The pregnancy brings about physiological and hormonal modifications which cause sleep disorder. The sleeplessness, snoring and a bad sleepquality are frequent during the pregnancy. Also a limited breathing airflow happens very often during the pregnancy. The limited airflow causes micro-awakenings that enter in the frame of the high resistances airways syndrome. To our knowledge there is no study about the outcome of micro-awakenings at pregnant women. Objectives: To compare the prevalence of the high resistances airways syndrome (RERA) in pregnant woman with or without gestational diabetes Methods : It is a monocentrical prospective study at pregnant women after the 30th amenorrhea week who consul the gynecologie and obstetrics department of the CHU NORD in Marseille. We are going to compare the breathing disorder during sleep of a control group with a group of women with gestational diabetes. A polysomnograph will be run at the included patients' home. Expected results : The physiological and hormonal modifications during the pregnancy could favor nocturnal sleep events (snoring, SAHOS and RERA) and its complications as gravidic HPN And gestational diabetes cause maternal and f≈ìtal and morbidity and mortality. We put the hypothesis that limited airflow in association with micro-awakenings in the RERA have a negative impact on the glucose metabolism and favor the gestational diabetes.</brief_summary>
