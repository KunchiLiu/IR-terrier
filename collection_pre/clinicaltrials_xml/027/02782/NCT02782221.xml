	<brief_summary>Growth hormone (GH) induces fat metabolism. The mechanisms underlying the fat metabolizing effects of GH remain elusive. However, it is known that insulin suppresses fat metabolism, and GH inhibits the expression of certain insulin-dependent signaling proteins. We therefore hypothesize that the fat metabolizing effects of GH depend on abrogation of insulin-dependent signaling pathways. In order to investigate the fat metabolizing effects of GH, we'll analyze consecutive adipose tissue biopsies taken after GH exposure and GH blocking, respectively. Knowledge of the effects of growth hormone and fat metabolism can in shot-sight as well as in long-sight have great importance for the understanding of growth disorders from overweight and type 2 diabetes to malnutrition and eating disorders.</brief_summary>
