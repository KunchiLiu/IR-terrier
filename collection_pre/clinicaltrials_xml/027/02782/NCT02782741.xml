	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To determine the effect of neoGAA (GZ402666) treatment on respiratory muscle strength measured by percent predicted forced vital capacity (% FVC) in the upright position, as compared to alglucosidase alfa. Secondary Objective: To determine the safety and effect of neoGAA treatment on functional endurance (6-minute walk test (6MWT), inspiratory muscle strength (maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP)), expiratory muscle strength (maximum expiratory pressure (MEP)), lower extremity muscle strength (hand-held dynamometry (HHD)), motor function (Quick Motor Function Test (QMFT)), and health-related quality of life (SF-12).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Enzyme Replacement Therapies neoGAA and Alglucosidase Alfa Administered Every Other Week in Patients With Late-onset Pompe Disease Who Have Not Been Previously Treated for Pompe Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The duration of the study per patient will be up to 3 years that will consist of a 14-day screening period, a 49-week blinded treatment period, a 96-week open-label treatment period, and a 4-week post-treatment observation period. Legally minor patients, as defined by local regulation, may be aged 18 years and older.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : The patient has confirmed GAA enzyme deficiency from any tissue source and/or 2 confirmed GAA gene mutations. The patient must provide signed, informed consent prior to performing any study related procedures. Consent of a legally authorized guardian(s) is (are) required for legally minor patients as defined by local regulation. If the patient is legally minor, signed written consent shall be obtained from parent(s)/legal guardian and assent obtained from patients, if applicable. The patient (and patient's legal guardian if patient is legally minor as defined by local regulation) must have the ability to comply with the clinical protocol. The patient, if female and of childbearing potential, must have a negative pregnancy test (betahuman chorionic gonadotropin) at baseline. Exclusion criteria: The patient is &lt;3 years of age. The patient has known Pompe specific cardiac hypertrophy. The patient is wheelchair dependent. The patient is not able to ambulate 40 meters (approximately 130 feet) without stopping and without an assistive device. The patient requires invasiveventilation (noninvasive ventilation is allowed). The patient is not able to successfully perform repeated forced vital capacity (FVC) measurements in upright position of ≥30% predicted and ≤85% predicted. The patient has had previous treatment with alglucosidase alfa or any investigational therapy for Pompe disease. The patient has prior or current use of immune tolerance induction therapy The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
