	<brief_title>Shared Decision Making in Older Adults With Distal Radius Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Shared decision making has become a increasingly important with the goal of helping patients make decisions that more align with patients values and goals. Decision aids are validated instruments that provide unbiased information and guide patients through questions that allow patients to clarify patients goals. Older adults with distal radius fractures have increasing evidence of ability to tolerate residual deformity with little to no functional deficits, which has called into question the indications for surgery. In situations where the operative indications are not clear, it is important to engage the patient in the risk and benefits of the decision. This trial is a prospective trial with two groups, one standard of care, and one with the decision aid.</detailed_description>
