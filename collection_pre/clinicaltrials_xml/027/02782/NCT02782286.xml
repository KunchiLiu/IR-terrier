	<brief_title>Morphine Versus Ketorolac in Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will take place in the Emergency Department of the Clinical Emergency Hospital Bucharest and will compare the analgesic effects of ketorolac tromethamine against morphine in low back pain. The patients will be randomised to receive either ketorolac 30 mg intravenous (diluted in 20 ml of 0,9% saline) or morphine 0,1 mg/kg weight intravenous. A scale of 1-10 will be used for measuring the pain, and the effects of the treatment will be evaluated at 15 minutes and 30 minutes from the administration of the drugs. After 30 minutes if there is no significant reduction of the pain a rescue therapy will be used : acetaminophen 1 g, sodic metamizole 1g both diluted in 500 ml saline and the other medication not used from the study (morphine or ketorolac tromethamine).</detailed_description>
