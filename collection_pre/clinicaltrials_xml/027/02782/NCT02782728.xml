	<brief_summary>This pilot study will evaluate a computer-based intervention titled "Trauma-informed Personalized Scripts" (TIPS). The goal of this intervention is to improve patient-provider communication about sensitive topics such as intimate partner violence (IPV) and reproductive coercion (RC). The main aim of this study is to pilot test TIPS in family planning clinics using a randomized study design to compare the basic version of TIPS (a computer-based assessment with provider scripts only) to an enhanced TIPS containing a tailored brief intervention for patients along with provider scripts. The investigators plan to recruit 240 female patients ages 16-29 for this study.</brief_summary>
