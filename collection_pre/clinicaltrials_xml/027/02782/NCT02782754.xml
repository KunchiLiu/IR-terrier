	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Plus Reduced Radiotherapy in Intracranial Germinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment outcome of intracranial germinoma is excellent with radiotherapy/chemotherapy. However, late sequelae are unavoidable especially with craniospinal irradiation, and various efforts have been done to reduce the dose and extent of radiotherapy. In this study, chemotherapy and further reduced dose of radiotherapy will be used to minimize the late sequelae in the patients with intracranial germinoma.</detailed_description>
