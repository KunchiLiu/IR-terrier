	<brief_summary>This randomized phase IIb trial studies how well curcumin works in preventing gastric cancer in patients with chronic atrophic gastritis and/or gastric intestinal metaplasia. Curcumin is an antioxidant compound found in plants that may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Curcumin in Preventing Gastric Cancer in Patients With Chronic Atrophic Gastritis or Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare the change in gastric mucosal interleukin (IL)-1beta cytokine level, quantified by Luminex assay technology, after a 6 month intervention in participants randomly assigned to the curcumin (Meriva) versus placebo arms. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety and tolerability of Meriva versus placebo. II. To compare changes in Histology Gastric Score (HGS) from baseline to 6 months for Meriva versus placebo. III. To compare changes in additional gastric mucosal cytokine/chemokine levels (IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNFalpha], and inducible protein[IP]-10; quantified by Luminex assay). IV. To compare changes in gastric mucosal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage (gamma H2A histone family, member X [gamma-H2AX] assessed by flow cytometry). V. To explore associations between proinflammatory cytokine genotype status (IL-1beta, IL-8, and TNFalpha single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]; characterized at baseline) and the above outcomes. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 arms. ARM 1: Patients receive curcumin orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 180 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. ARM 2: Patients receive placebo PO BID for 180 days. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and 7 months.</detailed_description>
