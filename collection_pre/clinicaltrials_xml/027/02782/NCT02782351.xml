	<brief_summary>The present study evaluates the safety and efficacy of humanized Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) in treating recurrent or refractory B cell malignancy targeting CD19 with a humanized scFv. All participants will receive autologous chimeric antigen receptor engineered T cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Humanized CAR-T Therapy for Treatment of B Cell Malignancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CD19 has been extensively evaluated as a therapeutic target for recurrent or refractory B cell malignancy by chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy, the single chain antibody sequence (scFv) against CD19 derived from a mouse hybridoma was widely employed. However, the immunogenicity of the mouse scFv sequence might be one of the reasons that CAR-T cells cannot persist in vivo for long. In present study investigators replace the mouse-derived scFv with a a humanized one and evaluate its safety and efficacy.</detailed_description>
