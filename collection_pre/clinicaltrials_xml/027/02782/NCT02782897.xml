	<brief_title>Intravenous Immunoglobulin for Acute Intracranial Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial consists of two groups: IVIg group and control group. Thirty patients will be recruited into IVIg group. Thirty Patients who are matched for age, gender, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores, hematomal volumes, and locations of hematomas, will be selected into control group.
