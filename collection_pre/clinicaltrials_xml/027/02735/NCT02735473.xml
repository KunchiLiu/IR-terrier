	<brief_title>Choline Supplementation as a Neurodevelopmental Intervention in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project is the third in a series of randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trials of choline bitartrate in children ages 2-5 who have been diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Pre-clinical data suggests that choline may attenuate the cognitive deficits caused by prenatal alcohol exposure (especially memory deficits). This study will evaluate the effects of daily choline supplementation vs. placebo for 9 months. Outcome measures include an elicited imitation memory paradigm, global cognitive functioning, and aspects of executive functioning. The study will also continue to collect safety and tolerability data.</detailed_description>
