	<brief_summary>This study combines functional MRI with medication treatment in order to understand the neural mechanisms by which disulfiram, a currently approved medication for alcohol use disorder, changes behavior. Disulfiram is a medication that prevents drinking by causing a highly unpleasant physical reaction when alcohol is consumed while it is being taken. Thus, it provides a means for studying the general neural mechanisms by which awareness of risks impacts behavior change in alcohol use disorder.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neural Mechanisms of Disulfiram Effects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall goal of this project is to combine functional brain imaging and clinical methods in order to examine how treatment with disulfiram (DIS) alters neural activity related to alcohol-seeking motivation in patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD). DIS is an established, effective, FDA-approved medication for AUD that causes a highly aversive physical reaction if alcohol is consumed while it is being taken. The mere awareness of the risk or threat the DIS-alcohol reaction deters alcohol use, i.e. it is not necessary to drink alcohol while taking DIS to change behavior. By uncovering the neural mechanisms underlying this risk/threat-based psychological effect, it will be possible to integrate DIS with biologically based treatments targeted at these neural mechanisms, with the goal of improving the efficacy of DIS. Furthermore, the results will shed light on the general neural mechanisms by which awareness of risks of substance use impacts addictive motivation. This is a core process in a number of behavioral treatments for substance use disorders, such as Motivational Interviewing and Contingency Management, as well as in behavior change in non-treatment settings.</detailed_description>
