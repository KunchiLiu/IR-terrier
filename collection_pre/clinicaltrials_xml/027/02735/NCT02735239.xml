	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the safety of durvalumab (MEDI4736) in combination with oxaliplatin/capecitabine chemotherapy in metastatic/locally advanced oesophageal cancer (OC) and with neoadjuvant chemo(radio)therapy before surgery in operable OC. The immunotherapy will be given for a 4-week period before starting the standard chemo(radio)therapy, continuing durvalumab treatment once the chemotherapy starts. The study will include 2 phases, a safety run-in Phase 1 (Cohorts A1 and A2) and an expansion Phase 2 (Cohorts B, C, and D).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Histological diagnosis of oesophageal or gastrooesophageal cancer Cohorts A and B metastatic/locally advanced cancer Cohorts C and D deemed suitable for surgery with curative intent 2. Recovered from prior therapy (Grade 1 persistent Adverse Events acceptable) 3. Anticipated lifespan greater than 4 months 4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. 5. At the time of day 1 of the study, subjects with brain metastases must be asymptomatic for at least 4 weeks and: at least 8 weeks without tumour progression after any whole brain radiotherapy at least 4 weeks since craniotomy and resection or stereotactic radiosurgery at least 3 weeks without new brain metastases as evidenced by MRI/CT 6. Adequate normal organ and marrow function as defined below. Laboratory parameters for vital functions should be in the normal range. Laboratory abnormalities that are not clinically significant are generally permitted, except for the following laboratory parameters, which must be within the ranges specified, regardless of clinical significance: Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 Serum creatinine, or Creatinine Clearance ≤ 1.5x Institutional Upper Limit of Normal (ULN), or ≥ 40 mL/min (by CockcroftGault formula) Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)/Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) (SGOT)/Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) (SGPT): ≤ 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN). This will not apply to subjects with confirmed Gilbert's syndrome (persistent or recurrent hyperbilirubinemia that is predominantly unconjugated in the absence of hemolysis or hepatic pathology), who will be allowed only in consultation with their physician. 7. Written informed consent obtained from the subject prior to performing any protocolrelated procedures, including screening evaluations. 8. Age 18 years. 9. Have been informed of other treatment options 10. Willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including undergoing treatment, scheduled visits, examinations, biopsies and follow up Exclusion Criteria 1. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca staff and/or staff at the study site). Previous enrollment in the present study. 2. Participation in another clinical study with an investigational product during the last 6 weeks 3. Prior or concurrent systemic anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, endocrine therapy, targeted therapy, biologic therapy, tumour embolization, monoclonal antibodies, other investigational agent) 4. Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) ≥470 ms calculated from 3 electrocardiograms (ECGs) using Fredericia's Correction 5. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 28 days before the first dose of study drugs, with the exceptions of intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids at physiological doses, which are not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone, or an equivalent corticosteroid 6. Active or prior documented autoimmune disease within the past 2 years. Subjects with vitiligo, Grave's disease, or psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment (within the past 2 years) are not excluded 7. Active or prior documented inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) 8. History of allogeneic organ transplant 9. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, active bleeding diatheses including any subject known to have evidence of acute or chronic hepatitis B, hepatitis C, known immunodeficiency or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements or compromise the ability of the subject to give written informed consent 10. Known history of previous clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis 11. Receipt of live attenuated vaccination within 30 days prior to study entry or within 30 days of receiving durvalumab 12. Prior exposure to tremelimumab / durvalumab or checkpoint inhibitors, such as antiCytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated protein 4 (CTLA4) and antiProgrammed cell death protein 1 (PD1)/antiProgrammed death ligand 1 (PDL1) antibodies. 13. History of severe allergic reactions to any unknown allergens or any components of the study drugs. 14. Known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency 15. Treatment with sorivudine or its chemically related analogues, such as brivudine 16. Peripheral sensitive neuropathy with functional impairment prior to first course 17. History of sarcoidosis syndrome. 18. Metastatic disease to the central nervous system for which other therapeutic options, including radiotherapy, may be available. 19. History of pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease. 20. Major surgical procedure (as defined by the investigator) within 30 days prior to Day 1 or still recovering from prior surgery. 21. Women who are breast feeding or pregnant as evidenced by positive serum pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG). 22. Any condition that, in the clinical judgment of the treating physician, is likely to would interfere with evaluation of study treatment, interpretation of subject safety or study results, prevent the subject from complying with any aspect of the protocol or that may put the subject at unacceptable risk. 23. Subjects should not donate blood while participating in this study or for at least 90 days following the last infusion of durvalumab or until the time specified in the prescribing information of oxaliplatin or capecitabine, whichever is longest 24. For oxaliplatin and capecitabine, refer to prescribing information for additional information</criteria>
