	<brief_summary>The study is an investigation to assess the capacity of ascending doses of CX1739 to antagonize the respiratory depressive effect of remifentanil. The study will also investigate whether ascending doses of CX1739 reduce the analgesic effect of remifentanil or alter the BIS measure of sedation and will evaluate the safety of CX1739 when used in conjunction with remifentanil.</brief_summary>
