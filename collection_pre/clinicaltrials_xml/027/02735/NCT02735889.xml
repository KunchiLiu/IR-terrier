	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to compare the effect of different levels of carbonation isocaloric beverages on glycemic response (using protocol based on standardized glycemic index testing methodology), gastric emptying and satiety. It is hypothesized that carbon dioxide will delay gastric emptying, and in turn, attenuate glycemic response and enhance satiety. The use of a non-nutrient (gas) in improving glycemic response and satiety would have important health implications for the beverage industry.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>15-20 healthy subjects will be recruited for the study by means of advertisements, flyers and personal communications. A randomized, cross-over design experiment with three treatments will be carried out. Three different beverages will be prepared:- No carbonation (NC): Potable water + sugar- Low carbonation (LC): Potable water + sugar + little CO2- High carbonation (HC): Potable water + sugar+ high CO2. The outcome measures assessed will be glycemic response, gastric emptying and satiety. Glycemic response will be measured by taking capillary blood samples (&lt;5ul) by fingerpricking with one-time use sterilized lancets. Gastric emptying will be assessed by ultrasonography methodology developed by Okabe et al, 2015. Satiety will be measured using electronic visual analogue scales assessing hunger, fullness, desire to eat, prospective consumption and thirst. In addition, participants will be asked to rate the level of effervescence of beverage, sweetness of beverage, amount of beverage consumed, as well as how pleasant the beverage was immediately after drinking of test beverage. Feelings of bloatedness will be assessed using electronic visual analogue scales administered at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90,120 min from drinking of test beverage. At the end of the test session, ad libitum lunch will be served, and the amount of food and drinks consumed will be measured (by weight difference before and after serving).</detailed_description>
