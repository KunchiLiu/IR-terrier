	<brief_summary>This phase 0 trial studies how well itraconazole gel works in treating patients with basal cell cancer. Itraconazole gel may help to treat basal cell tumors in patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topical Itraconazole in Treating Patients With Basal Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if 12 weeks of topical itraconazole gel reduces basal cell carcinoma (BCC) biomarkers (Gli1, the target gene of the Hedgehog pathway). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if topical itraconazole gel will decrease BCC size. OUTLINE: Patients apply itraconazole topically twice daily (BID) and placebo topically BID for 12 weeks. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 14 weeks.</detailed_description>
