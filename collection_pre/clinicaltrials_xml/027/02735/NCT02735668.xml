	<brief_title>Physiotherapy in Chronic Shoulder Pain After Breast Cancer Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction: Studies suggest that a potential complication that today lacks sufficient study and analysis are the motor patterns disturbances in chronic shoulder pain which occurred after breast cancer treatment. This alteration, maintained permanently, may cause long-term pathologies more committed both locally (impigement subacromial, retractable capsulitis ...) as a more global level by means of the central nervous system. So appears the need to reconsider these issues and propose effective physical therapy programs to solve these dysfunctions. Subjects and methods: A randomized clinical trial, the examiner being blinded unaware of the intervention group to which subjects were assigned. Participants will be randomly assigned to three groups: An experimental group, where the participants will be treated with Invasive Physical Therapy and Motor Control Exercises; Another experimental group where will be realized Motor Control Exercises; And a third group where will be done Shoulder Conventional Exercises. Pre- intervention, immediate post-intervention, 3, 6 and 12 months assessments will be made. The selection criteria will be: Adult women with chronic shoulder pain presenting motor patterns disturbances after breast cancer treatment verified through electromyography (EMG). All participants must understand and sign freely Informed Consent. Sample size: 30 women for each group. Data Analysis: A descriptive analysis of all variables was performed. It establish for all cases a confidence level of 95% (p &lt;0.05). The effectiveness was assessed by comparing the experienced change of the three goups in outcome variables between physicaltherapy examinations.</detailed_description>
