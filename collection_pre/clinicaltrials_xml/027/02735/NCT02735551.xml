	<brief_summary>This prospective randomized controlled study will evaluate if Long Acting Reversible Contraceptive (LARC) forward counseling in combination with same-day LARC placement increases overall LARC uptake within a community college population compared to LARC forward counseling and referral to a secondary clinic for LARC placement. The study will be conducted at Mount Hood Community College (MHCC) in Oregon. Participants will be enrolled into three groups. All groups will receive the same standardized contraceptive counseling ("LARC forward counseling") and participants will be able to choose between a LARC method and short-acting method of birth control.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LARC Forward Contraceptive Counseling at MHCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the benefit of an on-campus birth control counseling and services clinic. Currently there are no health services that provide access to birth control located on the Mount Hood Community College (MHCC) campus. We are offering a temporary 'Birth Control Resource Center' for eligible students. All forms of birth control in this study are FDA approved. During the study participants will undergo counseling to choose the method of birth control that is right for them. This will include watching an informational video and having a discussion with study staff. If participants choose pills, the patch the ring, or a diaphragm and do not have any contraindications to this method, they will receive a prescription for this method to be filled at the pharmacy of their choice. If participants choose Depo-Provera (the shot), they will receive their first shot on the day of their visit and a prescription for repeat shots every 3 months. If participants choose to have an IUD or Implant as their method of birth control, they will be randomized to one of two groups. There is a 50% chance of having the IUD or Implant placed immediately after the counseling session and a 50% chance of receiving a list of local clinics that can place the device at a later time.</detailed_description>
