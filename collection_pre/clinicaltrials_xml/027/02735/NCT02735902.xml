	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to demonstrate that a single anticoagulant therapy is superior to a combination of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy on the net clinical benefit estimated at 12 months after a Transcatheter Aortic Valve Intervention (TAVI) according to BARC2 criteria (bleeding complications; Mehran et al 2011) and VARC2 (other complications; Kappetein et al 2012)..</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the following at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after TAVI in both groups: 1. Mortality (all causes). 2. Cardiovascular mortality. 3. The occurrence of myocardial infarction. 4. The occurrence of stroke. 5. The occurrence of valve thrombosis. 6. The occurrence of major bleeding (BARC ≥ 3). 7. The occurrence of minor bleeding (2 ≤ BARC &lt;3). 8. Treatment compliance.</detailed_description>
