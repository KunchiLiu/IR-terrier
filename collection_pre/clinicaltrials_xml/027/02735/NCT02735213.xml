	<brief_title>Micropulse 577nm Laser vs Traditional Laser Treatment in Central Serous Chorioretinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) is characterized by serous detachment of neurosensory retina which can cause lose in visual acuity. Some studies have shown that traditional laser treatment (TLT) is effective on CSC, although accompanied with side-effects, such as scar. Recent retrospective studies suggest micropulse laser (MPL) therapy may also be effective without obvious complications in this disease. But to date, there is no study on effectiveness of CSC between TLT and MPL. The study is the first prospective randomized controlled trial about 577nm micropulse laser versus traditional laser treatment in central serous chorioretinopathy. It is a noninferiority study. The investigators hypothesize that application of 577nm micropulse laser in patients with CSC will prompt resolution of CSC as measured by ocular coherence tomography and best corrected visual acuity.This will be a pilot study to establish sound methods and provide some insights to the safety and efficacy of CSC treatment. The primary outcome measures is the proportion of eyes with absorption of subretinal fluid (SRF) and re-treatment in 12 week.</detailed_description>
