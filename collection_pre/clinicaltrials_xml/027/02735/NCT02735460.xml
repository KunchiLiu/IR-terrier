	<brief_summary>Andago V2.0 is a recently developed overground gait and balance training device. Many patients in neurorehabilitation suffer from gait disorders, most typically after stroke. Since pharmacological therapies are basically not available, neurorehabilitation plays an important role in the treatment of such patients. The Andago V2.0 may represent a useful device in the rehabilitation of stroke and other neurological patients featuring a severe gait disorder. Therefore a study has been designed to investigate the usability of the Andago V2.0 in the setting of a neurorehabilitation clinic. The primary outcomes of this study are the usability and acceptance of the investigational medical device (IMD). Usability is mainly measured by the time spent for the set-up and release of the participant, achieved training times and distances, the number of stumbles, collisions and emergency stops and the error messages during the session. Besides patient and therapist satisfaction with the Andago V2.0 is recorded.</brief_summary>
