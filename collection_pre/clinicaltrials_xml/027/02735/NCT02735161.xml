	<brief_summary>The aims of the current study is to explore if different exercise training protocols affect fatigue post-exercise, and if sarcoidosis-related fatigue and maximal and sub-maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) variables change after a 4-weeks exercise training period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fatigue and Exercise Training in Patients With Sarcoidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project aims to provide data on post-exercise fatigue after single exercise sessions with endurance training and muscle strength training, each with two different intensities. For endurance training; post-exercise fatigue will be assessed after one session of high intensity interval training, and one session with longer duration of moderate intensity. For muscle strength training, fatigue will be measured after one session with high loads/few repetitions and one session with low loads/many repetitions. In addition, changes in sub-maximal and maximal metabolic and ventilatory responses to a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test on a treadmill (CPET) and association to sarcoidosis-related fatigue before and after a 4-weeks exercise training period will be studied.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with sarcoidosis diagnosed according to the latest American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society/World Association for Sarcoidosis and Other Granulomatous Disorders (ATS/ERS/WASOG) statement on sarcoidosis who are attending a four weeks exercise based pulmonary rehabilitation program at LHLklinikkene Glittre. Patients with a concurrent and predominant diagnosis of another significant respiratory disorder (for example: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, or lung cancer). Unstable cardiovascular disease. Not able to perform the required physical tests and exercise training sessions caused by comorbidities.</criteria>
