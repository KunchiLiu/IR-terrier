	<brief_title>Does Cold Saline Used to Inflate a Balloon Tamponade Catheter More Significantly Reduce Blood Loss From Postpartum Hemorrhage Than Room Temperature Saline?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When post partum hemorrhage occurs one mode of therapy is to place a balloon tamponade catheter into the uterus to compress the bleeding vessels. When this mode of therapy has been chosen by the attending physician the patient will be randomized to either the room temperature arm (control) or the cold arm (study). The balloon catheter is placed through the vagina into the uterus and inflated using normal saline; room temperature for the control group and approximately 32 degrees F for the study group. Traction is placed on the catheter to tamponade the vessels in the lower uterine segment. Blood from the uterus passes through a central lumen of the balloon and will be collected and measured. Total measured blood loss for each group will be compared.</detailed_description>
