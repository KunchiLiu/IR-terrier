	<brief_summary>Heterogeneous modalities of aging lead to describe three categories of elderly patients: 1-healthy without frailty, 2- healthy with frailty, 3- patients with chronic disease(s) and frailty. Frail people have a high risk of losing functional independence and as a consequence they require more help for day to day life. It is known in elderly that physical activities, nutrition, social environment are important to maintain functional independence. For patients with disabilities, less is known about the occurence of dependance with aging. That is of growing importance because life expectancy of disabled patients has increased a lot during last decades, and because caregivers, often parents, also become elderly and frail. So the investigators will require tools to anticipate prevention and supportive needs for this specific population. The goal of this study is to evaluate if the participants (disabled patients over 40 years old) of a well-defined region in the south-east of France (400000 inhabitants), and to assess their needs, using the Functional Autonomy Measurement System (SMAF) developed for assessment of the elderly, by Rejean Hebert &amp; Nicole Dubuc's team in Sherbrooke University (Quebec/Canada).</brief_summary>
