	<brief_title>Acute Effects of Ginger Extract Consumption on Risk Markers of Cardiovascular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized, single-blind human intervention study involving 22 healthy male volunteers was designed to investigate the acute effects of ginger drink consumption on risk markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The primary outcome measure is reduction in blood pressure while the secondary outcome measures are improvement in flow mediated dilatation (FMD) and changes in plasma biochemical profile parameters related to CVD. Participants were given 300 ml of ginger extract or water (placebo) with breakfast, followed by a lunch at 2 hours on two visits separated by 2 weeks. Blood and urine samples were collected at regular intervals as well as blood pressure measurement done during the two visits. Vascular function was measured by flow mediated dilatation (FMD) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) at baseline, 2 and 4 hours after the the consumption of the study drink and placebo. The blood and urine samples were analysed for changes in lipid profile and other markers of CVD.</detailed_description>
