	<brief_title>Randomized, Embedded, Multifactorial Adaptive Platform Trial for Community-Acquired Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, the investigators aim to build an infrastructure for rapidly obtaining evidence for the management of patients requiring admission to an ICU during a pandemic of severe respiratory infections. Furthermore, during the inter-pandemic phase, this infrastructure will consist of a rolling adaptive clinical trial evaluating different management strategies of patients with severe CAP admitted to ICU. This ongoing trial will serve as the framework in which different aspects of ICU patient management can be rigorously and rapidly evaluated through rapid modification (adaptation) of the trial interventions based on new circumstances (e.g., a pandemic). These modifications or adaptations may include adding "pandemic" study arms (with or without predefined treatment) or changing randomization schemes.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The trial participants are patients with severe CAP that are admitted to an ICU as part of their routine clinical care. Overall Platform Inclusion Criteria In order to be eligible to participate in this study, a patient must meet all five of the following criteria: 1. Admitted to ICU within 48hrs of hospitalisation 2. ≥18 years of age 3. Suspected of communityacquired pneumonia: i) onset of symptoms outside the hospital or long term care facility; ii) Pneumonia is considered the primary admission diagnosis. Overall Platform Exclusion Criteria A potential eligible patient who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study: • Recent institutional exposure within 30 days of presentation to the hospital (to exclude healthcareassociated pneumonia) • Resident of nursing home or long term care facility. • No commitment to aggressive care; treatment is not aimed at recovery of the patient. • Significant trauma, burns • On ECMO (Extra Corporal Membrane Oxygenation) • Severe chronic liver disease (ChildPugh class C) Bone marrow transplant or chemotherapyinduced neutropenia. Participation in a competing interventional study (see below 7.5). Additional Antibiotic Domain Exclusion criteria • Known allergy to one of the study drugs. Additional Steroid/Immunomodulatory Domain Exclusion criteria • Patient has received &gt;24 hours of steroid treatment at an immunomodulatory dose (defined as more than 25mg of hydrocortisone, more than 5 mg prednisone or more than 1 mg dexamethasone per 24 hours) prior to randomisation. Additional General Ventilatory Domain Inclusion criteria • Intubated within 72 hours of ICU admission; • Presence of bilateral alveolar infiltrates on chest Xray; • Moderate to severe ARDS oxygenation criteria (PaO2/FiO2 ratio &lt;200mmHg) on a PEEP of 5cmH2O Additional Specific Ventilatory Domain Exclusion Criteria No longer than 48 hours of tracheal intubation and ventilation before randomization; Barotrauma (pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema or the presence of any intercostal catheter), Contraindication for siting of ECCO2R cannulae (ECCO2R arm only) Study subjects may be coenrolled in other research studies when such coenrolment does not threaten the validity of either study or substantively increase the risk to the study subjects. Approval of coenrolment with interventional studies will be determined on a casebycase basis by the study management team.</criteria>
