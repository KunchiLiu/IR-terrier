	<brief_summary>This is a multi-centre, randomized, investigator blinded, vehicle controlled trial using intra-individual comparison (right half-face versus left half-face). Subjects will have each half-face randomized to one of the two following treatments: - Adapalene 0.3% - BPO 2.5% gel (TactuPump® Forte). - Vehicle gel The main objective of this trial is to evaluate the effect of Adapalene 0.3% - benzoyl peroxide (BPO) 2.5% gel versus vehicle gel on the risk of formation of atrophic acne scars in moderate to severe acne subjects.</brief_summary>
