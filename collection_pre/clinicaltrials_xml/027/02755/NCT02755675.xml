	<brief_title>uPAR-PET for Prognostication in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma and Large Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Lung</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study I: uPAR PET/CT with 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 will be evaluated as a prognostic tool in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (stage IV (Ia) operable disease (Ib)) by observer-blinded readings and compared to the prognostic performance of FDG PET/CT and prognostic biomarkers as uPAR. Furthermore, uPAR PET/CT will be evaluated in a pilot study in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) (Study II) and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung (LCNEC) (Study III) and correlated with immunohistochemical uPAR expression.</detailed_description>
