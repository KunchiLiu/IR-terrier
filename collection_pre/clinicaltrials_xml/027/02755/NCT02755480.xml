	<brief_summary>Patients with bone marrow cancer are more susceptible to chest infections than healthy adults; marrow ablation treatment further compromises their immune status and increases the risk of fungal opportunistic infection, which is associated with a high fatality rate. Therefore, it is critical to achieve early and accurate diagnosis of fungal infection when these patients become febrile. At the Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) and the University Health Network (UHN), the standard of care (SOC) to exclude a chest infection in immunocompromised (IC) patients is chest computed tomography (CT) using low dose CT (LDCTT).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultralow Dose Thoracic Computed Tomography in Immunocompromised Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As patients may have several febrile episodes during their hospital stay, the cumulative dose from LDCTT scans can be significant and increase the lifetime risk of inducing a second cancer. The aim of this project is to determine whether a 75% reduction in radiation dose for LDCTT in other words, an ultralow dose chest CT (uLDCTT) at a dose comparable to chest X-ray, maintains the diagnostic image quality for detection of fungal chest infection in IC patients. If successful, uLDCTT will be adopted as SOC imaging at Princess Margaret Cancer Center (PM) for these patients.</detailed_description>
