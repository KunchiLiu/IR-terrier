	<brief_summary>Prospective, randomized controlled trial. Pregnant women in early pregnancy will be randomized to either the Sleep Study + CPAP group (n = 180) or to a Standard Prenatal Care group (n = 180). Subjects in the Sleep Study + CPAP group will complete a sleep study (WatchPAT-200, Itamar Medical, Inc.) and have CPAP initiated if the AHI ≥5 as indicated, in early and late pregnancy, whereas the other group will receive standard prenatal care. All subjects will complete a sleep study again at 12 weeks postpartum.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study is to determine if parturients identified as high risk for OSA (defined as an apnea hypopnea index [AHI] ≥5 events/hour; risk factors: prepregnancy BMI≥30 kg/m2, chronic hypertension, pregestational diabetes (type 1 or type 2), history of prior preeclampsia, and/or a twin gestation) who are randomized to receive an unattended sleep study during early and late pregnancy (early = between 6 and 16 weeks; late = between 27 and 33 weeks) plus initiation of CPAP therapy if the AHI ≥5 events/hour and standard prenatal care have a decreased incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes (defined as a composite variable which includes gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, low birth weight, or stillbirth) at the time of delivery when compared to a group who receives standard prenatal care only (no sleep study and CPAP initiation).</detailed_description>
