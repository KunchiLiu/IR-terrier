	<brief_summary>ESTAMPS is a randomized clinical trial with a crossover design: Main objective is to compare impact of 2 different Mandibular Retention Device (MRD) designs (Narval MRD CadCam (CC) design vs Narval MRD traditional (trad) design) on upper airway volume secondary objectives: To evaluate the maximal mandibular propulsion according to the type of MRD To evaluate benefits on quality of life, sleepiness and OSA symptoms To evaluate impact of MRD design on therapy efficacy and tolerance To evaluate impact of MRD design on mandibular positioning</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Impact of 2 Types of Mandibular Retention Devices - Narval O.R.M CadCam Design vs Narval O.R.M Traditional Design - on Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) Therapy: ESTAMPS Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis ORCADES results suggest that Narval O.R.M CC could be more efficient than Narval MRD trad to reduce AHI whatever the initial OSA severity 79% of CC MRD patients have at least an AHI reduction of 50% (vs. 61% with a trad Narval MRD, p=0.0031) 66% of CC MRD patients get a complete answer with an AHI reduction &lt;10 (vs. 49% with a trad Narval MRD, p=0.0017) The investigators think that differences seen in the ORCADES study between the 2 MRD is due to a different impact on upper airway volume</detailed_description>
