	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate sit-stand phases and gait speed detection using an externally worn Reveal LINQTM compared to an external reference (3D accelerometer, and/or the Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment (CAREN) system) in one center in the Netherlands</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Frailty is a geriatric syndrome characterized by reduced homeostatic reserves, exposing the organism to extreme vulnerability to endogenous and exogenous stressors. Frailty is prevalent in older people and involves a progressive physiological decline of multiple body systems, typical signs and symptoms include weight loss, fatigue, muscle weakness, slow or unsteady gait declines in activity. Frailty is increasingly recognized as an important prognostic indicator in heart failure (HF) and is more prevalent in HF than the general population. The identification of frailty in its early stage is important because interventions may potentially prevent, or delay the clinical consequences of frailty. Of particular focus in this study will be walking speed as prior research has demonstrated that slow gait speed has the strongest prognostic ability of the traditional components used to assess frailty, and has been reported as one of the strongest to predict adverse outcomes, such as mobility disability, falls, or hospitalization. Also of interest is the detection of posture changes as this may have implications for detecting changes in sleeping habits and could also provide context for other biomarker signals collected by the LINQ device. The literature has been reviewed and the scientific soundness of the proposed analytical techniques evaluated. The rationale for this study design is to evaluate the feasibility of using the Reveal LINQ™ to monitoring walking patterns. HF patients (the target population for the study in discussion) would make it possible to test the sensitivity of the accelerometer embedded in the LINQ device in a small cohort of subjects with reduced mobility and for which frailty is more prevalent than the general population, as well as recognized as an important prognostic indicator. No risk to the subjects is expected with this study.</detailed_description>
