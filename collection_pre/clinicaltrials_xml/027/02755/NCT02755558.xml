	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators varied both the energy density and portion size of milk served with a meal commonly consumed by preschool children. The milk used in this study is commercially available and reflects typical variations in energy density. The primary aim of the study is to investigate the independent and combined effects of milk energy density and portion size on preschool children's intake of the milk and the simultaneously served meal. The effect of milk energy density and portion size on children's total energy intake at the meal will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>
