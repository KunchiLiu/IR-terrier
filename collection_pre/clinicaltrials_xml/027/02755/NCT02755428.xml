	<brief_title>Subretinal Transplantation of Retinal Pigment Epitheliums in Treatment of Age-related Macular Degeneration Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project intends to transplant human embryonic stem cells derived retinal pigment epitheliums into subretinal space to treat age-related macular degeneration(AMD). Through the statistical analysis EDTRS, BCVA, OCT, ERG, Fluorescein angiography, Ophthalmic AB ultrasound changes between before and after the treatment to assess the efficacy and safety of RPE transplants to treat AMD disease.</detailed_description>
