	<brief_summary>Hyperphosphatemia is an independent risk factor for mortality among dialysis patients. And most phosphate in human is derived from the food. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of nutritional consultation and education on phosphate binder among dialysis patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hyperphosphatemia is an independent risk factor for mortality among dialysis patients. Hyperphosphatemia is associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases, and is a mediator to the development of hyperparathyroidism and mineral bone disorder. Phosphate is usually obtained by food intake, and it can be removed by hemodialysis. However, the efficacy of removal is limited, so that dietary education and proper intake of phosphate binder is essential.</detailed_description>
