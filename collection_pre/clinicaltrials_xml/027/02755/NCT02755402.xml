	<brief_summary>Persons who inject drugs (PWID) are overrepresented among hepatitis C infected patients, but underrepresented among those who are treated, despite many studies showing that treatment is feasible and effective in this population. The hepatitis C diagnosis and pre-treatment evaluation are multistep processes. Every step is a potential occasion for disengagement and loss to follow-up. This is especially true with hard-to-reach populations such as PWID in whom competing needs are numerous and psychosocial situation can change rapidly. By using new technologies that can quickly provide clinical results, like Xpert HCV Viral Load (Cepheid) and transient elastography (fibroscan), a provider could determine if a patient needs treatment rapidly or not on the day of the initial visit. The aim of this study is to explore whether an accelerated pre-treatment evaluation can result in an improved linkage-to-care (defined as linkage to health care, addiction or social services) and, eventually, linkage-to-treatment among PWID.</brief_summary>
