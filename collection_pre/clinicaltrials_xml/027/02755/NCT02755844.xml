	<brief_summary>Endometrial cancer ranks 11th in terms of incidence (7275 / year) and mortality (2025 deaths/ year). The 5-year overall survivals of patients at diagnosis with locally advanced and metastatic carcinomas are about 50% and 15% respectively. Beyond first line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy, there is lack of effective drug in this disease, which explains the poor prognosis of patients. The prognosis of metastatic endometrial cancer patients is poor, and few drugs have been shown to be effective beyond first chemotherapy line. Endometrial carcinomas are characterized by frequent alterations of PI3K-AKT-mTor; IGF1R and of DNA repair pathways. Phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN)-phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor) and DNA repair pathways interact, and inhibition of PI3K-AKT-mTor signaling pathway may alter DNA damage repair. Metronomic cyclophosphamide regimen may increase the anti-proliferative effects of olaparib because it is an alkylating agent, and it exerts anti-angiogenic effects, with a favorable toxicity profile. Metformin may increase the anti-proliferative effects of olaparib because it downregulates IGF1R and PI3K-AKT-mTor pathways, with no additive toxicity.</brief_summary>
