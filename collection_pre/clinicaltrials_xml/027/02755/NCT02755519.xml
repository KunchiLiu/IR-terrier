	<brief_title>Optimizing Diagnosis Of Primary Aldosteronism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, the investigators aim to optimize the three confirmatory tests: salt loading, captopril challenge and fludrocortisone suppression, and to confirm a better choice of confirming testing for single or combined diagnosis of primary aldosteronism. Additionally, the investigators plan to collect blood and tissue samples of PA patients for genetic testing, and to proceed a long-term follow-up for further investigating the mechanism underlying PA and evaluating the cardio-cerebrovascular complications risk.</detailed_description>
