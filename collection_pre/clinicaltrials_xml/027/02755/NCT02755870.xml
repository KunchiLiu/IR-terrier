	<brief_title>A Phase I SAD and MAD Clinical Trial of CNM-Au8 in Healthy Male and Female Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SAD Phase: A total of 8 subjects will be randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive a single dose of either CNM-Au8 (n=6) or placebo (n=2) at an initial dose level of 15 mg CNM-Au8. Additional cohorts of 8 subjects will be enrolled to investigate escalating single doses of CNM-Au8 at 30, 60, and 90 mg. Cohorts will be balanced by sex with no more than 2/3rd of subjects being of one sex. MAD Phase: A total of 12 subjects will be randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive a multiple dose of either CNM-Au8 (n=9) or placebo (n=3) once daily for 21 days at an initial dose level of 15 mg CNM-Au8. Additional cohorts of 12 subjects will be enrolled to investigate escalating multiple doses of CNM-Au8 at 30, 60, and 90 mg CNM Au8 administered once daily for 21 days. Cohorts will be balanced by sex with no more than 2/3rd of subjects being of one sex.</detailed_description>
