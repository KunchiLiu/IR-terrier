	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal timing of zoster vaccination to induce both higher cell-mediated immunity and humoral immunity in adult patients aged over 50 with history of zoster within 5 years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimal Timing of Zoster Vaccine After Zoster Illness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Zoster vaccination is recommended by FDA for adults aged 60 years or older, and is approved for people aged 50 through 59 years old. For patients who had shingles, there is no specific length of time they must wait before receiving shingles vaccine. It is generally recommended that patients should wait for 6 to 12 months after recovery. The investigators plan to make scientific recommendation for optimal timing of zoster vaccine after zoster illness by comparing immune response between two groups (vaccination at 6 months to 2 years after shingles vs. 2 to 5 years after shingles). Primary outcome is ELISPOT response at week 6 after vaccination. Secondary outcome is gpELISA titer at week 6 after vaccination. All the patients will be asked if they have any contraindications for zoster vaccine by a physician before vaccination. And they will be monitored for any adverse reaction of the vaccination after 6 weeks (visiting the hospital).</detailed_description>
