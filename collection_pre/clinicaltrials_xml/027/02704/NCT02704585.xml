	<brief_title>Comparison of Two Pulse Oximeters in Delivery Room</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After delivery babies will be located in the radiant warmer. The probe of each pulse oximeter will be applied to one of the feet. Both probes will be simultaneously connected to the female plug of the pulse oximeter. Heart rate will be checked Time to get a stable reading in each device (by observation on the devices' display) will be recorded; this will be the primary study outcome. Other vital signs (oxygen saturation, heart rate) and demographics) will be recorded as well. Paired students T test will be used for the statistical analyzes.</detailed_description>
