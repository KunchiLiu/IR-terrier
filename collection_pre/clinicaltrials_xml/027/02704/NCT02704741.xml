	<brief_summary>The CO2RE laser system is a fractional CO2 laser that is FDA approved under a 510(k) K101321 for dermatologic procedures requiring ablation and coagulation of soft tissues, including the skin Eligible subjects will undergo 3 treatments in 4±1 weeks interval on the Vagina (External/Vulva and Internal/Vagina) with the CO2RE device according to study protocol. Subject will return for to 5 follow-up (FU) visits: 1 week ± 2 days post first treatment visit and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after last (third) treatment (± 2 weeks). Methodology described in protocol to evaluate efficacy of treatments will be carried out at each visit at the clinic.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study of the CO2RE Laser Device Performance for Vaginal Atrophy Treatments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a Prospective clinical study to demonstrate the CO2RE laser device for safety and efficacy for Vaginal Atrophy. Up to a total of 60 healthy candidates, seeking vaginal treatment from the participating investigator will be enrolled at a participating study site. Subjects will receive three (3) CO2RE treatments. Each subject will be followed for additional 5 post treatment visits (FU visits) that will be conducted at: - One week post first treatment - 1wk FU ± 2 days (Safety). - 1 month post last treatment - 1m FU ± 2 weeks (efficacy &amp; Safety). - 3 months post last treatment - 3m FU ± 2 weeks (efficacy &amp; Safety). - 6 months post last treatment - 6m FU ± 2 weeks (efficacy &amp; Safety). - 12 months post last treatment - 12m FU ± 2 weeks (efficacy &amp; Safety).</detailed_description>
