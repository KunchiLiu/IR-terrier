	<brief_title>Subthalamic Nucleus Stimulation Effect on Gait Symmetry and Freezing of Gait</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unilateral modulation of subthalamic stimulation and its impact on freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease will be studied. In a cross-over, doubleblind, randomized study, a 30% reduction of stimulation intensity of the less impacted side will be compared with chronic treatment with regard to frequency and duration of freezing of gait episodes.</detailed_description>
