	<brief_title>Analysis of Lipid Profiles in Samples Sperm and Seminal Plasma Under Artificial Insemination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Analyze lipid profiles in samples of sperm and seminal plasma of three populations: 1. male sperm donors 2. men assigned to a program of assisted reproduction with normal sperm / slightly abnormal successfully in the IUI; 3. attached to a program of assisted reproduction with male semen Normal / slightly abnormal unsuccessfully in IUI Establish partnerships between the composition of fatty acids, especially fatty acids polyunsaturated (PUFA) of the omega-3 (w3) series of samples analyzed parameterssemen and results of the IA to identify biochemical markers of fertility. Assess markers found by checking the increase in the rate of success in the IA.</detailed_description>
