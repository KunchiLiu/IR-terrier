	<brief_summary>Separated and expanded the CD4+CD25+CD127- Tregs from peripheral blood of autoimmune hepatitis patients and administrate the cells (5 x 106 cells/kg) into patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Regulatory T Cells in Treating Autoimmune Hepatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial will be carried out in autoimmune patients. The investigators will isolate CD4(cluster of differentiation)+CD25(cluster of differentiation25)+CD127(cluster of differentiation127)- Tregs from these patients, and expand them with IL(interleukin)-2 retinoid acid and anti-CD3(cluster of differentiation 3) /CD28(cluster of differentiation 28) beads. The patients will be subsequently treated with single infusion of CD4+CD25+CD127- Tregs (10-20 x 106 cells/kg). In the clinical trials, the investigators will monitor the number of Tregs in patients at different periods, and to test their suppressive functions in vitro. Also the function and biopsy of liver will be processed to determine the efficacy of Treg therapy.</detailed_description>
