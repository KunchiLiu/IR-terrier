	<brief_summary>End-stage renal disease related to AA amyloidosis is well characterized but there is limited data concerning patient and graft outcomes after renal transplantation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical features of, and risk factors for recurrent AA amyloidosis, as well as the effects of these factors on the ultimate outcome of renal allografts.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Recurrent AA Amyloidosis After Renal Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AA amyloidosis is a rare but serious complication of several chronic inflammatory diseases including recurrent hereditary periodic fever syndromes. Although end-stage renal disease related to AA amyloidosis is well characterized, there is limited data concerning patient and graft outcomes after renal transplantation, with most of the findings reported from small series. Recurrence of amyloidosis in the renal allograft might be underdiagnosed, assessing graft and patient outcomes in larger study groups will bring better understanding and new strategies in daily practice.</detailed_description>
