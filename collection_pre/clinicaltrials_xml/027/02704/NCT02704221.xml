	<brief_summary>This study is a feasibility trial, testing the hypothesis that among sedentary mothers of behaviorally at-risk preschool-aged children, those who receive behavioral parent training (BPT) programs and concurrently increase their physical activity levels will demonstrate improved parenting and child behavior outcomes compared to those who receive BPT but remain sedentary.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhancing the Outcomes of a Behavioral Parent Training Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will randomly assign 20 participants to two groups: behavioral parent training plus contingency management to increase steps (BPT+CM) or behavioral parent training alone (BPT). Contingency management procedures will involve monetary rewards for meeting weekly step-count goals. The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) assess the feasibility of the study design and procedures, 2) assess the acceptability of the BPT+CM condition to participants, and 3) determine whether a signal of an effect of increased physical activity exists (via preliminary comparisons of measures of fatigue, perceived energy, parenting behaviors, parenting sense of competence, parenting stress, and child behavior ratings between participants in the two conditions). This innovative pilot study will prepare us for a fully powered trial to test the efficacy of this approach.</detailed_description>
