	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies quality of life and supportive care preferences following radiation therapy in prostate cancer survivors. Studying quality of life and supportive care preferences in patients undergoing radiation therapy may help identify the effects of treatment on patients with prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quality of Life and Supportive Care Preferences Following Radiation Therapy in Prostate Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To develop an understanding of the impacts of prostate cancer on aspects of psychological stress, physiological stress and health related quality of life (HRQL) for men who are being treated with some level of radiation therapy (RT). II. To gain insight into the perceived needs of survivors depending on their disease stage, treatment regimen and side effects. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore whether biomarkers of stress, inflammation and autonomic control (heart rate variability [HRV]) can confirm or dispel the self-reported measures of psychological distress and HRQL of a unique population of aging men with prostate cancer. OUTLINE: Participants complete questionnaires about quality of life and preferences for supportive care treatment, undergo heart rate variability testing over 10-15 minutes while both lying down and standing, complete a walking test, wear an accelerometer for a period of 1 week, and undergo a single intelligent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (iDXA) scan over 10 minutes.</detailed_description>
