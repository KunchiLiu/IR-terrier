	<brief_title>Tarceva With or Without Apatinib in the Advanced Lung Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common NSCLC,most patient were diagnosed to advanced stage.The first-line therapy include chemotherapy of targeted therapy .Tarceva now was established first-line therapy for advanced lung adenocarcinoma with mutant EGFR patients.However,the benefit lasted for about 6-8 months.So we consider to add apatinib,a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGF,to the therapy of these patients.We designed the study to find out whether the addition of apatinib to the Tarceva would enhance the efficacy of Tarceva.</detailed_description>
