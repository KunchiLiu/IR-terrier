	<brief_title>Transumbilical Versus Lateral Transabdominal Removal of Benign Adnexal Masses Via Laparoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women assigned to laparoscopic surgery for removal of a benign adnexal mass were randomly divided into two groups as regards surgery: a transumbilical (TU) group (n=21) and a transabdominal (TA) group (n=21). General anesthesia and use of local anesthetics were standardized. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain and side effects (nausea/vomiting) and the amount of postoperative analgesic used were recorded for 24 hours. Investigators also investigated the expenses related to endobags and trocars. Further, peri- and postoperative complications were recorded. Investigators inquired about patient satisfaction as well as the surgeons' opinions of the alternative methods available.</detailed_description>
