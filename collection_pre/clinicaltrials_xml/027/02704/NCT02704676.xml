	<brief_title>CA-125 and Severity of Pre-Eclampsia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although the source of CA-125 during pregnancy is the fetal chorion, amniotic fluid, and maternal decidua, the perinatal dynamics of maternal serum CA-125 requires clarification. Clinical studies of CA-125 levels and its function in hypertensive pregnant patients are limited and offered contradictory results (Cebesoy et al., 2009). And so we investigate CA-125 in normal pregnancy and in pre-eclampsia, comparing mild and sever pre-eclampsia to determine relationship of CA-125 and severity of the disease. Patients will be divided in three groups: - Control: 40 normal healthy pregnant women attending the ER in labor. - Mild pre-eclampsia: 40 patients fulfilling the following criteria. - Blood pressure: systolic blood pressure &gt;140 and &lt;160 , Diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 and &lt;110 - Proteinuria: 300 mg (+) assessed by urine urignost 3AÂ® (urine strips from DIALAB). - No symptoms of severity as headache. - Normal investigations for different organ function (as liver and kidney function). - Severe pre-eclampsia :40 patients fulfilling anyone or more of the following criteria (The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2010)(ACOG): - Systolic blood pressure &gt; 160 mmHg - Diastolic blood pressure &gt; 110 mmHg (on two occasions at least 6 hours apart while the patient is on bed rest) - Proteinuria of 5000mg (5g) or higher on a 24-hour urine collection or at least 3+ on two random urine samples collected at least 4 hours apart - Oliguria &lt; 500 mL urine output in 24 hours - Cerebral or visual functional disturbances (cns irritability) - Pulmonary edema or cyanosis (not due to excessive intravenous volume replacement) - Epigastric or right-upper quadrant abdominal pain - Impaired liver function on laboratory analysis (elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine amino transferase(ALT), or lactate dehydrogenase(LDH)) - Thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 150,000/uL) - Fetal growth restriction.</detailed_description>
