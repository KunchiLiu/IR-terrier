	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the effects of non-invasive neuromodulation, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), on brain function in individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This study is focused on the mechanism(s) by which brain stimulation might change the functioning of regions implicated in OCD, and thereby inform possible future therapeutic uses.</brief_summary>
