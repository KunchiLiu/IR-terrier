	<brief_summary>This single-center, prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) is designed to compare the outcomes and clinicopathologic results of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and microwave ablation (MWA) combination therapy with MWA monotherapy for the treatment of early (stages 0 and A) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The primary aim of this study is to test the following hypothesis: 2-year intrahepatic disease-free survival does not differ between patients receiving the experimental therapy (MWA + TACE) and patients receiving the standard therapy (MWA alone) as treatment for early stage HCC. Secondary aims are: 1) to determine the clinical feasibility of TACE + MWA in HCC patients with a small tumor burden using patient demographics and disease characteristic data and 2) to determine the effect of TACE on radiographic tumor characteristics in this patient cohort.</brief_summary>
