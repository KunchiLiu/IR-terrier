	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease(CKD) patients have high incidence of coronary artery problems event after renal transplantation. And remain a major cause of mortality. The major risk marker is arterial stiffness. The cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) is a new index of overall stiffness and can estimated the risk of atherosclerosis. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) is a metabolic regulator that plays important role in cardiac remodeling elevated FGF-21 have been reported in coronary heart disease or carotid artery plaque and could be biomarkers for atherosclerosis disease Investigators aimed to study the association between CAVI and FGF-21 and their relations to various parameters that can contribute to cardiovascular disease eg. homocysteine Echocardiogram findings and other traditional basic factors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FGF21 Can Help Predicting Arterial Stiffness Measured by Cardio-ankle Vascular Index in Renal Transplant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 90 participants who underwent renal transplant were included in the study. The following measures were done and laboratory data were collected. CAVI, Ecchocariogram, Homocysteine, Hs-CRP, Carotid IMT, FGF-21, Medication after renal transplantation, incidence of cardiovascular disease correlation between categorical data was done by using Pearson's correlation test and multiple regression analysis.</detailed_description>
