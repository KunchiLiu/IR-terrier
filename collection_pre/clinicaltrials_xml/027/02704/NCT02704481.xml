	<detailed_description>This is a multi-site double-blind, randomized controlled trial to assess treatment with a repeat mifepristone-misoprostol regimen and with a two-dose misoprostol-alone regimen in women who are diagnosed with ongoing pregnancy â‰¤77 days gestational age at 1-week follow-up after medical abortion. The sample will be stratified in two cohorts: women with ongoing pregnancies &lt;= 56 days of gestation and women with ongoing pregnancies 57-77 days of gestation. Eligible women who agree to participate in the study will be randomly assigned to either Group 1 for treatment with 200 mg mifepristone followed in 24-48 hours by 800 mcg buccal misoprostol, followed by 4 misoprostol placebo pills 3-12 hours later, or to Group 2 for treatment with one mifepristone placebo pill, followed by 800 mcg buccal misoprostol 24-48 hours later and another 800 mcg dose repeated in 3-12 hours. The study will also assess the acceptability of additional medication for ongoing pregnancy following an initial course of mifepristone-misoprostol medical abortion.</detailed_description>
