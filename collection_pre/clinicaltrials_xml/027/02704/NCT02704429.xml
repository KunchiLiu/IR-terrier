	<brief_title>A Study of PRN1008 in Adult Patients With Pemphigus Vulgaris</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives: To evaluate the safety of PRN1008 in patients with pemphigus vulgaris (PV) To evaluate the clinical activity of PRN1008 in patients with PV, per criteria in the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) 2014 Pemphigus S2 Guideline (Hertl et al. 2015) Secondary Objectives To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and the pharmacodynamics (PD) of multiple doses of PRN1008 in patients with PV To evaluate the relationship of PK and PD to each other and to efficacy and safety in this patient population</detailed_description>
