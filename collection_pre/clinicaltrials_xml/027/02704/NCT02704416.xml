	<brief_title>Ablation in Brugada Syndrome for the Prevention of VF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial aims to develop evidence based curative treatment with optimal net benefit for patients with Brugada syndrome. Since a recent non-randomized pilot study and scarce case reports documented potential clinical benefit of epicardial ablation of fragmented electrograms in the region of the right ventricular outflow tract, patients in this trial will be randomized to continued implanted cardioverter defibrillator therapy (control arm) or ablation of areas of fragmented electrograms in the right ventricular outflow tract plus continued implanted cardioverter defibrillator therapy (intervention arm). A projected 92 patients in each group will be studied.</detailed_description>
