	<brief_summary>Over 6% of children in Pakistan suffer from a developmental disorder (intellectual disability or Autistic spectrum disorder) and most receive no intervention.In an earlier proof of concept study, the investigators integrated social, technological and business innovations to develop and successfully pilot a sustainable service for such children in one rural population of 30,000. Affected families were identified through a mobile phone-based interactive voice response system, and organised into family networks. 'Champion' family volunteers were trained in evidence-based interventions. A Tablet-based android application was developed for training, monitoring and supervision of the champions, based on the World Health Organization's guidelines. The champions delivered the intervention to other families in the network. The project was sustainable and demonstrated significant improvements in the lives of children and their families in the first 6 months of its operation. The investigators are scaling-up this intervention to a population of 1 million. The investigators aim to evaluate the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the scaled-up programme using cluster randomized control trial nested within the scale-up study.</brief_summary>
