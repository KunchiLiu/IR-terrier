	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to improve the methods with which researchers identify patient centered outcomes for use in research. Specifically, the investigators will test the application of concept mapping as compared to one-on-one interviews as a comprehensive and efficient method of identifying patient-important outcomes for use in research.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Concept Mapping as a Scalable Method for Identifying Patient-Important Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an observational study comparing two methods - concept mapping and one-on-one interviews. The investigators will test the methods themselves by comparing the comprehensiveness of the lists of patient-important outcomes obtained through each method (primary outcome) as well as the efficiency, as measured by resource intensiveness, of the methods (secondary outcome). The aims of this study will be tested with adult patients with moderately to poorly controlled diabetes mellitus who receive care at a large, urban, academic health system. In order to allow comparisons of the comprehensiveness of the methods in producing patient-important outcomes regardless of the healthcare setting in which outcomes are elicited, the investigators will recruit patients for the interview group from 3 different care settings: an acute care visit (in the emergency department), a post-acute care visit (within 1 week of a hospital discharge), and a routine primary care visit. Target sample size within each healthcare setting is 30 patients, which is the anticipated number needed for thematic saturation. The investigators will then recruit patient-participants from existing clinical and research databases for 3 separate concept mapping groups, each with a target of 20 patients. In Aim 2, the investigators will test the hypothesis that concept mapping in a research setting produces outcomes consistent with those elicited from patients in the "real-world" settings. In Aim 3, the investigators will assess the overall resource utilization, assessed primarily by time required from patients, the research team, and the advisory board, of qualitative interviews conducted to thematic saturation within a single healthcare setting compared to resources used for a single iteration of concept mapping. Findings from this work will improve patient-centered outcomes research methods by providing researchers with information about standardized scalable methods to identify patient-important outcomes for use in research studies, so that individual patients are able to select outcomes that are most useful to them. In addition to providing insight regarding methods for eliciting patient-centered outcomes, the study will also provide valuable information to stakeholders regarding how patients' priorities vary across the care continuum. The investigators will report how findings from concept mapping apply across healthcare settings, and the degree to which patient priorities (based on interviews) differ across healthcare settings. If concept mapping results (collected in the research setting) capture the priorities identified by patients across different healthcare settings, this finding would enhance researchers' ability to perform studies in different, or multiple, settings. If the findings do not generalize across settings, this will be a valuable finding demonstrating that patient priorities differ across interview settings and patient acuity and will validate researchers' needs to be specific about the setting in which they choose to perform research to ensure they are reaching their intended patient population. The work is being performed in close collaboration with the Patient and Key Stakeholder Advisory Board (PAKSAB) - equal partners with the research team who have been involved with the proposal from inception. PAKSAB members will be part of the research team throughout conducting the aims and assisting with all analysis and data interpretation.</detailed_description>
