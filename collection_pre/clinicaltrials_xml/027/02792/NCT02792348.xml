	<brief_summary>For the new-born, diagnosis and prognosis of congenital urine flow impairment (UFI) are difficult to confirm only with morphological examination (ultrasonography, intravenous pyelography) and functional examination (dynamic renal scan MAG3). Only the test of time allows the post confirmation of a significant UFI requiring a surgery. This meant that the actual therapeutic indications are imperfect by the absence of an "absolute" endpoint for UFI. The objective of the study is to characterize the urinary metabolomics profile of new born with renal pelvis and/or ureters tract dilatation (suspicion of pelvi-ureteric junction anomalies, primary megaureter and vesico-ureteric reflux), detected by prenatal ultrasonography, by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and metabolomics analysis. This characterization will allow the identification of statistically significant metabolomics markers for the diagnosis and prognosis of a favourable evolution of the anomaly. The evolution with time of these metabolomics profiles will also considered.</brief_summary>
