	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES The aim of the study is to explore association between increased central venous pressure (CVP), Ejection Fraction (EF) and renal dysfunction (eGFR) in patients with Cardio-Renal Syndromes type 1 and 2. BACKGROUND The pathophysiology of impaired renal function in cardiovascular disease is multifactorial. Recent investigations suggest that management of patients based on low-flow theory does not lead to improved outcomes. Relative importance of right heart dysfunction (manifested as increased CVP) has not been evaluated . Precise understanding of bidirectional pathways by which the heart and kidneys influence each other is necessary to define optimal treatment strategies specific to the subtypes, as therapies directed towards one organ system may have beneficial or unfavorable effects on the other. METHODS The study is of non-experimental (observational) type, based on retrospective chart review. The patients' personal identifiers are concealed and an anonymized datasets used (unique code given to each patient, which is kept secure under the control of hospital staff).</detailed_description>
