	<brief_summary>In the case of intestinal failure with a high-output double enterostomy, the parenteral nutrition (PN) is the gold standard treatment until the surgical reestablishment of digestive continuity. PN has its own morbidity, and in the absence of expertise, the risks of infectious, mechanical, and metabolic complications are increased. Chyme reinfusion (CR) is an enteral nutritional technique which reestablishes the functional continuity of the anatomically present small bowel through an extracorporeal circulation of the chyme. In patients with intestinal failure with a temporary high-output double enterostomy, we hypothesize that CR, compared to PN will reduce post-operative complications after surgical reestablishment of digestive continuity, maintain the intestinal function including absorption, and reduce the complications during the transitional period pending the surgical reestablishment of digestive continuity.</brief_summary>
