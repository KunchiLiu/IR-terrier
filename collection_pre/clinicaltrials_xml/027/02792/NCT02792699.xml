	<brief_summary>This trial is designed to determine what effects the human body has on the investigational medicine, ABP 798, and what effects the body has on the investigational medicine after you have been given it, and if this is comparable to what is seen for the licensed medicine, rituximab, in patients with moderate or severe RA. This study will assess if the investigational medicine is safe and effective in treating moderate or severe RA compared to the licensed medicine.</brief_summary>
