	<brief_title>Online Program for Social Anxiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While there are many benefits to online programs in treating a variety of health issues (i.e., implementation in remote areas, cost-effectiveness, etc.), the primary challenge for online formats is to imitate real-life interactions while promoting a reduction in symptoms. This will be attempted in a six-month online program for social anxiety. The present study will assess the efficacy of a six-month online program through measures of social anxiety, fear of negative evaluations, unhelpful thoughts, avoidance behaviours and quality of life. This information will be collected from students at baseline and upon completion of the online program.</detailed_description>
