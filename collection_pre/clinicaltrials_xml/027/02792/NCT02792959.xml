	<detailed_description>This study evaluates the therapeutic response by modern FMRI and PET techniques with the perspective to exploit multimodal data (fusion MRI/PET). The Sponsor would like to optimize the respective performances and to define the early assessment criteria, at the first detox, of the treatment efficacy, with and without antiangiogenic agent. It is a single center evaluation of the study treatment.</detailed_description>
