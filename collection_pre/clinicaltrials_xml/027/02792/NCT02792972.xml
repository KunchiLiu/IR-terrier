	<brief_summary>Context: Research on natural products with therapeutic, analgesic or antimicrobial purpose should be encouraged to create new drugs. Acmella oleracea, typical plant of the Northern region of the country and popularly known as jambu, has aroused the interest of researchers because of its therapeutic potential. Objective: To evaluate the potential topical analgesic and antimicrobial of Acmella oleracea plant extract from the skin antisepsis in venipuncture procedures. Methods: This is a clinical, randomized, controlled trial with healthy volunteers recruited at the Clinic I of the collection of biological materials sector of the Hospital das Clinicas Samuel Libânio, in Pouso Alegre-MG. The plant extract A. oleracea manipulated with Transcutol® and 70% alcohol were used in the volunteers before the venipuncture procedure as allocation in study groups. Held collection of skin microbiota by the swab technique and the end of the venipuncture procedure was applied to the volunteer, the visual numeric scale (VNS) standard to determine the degree of pain.</brief_summary>
