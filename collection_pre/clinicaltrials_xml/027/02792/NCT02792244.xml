	<brief_summary>Previous studies show that incontinence is relatively common during pregnancy and after delivery. Experiencing incontinence during pregnancy or in the first year after delivery increases the risk of long term incontinence. There is scarce documentation of the long term prevalence of anal incontinence (AI) in Norway. This study aims to explore prevalence and risk factors for incontinence approximately six years after delivery among the 1718 who participated in two previous studies exploring the prevalence and predictors of anal incontinence in late pregnancy and during the first year after first delivery, and the effect of pelvic floor muscle exercises as treatment for anal incontinence after delivery. Increased awareness and knowledge about risk factors and long term prevalence of anal incontinence among health professionals as well as pregnant and parous women may give indications about which women to target for preventative measures to reduce the risk of new onset of postpartum AI during pregnancy and after delivery. Further, increased knowledge may aid in planning individualized follow-up during pregnancy and the first year as well as in the long term among women with existing AI symptoms.</brief_summary>
