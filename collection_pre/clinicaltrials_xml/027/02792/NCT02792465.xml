	<brief_summary>This is a phase 1 study of investigational agent CFI-402257 in patients with advanced cancer. The purpose of this study is to see how safe and tolerable CFI-402257 is in cancer patients as well as the pharmacokinetics (PK). This study is the first time that CFI-402257 is given to humans.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Investigational Drug CFI-402257 in Patients With Advanced Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CFI-402257 is an oral drug that blocks TTK protein kinase (also known as Monopolar spindle 1 [Mps1]) activity. TTK is a protein that is important in regulating cell growth, and cell death, and ensuring proper division. Many tumors are shown to make too much TTK. When there is too much TTK produced, it is believed to contribute to uncontrolled cancer cell growth and division leading to additional mutations in cancer cells. Therefore, it is believed that blocking this protein from working will lead to cancer cell death, stopping tumors from growing or shrinking them. This study will have two parts: dose escalation and dose expansion. The dose escalation part will test different dose levels of study drug in groups of patients to find the highest dose of study drug that can be given safely to patients (called maximum tolerated dose or MTD). The expansion part will further assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of the MTD found in the escalation part of the study in additional group of patients.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Have histological or cytological proof of advanced cancer that has progressed and for which there is no further standard anticancer therapy available in the opinion of the Investigator. Patients must have measurable disease as per RECIST v 1.1 guidelines. Patients must be â‰¥18 years of age. Have clinically acceptable laboratory screening results (i.e., clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) within certain limits. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Be able to swallow oral medications. Have a life expectancy of greater than 3 months. Women and men of childproducing potential must agree to use highly effective means of contraception for a specified period. A negative serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential. Have the ability to understand the requirements of the study, provide written informed consent which includes authorization for release of protected health information, abide by the study restrictions, provide archived tissue if available for biomarker studies, provide a blood sample for genetic testing and agree to return for the required assessments. Women who are pregnant or nursing. Have received radiotherapy, chemotherapy, biological therapy, or investigational treatment less than four weeks (six weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to first dose of study drug or have not recovered from all acute toxicities from prior treatments and those deemed by the Investigator not to affect safety assessment. Patients who have received growth factors within 14 days prior to initiation of dosing of CFI402257 or who will require ongoing treatment with growth factors throughout the duration of the trial. Have active, acute, or clinically significant chronic infections. Have uncontrolled severe hypertension. Have symptomatic congestive heart failure. Have active angina pectoris or recent myocardial infarction (within 6 months). Have chronic atrial fibrillation or QTc of greater than 470 msec. Have had major surgery within 21 days of starting therapy. Have additional uncontrolled serious medical or psychiatric illness. Have any medical condition that would impair the administration of oral agents including significant bowel resection, inflammatory bowel disease or uncontrolled nausea or vomiting. Known central nervous system metastasis. Patients being treated with full dose warfarin are excluded. Patients being treated with the following drugs are excluded: Alfentanil, Pimozide, Cyclosporine, Quinidine, Digoxin, Sirolimus, Dihydroergotamine, Tacrolimus, Ergotamine, Warfarin, Fentanyl.</criteria>
