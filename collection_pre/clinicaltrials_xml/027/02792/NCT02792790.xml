	<brief_summary>The investigators will prospectively evaluate tissue samples obtained from patients undergoing carpal tunnel release surgery for amyloid in the soft tissue that is removed. Patients who have tissue that stains positive for amyloid will undergo cardiac testing to look for evidence of cardiac involvement.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Amyloid Cardiomyopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since the 1970s, the connection between amyloidosis and carpal tunnel syndrome has been described, with tenosynovial tissue staining positive for amyloid fibril deposition. Up to 30% of patients in prior studies with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome have biopsy tissue that stains positive for amyloid deposition. However, the prevalence of cardiac involvement at the time of carpal tunnel syndrome surgery has not been established. Furthermore, the role of TTR kinetic stability in the disease progression of amyloidosis is unclear. Diagnosing TTR amyloidosis at the time of carpal tunnel involvement could lead to an earlier identification of the disease at a stage where the cardiomyopathy may be occult or less advanced. In addition, abnormal TTR kinetics may even precede tissue deposition in the flexor tendon retinaculum. As several emerging pharmacological strategies are in development that may slow or even halt TTR amyloidosis, earlier diagnosis is advantageous. Identification and implementation of therapy for prevention or early disease treatment may alter the natural history of this progressive systemic disease.</detailed_description>
