	<brief_summary>The simple head extension is recommended for optimization of glottic visualization during awake orotracheal intubation whith fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) . However, no study to date has conﬁrmed its superiority over "snifﬁng position" . In a prospective, randomized study, the authors compared the snifﬁng position with simple head extension in awake orotracheal Intubation</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing the "snifﬁng Position" With Simple Head Extension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study included sixty obese patients with anticipated difficult airways.The snifﬁng position was obtained by placement of a 7-cm cushion under the head of the patient. The extension position was obtained by simple head extension. The head position was randomized as follows: group A was in the snifﬁng position ;group B was in the extension position . Glottic exposure was assessed by the Cormack scale. Randomization was performed by placing index cards with the letter A or B into100 sealed envelopes (more than the number of study patients), which were then placed in random order. At the time of a patient's enrollment, the next available envelope was placed with the patient's chart. At the time of intubation, the envelope was opened and the sequence was thus determined.</detailed_description>
