	<brief_summary>In normal physiology, glucagon from pancreatic alpha cells plays an important role in maintaining glucose homeostasis via its regulatory effect on hepatic glucose production. Patients with type 2 diabetes exhibit elevated plasma glucagon levels in the fasting state, and in response to ingestion of glucose or a mixed meal.glucagon, glucagon concentrations fail to decrease appropriately and may even increase. This diabetic hyperglucagonaemia may therefore contribute importantly to the hyperglycaemia of the patients. Several glucose-lowering treatment modalities have been shown to affect glucagon levels in patients with type 2 diabetes, but the role of glucagon in the glucose-lowering effects of these treatment modalities has been difficult to discern. By using a glucagon receptor antagonist (GRA) the investigators will exploit glucagon receptor antagonism to delineate the role of glucagon during treatment with sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, which have been shown to increase and decrease plasma glucagon levels, respectively.</brief_summary>
