	<brief_summary>Objective Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is performed for resolving cholestasis by sphincterotomy and/or stone extraction and is done with deep sedation or general anesthesia. The investigators primary outcome was to evaluate the effects of the depth of anesthesia on oxidative stres provided via Bispectral Index (BIS) monitorisation during the ERCP procedure by analyzing the biochemical parameters. And their secondary outcome was the effects of anesthesia depth on propofol consumption and postoperative sedation status.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does the Use of Bispectral Index Reduce the Oxidative Stress in Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>50 patients undergoing ERCP procedure were randomly allocated in two groups. Propofol was given to provide the patients Ramsey sedation scale as 3 and 4 in Group R (n=25) patients whereas it was given to Group B (n=25) patients to provide BIS values between 65 to 85. The levels of total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS), and Oxidative stres index (OSI) were measured. Hemodynamic signs, propofol consumption, postoperative recovery time were recorded.</detailed_description>
