	<brief_summary>Aim of this study is to evaluate in a population of old osteoporotic chronic kidney disease females the effect of denosumab: - on bone mineral density (femoral T-score) at 24 months - on bone mineral density evolution (femoral T-score) after 24 months of follow-up - on bone mineral density evolution (lumbar T-score) after 24 months of follow-up - on coronary and abdominal aorta calcification scores evolution after 24 months of follow-up - on parameters of bone remodelling (OPG, RANKL, sclerostin, DKK-1), of mineral and calcium metabolism (FGF23 Ct, Klotho, PTH, 25(OH) vitamin D3, phosphorus, calcium, bone alklaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, CTX), of inflammation (CRP) after 24 months of follow-up - on cardiovascular morbidity (cardiovascular events) and mortality after 24 months of follow-up - the tolerance after 24 months of follow-up</brief_summary>
