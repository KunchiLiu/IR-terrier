Presence of acute or chronic illness or history of chronic illness sufficient to invalidate the volunteer's participation in the trial or make it unnecessarily hazardous. 3. Impaired gastrointestinal, endocrine, thyroid, hepatic, cardiovascular, respiratory, haematological, renal or neurological function, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, or history of any psychotic mental illness. 4. Surgery (e.g. stomach bypass) or medical condition that might affect absorption of medicines. 5. Presence or history of severe adverse reaction to any drug. 6. Use of any prescription or overthecounter medicine during the 14 days before the first dose of trial medication, or intention to use any medicine during the trial, with the exception of short courses of medication considered by the investigator not to interfere with the safety of the subject or the integrity of the trial data (such as acetaminophen (paracetamol)). 7. Current use of any herbal remedy or nutritional supplement, or intention to use any such product during the study. 8. Participation in another clinical trial of a new chemical entity or a prescription medicine within the 3 months prior to the first dose. 9. Previous participation in this trial or any other clinical trial of an oxytocin receptor antagonist. 10. Presence or history of drug or alcohol abuse, or intake of more than 21 units of alcohol weekly or more than 5 cigarettes daily. 11. Blood pressure and heart rate in supine position at the screening examination outside the ranges 90130 mm Hg systolic, 5090 mm Hg diastolic; heart rate 5090 beats/min, unless judged not clinically significant by an investigator. 12. Possibility that the volunteer will not cooperate with the requirements of the protocol. 13. Evidence of drug abuse on urine testing. 14. Positive test for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV1 or HIV2. 15. Loss of more than 400 mL blood during the 3 months prior to the first dose, eg as a blood donor. 16. Objection by General Practitioner (GP) to volunteer entering trial. 17.
