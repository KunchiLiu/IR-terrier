	<brief_summary>According to a study of the DREES (Direction de la Recherche, des Etudes, de l'Evaluation et des Statistiques), in 2013, nearly 229 000 abortions were performed in France, an increasing number. The success rate of drug abortion before 49 days of amenorrhea, defined by the National Health Autority as a complete abortion not requiring surgery, varies from 92 to 98% depending on the pregnancy term and the dose used. The control visit is performed between the 14th day and the 21th day post abortion. Its role is to monitor the effectiveness of the method, to verify absence of complication and to better adapt contraception to prevent another unwanted pregnancy. The choice of the method is left to the physician's discretion: β-HCG dosage, pelvic or transvaginal ultrasound. In the Orthogenic Departement of the Croix-Rousse Hospital Lyon, France, the method performed during the control visit is transvaginal ultrasound. To simplify the monitoring of drug abortion, a urine pregnancy test would be an attractive alternative to transvaginal ultrasound: simplicity of use, speed, ease of interpretation and low cost. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic value of urine pregnancy test CHECK TOP compared to transvaginal ultrasound in monitoring the outcome of drug abortion during the control visit. This is a monocentric observational study.</brief_summary>
