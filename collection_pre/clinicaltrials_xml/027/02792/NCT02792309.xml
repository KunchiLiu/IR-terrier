	<brief_title>Impact Evaluation of MotherWise Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), is conducting an evaluation of healthy marriage and relationship education (HMRE) programs. Mathematica was awarded a contract by ACF to conduct the evaluation of selected programs/grantees.This segment of the larger evaluation will focus on the University of Denver's MotherWise program. The Mother Wise program will offer relationship education and other supports to low-income women expecting a baby. The program will have three core components: (1) 18 hours of core workshop sessions using the Within My Reach relationship education curriculum supplemented with content on mother-infant relationships; (2) case management services; and (3) optional relationship education workshops for couples. The evaluation will test the effect of this full package of services on mothers' relationship outcomes, as well as other outcomes related to child well-being, such as co-parenting and father involvement. If feasible, the evaluation will also examine some measures available through hospital records, such as birth weight. Mother Wise will enroll women who are expecting a baby and receiving prenatal care services through the Denver Health hospital system. Women will be recruited for the evaluation primarily from the clinic at which they receive prenatal services. Control group members will not be eligible for Mother Wise but will be eligible for other services available in the community. To document the outcomes of study participants, survey data will be collected at two time points: (1) a baseline survey administered at study enrollment and (2) a follow-up survey conducted about a year later. Surveys will be conducted by staff at Mathematica's Survey Operations Center using computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI). Survey data may be supplemented with administrative records data from the Denver Health system.</detailed_description>
