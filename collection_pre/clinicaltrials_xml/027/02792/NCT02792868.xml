	<brief_summary>Study a sample of patients in primary prevention, moderate cardiovascular risk (n = 83 patients), with normal, non-diabetic renal function. The investigators quantify the phophocalcic intake and excretion, realizing a food examination and a urine collection of 24 particular. The investigators will measure plasma levels of FGF23 serum calcium, phosphatemia, the investigators will calculate the tubular reabsorption of phosphate. The investigators will conduct a quantitative assessment of coronary calcification by a non-injected CT scan, measuring semi automated way Agatston calcium score. There will be an analysis of collinearity. An adjustment will be made for confounding variables in a generalized linear regression model.</brief_summary>
