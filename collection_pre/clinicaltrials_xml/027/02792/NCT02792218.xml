	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Ofatumumab Compared to Teriflunomide in Patients With Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active comparator-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study with variable treatment duration in approximately 900 patients with relapsing MS. The maximal treatment duration in the study for an individual patient will be 2.5 years. Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either experimental ofatumumab subcutaneous (sc) injections every 4 weeks or active comparator teriflunomide orally once daily. In order to blind for the different formulations, double-dummy masking will be used i.e. all patients will take injections (containing either active ofatumumab or placebo) and oral capsules (containing either active teriflunomide or placebo).</detailed_description>
