	<brief_summary>This pilot research trial studies magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cardio (heart)-pulmonary (lung) exercise testing in evaluating exercise intolerance in patients with stage I-III breast cancer after treatment with chemotherapy drugs called anthracyclines. Anthracyclines are related with heart problems, cardiac abnormalities, bone and muscle dysfunction. Patients with breast cancer who are exposed to anthracycline drugs may also experience progressive fatigue and exercise intolerance which may limit daily activities and is an important barrier for patients returning to work. Using MRI and cardio-pulmonary exercise testing (CPET) may help doctors understand the causes of fatigue and exercise intolerance in patients receiving anthracycline chemotherapy and this may also allow doctors to plan better treatments to protect patients' heart, cardiovascular system, bone and muscle function.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the feasibility of performing upright treadmill cardio-pulmonary exercise stress testing utilizing magnetic resonance imaging. II. To determine the reproducibility of measures of peak oxygen uptake (V02) and cardiac output as well as arterio-venous oxygen difference (A-V02) difference in survivors of breast cancer treatment and control participants. OUTLINE: Patients undergo CPET using a one-way breathing mask in 2 separate days 1-2 weeks apart. Patients also undergo MRI before and within 60 seconds after exercising.</detailed_description>
