	<brief_summary>The high doses of interferon α-2b therapy in patients with melanomas of the skin may induced retinopathy, especially in the patients with hypertension or diabetes, so these patients should be followed up after treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characteristic Analysis of Retinopathy Associated With High Doses of Interferon α-2b Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with melanomas of the skin whose tumors have been resected completely were collected. The detailed ocular examinations including intraocular pressure, slit lamp microscope, indirect ophthalmoscope and color fundus photography were done before the induction therapy, 2 weeks after the induction therapy, after the whole course of induction therapy and each month in the maintenance treatment period. Fundus examinations were carried out by experienced ocular fundus doctors and the retinopathy characteristics were recorded.</detailed_description>

Must complete all primary therapy (wide excision with or without lymphadenectomy). 1. Mucous membrane or ocular melanoma. 2. Any evidence of distant metastasis (CTscan of brain, Chest X ray or CT, abdominal ultrasound or CT and ultrasound of regional lymph nodes at screening). 3. Patients with retinopathy on baseline fundoscopic examination at the start of interferon therapy. 4. History of any other malignancy within the last ten years (except basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix). 5.
