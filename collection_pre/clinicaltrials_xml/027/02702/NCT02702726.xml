	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to compare the effects of dietary fats, ingested in two physical forms, on acute energy balance, appetitive, and glycemic responses of healthy normal (BMI 18-24.9 kgm-2) or overweight (BMI&gt;25kgm-2) adults.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This will be a randomised, crossover study. Randomisation will be performed with an online randomisation software (www.randomizer.org). Participants will be screened (1 screening visit) and attend five test visits conducted in a whole room calorimeter (WRC). During each test visit, participants will arrive at the laboratory after an overnight fast, enter the WRC and rest for 15 minutes in a supine position,have their resting energy expenditure (REE) measured for 30 minutes and consume congee and juice alone(control), or with one of the 4 dietary fats: sunflower oil (SO) or gel (SG) and coconut oil (CO) or gel (CG) (total 5 test visits). Post-meal energy expenditure, fat oxidation, glycemia and appetite (visual analog scales) will be measured continuously for 3 hours in WRC, followed by a meal challenge where participants will eat until sated. Participants will return and repeat the protocol until all fat types and forms are completed.</detailed_description>
