	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study being conducted as a postmarketing requirement to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to evaluate whether there is a lower starting dosage of lenvatinib other than the approved 24 mg once daily (QD) that provides comparable efficacy but has a better safety profile in participants with RR-DTC with radiographic evidence of disease progression within the prior 12 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Trial of Lenvatinib (E7080) in Subjects With Iodine-131 Refractory Differentiated Thyroid Cancer to Evaluate Whether an Oral Starting Dose of 20 mg or 14 mg Daily Will Provide Comparable Efficacy to a 24 mg Starting Dose, But Have a Better Safety Profile</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consists of 2 phases, the Prerandomization Phase and the Randomization Phase. The Prerandomization Phase will last no longer than 28 days and will include a Screening Period to establish protocol eligibility and a Baseline Period to confirm eligibility and establish disease characteristics prior to randomization and treatment. The Randomization Phase will consist of a Treatment Period and a Follow-up Period. It will begin at the time of randomization of the first participant and will consist of 28-day blinded study treatment cycles. The End of Study will occur at the end of the Randomization Phase, which is defined as when the last participant enrolled completes the Week 24 tumor assessments or discontinues study treatment if before Week 24. Participants will be randomly assigned to treatment with 1 of 3 blinded dosages of lenvatinib in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive lenvatinib 24 mg, 20 mg, or 14 mg orally QD. Dose reductions will occur in succession based on the previous dose level (24, 20, 14, 10, 8, or 4 mg QD). Once the dose has been reduced, it may not be increased at a later date.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of one of the following differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) subtypes: 1. Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) Follicular variant Variants (including but not limited to tall cell, columnar cell, cribriformmorular, solid, oxyphil, Warthin'slike, trabecular, tumor with nodular fasciitislike stroma, Hürthle cell variant of papillary carcinoma, poorly differentiated) 2. Follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) Hurthle cell Clear cell Insular 2. Measurable disease meeting the following criteria and confirmed by central radiographic review: 1. At least 1 lesion of ≥1.0 cm in the longest diameter for a nonlymph node or ≥1.5 cm in the shortaxis diameter for a lymph node that is serially measurable according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) using computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI). If there is only 1 target lesion and it is a nonlymph node, it should have a longest diameter of ≥1.5 cm. 2. Lesions that have had external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or locoregional therapies such as radiofrequency (RF) ablation must show evidence of progressive disease based on RECIST 1.1 to be deemed a target lesion. 3. Participants must show evidence of disease progression within 12 months (an additional month will be allowed to accommodate actual dates of performance of screening scans, ie, within ≤13 months) prior to signing informed consent, according to RECIST 1.1 assessed and confirmed by central radiographic review of CT and/or MRI scans. 4. Participants must be Iodine131 refractory/resistant as defined by at least one of the following: 1. One or more measurable lesions that do not demonstrate iodine uptake on any radioiodine scan. 2. One or more measurable lesions that have progressed according to RECIST 1.1 within 12 months (an additional month will be allowed to accommodate actual dates of performance of screening scans, ie, within ≤13 months) after Iodine131 therapy, despite demonstration of radioiodine avidity at the time of that treatment by pre or posttreatment scanning. These participants must not be eligible for possible curative surgery. 3. Cumulative activity of Iodine131 of &gt;600 mCi or 22 gigabecquerels (GBq), with the last dose administered at least 6 months prior to study entry. 5. Participants with known brain metastases who have completed whole brain radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery or complete surgical resection, will be eligible if they have remained clinically stable, asymptomatic, and off steroids for one month. 6. Participants must be receiving thyroxine suppression therapy and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) should not be elevated (TSH should be ≤5.50 mcIU/ML). When tolerated by the participant, thyroxine dose should be changed to achieve TSH suppression (TSH &lt;0.50 mcIU/ML) and this dose may be changed concurrently upon starting study drug treatment. 7. All chemotherapy or radiationrelated toxicities must have resolved to Grade &lt;2 severity per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.03), except alopecia and infertility. 8. Participants must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2. 9. Adequately controlled blood pressure (BP) with or without antihypertensive medications, defined as BP ≤150/90 mmHg at Screening and no change in antihypertensive medications within 1 week prior to Cycle 1/Day 1. 10. Adequate renal function defined as calculated creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min per the Cockcroft and Gault formula. 11. Adequate bone marrow function: 1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1500/mm3 (≥1.5 × 103/uL) 2. Platelets ≥100,000/mm3 (≥100 × 109/L) 3. Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL 12. Adequate blood coagulation function as evidenced by an International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤1.5. 13. Adequate liver function: 1. Bilirubin ≤1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) except for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia or Gilbert's syndrome. 2. Alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤3 × ULN (≤5 × ULN if participant has liver metastases). If alkaline phosphatase is &gt;3 × ULN (in absence of liver metastases) or &gt;5 × ULN (in presence of liver metastases) AND the participant also is known to have bone metastases, the liverspecific alkaline phosphatase must be separated from the total and used to assess the liver function instead of total alkaline phosphatase. 14. Males or females age ≥18 years at the time of informed consent. 15. Females must not be lactating or pregnant at Screening or Baseline (as documented by a negative betahuman chorionic gonadotropin [BhCG] test with a minimum sensitivity of 25 IU/L or equivalent units of BhCG. A separate baseline assessment is required if a negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours before the first dose of study drug. 16. All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate age group and without other known or suspected cause) or have been sterilized surgically (ie, bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, all with surgery at least 1 month before dosing). 17.

Participants who have received any anticancer treatment within 21 days or any investigational agent within 30 days (or 5 halflives) prior to the first dose of study drug and should have recovered from any toxicity related to previous anticancer treatment. This does not apply to the use of TSH suppressive thyroid hormone therapy. 6. Major surgery within 3 weeks prior to randomization or elective surgery scheduled to performed during the study. 7. Participants having &gt;1+ proteinuria on urine dipstick testing will undergo 24hour urine collection for quantitative assessment of proteinuria.
