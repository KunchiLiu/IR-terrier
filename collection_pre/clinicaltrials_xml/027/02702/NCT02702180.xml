	<brief_summary>This study evaluates inhaled molgramostim (recombinant human (rh) Granulocyte Macrophage-Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF)) in the treatment of autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis patients. A third of the patients will receive inhaled molgramostim daily for 24 weeks, a third will receive inhaled molgramostim every other day for 24 weeks and a third will receive inhaled matching placebo for 24 weeks</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Inhaled Molgramostim (rhGM-CSF) in Autoimmune Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis (aPAP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre clinical trial investigating efficacy and safety of inhaled molgramostim (rhGM-CSF) in autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (aPAP) patients. The primary objective is efficacy on the Alveolar-arterial oxygen difference after 24-weeks treatment. Secondary objectives are requirement for, and time to, Whole Lung Lavage (WLL), effect on pulmonary function, tolerance to exercise, effect on dyspnea, cough and Quality of Life, and effect on computed tomography (CT) scoring. Number of reported adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, and adverse drug reactions will be monitored. The trial will include two phases; a Double-blind treatment period consisting of up to eight trial visits (Screening, Baseline, and at Weeks 4,8,12, 16, 20 and 24 after randomisation) and a Follow-up period consisting of up to five trial visits (at Weeks 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48 post-treatment). In the Double-blind treatment period, eligible subjects will be randomised to treatment for up to 24 weeks with either: 1) inhaled molgramostim (300 µg) once daily, 2) inhaled molgramostim (300 µg) and matching placebo administered intermittently (seven days on and seven days off) or 3) inhaled placebo once daily. During the Double-blind treatment period, WLL may be applied as rescue therapy in case of significant clinical worsening. Brief risk assessment: There is currently no approved pharmacological treatment for patients with PAP, and therefore an unmet need for further treatment modalities exists. Results from pre-clinical studies with inhaled molgramostim nebuliser solution showed the expected pharmacological effects on white blood cell (WBC) populations locally and systemically in line with observed effects after IV administration of molgramostim. No severe, serious or dose-limiting AEs were observed in the first clinical study in humans (MOL-001). The most common AE was cough, which was reported at a similar incidence for the molgramostim nebuliser solution and placebo. Increases of WBC populations in the blood consistent with the known mechanism of action were observed; most of which were considered not clinically significant. Only two cases (total WBC increased and eosinophilia) were reported as AEs. No development of anti-drug antibodies was observed.</detailed_description>
