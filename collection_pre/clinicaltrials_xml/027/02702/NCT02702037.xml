	<brief_summary>The novelty with the OPEN study is to evaluate the effects of the simple sit-to-stand exercise during routine care, in combination with an oral protein-rich supplement, on functional status and independence in frail older persons. In this study we will also explore the experiences among older persons in the intervention group as wells as among staff of promoting the sit-to-stand exercise and nutritional supplement to gain knowledge for implementation as a daily routine in nursing homes across Sweden. Hypothesis The main hypothesis of the OPEN study is that physical exercise performed as a daily routine along with an oral protein-rich supplement, will result in improved functional status and independence in everyday life activities and thereby enhance health-related quality of life in older persons living in nursing homes. The primary outcome measure for functional status will be the number of sit-to-stands that the participant is able to complete in 30 seconds. Specific aims Aim I: To study the effects of the sit-to-stand exercise combined with an oral protein-rich supplement on functional and nutritional status, and health-related quality of life, and the frequency and incidence of falls, pressure ulcers and incontinence in older persons living in nursing homes. Furthermore, the cost effectiveness of the combination of the sit to stand exercise and oral protein-rich supplement vs. the control group will also be examined. Aim II: To describe the older persons' perceptions of daily being offered to conduct the sit-to-stand exercise and to drink the nutritional supplement. Aim III: To describe staff's perceptions of supporting the sit-to-stand exercise and the nutritional supplement with older persons living in nursing homes.</brief_summary>
