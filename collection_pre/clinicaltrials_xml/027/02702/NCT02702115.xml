	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability of ascending doses of SB-318. SB-318 is an intravenously delivered Zinc Finger Nuclease (ZFN) Therapeutic for genome editing. It inserts a correct copy of the α-L-iduronidase (IDUA) gene into the Albumin locus in hepatocytes with the goal of lifelong therapeutic production of the IDUA enzyme.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ascending Dose Study of Genome Editing by the Zinc Finger Nuclease (ZFN) Therapeutic SB-318 in Subjects With MPS I</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objectives of the study are to provide long term expression of IDUA and improve the current clinical outcome of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) therapy in subjects with attenuated MPS I, a recessive lysosomal storage disorder that results from mutations in the gene encoding IDUA. SB-318 is a therapeutic for ZFN-mediated genome editing which will be delivered by adeno-associated virus (AAV)-derived vectors. SB-318 is intended to function by placement of the corrective copy of the IDUA transgene into the genome of the subject's own hepatocytes, under the control of the highly expressed endogenous albumin locus, and is expected to provide permanent, liver-specific expression of iduronidase for the lifetime of an MPS I patient.</detailed_description>
