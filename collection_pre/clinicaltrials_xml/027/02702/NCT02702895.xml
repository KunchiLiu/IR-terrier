	<brief_summary>MTN-032 is an exploratory sub-study of the ASPIRE and HOPE trials that will utilize qualitative In-Depth Interviews (IDIs) and Focus-Group Discussions (FGDs) to explore socio-contextual and trial specific issues which affected participants' adherence to the dapivirine vaginal ring (VR).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of ASPIRE and HOPE Adherence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The MTN-032 trial is a two-phase exploratory sub-study of the ASPIRE and HOPE trials. A sample of up to 224 women who participated in ASPIRE will be selected for participation in Phase 1 of this study. Approximately 84 former Phase 1 participants who participated in HOPE will be selected for participation in Phase 2. There will be approximately 4-6 months allotted for recruitment and follow-up at each site for each phase. MTN-032, an exploratory study, is primarily designed to identify factors that may have affected participant adherence to study product in ASPIRE and HOPE. MTN-032 will also elicit perceptions about various participant engagement and adherence promotion interventions implemented in ASPIRE and may also explore the potential use of incentives to promote adherence to VR use. MTN-032 will use study product adherence results from ASPIRE and HOPE, qualitative in-depth interviews (IDI) and focus group discussions (FGD) to explore study product adherence behaviors and strategies used to overcome adherence challenges. An in-depth understanding of the various socio-behavioral factors that contribute to product use adherence may assist in the interpretation of past and ongoing study results and inform implementation of future studies.</detailed_description>
