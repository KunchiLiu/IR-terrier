	<brief_summary>Randomized Controlled study to compare the effectiveness of two different treatment approaches using a new moldable beta-tricalcium phosphate(TCP) bone graft material in ridge preservation of an atraumatic extraction socket site compared to allograft with collagen plug.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of Ridge Preservation Using Moldable Beta-tricalcium Phosphate Bone Grafting System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Provision of informed consent At least 18 years old In need of one posterior tooth, excluding third molar molars, planned for extraction and replacement with a dental implant (If the subject requires two adjacent socket preservation, they can still be enrolled in the study but only one site will be used for the study) Intact ridge as verified with conebeam CT scan At least one natural tooth adjacent to the study site present. Insufficient interocclusal space to allow for implant supported prosthesis Dehiscence or fenestration identified at the time of reviewing CBCT. Nontreated caries or uncontrolled periodontal disease present affecting the teeth in adjacent to study teeth. Any of natural teeth adjacent to the study site presents active periapical endodontic lesion ("active periapical endodontic lesion" will be determined per consultation by endodontics specialist). Adjacent tooth (mesial and distal) to study site was extracted within last 6 months Adjacent teeth (or tooth) to study site with significant soft tissue loss Smoker using more than 10 cigarettes or equivalent per day Smokeless tobacco use or ecigarette use Current alcohol or drug abuser Systemic or local disease or condition that would compromise postoperative healing and/or osseointegration e.g. uncontrolled diabetes Need for systemic corticosteroids or any other medication that would influence postoperative healing and/or osseointegration Pregnancy, as indicated by positive serum human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) test result. Unable or unwilling to return for followup visits for a period of 5 months Unlikely to be able to comply with study procedures according to Investigators judgement Subject in other clinical trials</criteria>
