	<brief_summary>A prospective randomised controlled trial involving patients undergoing hip arthroscopy. Participants were randomised to receiving either Fascia Iliaca Compartment Block (FICB) or Local Anaesthetic Infiltration (LAI) of the portal tracts with local anaesthetic. Supplemental analgesia was also used in both groups on an on-demand basis. Pain level is assessed at 1,3,6, and 24 hours post surgery. The primary outcome measure was the post-operative level of pain as assessed by Numeric Pain Score 6 hours after surgery. Secondary outcome measures were the frequency and the dose of morphine and other medications consumed at 1 and 24 hours after surgery as well as any other adverse events relating to pain or medications used for pain relief in both the groups.</brief_summary>
