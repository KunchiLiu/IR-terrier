	<brief_summary>This cross-over intervention study aims to investigate the effect of two doses of thylakoids to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) on glucose and insulin homeostasis as well as appetite regulating hormones in healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Two Doses of Thylakoids on OGTT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A minimum of twenty healthy volunteers are recruited to participate in an OGTT at three different occasions separated by one week. At two of the occasions a green leaf extract, thylakoids, is added to a glucose solution; 5 gram or 10 gram in randomized order. The third occasion, without added thylakoids, serve as control. Blood samples are taken fasting and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes after the glucose load. Blood samples are analysed for p-glucose, p-insulin, p-C-peptide, p-ghrelin, p-CCK and p-GLP-1.</detailed_description>
