	<brief_title>Preventive EXACYL® on Perioperative Bleeding During Orthognathism of Maxillary Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical value of preventive treatment EXACYL® on bleeding during surgery to orthognathism. Our hypothesis is that this preventive treatment is not enough reduces bleeding to cause a change in patient management (count additional blood count, extra padding, transfusion). Prospective equivalence trial type controlled by two parallel group, randomized, triple-blind (patient, surgical team, anesthesia team). - EXACYL® Group: 1 syringe 1g EXACYL® on one hour + 1 syringe 1g EXACYL® on 8 hours - Control group: 1 syringe 30 mL of saline on one hour + 1 syringe 30 mL saline on 8 hours Main criteria is amount of blood during the entire hospitalization: bleeding during surgery completed in the amount of blood present in the suction drains and nasogastric tube until ablation thereof.</detailed_description>
