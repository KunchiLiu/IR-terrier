	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of mechanical stimulation on mastectomy scars in: (i) alleviating scar appearance - pigmentation, vascularity, pliability and thickness, (ii) reducing shoulder morbidities, (iii) improving arm functions, and (iv) enhancing quality of life, in women with breast cancer after mastectomy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Mechanical Stimulation on Mastectomy Scars</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Breast cancer is common among women. After surgical interventions like mastectomies, women with breast cancer may suffer physical, emotional and psychosocial complications. Evidence suggests that comprehensive physiotherapy program, including patient education, manual techniques, therapeutic exercises and compression bandaging, is effective in managing the above complications. Scarring was frequently overlooked in past studies. Besides cosmetic issues, a post mastectomy scar may cause adverse physical, functional, and psychological outcomes. The effects of mechanical stimulation on mastectomy scars have not been well investigated yet. Objectives: To investigate the efficacy of mechanical stimulation in: (i) alleviating scar appearance - pigmentation, vascularity, pliability and thickness, (ii) reducing shoulder morbidities, (iii) improving arm functions, and (iv) enhancing quality of life, in women with breast cancer after mastectomy. Setting: Out-patient physiotherapy breast care clinic at the Hong Kong Queen Elizabeth Hospital Participants: One hundred and eight women with breast cancer after mastectomy in recent 6 weeks will be recruited. Methodology: An assessor-blind, randomized controlled trial will be conducted. 108 women with breast cancer after mastectomy will be recruited from the breast care clinic of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital. They will be randomly allocated by block randomization method into either the mechanical stimulation group (n= 54) or conventional treatment group (n=54). Both study groups will receive an educational session before commencement of the program. Twelve sessions of 40-minute remedial exercises, 5-minute warm up and 5-minute cool down exercises will be provided within a 6-week period (i.e., two sessions per week) to all subjects. For the mechanical stimulation group, a ten-minute mechanical stimulation program will be provided. For the conventional treatment group, no mechanical stimulation will be given. Primary outcomes include scar evaluations by the Vancouver Scar Scale and spectrophotometry. Secondary outcomes are composite measurements of shoulder morbidities, including numeric pain rating scale (NPS), shoulder range of movement and hand grip strength; arm function as evaluated by the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH-HKPWH) questionnaire; and quality of life as measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Breast Cancer (FACT-B). Outcome assessments at baseline, immediately after the 6-week program, and 3-month follow-up periods will be conducted by blinded assessors at the breast care clinic. Data Analysis: The results will be analyzed using two-way repeated measures analysis of variance with Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 21.0. Alpha level will be set at 0.05. Potential Clinical Significance of Study: Improvement of physiotherapy in scar management might potentially improve scar appearance - pigmentation, vascularity, pliability and thickness, decrease shoulder morbidities, improve upper limb functions, and enhance quality of life for women with breast cancer after mastectomy. If the mechanical stimulation protocol is proven to be effective, it will bring about significant advances in physiotherapy practice in post-mastectomy care in an evidence-based manner.</detailed_description>
