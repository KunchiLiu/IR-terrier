	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to find markers that might help predict why some patients with monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) develop multiple myeloma, while others do not. Markers that will be studied may include participant's age, level of proteins in blood and urine, percent of abnormal blood cells in the bone marrow, genes in the abnormal blood cells, and bone abnormalities.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Visits: If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, every 6 months for 3 years: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be collected for biomarker and routine tests and to check the status of the disease. - A 24 hour urine sample will be collected for routine tests. - If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have a bone marrow biopsy and aspiration, PET/CT scan, and/or MRI. This may be done, for example, if participant is not feeling well or if there is a concern that the disease might be developing into multiple myeloma. One (1) time a year for 3 years, participant will have x-rays to check the status of the disease if the doctor thinks it is needed. Length of Study: Participant will be taken off study if they decide to receive chemotherapy or other treatments for the disease during the first 3 years or if they are unable to follow directions. Participant will enter the follow-up period early if the disease gets worse. End-of-Study Visit: After 3 years on study, the following tests and procedures will be performed: - Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be collected for routine tests, biomarker tests, and to check the status of the disease. - A 24 hour urine sample will be collected for routine tests. - Participant will have a bone marrow biopsy and aspiration to check the status of the disease and for biomarker testing. - Participant will have x-rays to check the status of the disease. - If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have a PET/CT scan and/or MRI. Long-Term Follow-Up: At least 1 time every 6 to 12 months after 3 years on study: - Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be collected for routine tests and to check the status of the disease. - A 24 hour urine sample will be collected for routine tests. - If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have a PET/CT scan, MRI, x-rays, and/or bone marrow biopsy and aspiration. If the disease gets worse during the 3-year study period: - At least 1 time every 6 to 12 months, the study staff will call and ask how participant is doing or they will be asked these questions at their regular clinic visits. These calls should last about 15-20 minutes. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker tests. - Participant will have a bone marrow aspiration for biomarker tests. This is an investigational study. Up to 200 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
