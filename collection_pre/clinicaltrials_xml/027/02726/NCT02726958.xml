	<brief_summary>Stress hyperglycaemia is a well-known risk factor of postoperative morbidity and mortality in cardiac surgery. Recently, several authors have reported that increased blood glucose (BG) variability could worsen the prognosis in this population.The transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a low invasive procedure proposed as an alternative technique to aortic valve replacement surgery in high-risk patients. The aim of this study is to describe the incidence of stress hyperglycaemia and assess whether BG variability could impact the outcome of patients undergoing TAVI.</brief_summary>
