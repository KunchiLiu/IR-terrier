	<brief_title>Computerized Cognitive Training in Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed investigation will be the first to pit two software packages against each other to evaluate the relative efficacy and feasibility of their use among patients with epilepsy. Pharmacotherapy fails to control seizures in approximately 30% of patients. Use of non-pharmacologic interventions, such as cognitive rehabilitation, has shown some benefit for improving cognitive functions and reducing mood symptoms. Each of the computer exercises employ a set of stimuli that are generalizable and mimic real-world experiences.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Documented diagnosis of epilepsy based on medical records. The records will be reviewed by the PI and the approved study personnel to confirm that a diagnosis of epilepsy has been made. Must own a computer or have access to the internet. Full Scale IQ &lt; 80, as assessed by the WASIII. History of chronic progressive neurologic or neurodegenerative illnesses (e.g., Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, dementia, primary or metastatic malignancy). Patients with headache or migraine are not excluded. History of Axis I psychiatric illness with psychotic features. (e.g., schizophrenia). Patients with depression or anxiety (treated or untreated) without psychotic features are not excluded. Visual or auditory impairment, which precludes participation in part, or all of the testing. English as a first language will not be required, but participants must have either received some of their schooling in English or used English in their work for &gt;10 years.</criteria>
