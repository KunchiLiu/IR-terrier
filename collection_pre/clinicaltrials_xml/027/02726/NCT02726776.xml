	<brief_summary>Suspension syndrome refers to a potentially life-threatening condition that can occur in unconscious persons after prolonged suspension in a harness. To date, our understanding of the pathophysiology and appropriate treatment is based primarily on case reports and expert opinion. The main pathophysiological hypothesis implicates blood pooling in the lower extremity and lack of return via muscle pumping. However, a recent French study could not support this hypothesis. Other mechanisms, such as a central vagal reflex may play a role in the pathophysiology of suspension syndrome. The aim of this study is to better understand the pathophysiological basis of suspension syndrome and to develop practical recommendations for prevention and treatment.</brief_summary>
