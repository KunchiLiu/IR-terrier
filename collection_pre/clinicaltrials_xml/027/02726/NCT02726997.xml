	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety of giving the combination of MEDI4736 (durvalumab), carboplatin, and paclitaxel to patients with high-grade epithelial non-mucinous ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. Researchers also want to learn how the study drug combination may affect DNA and RNA (the genetic material in cells) and proteins.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Matched Paired Pharmacodynamics and Feasibility Study of Durvalumab in Combination With Chemotherapy in Frontline Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups: This study has 2 parts: a safety lead-in and Phase 2. If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to either the Safety Lead-in or the Phase 2 portion, depending on when you join the study. Up to 12 participants will be enrolled in the Safety Lead-in, and up to 24 participants will be enrolled in Phase 2. If you are enrolled in the Safety Lead-in, the dose of durvalumab you receive will depend on when you join this study. The first 4 participants will receive the first dose level of durvalumab and be enrolled one at a time, every 3 weeks. Each new participant or group of up to 6 participants enrolling after that will receive either the same dose as the previous participant or group or a lower dose of either durvalumab or chemotherapy. This will continue until a tolerable and appropriate dose of durvalumab and chemotherapy is found. If you are enrolled in Phase 2, you will receive durvalumab at the highest dose that was tolerated in the Safety Lead-in. Study Drug Administration: For all participants, the study drugs are given in 2 steps called Primary Therapy and Maintenance. In the Primary Therapy part of the study, each cycle is 21 days. You will receive the study drugs on the schedule below for 3 cycles before and then 3 cycles after your planned surgery (6 cycles total). - You will receive paclitaxel by vein over 3 hours on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycles 1-6. - You will receive carboplatin by vein over 1 hour on Day 1 of Cycles 1-6. - You will receive durvalumab by vein over 1 hour every 2 weeks in Cycles 1-6. After that, you may begin the Maintenance Phase. In this phase, cycles are 28 days long. You will receive durvalumab alone every 2 weeks for 7 more cycles (28 weeks). It will continue to be given by vein over 1 hour. Study Visits during Primary Therapy: At Week 1 of Cycles 1-6: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. In Cycles 1-3, this blood will also be used for biomarker tests. The biomarker tests in this study may include genetic biomarkers. Biomarkers are found in the blood and tissue and may be related to your reaction to the study drug. - You will have an EKG to check your heart function (Cycles 1 and 6 only). In Cycle 1, an EKG will be performed within 1 hour before the start of the study drug infusion and then at least 1 more time in the 3 hours after the end of the infusion. At Weeks 2 and 3 of Cycle 1: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. At Weeks 2 and 3 of Cycles 2-6, blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. After Cycle 3, you will temporarily stop receiving the study drugs as you prepare for the surgery. At your visit before surgery: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker tests. - You will have an EKG to check your heart function. - You will have an MRI or CT scan to check the status of the disease. You will sign a separate consent form for the surgery that explains the procedure and its risks. During the surgery, tumor tissue will be collected for biomarker and genetic testing. All samples will be stored at MD Anderson for an unlimited amount of time for testing related to this study. At your visit after surgery: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. At all visits during this part of the study except the day of surgery and the visit after surgery, you will complete 1, 2, 5, or all 7 study questionnaires. You will be told how many to complete each time. When you only complete 1 questionnaire at several of the visits, it should take about 10-15 minutes. Anytime the doctor thinks it is needed: - If you can become pregnant, part of the routine blood sample will be used for a pregnancy test. - Part of the routine blood sample will be used for blood clotting tests. Study Visits During Maintenance Therapy: At Week 1 of Cycles 7-13: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) and urine will be collected for routine tests. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for biomarker tests. - You will have an EKG to check your heart function. - You will complete 6 of the study questionnaires. At Week 3 of Cycles 7-13: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. Every 12 weeks, you will have an MRI or CT scan to check the status of the disease. At every other visit during Cycles 7-12 and at Weeks 1 and 4 of Cycle 13, you will complete 1, 6, or all 7 study questionnaires. You will be told how many to complete each time. Anytime the doctor thinks it is needed: - If you can become pregnant, part of the routine blood sample will be used for a pregnancy test. - Part of the routine blood sample will be used for blood clotting tests. Interviews: You will have 2 interviews with the study staff: before you receive any treatment and after you have completed at least 2 cycles of treatment before your tumor reduction surgery and after you have begun receiving maintenance therapy with durvalumab alone. Each interview may take 25-45 minutes. During the interviews, you will be asked questions about any symptoms you had during the time when you were diagnosed, symptoms you are currently having, and any symptoms you had when you received previous treatments for cancer. During the second interview, you will be asked how your symptoms have changed since the first interview. The interviews will be held in a private conference room and will be digitally recorded. The study staff will transcribe (create a text copy of) the interview and will not record your name, medical record number, or any other identifying information. The electronic files and transcription of the interview will be stored securely. Length of Treatment: You may receive up to 6 cycles of the study drug combination and up to 7 more cycles of durvalumab alone. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up. End-of-Treatment Visi: After your last study drug dose: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker tests. - You will have an MRI or CT scan to check the status of the disease. - You will have an EKG to check your heart function. - You will complete 6 of the questionnaires. Follow-up: At 30 days after your last durvalumab dose: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be collected for routine tests. If you can become pregnant, part of this sample will be used for a pregnancy test. - You will complete 6 of the questionnaires. At Month 2 after your last durvalumab dose, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. At Month 3: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. At Months 4, 6, 8, and 10, you will be asked how you are doing. This may also be done at Month 9, depending on how long you took durvalumab and the reason you stopped it. The study staff will tell you if you have this 9-month visit. At the Month 12 and then every 6 months, depending on how long you took durvalumab and the reason you stopped it, blood (about 3 tablespoons) may be drawn for routine tests. As often as the doctor thinks is needed, you will have an MRI or CT scan to check the status of the disease. This will depend on how long you took durvalumab and the reason you stopped it. If you choose not to return for follow-up visits, you can instead receive follow-up phone calls at Months 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 after your last durvalumab dose and then every 2 months starting at Month 12. You will be asked how you are doing. The calls should take about 10-15 minutes. This is an investigational study. Durvalumab is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for research purposes only. Paclitaxel and carboplatin are FDA approved and commercially available. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work. Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
