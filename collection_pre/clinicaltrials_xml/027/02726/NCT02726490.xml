	<brief_title>Glyburide vs Glucovance in the Treatment of GDM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be a randomized open label trial of glyburide compared to glucovance in the management of gestational diabetes. We hypothesize that glucovance will provide improved glycemic control and a lower failure rate with no increase in neonatal adverse outcomes. Sixty-seven patients will be randomized by computer to each arm of the study. Outcomes will be glycemic control, failure rate of the drug to achieve glycemic goals, and neonatal outcomes.</detailed_description>
