	<brief_summary>It's a community-based parallel-arm cluster Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). An interactive mobile health management system will be developed to support lay family health promoters and healthcare staff to improve clinical outcomes for family members with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). 2,000 participants from 80 communities will be chosen from an urban (Beijing province) and a rural setting (Hebei province).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design and setting Cluster randomised controlled trial involving 80 communities (40 communities in Beijing and 40 rural villages in Hebei province) and 2,000 people with T2DM. Hypothesis An interactive mobile health management system can support lay family health promoters (FHP) and healthcare staff to improve clinical outcomes for family members with T2DM Intervention SMARTHealth Diabetes is an interactive mobile health platform to promote improved self-management for people with T2DM. It comprises the following core features: - Management support based on best practice clinical guidelines - Self-management tools and resources for family members - Password protected registration of patients and their nominated FHP to access this information - Population of key clinical information into a desktop application used by health care providers when applicable Community eligibility - 40 urban communities (Beijing) and 40 rural villages (Hebei) from geographically dispersed regions will be selected - Each community/ village must have at least one community health station providing services to ≥1,000 adult residents - Staff at the community health station must be willing to participate in the intervention Statistical power 80 community clusters and a mean community cluster size of 25 participants (2,000 total) will provide 90% power to detect an absolute improvement of 10% in the primary outcome. This assumes a 12% baseline T2DM prevalence; 20% of people in the control arm will achieve ≥2 'ABC' diabetes goals ((HbA1C&lt;7%; Blood Pressure &lt;140/80 mmHg, LDL cholesterol &lt;100mg/dl or 2.6mmol/L) at end of study; an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.05, a 20% loss to follow-up, and a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. This translates to a mean reduction of 0.35% for HbA1C, 0.14 mmol/L for LDL cholesterol and 3.4mmHg for systolic BP. Primary analyses will be conducted at the patient level. Secondary analyses will be conducted at the cluster level. Sub-group analyses will be conducted at the community level (based on size and health service characteristics) and patient level (based on demographic factors (co-habitation with FHP) and clinical factors (control rate of 'ABC' risk factors at baseline). Significance The Chinese government has placed prevention and treatment of diabetes as one of 11 National Basic Public Health Services. Despite great promise for mobile health (mHealth) interventions to improve access to effective health care there remains uncertainty about how this can be successfully achieved. These uncertainties pose substantial dilemmas for health system planners. The findings are likely to inform policy on a scalable strategy to overcome sub-optimal access to effective health care in China.</detailed_description>
