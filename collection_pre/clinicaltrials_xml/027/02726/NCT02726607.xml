	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to modify the HITSystem to engage and retain HIV+ pregnant women before, during and after delivery and evaluate the HITSystem impact on prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) related behaviors and outcomes. HITSystem 2.0 intervention will support a range of PMTCT outcomes including retention in care, ART adherence, and integration of maternal and pediatric HIV services in low-resource settings.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study will be conducted in three phases: Phases 1: The researchers will conduct formative research (focus groups and interviews) with HIV+ pregnant women and PMTCT providers to customize communication strategies for text messaging and inform patient flow and optimal implementation across the various PMTCT-related services at the intervention site. Phase 2: The researchers will design and refine the HITSystem 2.0 technical components to support PMTCT outcomes guided by clinical content experts, technology analysts, and findings from Phase 1. Phase 3: The researchers will implement HITSystem 2.0 at one hospital over an 18 month period, and compare targeted PMTCT outcomes to those at a matched control hospital. The study will be conducted at two government hospitals in Kenya. HIV+ pregnant women will be enrolled in the HITSystem 2.0 at Kapsabet Hospital. HIV+ pregnant women receiving the current standard of PMTCT care at Nandi Hills Hospital will be the comparison group.</detailed_description>
