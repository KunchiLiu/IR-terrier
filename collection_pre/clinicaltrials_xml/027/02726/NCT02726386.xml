	<criteria>Male and female ,Parkinson's disease subjects of any race aged 30 to 85 years . PD diagnosis consistent with the UK Brain Bank Criteria. Modified Hoehn &amp; Yahr scale in "ON" state of stage â‰¤3. Taking at least 4 doses/day of Levodopa (or at least 3 doses/day of Rytary) and taking, or have attempted to take, at least 1 other Parkinson's disease treatment for at least 30 days in the previous year. Subjects must be stable on their antiParkinson's disease medications for at least 30 days before Day 1. Subjects may have had prior exposure to Sub Cutaneous apomorphine injections/infusion but must have stopped administration at least 4 weeks before the screening visit. Treatment with apomorphine is prohibited during the entire ND0612 treatment period. Must have a minimum of 2 hours of "OFF" time per day with predictable early morning "OFF" periods as estimated by the subject. Must have predictable and well defined early morning "OFF" periods with a good response to Levodopa for treatment of the early morning "OFF" in the judgement of the investigator. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score &gt;26. No clinically significant medical, psychiatric or laboratory abnormalities which the investigator judges would be unsafe or noncompliant in the study. Female subjects must be surgically sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation), postmenopausal (defined as cessation of menses for at least 1 year), or willing to practice a highly effective method of contraception. All female participants must be nonlactating and nonpregnant and have a negative urine pregnancy test at Screening and at Baseline. Female subjects of childbearing potential must practice a highly effective method of contraception ( oral contraceptives plus a barrier method of birth control [condoms with contraceptive foams, diaphragms with contraceptive jelly], intrauterine devices, partner with vasectomy), 1 month before enrollment, for the duration of the study, and 3 months after the last dose of study drug. Willing and able to administer the subcutaneous infusion alone or with the assistance of a study partner after a screening period of 28 days and willing and able to comply with study requirements. For Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, the following exclusion criterion applies: Previously unable to tolerate ND0612 and/or have experienced intolerable adverse drug reactions associated with its use, regardless of the dosing regimen administered. For Cohort 2, the following exclusion criteria apply: Atypical or secondary parkinsonism. Acute psychosis or hallucinations in past 6 months. Any relevant medical, surgical, or psychiatric condition, laboratory value, or concomitant medication which, in the opinion of the Investigator makes the subject unsuitable for study entry or potentially unable to complete all aspects of the study. Prior neurosurgical procedure for Parkinson's disease, or duodopa treatment. Subjects with a history of drug abuse or alcoholism within the past 12 months. Clinically significant ECG rhythm abnormalities. Renal or liver dysfunction that may alter drug metabolism including: serum creatinine &gt;1.3 mg/dL, serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;2 x upper limit of normal (ULN), total serum bilirubin &gt;2.5 mg/dL.</criteria>
