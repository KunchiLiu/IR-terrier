	<brief_title>Effect of Sodium Bicarbonate Buccal Infiltration on the Success of Inferior Alveolar Nerve Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several studies have been done by adding Sodium Bicarbonate to local anesthesia in dentistry based on the theory that the amount of local anesthetic in the free-base un-ionized form will decrease to provide greater lipid penetration of the nerve and this could be cause of the failure of local anesthesia injected into the inflamed tissue with low PH and conflicting results were obtained. But, there are no study that evaluate effect of increasing PH in periradicular tissue on hindrance of resistance channels with supplementary infiltration injection of Sodium Bicarbonate</detailed_description>
