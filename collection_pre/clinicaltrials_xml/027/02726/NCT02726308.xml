All patients received standardized anesthetic technique. At the end of surgery, gastric contents were suctioned via an orogastric tube before extubation. Atropine and neostigmine (1/2.5 mg) was given slowly I.V. to antagonize the residual neuromuscular block. Then, the trachea was extubated. Then, patients were transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit in a stable condition. Patients were allowed to drink liquids as soon as requested.</detailed_description>
