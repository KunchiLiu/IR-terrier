	<brief_summary>This is a phase 3 multicenter, randomized, open label study designed to evaluate the clinical benefit and safety of the combination therapy of Nivolumab, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone (N-Pd the investigational arms, when compared to pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Pd; the control arm) in subjects with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (rrMM). The study includes a third arm evaluating the clinical benefit and the safety of the combination therapy of elotuzumab, nivolumab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone (NE-Pd, the exploratory arm) in the same patient population. Subjects in the control arm (Pd) are allowed to cross-over to the exploratory arm (EN-Pd) at the time of progression.</brief_summary>
