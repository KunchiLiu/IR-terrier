	<brief_summary>Debio 1450 is being developed for the treatment of staph (staphylococcal) infections. How fast and completely an antibiotic penetrates into bone is used to determine how effective it might be to treat infections related to bones or joints. Since bone has fewer blood vessels than other tissue (for example lung tissue or the skin), drugs have a harder time getting into them. It is important to find out how much of the antibiotic can get into the bone to help patients with bone infections.</brief_summary>
