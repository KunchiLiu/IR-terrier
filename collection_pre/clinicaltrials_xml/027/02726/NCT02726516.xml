	<brief_title>Effects of PRJ-205 on Performance in Trained Young Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty young active males will be recruited and randomized to either placebo or PRJ-205. Subjects will take the designated treatment in an acute dosage and chronically, 4 days of treatment. They will undergo 3 exercise tasks (before the administration of the product, 1.5h after the acute administration of the product and after 4 days of treatment). VO2max and anaerobic threshold will be measured during the tests. Blood samples will be taken to measure muscle damage and oxidative stress.</detailed_description>
