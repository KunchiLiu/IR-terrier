	<brief_title>Effects of Respiratory Training on Respiratory and Functional Performance in Patients With Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke ranks third in the global cause of death, behind cancer and coronary heart disease. Stroke is also the third largest cause of death in Taiwan in 2014. Stroke patients in the course of exercise are in addition to muscle weakness and reduced endurance, but usually also accompanied by respiratory damage. From past studies have shown that stroke patients whose respiratory function has significant change, such as decreased respiratory muscle strength, reduced respiratory movement of the affected hemithorax, declined in maximum breathing pressure and decreased amplitude of diaphragmatic movements on the paralyzed side. But whether respiratory training can improve respiratory and functional performance of stroke patients, because of the limited research results could not be confirmed.</detailed_description>
