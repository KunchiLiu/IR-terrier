	<brief_summary>Double-dose statin regimen achieves merely 6% of decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, whereas the risk of side effects increased largely. The investigators' previous pilot study (NCT01686451) has suggested that red yeast rice was of similar lipid-lowering efficacy while was associated with less fatigue than statins. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined therapy with red yeast rice and low-dose atorvastatin in persons with mild atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and who qualified for statin therapy according to national guidelines.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy and Safety of Combined Therapy With Red Yeast Rice and Low-dose Statinï¼šComparing With Standardized Statin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both Red Yeast Rice and Statins are cholesterol-lowering medications are often prescribed for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The investigators' previous pilot study (NCT01686451) has suggested that red yeast rice was of similar lipid-lowering efficacy while was associated with less fatigue than statins. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of combined therapy with red yeast rice at 1.2 g/day and atorvastatin at 10 mg/day with atorvastatin at 20 mg/day in persons with mild atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and who qualified for statin therapy according to national guidelines. This study will enroll individuals with established mild atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and who do not currently take lipid-lowering medications. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive combined therapy with red yeast rice at 1.2 g/day and atorvastatin at 10 mg/day or atorvastatin at 20 mg/day for 24 weeks. Study visits will occur at screening, baseline, week 4, week 8, week 16, and week 24. Blood will be collected for laboratory testing, and standardized questionnaires will assess noncardiovascular endpoints. Pill count will be used to assess adherence of treatment. Medication side effects will be monitored and tests of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) and creatine phosphate kinase (CPK) will be performed. Medication efficacy will be assessed and test of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) will be performed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with established mild atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, defined as coronary and/or carotid and/or peripheral artery lesions &lt;40% lumen diameter stenosis, diagnosed by coronary angiography and carotid and/or peripheral artery ultrasound respectively, together with LDL cholesterol level &gt; 70 mg/dL (1.80 mmol/L). 2. Female patients must be postmenopausal as defined by no menstruation for at least 12 months, or surgically sterilized for at least three months prior to beginning the study, or have a negative pregnancy test and agree to avoid pregnancy during the study and one month after the end of the study by using two reliable methods of contraception. 3. Patients must have been informed of all aspects of the study and signed an informed consent form before any studyrelated activities. 4. Patients must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures. Patients who have met all the above inclusion criteria will be screened for the following exclusion criteria. 1. Patients who have been taken lipidlowering medications including statins or red yeast rice products during the 4 weeks prior to the screening visit. 2. Documented history of myocardial infarction (MI), unstable angina leading to hospitalization, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), carotid surgery or stenting, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, endovascular procedure or surgical intervention for peripheral vascular disease. 3. Planned to undergo scheduled PCI, CABG, carotid or peripheral revascularization during the study. 4. History of New York Heart Association Class III or IV heart failure within the past 12 months. 5. Known history of hemorrhagic stroke. 6. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension at the screening visit. Patients on stable antihypertensive medication may be enrolled provided that the medications and dosage remain stable throughout the study. 7. Cardiovascular surgery or major operations within 6 months prior to screening visit. 8. Patients who are taking anticoagulants except aspirin at &lt; 325 mg/day. 9. Patients with liver dysfunction as indicated by a serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of &gt; 1.5times of upper limit of normal (ULN) range, or clinical symptoms. 10. Patients with elevated creatine phosphokinase level (above Upper Limit of Normal range). 11. Patients with renal dysfunction as indicated by a serum creatinine level above ULN range, or clinical symptoms. 12. Patients with gastric or peptic ulcer within 3 months prior to screening visit. 13. Patients with medical history of hypothyroidism, pancreatitis, cholestasis, nephrotic syndrome, gall bladder disease, or primary biliary cirrhosis. Patients on thyroid replacement therapy at stable doses may be enrolled if clinically euthyroid. 14. Patients with clinically relevant illness within 4 weeks prior to screening visit that may interfere with the conduct of this study. 15. Patients with a history of alcohol or narcotic substance abuse within two years prior to screening visit. 16. Patients with hypersensitivity to lipidlowering agents. 17. Patients who have taken another investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to screening visit. 18. Patients with uncontrolled metabolic or endocrine disease knowing to influence lipid values. 19. Patients who are known to be HIV positive. 20. Patients who have a history or presence of active malignancy (other than nonmelanoma skin cancer) or clinically significant psychiatric, neurological, respiratory, hematological, or other conditions that in the opinion of investigators might interfere with or contraindicate participation of the patients in this study.</criteria>
