	<brief_summary>Chronic constipation is a prevalent, burdensome gastrointestinal disorder whose treatment remains challenging. There exist effective pharmacological therapies for chronic constipation, however, many patients do not well respond to current medications. Evidence suggests that disturbance in the gastrointestinal microbiota may be implicated in chronic constipation. Although, E.coli Nissle 1917 (Mutaflor速) has been used for chronic constipation, there are limited data regarding the efficacy of E.coli Nissle 1917 (Mutaflor速) in these patients. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the efficacy of E.coli Nissle 1917 (Mutaflor速) in patients with chronic constipation.</brief_summary>
