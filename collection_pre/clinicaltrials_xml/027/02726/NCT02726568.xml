	<brief_title>High Dose Icotinib For NSCLC Patients Harboring EGFR Mutation With Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The long-term control of brain metastases becomes a clinical challenge. Whole brain radiotherapy, the standard treatment for patients with multiple brain metastases, can only bring a modest survival improvement around 3-6 months. EGFR-TKIs like icotinib with its proven activity in non-small cell lung cancer may provide clinical benefits to brain metastases patients.</detailed_description>
