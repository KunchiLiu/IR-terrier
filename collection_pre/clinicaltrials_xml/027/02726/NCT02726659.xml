	<brief_summary>The investigators will conduct a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of celecoxib as an add-on treatment to the mood stabilizer among women with bipolar I or II postpartum depression. Women who are taking a mood stabilizer for treatment of bipolar disorder in the postpartum treatment will receive either a placebo or celecoxib add-on treatment. Patients will be monitored regularly to assess psychiatric symptoms and side effects. The investigators aim to evaluate the potential antidepressant effect of celecoxib in bipolar postpartum depression.</brief_summary>
