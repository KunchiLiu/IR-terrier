	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works when given together with letrozole and palbociclib in patients with stage IV estrogen receptor positive breast cancer with stable disease that has not responded to letrozole and palbociclib. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Antihormone therapy, such as letrozole, may lessen the amount of estrogen made by the body. Palbociclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving pembrolizumab, letrozole, and palbociclib may be an effective treatment for patients with stage IV estrogen receptor positive breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab, Letrozole, and Palbociclib in Treating Patients With Stage IV Estrogen Receptor Positive Breast Cancer With Stable Disease That Has Not Responded to Letrozole and Palbociclib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR), based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST], version 1.1), of pembrolizumab in combination with letrozole and palbociclib in patients with metastatic estrogen receptor (ER)+human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2- breast cancer, and determine if the addition of pembrolizumab in patients with stable disease (SD) on letrozole and palbociclib can achieve a response (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], and ORR) measured from the study baseline, based on RECIST version 1.1. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety and tolerability of adding pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) to ongoing treatment with letrozole (2.5 mg) and palbociclib (3 weeks on, one week off: dose of palbociclib can vary secondary to individual patient tolerance, range 75-125 mg) in patients with metastatic ER+HER2- breast cancer. II. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS). III. To evaluate overall survival (OS). IV. To evaluate duration of response (DOR) using RECIST version 1.1. V. To evaluate clinical benefit rate (CBR) using RECIST version 1.1. VI. To evaluate toxicities (using the National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for adverse Events [CTCAE], version 4.0) associated with the triple drug combination (pembrolizumab, letrozole, and palbociclib) in patients with metastatic ER+HER2- breast cancer. VII. To evaluate CR, PR, ORR, PFS, DOR, and CBR using immune-related Response Criteria In Solid Tumors (irRECIST); time to treatment failure will also be assessed. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To study cellular/humoral immune response by analyzing immune and stromal cell characteristics before and after treatment that correlate with clinical response; this includes programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression levels. II. To study the peripheral serum thymidine kinase (TK) level and its association with treatment response. III. To study circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) and the effect of combining pembrolizumab, letrozole, and palbociclib on ctDNA profiles. OUTLINE: Patients receive letrozole orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and palbociclib PO QD for 3 weeks. Courses with letrozole and palbociclib repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses with pembrolizumab repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 6 months for 3 years, and then every 12 months for 1 year.</detailed_description>
