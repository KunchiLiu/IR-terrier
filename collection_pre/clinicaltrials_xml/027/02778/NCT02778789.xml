	<brief_summary>Comparing the structural effects of TNFi and tocilizumab on the periarticular bone by performing a comprehensive analysis of the periarticular bone changes in RA patients treated with either TNFi or tocilizumab in a longitudinal Setting, using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT), a very sensitive method for visualizing and quantifying bone microstructure in RA patients. Quantitatively assessing the changes of erosions volume, osteophytes size and the area of cortical fenestration in a group of TNFi-treated and a group of tocilizumab- treated RA patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and of interleukin- 6 receptor (IL-6R) emerged as highly effective cytokine blocking strategies in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the last years. Both, inhibition of TNF-α (TNFi) and of the interleukin-6 receptor by tocilizumab ameliorate the signs and symptoms, reverse the elevated acute phase response and inhibit the progression of bone erosion in RA patients (1). Despite striking similarities with respect to their efficacy and safety in the treatment of RA, TNFi and tocilizumab are two entirely distinct approaches for targeting chronic inflammatory diseases in humans. This concept is highlighted by the differential response to TNFi and tocilizumab in other chronic inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and spondyloarthritis, with clinical efficacy of the former but not the latter treatment modality (2). On the other hand, tocilizumab has a direct effect on the acute phase response and iron metabolism, which is not found with TNFi. Therefore, subtle differences may exist between TNFi and tocilizumab, which are relevant for the long-term treatment of RA patients.</detailed_description>
