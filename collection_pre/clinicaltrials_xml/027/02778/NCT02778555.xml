	<brief_title>Development and Validation of a Daily Pain Catastrophizing Scale</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS; 13 items; factors: rumination, helplessness, magnification) (Sullivan 1995) measures trait catastrophizing in the context of actual or anticipated pain. Currently, there is no validated tool for measuring pain catastrophizing at the daily level. Lack of a validated daily measure stands as a barrier for studies that aim to characterize mechanisms of pain treatment and how PC adaptation / change occurs.</detailed_description>
