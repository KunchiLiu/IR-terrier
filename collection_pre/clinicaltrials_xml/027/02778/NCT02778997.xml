	<brief_summary>Complications in patients with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts are common. Thus, these patients are frequently admitted for suspicion of a shunt dysfunction (SD). However, the symptoms of a SD are often unspecific and the required diagnostics are time consuming, expensive, invasive and may involve radiation exposure. In a prospective observational study it is planned to find out, how often a suspected shunt dysfunction is found, which kinds of shunt dysfunction are seen and if there is a correlation between the shunt dysfunctions and the age of the shunt. Furthermore, it is intended to find out, if there are symptom-patterns specific for certain shunt dysfunctions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Shunt Complication Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients who are admitted for suspected shunt-dysfunction will be included. Patient data, detailed data about the shunt, patient's symptoms and all findings will be recorded in the CRF. After 4-8 weeks all patients will be followed-up to add missing data and correct initial findings with the benefit of a retrospective view. After 2 years, data will be analyzed.</detailed_description>
