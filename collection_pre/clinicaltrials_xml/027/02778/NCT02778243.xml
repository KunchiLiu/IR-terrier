	<brief_summary>Patients followed in the Foch Hospital Urology Department (Suresnes): Patients justifying a prostatectomy. - Patients justifying prostatectomy together with the bladder (radical cystectomy for bladder cancer). - Patients with benign prostate hyperplasia who justified a prostatectomy. Compare serum sexual steroid concentrations and intra-tissue on healthy prostates and prostate adenoma, assess concentrations intra-tissue sex steroids on cancer metastasis prostate specific blood sample under study (30mL) will be performed preoperatively in Patients followed in Foch Hospital Urology Department (Suresnes), and a Removal of a fragment of prostate tissue or metastasis will be analyze. Aim is to compare serum concentrations of sexual steroids and intra-tissue on healthy prostates and prostate adenomas compared to concentrations measured in patients operated for prostate cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Steroids concentration will be determined using Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The analyzed steroids are : FSH :Mul/ml LH: mUI/ml SHBG: µg/ml BT: ng/ml TT: ng/ml DHT: ng/ml DHEA: ng/ml D5: ng/ml D4: ng/ml E1: pg/ml E2 : pg/ml DHEA-S : µg/dl</detailed_description>

Patients affiliated to a social security scheme or benefiting from such a regime. Patients who have given their consent to participate in writing Patient received local therapy or hormonal treatment (LHRH analogue, therapy blocking androgen receptors) before surgery. Treatment reductase inhibitors 5ARI ongoing or stopped for less than 3 months before the intervention. Patient included in another clinical trial inconsistent with the conduct of this research. Patient receiving treatment that could interfere with hormone levels (Prednisone, Ketoconazole, Abiraterone, Finasteride, Dutasteride).</criteria>
