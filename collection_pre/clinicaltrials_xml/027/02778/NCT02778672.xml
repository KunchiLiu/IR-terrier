	<brief_summary>This is a study of up to 250 participants from birth to 12 months who are having a chest x-ray while a patient at the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. Participants will have thermal pictures of their chest taken by trained study staff using a Smartphone and a FLIR ONE attachment. Thermal images will be read by trained study staff to determine if bacterial pneumonia is present. Results of the thermal images will then be compared to the results of the chest X-ray. If additional images of the chest are available, additional thermal images will be taken of the same location within 24 hours of the other image.</brief_summary>
