	<brief_summary>Concomitant chemoradiotherapy improves overall survival in patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LA-HNSCC) compared to radiotherapy alone. Cisplatin 100 mg/m2 at day 1, 22 and 43 is widely used but results in considerable acute and late toxicity. Three cycles of carboplatin plus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is an accepted alternative but both chemotherapy regimens have not been compared prospectively. The aim of this study is to compare tolerability, efficacy, toxicity and quality of life in patients with LA-HNSCC treated with concomitant cisplatin and carboplatin plus 5-FU.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Concomitant Cisplatin Versus Carboplatin and 5-fluorouracil With Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a retrospective comparison of patients with LA-HNSCC treated with chemoradiotherapy at 2 tertiary care centers in the Netherlands (UMCG and VUmc), where one center routinely gives carboplatin plus 5FU (UMCG) and the other center (VUmc) uses high dose cisplatin as standard of care.</detailed_description>
