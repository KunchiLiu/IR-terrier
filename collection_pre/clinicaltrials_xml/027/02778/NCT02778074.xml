	<brief_summary>Purpose and aims Tailored internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (I-CBT) is a new innovative and person-centred method that is promising that may be used to decrease depression in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). In patients with CVD, depressive symptoms is a common co-morbidity leading to decreased wellbeing, and increased morbidity and mortality. Depressive symptoms are both underdiagnosed and undertreated in CVD patients. Earlier studies have demonstrated the efficiency of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for many psychiatric conditions, but few studies have evaluated CBT in patients with CVD. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of the tailored I-CBT program on reducing depressive symptoms and other patient reported outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to explore factors related to implementation of the I-CBT program in clinical cardiac care. Aims of the study - To evaluate the effects of the tailored I-CBT depression program on depressive symptoms, sleep, anxiety and quality of life. - To evaluate factors that can influence the I-CBT programs effect on depressive symptoms. - To gain knowledge about the I-CBT program, as perceived by patients and health care professionals. - To explore facilitators and barriers to the implementation of the I-CBT program in clinical practice from the perspectives of patients, health care professionals and policymakers.</brief_summary>
