	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of three single oral doses of nebicapone (50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg) on the levodopa pharmacokinetics when administered in combination with a single-dose of controlled release levodopa 100 mg/benserazide 25 mg (Madopar® HBS 125).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY: Single centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, 4-way crossover study with 4 single-dose treatment periods. The washout period between doses was 5 days or more. Screening: Subjects were screened for eligibility within 28 and 7 days before first admission. The screening consisted of: medical history; physical examination, vital signs; complete neurological examination; 12-lead ECG; haematology, coagulation, plasma biochemistry and urinalysis tests; HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C serology; drugs of abuse and alcohol screen; urine pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential; and review of the selection criteria. Treatment periods: In each treatment period, eligible subjects were admitted to the UFH on the day prior to receiving the study medication for: vital signs; medical history and physical examination updates; 12-lead ECG; haematology and plasma biochemistry; drugs of abuse and alcohol screen; and urine pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential. On first admission, subjects had a review of the selection criteria and were randomly assigned to one of the treatment sequences. On the morning of the dosing day, subjects received a dose of nebicapone/placebo concomitantly with a dose of Madopar® HBS 125 in fasting conditions (at least 8 hours) and remained in the UFH until at least 24 h post-dose; then, they left and returned for the next period or the follow-up visit. At given time-points between pre-dose and discharge, subjects were submitted to vital signs recording, brief neurological examination, 12-lead ECG, and blood sampling for plasma drug determination and erythrocyte S-COMT activity assay. At discharge, vital signs and ECG were recorded, and haematology and plasma biochemistry tests were performed. Blood samples (7 mL) for the determination of plasma concentration of levodopa, 3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD) and nebicapone, and for the assay of the erythrocyte S-COMT activity were taken at the following times: pre-dose, ½, 1, 1½, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24 h post-dose. Follow-up: A follow-up visit occurred approximately 7-10 days after discharge of last treatment period or early discontinuation for: medical history and physical examination updates; vital signs; 12-lead ECG; haematology, plasma biochemistry and urinalysis tests; and pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential.</detailed_description>

Subjects of body mass index (BMI) between 19 and 30 kg/m2, inclusive. Subjects who were healthy as determined by prestudy medical history, physical examination, vital signs, complete neurological examination and 12lead ECG. Subjects who had clinical laboratory test results clinically acceptable at screening and admission to first treatment period.

(If female) She was not of childbearing potential by reason of surgery or, if of childbearing potential, she used one of the following methods of contraception: double barrier, intrauterine device or abstinence. (If female) She had a negative urine pregnancy test at screening and admission to each treatment period. Subjects were not eligible for entry into the study if they fulfilled the following exclusion criteria: Subjects who did not conform to the above inclusion criteria, or Subjects who had a clinically relevant history or presence of respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, haematological, lymphatic, neurological, cardiovascular, psychiatric, musculoskeletal, genitourinary, immunological, dermatological, endocrine, connective tissue diseases or disorders.

Subjects who had acute gastrointestinal symptoms at the time of screening or first admission (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, heartburn). Subjects who had used medicines within 2 weeks of first admission that, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect the safety or other study assessments. Subjects who had used any investigational drug or participated in any clinical trial within 2 months of their first admission. Subjects who had donated or received any blood or blood products within the previous 2 months prior to screening. Subjects who were vegetarians, vegans or have medical dietary restrictions. Subjects who could not communicate reliably with the investigator. Subjects who were unlikely to cooperate with the requirements of the study. Subjects who were unwilling or unable to give written informed consent. (If female) She was pregnant or breastfeeding. (If female) She was of childbearing potential and she did not use an approved effective contraceptive method (doublebarrier, intrauterine device or abstinence) or she used oral contraceptives.</criteria>
