	<brief_summary>Falling of the elderly as one of the greatest issues and major health problems among the elderly population has produced a further discussion among gerontologists and physical therapists. Moreover, they are considered as one of the major health problems among the aging population and by now around a third of 65-year-old adults fall as a minimum once a year while 6% of such falls cause fractures. Loss of the balance is the main reason for falling among the elderly. Proprioception is the sensory feedback regarding the joint position sense and movement which can accordingly lead to a decrease in the postural stability and steadiness of the elderly people. Proprioception has shown to be a risk factor for falls in older people. proprioception can be modified by physical training. Recently, exergaming, the playing of video games with body movements, has been proposed as effective strategy to deliver exercise. Aim of study: the current research investigates the effect of 8 weeks videogame game exercise, conventional balance exercise, and a combined of the two (mixed training) on knee proprioception, static balance, and mobility of elderly male. Methodology: The study was designed as a single-blinded, randomized, controlled intervention trial. Sixty-four male ages 65 years and above were randomly assigned into an exergame group, a traditional balance exercise group, a mixed training group or a passive control group. After pretest all participant perform 8 weeks of exercise and measured the effects of the training regimens on proprioception and other functional outcomes as well as mood states in healthy older adults.</brief_summary>
