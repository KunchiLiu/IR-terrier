	<brief_summary>This expanded access protocol is for children that cannot get enough nutrients from food and must receive nutrition through a vein. The standard nutrition given through a vein is blend that has soybean fat. If this is given over a long period of time, it can cause problems. It can lead to severe and/or permanent injury to the liver. It is believed that a type of fish oil blend, called Omegaven®, may be used in place of the soybean fat blend. The Omegaven® fish oil blend may greatly reduce the risk of liver injury. Omegaven® is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is only offered under an "expanded access" protocol as an alternative to the soybean fat blend.</brief_summary>
