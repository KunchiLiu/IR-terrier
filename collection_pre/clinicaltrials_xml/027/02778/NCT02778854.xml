	<brief_title>Liquid Biopsy for Detection of Driver Mutation in NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Collect plasma and other specimens from patients who are newly diagnosed with NSCLC or with drug-resistant and plan to receive gene detection to complete the diagnostic test for liquid biopsy .Participants who come from diagnostic test and plan to receive tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) therapy will be collected plasma and other specimens every month during the regiments and monitor the changes of driver motion to predict the prognosis of targeted therapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>cohort 1 patients newly diagnosed with NSCLC confirmed by tissue biopsy and going to receive the detection of gene mutation or patients have obtained drugresistance after receiving molecular target therapy and plan to rebiopsy. Age â‰¥ 18 years newly diagnosed patients have not received TKI and chemotherapy patients who are drugresistant have not received nextgeneration TKI patients who have more than one type of carcinoma patients who reject to sign the informed consent from cohort 2 patients from cohort1 with sensitive driver mutation and plan to receive TKI therapy patients will have regular followup in Chinese people liberation army general hospital every month. patients who are refused to provide the informed consent from</criteria>
