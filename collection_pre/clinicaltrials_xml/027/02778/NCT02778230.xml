	<brief_title>Efficacy of Pea Hull Fibre Supplementation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A 10-week randomized, cross-over study will be carried out to assess the efficacy of pea hull fiber. Participants will complete a 2-week baseline period during which appetite, gastrointestinal symptoms, stool frequency, and stool consistency (transit time) will be collected by paper questionnaire, and participants will collect a single stool. Dietary data (24-hour dietary recalls) will be obtained via phone interviews 3 times during the baseline period. On or about day 15, participants will attend a study visit and complete the Simplified Nutritional Appetite Questionnaire (SNAQ) and Gastrointestinal Symptom Response Scale (GSRS). Participants will be randomized on or about day 15 and consume snacks without pea hull fiber for a 2-week control period, and snacks with added pea hull fiber for a 2-week treatment period separated by a 2-week washout period. In both intervention periods, participants will complete daily questionnaires to assess appetite, gastrointestinal symptoms, and stool frequency and consistency (transit time). Furthermore, they will complete SNAQ and GSRS after the end of each intervention period. The 24-hour dietary recalls will also be collected 3 times during each of the intervention periods. Participants will undergo an additional 2-week washout period after the second intervention period. During washout periods, the same data will be collected as was done during the baseline and intervention periods.Participants will be asked to collect one stool during pre-baseline and weeks 4, 6, 8 and 10 for a total of 5 stools. Stool samples will be analyzed for changes in the microbiota.</detailed_description>
