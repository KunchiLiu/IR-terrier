	<brief_title>Acute Cardiovascular Responses and Chronic Adaptations of Strength Exercise in Intermittent Claudication Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several studies have shown that strength training can promote important benefits for the cardiovascular system in healthy subjects and patients with chronic diseases. However, the effects of resistance exercise on cardiovascular function in intermittent claudication patients are unclear. In addition, it also do not know the chronic effects on cardiovascular function in these patients.</detailed_description>
