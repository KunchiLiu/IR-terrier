	<brief_summary>In this pre-post observational study, the investigators will enroll and follow a cohort of about 50 adults undergoing sleeve gastrectomy surgery for weight loss. Pre-operatively and at 6 and 12 months post-operatively, the investigators will use state-of-the-art metabolic and imaging techniques to evaluate calcium metabolism and skeletal health. Specific outcomes include intestinal calcium absorption capacity, bone mineral density (BMD) assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and quantitative computed tomography (QCT), and bone structure assessed by QCT and high-resolution peripheral QCT (HR-pQCT).</brief_summary>
