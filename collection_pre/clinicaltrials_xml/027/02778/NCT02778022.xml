	<brief_title>Child Adult Relationship Enhancement in Pediatric Primary Care Parenting Group to Reduce Child Behavior Problems</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Child behavioral concerns are common among families served by The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) urban primary care centers. To address this, we developed Child Adult Relationship Enhancement Model in Primary Care Parenting Program (PriCARE), a scaled down version of Parent Child Interaction Therapy designed for urban primary care clinics. The objectives of this study are to 1) evaluate the efficacy of the modified PriCARE to decrease child behavior problems and improve parenting capacity and skills and 2) understand parents' perceptions of the efficacy of PriCARE and strategies for improving its implementation and dissemination. We will perform a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the effectiveness of the modified PriCARE on decreasing child behavior problems and improving positive parenting among 2- to 6-year-old children with behavior problems and their parents at CHOP's South Philadelphia Primary Care Center and Karabots Pediatric Care Center. We intend to randomize 120 child-parent pairs (240 subjects) to receive PriCARE immediately plus usual treatment (intervention group) and 60 child-parent pairs (120 subjects) to receive PriCARE at a later time plus usual treatment (control group) for a total of 180 child-parent pairs (360 subjects). All child-parent pairs randomized to the control group will be placed on a waitlist and offered PriCARE after completion of data collection. Child behavior and parenting style will be measured at baseline (time 1), at 6-19 weeks (time 2), and at 14-27 weeks (time 3).</detailed_description>
