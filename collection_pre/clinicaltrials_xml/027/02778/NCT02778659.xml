	<brief_summary>This study aims to determine the effect of acute hypnotic intake (Zolpidem) on sleep, cognitive and motor performances and on acute mountain sickness symptoms at high altitude. Healthy subjects will be evaluated on 4 occasions (twice at sea level and twice at high altitude), after hypnotic or placebo intake. Following an early wake-up (01:00), symptoms, cognitive and motor performances will be assessed to determine potential residual effects of Zolpidem within such conditions.</brief_summary>
