	<brief_summary>Culture media used to support development of zygotes to the blastocyst stage is based on two basic philosophies: a single step medium "let-the-embryo-choose" or a sequential medium "back-to-nature". For single step media, there are two types of protocol can be used for the culture of human preimplantation embryos: 1. Interrupted single medium culture, in which the medium is renewed on the Day 3 of embryo culture 2. Uninterrupted single embryo culture, in which the same single medium is used throughout the 5-6 days of culture with no replenishment or replacement on Day 3. Investigators aim to compare the blastocyst development and clinical outcome between the two types of protocols of a single medium (with or without renewal on Day 3)</brief_summary>
