	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to mechanistically define the potential anticancer activities of the osteoporosis bisphosphonate (BP) drug alendronate, and extend the analysis to learn novel information about the impact of BP on gamma delta (γδ) T cells in breast tissues as well as epithelial breast cell differentiation of high-risk women. To this end, we have designed a BP "window trial" to examine the effect of 1 - 3 weeks administration of alendronate on women at high-risk for breast cancer, at the level of immunosurveillance and mammary epithelial cell differentiation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients referred for risk reduction mastectomy (ex. BRCA or other highrisk gene mutations, strong family history of breast cancer, history of LCIS, ADH, ALH and those with DCIS undergoing bilateral mastectomy or prophylactic contralateral mastectomy) Patients who are premenopausal defined as an individual with at least six menstrual cycles in the past year Patients must be 18 years of age or older The effects of Alendronate on the developing fetus are unknown. For this reason, heterosexual women must agree to use TWO effective forms of birth control for the duration of study participation and for 8 weeks following the last dose of study medication. Women must combine a hormonal birth control method (e.g. combined oral contraceptive pill, vaginal ring, skin patch, injection, or copper IUD) in continuous use for &gt;90 days prior to study entry (except in the case of a copper IUD), with a nonhormonal birth control method (e.g. diaphragm, cervical cap, cervical shield with spermicide, contraceptive sponge, or condom (male or female) with spermicide). Women with hysterectomy with intact functioning ovaries, women with Fallopian tubes cut, tied, or sealed, and women with a sterilization implant (e.g. Adiana, Essure) placed &gt;3 months prior to beginning the study drug are not considered to be able to bear children and therefore are eligible to participate without the use of concurrent birth control. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within the current menstrual cycle and within 7 days before starting drug. Patients must have recovered from major infections and/or surgical procedures, and in the opinion of the investigator, not have any significant active concurrent medical illnesses precluding protocol treatment Participants must have the ability to understand, and the willingness to sign, a written informed consent form Patients with a previous diagnosis of invasive breast cancer Patients who are postmenopausal (defined as 12 consecutive months without a menstrual period). Patients with an implant in the sampled breast Pregnant or lactating women are excluded from this study. Breastfeeding must be discontinued for the duration of study participation and for 8 weeks after the last dose of the study agent Patients for whom English is not their native language Patients with current or previous bisphosphonate therapy Patients with a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition of alendronate and other bisphosphonates. Patients with esophageal dysmotility Patients unable to sit up or stay up for 30 minutes after taking oral dose Patients who have taken nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the past two weeks Patients who have received chemotherapy for a malignancy in the past 5 years Patients who are treated for a medical condition (such as ulcerative colitis) with chronic steroids during the 2 years prior to planned mastectomy surgery Patients with calculated creatinine clearance (CockroftGault) less than 35 mL/min Patients with a history of hypocalcemia</criteria>
