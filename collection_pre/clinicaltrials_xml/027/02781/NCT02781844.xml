	<brief_summary>This study is being conducted to characterize the effects of twice daily administration of rhPTH(1-84) on the way the body handles rhPTH(1-84) as well as its actions, and safety and tolerability over the course of 24-36 hours as compared with the current once daily dosing regimen of marketed rhPTH(1-84) (marketed in the United States as Natpara®).</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Hypoparathyroidism</mesh_term>
	<mesh_term>Hormones</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Key 1. History of hypoparathyroidism ≥ 12 months. 2. Requirement for supplemental oral calcium treatment ≥ 1000 mg per day. 3. Requirement for active vitamin D therapy at a dose of ≥ 0.25 mcg per day . (i.e., ≥ 0.25 mcg calcitriol or equivalent per day). 4. Serum calcium levels ≥7.0 to ≤9.5 mg/dL (1.752.375 mmol/L) based on local clinical chemistry lab results at Screening (central lab) and Treatment Period 1, Day 2 (central and/or local lab). 5. Urinary calcium excretion ≥250 mg (6.25mmol)/24h while on usual calcium and active vitamin D supplementation, based on historical (ie within 12 months) data provided by the subject's physician. 6. Urinary calcium excretion ≥200 mg (5mmol)/24h, based on a 24hour collection prior to checkin to the CRC at Treatment Period 1, Day 2. 7. Serum magnesium level within the laboratory normal range at the screening examination or, if outside the normal range, considered as not clincially significant by the Investigator. 8. Serum thyroid function tests within normal laboratory limits at screening, or if outside of the normal range, considered as not clinically significant by the Investigator. 9. Serum 25(OH) D level between the lower limit of normal and 1.5 fold the laboratory upper limit of normal at the first screening visit. 10. Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL (&lt;133 micromol/L) AND creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/ minute(&gt;1.002mL/s). Key 1. Participation in any other investigational drug study within the last 3 months 2. Use of any of the following prior to study drug administration: (1) 30 days: loop diuretics, lithium, antacids, systemic corticosteroids; (2) 3 months: calcitonin, cinacalcet hydrochloride, rhPTH(184) or Nterminal PTH or PTHrelated peptide fragments or analogs; (3) females only: changes in hormone replacement therapy within 3 months; (4) 6 months: fluoride tablets, oral bisphosphonates, methotrexate growth hormone, digoxin; raloxifene or similar selective estrogen receptor modulators; and (5) 12 months: intravenous bisphosphonates, drug or alcohol abuse 3. History of a clinically significant disorder involving the cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal, immunologic, hematologic, endocrine (with exception of the condition under study), or neurologic system(s) or psychiatric disease as determined by the Investigator. 4. Known history of hypoparathyroidism resulting from an activating mutation in the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) gene or impaired responsiveness to PTH (pseudohypoparathyroidism). 5. Any disease that might affect calcium metabolism or calciumphosphate homeostasis other than hypoparathyroidism 6. Subjects who are at increased baseline risk for osteosarcoma. 7. Subjects who have a known history of hypocalcemia during initiation of treatment or following abrupt withdrawal of treatment with PTH, PTH analogues or fragments of PTH. 8. Subjects dependent on regular paretneral calcium infusions to maintain calcium homeostasis within 3 months prior to enrollment. 9. Any medical condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for this study.</criteria>
