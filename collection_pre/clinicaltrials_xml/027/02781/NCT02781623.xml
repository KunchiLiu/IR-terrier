	<brief_summary>This study will quantify and examine the extent to which the quadriceps femoris muscle group atrophies following tibial plateau fractures and the length of time that atrophy affects function. The study will also look at the effects of tibial plateau fractures on the quadriceps muscle and the effect this atrophy has on functional outcome. Quadriceps atrophy will be measured both clinically and by using MRI scans taken pre-operatively, 3 months post operatively, and 1 year post-operatively. The injured leg and the non-injured leg will be scanned in order for the non-injured leg to serve as the control. In this way muscle volume can be estimated from the muscle thickness at specific locations in the thigh. The muscle strength of the quadriceps will also be assessed at the 3 month and 1 year visit by measuring isokinetic knee-extension torque, and functional assessment questionnaires will be completed at each study visit.</brief_summary>
