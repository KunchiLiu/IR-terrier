	<brief_summary>In this study, individuals without hepatitis C infection who are on the kidney transplant waitlist will receive a kidney from a deceased donor with hepatitis C infection and will be treated for hepatitis C at the same time. Treatment will include Grazoprevir (GZR) 100 mg/Elbasvir (EBR) 50 mg administered on-call to the operating room for the renal transplant procedure and continued for 12 weeks post-renal transplant.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this study, individuals without hepatitis C infection who are on the kidney transplant waitlist will receive a kidney from a deceased donor with hepatitis C infection and will be treated for hepatitis C at the same time. Hepatitis C treatment will include Grazoprevir (GZR) 100 mg/Elbasvir (EBR) 50 mg administered on-call to the operating room for the renal transplant procedure and continued for 12 weeks post-renal transplant. The donor hepatitis C genotype will be tested. If the donor has genotype 1a without resistance or genotype 1b treatment will remain GZR/EBR for 12 weeks. If the donor has genotype 1a with resistance variants, then Ribavirin will be added and treatment will be given for 16 weeks starting from the date ribavirin was added. If the donor has hepatitis C genotype 2 or 3, Sofosbuvir will be added and treatment will be for 12 weeks from the date Sofosbuvir was added.</detailed_description>

Calculated panel reactive antihuman leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibody (cPRA) below 20 percent Female who is: practicing total abstinence from sexual intercourse (minimum 1 complete menstrual cycle) sexually active with female partners only not of childbearing potential: defined as postmenopausal for at least 2 years prior to screening defined as amenorrheic for longer than 2 years, age appropriate, and confirmed by a folliclestimulating hormone level indicating a postmenopausal state, or surgically sterile: defined as bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy or has a vasectomized partner(s); of childbearing potential and sexually active with male partner(s): currently using at least one effective method of birth control at the time of screening and agree to practice two effective methods of birth control while receiving study drug (as outlined in the participant information and consent form starting with Study Day 1 and for 30 days after stopping study drug, or for 6 months after stopping study drug if receiving RBV (Note: Estrogencontaining hormonal contraceptives, including oral, injectable, implantable, patch and ring varieties, may not be used during study drug treatment). Males who are not surgically sterile and are sexually active with female partner(s) of childbearing potential must agree to practice two effective forms of birth control (as outlined in the participant information and consent form) throughout the course of the study, starting with starting with Study Day 1 and for 30 days after stopping study drug, or for 6 months after stopping study drug if receiving ribavirin (RBV) Plan to receive a multiorgan transplant Plan to receive a dual kidney transplant (including en bloc) Prior solid organ transplant Participating in another study that involves an intervention or investigational product Plan to receive a blood type incompatible kidney History of human immunodeficiency (HIV), hepatitis C (HCV), or active hepatitis B (HBV) infection defined as being on active antiviral treatment for HBV, detectable hepatitis B surface Ag or detectable hepatitis B DNA Active or unresolved bacterial, viral, or fungal infection that is clinically significant History of cirrhosis or preexisting liver disease such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis History of illicit drug use or alcohol abuse within 12 months prior to screening Psychiatric or physical illness that in the opinion of the investigator would make it unsafe to proceed with transplantation or interfere with the ability of the subject to participate in the study.</criteria>
