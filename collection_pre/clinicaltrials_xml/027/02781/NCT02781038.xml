	<brief_summary>Patients who smoke and suffer from fractures are worse off than those who do not smoke. Orthopaedic patients represent a group that can benefit from physician contributions to smoking cessation, and a special opportunity to cue this can begin with the orthopaedic surgeon in the acute setting. However, the best way to appropriately counsel these patients and assess the impact as a teachable moment remains undetermined.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Smoking Cessation and a Teachable Moment in Patients With Acute Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If the patient self-identifies as a smoker, the investigators will consent and randomize to receive the intervention or not. Either way, all will receive a baseline attitude survey. The patient will be given a series of questions that target the areas of interest noted in the model. At some point in their hospitalization, preferably at least one day later and no greater than one week later, the patients will be given the teaching intervention (or not), and receive another attitude survey. After discharge, the patients will be expected in orthopaedic follow up clinic. At that time they will receive another attitude survey. If unable to deliver at that time, they will be contacted by phone or sought at their second clinic follow up.</detailed_description>
