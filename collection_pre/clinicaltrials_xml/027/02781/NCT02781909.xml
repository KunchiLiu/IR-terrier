	<brief_summary>Novel approaches to improve TB treatment outcomes (to reduce morbidity, mortality, and the duration of TB treatment) and to treat XDR-TB cases are urgently required. Host-Directed therapies (especially repurposed drugs such as Non-Steroid AntiInflammatory Drugs NSAIDS) could be useful in this context, and therefore its the appropriateness and potential effect of this approach needs to be evaluated in humans. Investigators do propose a prospective, randomized, pilot study to estimate the potential efficacy and safety of using adjunctive ibuprofen for the treatment of XDR tuberculosis.</brief_summary>
