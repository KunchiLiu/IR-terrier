	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to assess whether the combination of BP1001 and LDAC provides greater efficacy (Complete Remission [CR], Complete Remission with incomplete hematologic recovery [CRi], Complete Remission with incomplete platelet recovery [CRp]) than LDAC alone (by historical comparison) in participants with AML that cannot or elect not to be treated with more intensive chemotherapy. Safety, pharmacokinetics, overall survival, time to response, and duration of response will also be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of BP1001 (Liposomal Grb2 Antisense Oligonucleotide) in Combination With LDAC in Patients With Previously Untreated AML</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Grb2 gene has been mapped to the human chromosome region 17q22-qter, a region that is duplicated in leukemias and solid tumors, which may result in an increased copy number of the Grb2 gene product. As Grb2 is important for the transformation of murine hematopoietic cells, and the proliferation of human leukemia cells that express high levels of oncogenic tyrosine kinases, inhibition of Grb2 may have a significant impact on the natural history of leukemias. The study drug (BP1001) may be able to inhibit the cells from making Grb-2. Researchers hope that without this protein, the leukemia cells will die. Low-dose cytarabine (Ara-C) (LDAC) has been used in a variety of schedules in several Phase II trials in AML showing responses that include complete remission of disease. It is generally well tolerated and can be given in an outpatient or home care setting. Researchers hope that the combination of BP1001 and LDAC will result in greater response rates and duration of response in participants with AML that cannot or elect not to be treated with more intensive chemotherapy. This is a Phase IIa, multicenter, study of BP1001 in combination with LDAC in participants with previously untreated AML who are not otherwise eligible for standard or high-intensity chemotherapy regimens or who have elected a low-intensity regimen. This trial will utilize a single arm, open label, two-stage design to assess the safety profile, PK, PD, and efficacy of 60 mg/m2 of BP1001 in combination with LDAC compared to historical response rates documented for LDAC alone. Approximately 54 evaluable participants will receive the combination of BP1001 and LDAC.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Adults ≥18 years of age 2. Females must be of nonchildbearing potential, surgically sterile, postmenopausal, or practice adequate methods of contraception during the study and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug or LDAC 3. Males must agree to use an adequate method of contraception during the study and for at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug or LDAC 4. Histologically documented diagnosis (based on the 2008 World Health Organization [WHO] Classification) of one of the following: Newly diagnosed de novo AML; or Untreated secondary AML, including AML that has progressed from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) 5. Investigator considers participant ineligible for intensive induction therapy based on medical reasons, disease characteristics such as genetics, type of AML (de novo or secondary), or participant characteristics such as age, performance status, comorbidities, organ dysfunctions, or patient election of lowintensity treatment. 6. Eligible for LDAC therapy, based on Investigator assessment 7. Adequate hepatic and renal functions as defined by: Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN); and Total bilirubin ≤1.5 times ULN; and Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of at least 50ml/min using the Cockcroft Gault formula will be determined at base line when testing of BUN and creatinine is performed. The combination of eGFR serum creatinine and BUN will be used to evaluate renal function and assure the safety of this patient function. 8. Documented Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2 9. Recovered from the effects of any prior surgery, radiotherapy, or antineoplastic treatment (with the exception of alopecia), based on Investigator assessment 10. Willing and able to provide written informed consent 1. Active nonhematologic or lymphoid malignancy other than AML treated with immuno or chemotherapy within the previous 12 months except active nonmelanoma, noninvasive skin cancer will be allowed. 2. Known, active leptomeningeal leukemia requiring intrathecal therapy. NOTE: Patients with a history of CNS disease may be allowed to participate based on at least 1 documented, negative spinal fluid assessment within 28 days prior to Screening 3. Isolated extramedullary leukemia without also meeting bone marrow criteria for acute leukemia (ie, ≥20% blasts in bone marrow aspirate) 4. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with t(15;17)(q22;q12) PMLRARA 5. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in any phase 6. Receipt of any anticancer therapy within 14 days prior to C1D1, with the exception of hydroxyurea or anagrelide (within 24 hours), TKI (within 1days), or a single dose of cytarabine (for proliferative disease) 7. Uncontrolled active, untreated, or progressive infection 8. Receipt of any investigational agent or study treatment within 30 days prior to C1D1 9. Females who are pregnant, test positive for pregnancy, or are breastfeeding during the Screening period, or intend to become pregnant or breastfeed during the course of the study or within 30 days after last dose of study drug 10. Prior exposure to BP1001 11. Serious intercurrent medical or psychiatric illness which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with the ability of the participant to complete the study 12. Active/chronic hepatitis B infection (based on positive surface antigen [HBsAg]), hepatitis C infection (based on positive antibody [HCV Ab]), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV1 or HIV2, based on positive antibody) 13. History of any serious adverse reaction or hypersensitivity to cytarabine, unless reaction is deemed irrelevant to the study by the Investigator and Medical Monitor 14. Presence of concurrent conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator and/or Medical Monitor, may compromise the participant's ability to tolerate study treatment or interfere with any aspect of study conduct or interpretation of results. This includes, but is not limited to, unstable or uncontrolled angina, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV congestive heart failure, uncontrolled and sustained hypertension, clinically significant cardiac dysrhythmia or clinically significant ECG abnormality (eg, QTcF &gt;470 msec) 15. Within the past 6 months, has had any of the following: myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack 16. Uncontrolled seizure disorder (ie, seizures within the past 2 months). 17. Unable or unwilling to communicate or cooperate with the Investigator or follow the protocol for any reason</criteria>
