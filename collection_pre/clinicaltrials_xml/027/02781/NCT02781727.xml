TransCon hGH will be given once-a-week, human growth hormone (hGH) will be given daily. Approximately 150 prepubertal, hGH-treatment naïve children (males and females) with GHD will be included. Randomization will occur in a 2:1 ratio (TransCon hGH : Genotropin). This is a global trial that will be conducted in, but not limited to, the United States, Canada, Germany, France, Poland, Bulgaria, Russia and Australia.</brief_summary>
