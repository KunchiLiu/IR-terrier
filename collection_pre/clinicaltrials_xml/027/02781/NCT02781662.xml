	<brief_summary>This study evaluates an intervention to reduce medication errors and adverse drug events in older adults who have recently been discharged from the hospital and prescribed anticoagulants, diabetes agents, or opioids. Half of the study participants will receive the intervention, while the other half will receive usual care.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Safety After Hospitalization in Older Persons on High-Risk Medications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overarching objective of this research study is to pursue a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) focused on older patients recently discharged from the hospital who have been prescribed medications within one of three high-priority, high-risk drug classes in order to reduce the risk of clinically important medication errors. The National Action Plan for Adverse Drug Event (ADE) Prevention identified three high-priority drug classes as key targets for reducing the risk of drug-related injuries: anticoagulants; diabetes agents (insulin and oral agents); and opioids. These medication classes were chosen because they account for the greatest number of measurable drug-related harms to patients, and a substantial proportion of ADEs associated with these medications is considered preventable. The clinical trial will determine the value of a multifaceted medication error and ADE reduction intervention with a special focus on in-home assessment. Components of the intervention will include: (1) in-home assessment of high-risk patients by a clinical pharmacist; (2) best-practice, evidence-based medication safety tools and resources targeted to high-risk patients and their caregivers; (3) communication with the primary care team via the electronic health record (EHR) regarding concerns relevant to the use of high-risk medications as well as other medication safety concerns; and (4) a follow-up phone call by the pharmacist to the patient and/or caregiver within 14 days of the home visit. The primary outcome of interest will be clinically important medication errors, a composite outcome comprised of preventable or ameliorable ADEs and potential ADEs due to medication discrepancies or non-adherence. Secondary outcomes will include: (1) preventable or ameliorable ADEs; (2) potential ADEs due to discrepancies or non-adherence; and (3) preventable or ameliorable ADEs judged to be serious, life-threatening, or fatal. The specific aims for our study are as follows: Aim 1: To adapt and integrate existing "best-practice," evidence-based medication safety tools, resources, and approaches into a cohesive, multifaceted intervention to reduce the occurrence of clinically important medication errors in older adults recently discharged from the hospital using one or more of the three high-priority, high-risk drug classes (anticoagulants, diabetes agents, and opioids). Aim 2: To assess the impact of the multifaceted intervention on the incidence of clinically important medication errors employing a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. Aim 3: To conduct a process evaluation assessing intervention fidelity, adaptation, mechanisms of impact, essential components, and the influence of contextual factors. Aim 4: To create: 1) a plan for disseminating study findings to stakeholders who might implement the intervention or make decisions about its future use; and 2) an implementation toolkit for those who wish to implement the intervention in practice.</detailed_description>
