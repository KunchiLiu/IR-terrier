	<criteria>Confirmed lung cancer based on cytological or histological analysis. Group A: squamous cell carcinoma amenable for surgical resection (up to TNM stage IIIa). Group B: any type of lung cancer (smallcell carcinoma, nonsmallcell carcinoma) not amenable for surgical resection. Group C: healthy controls. Age between 18 and 85 years at study entry Another 'active' secondary malignant disease (e.g. breast cancer, colon carcinoma) in group A and B, presence of any active malignant disease in group C (based on personal information). Acute inflammatory disease (e.g. common cold) within the last 4 weeks. Any other chronic lung disease than chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD). Acute or chronic hepatic disease. Renal failure or renal replacement therapy.</criteria>
