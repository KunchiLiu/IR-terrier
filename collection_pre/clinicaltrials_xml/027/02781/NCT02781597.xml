	<brief_title>Efficacy of Tranexamic Acid in Hemoptysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemoptysis is a common problem in India due to high incidence of tuberculosis and also due to post tubercular sequale. Hemoptysis is usually managed conservatively in mild to moderate cases and cases of massive hemoptysis are managed with more definitive treatment options like vessel embolization (bronchial/pulmonary artery) and surgery as a last option. Tranexamic acid is a antifibrinolytic used in many surgeries and trauma patients to control bleeding and it has been shown effective and safe. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of tranexamic acid in patients with hemoptysis in controlling bleeding.</detailed_description>
