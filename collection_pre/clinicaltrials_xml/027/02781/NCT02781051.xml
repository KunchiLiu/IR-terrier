	<brief_title>Increasing Physical Activity Among Breast Cancer Survivors With Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research project is a pilot study to assess the effects of a multi-component intervention in increasing physical activity among breast cancer survivors with depression. Individuals meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the 12-week intervention with a 6 month follow up. Intervention components will include print-based education, self-monitoring, Active Living counseling, and facility access. Blood samples will be collected at baseline. Assessments (anxiety, stress, sleep) and sample collection will also occur at 3 time points during the intervention (Weeks 7, 13, and 25). Changes in physical activity will be assessed using Fitbits to measure weekly minutes of moderate/vigorous activity.</detailed_description>
