	<brief_summary>This study is designed to identify brain activity associated with good memory in subjects with a chronically implanted RNS® device and to study the effects of therapeutic stimulation for epilepsy on memory. This will be accomplished through analysis of ECoG data collected during memory encoding for short and long-term free recall as well as during navigation tasks.</brief_summary>
