	<brief_title>Efficacy of Prucalopride Plus Polyethylene Glycol in Bowel Preparation for Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colonoscopy is the standard approach for evaluating the colon currently. Thorough bowel cleansing is critical for adequate visualization of colonic mucosa during colonoscopy. Inadequate bowel cleansing results in adverse consequences for the examination, including lower adenoma detection rates, longer procedural time, lower cecal intubation rates, shorter intervals between examinations and an estimated 12-22% increase in overall colonoscopy cost.Unfortunately, despite advances in bowel preparation methods, up to one-third of all colonoscopies are reported to have an inadequate bowel preparation. Prucalopride can accelerate colonic transit and has been demonstrated to be efficient in constipation.</detailed_description>
