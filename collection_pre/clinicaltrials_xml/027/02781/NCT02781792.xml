	<brief_summary>Temozolomide (TMZ) is the chemotherapy drug approved by the FDA to increase survival in glioblastoma (GBM) patients beyond surgical resection and radiation therapy alone. Give its activity in astrocytomas, TMZ is commonly used in grade III anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) as well. Both grade III AA and grade IV GBM are high grade gliomas (HGG). The short half-life of this drug and known oscillations in DNA damage repair make it an ideal candidate for chronotherapy. Chronotherapy is the improvement of treatment outcomes by minimizing treatment toxicity and maximizing efficacy through delivery of a medication according to the timing of biological rhythms within a patient. Chronotherapy has improved outcomes through the reduction of side effects and increase in anti-tumor activity for a variety of cancers, but has never been applied to the treatment of gliomas. Based on the preliminary preclinical data for chronotherapeutic TMZ treatment of intracranial glioma xenografts and the success of chronotherapy in the treatment of other cancers, the invesitgators hypothesize that the timing of TMZ treatment will alter its efficacy and toxicity.</brief_summary>
