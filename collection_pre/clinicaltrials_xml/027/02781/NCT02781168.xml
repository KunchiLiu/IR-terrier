	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the use of headphones in salivary cortisol levels in newborns (NB) during periods of nap aimed at noise reduction, brightness and handling NB, measure the concentrations of salivary cortisol before (baseline) and after the use of hearing protection (response) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). A NICU nap periods and compare the influence of the use and non-use of hearing protection in salivary cortisol levels and sleep patterns of infants during nap periods of the NICU.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the use of headphones in salivary cortisol levels in newborns (NB) during periods of nap aimed at noise reduction, brightness and handling NB, measure the concentrations of salivary cortisol before (baseline) and after the use of hearing protection (response) in the NICU nap periods and compare the influence of the use and non-use of hearing protection in salivary cortisol levels and sleep patterns of infants during nap periods of the NICU. Being the chance prosposta the use of headphones during periods of environmental control has an influence on the level of salivary cortisol and sleep in preterm infants. This is a randomized clinical trial, controlled, crossover, in which clinical intervention is introduced by the researcher that controls and varies, featuring experimental research. In this study the intervention being tested is the use of hearing protection in infants. The ear is employed in certain periods of the day. These periods established by the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (ICU), are intended to promote environmental noise control and manipulation of the NB. Levels of cortisol present in the saliva of the newborn will be analyzed, allowing to measure the biologically active free cortisol in the body.</detailed_description>
