	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular events remain the main cause of death of the industrialized world (Global status report on noncommunicable diseases 2010. Geneva, World Health Organization, 2011). Arterial hypertension, hyperlipoproteinemia, smoking, diabetes and family history represent the main cardiovascular risk factors. Arteriosclerosis leads to coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular insufficiency and peripheral vascular diseases that reflect in myocardial infarction and stroke. The main objective of this experiment is to investigate the differential effect of microgravity on central aortic blood pressure. The main criterion is the central aortic pressure (measured in mmHg). The hypothesis is that microgravity leads to an increased central aortic pressure.</brief_summary>
