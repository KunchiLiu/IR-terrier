	<brief_summary>Catheter infections and dysfunctions are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in haemodialysis patients. According to the US Renal Data System, infection is the second leading cause of death in dialysis patients and the leading cause of catheter removal and morbidity in patients with end-stage renal disease. There is evidence that catheter lock solutions containing taurolidine reduce the risk of catheter related infections and improve catheter patency. Lock solutions have a local, but no systemic effect. In this study a taurolidine based lock regimen (TauroLock™-Hep500, Tauropharm, Waldbüttelbrunn, Germany, 2x/week and TauroLock™-U25.000, Tauropharm, Waldbüttelbrunn, Germany, 1x/ week) will be compared to 4% citrate (CitraFlow™ 4%, MedXL, Montreal, Canada, 3x/week) as standard lock solution. The objective of this study is to evaluate if a TauroLock™ based regimen to lock tunneled haemodialysis catheters has reducing effects on catheter related blood stream infections and catheter dysfunctions.</brief_summary>
