	<brief_summary>Left ventricular remodeling is a common complication in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI ) and may lead to heart failure. Hemodynamic, metabolic and inflammatory mechanisms are involved in this pathophysiological process. Recent data demonstrated that remote, noninfarct-related region of the myocardium is also implicated. There is no data about the assessment of coronary endothelial function or myocardial fibrosis in the remote zone in patients with STEMI . The correlation between these parameters and left ventricular remodeling is not known.</brief_summary>
