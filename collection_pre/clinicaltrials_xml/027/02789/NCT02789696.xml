	<brief_summary>Prevalence of sleep apnea syndrome in patients with acromegaly is about 70%. It seems that comorbidities of arterial hypertension or type 2 diabetes are more severe in patients with acromegaly and sleep apnea syndrome. Besides sleep apnea syndrome associated to acromegaly gives rise to few symptoms, that explains it is under diagnosed. The mechanisms of the association are based on maxillofacial modifications linked to acromegaly, a thickening of soft tissues with deposits of glyco-aminoglycanes but probably also because of the associated obesity, of the potential existence of a goiter and a muscular dystrophy of the dilatative muscles of the pharynx. At present, no study clearly documented prevalence of acromegaly in a diagnostic consultation for sleep apnea syndrome.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>60 investigators will participate to this study. They will be chosen among those participating to the sleep observatory of the federation of pneumology (www.osfp.fr). All participating pneumologists would have to fill in the questionnaire (co-morbidities, concomitant treatments, biological analysis) directly online and also clinical signs and symptoms of acromegaly. A blood test for the insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) dosage will be systematically prescribed to the patient. Pneumologists will have to include all consecutive patients presenting with sleep apnea syndrome suspicion. According to first IGF-1 results, patients may have to do a second blood test in a referenced laboratory to confirm the dosage.</detailed_description>
