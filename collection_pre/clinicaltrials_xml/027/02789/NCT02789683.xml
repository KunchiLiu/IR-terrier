	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to compare the effects of emulsification and lipid droplet size on gastric emptying rate, and to determine if the change in gastric emptying rate can in turn influence postprandial glycemic, insulinemic and lipidemic responses.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Emulsification and Lipid Droplet Size on Postprandial Metabolic Responses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be conducted using a randomized, crossover design with three dietary phases: 1) fine emulsion beverage (small lipid droplet size), 2) coarse emulsion beverage (large lipid droplet size) and 3) non-emulsified oil and water. All treatments will be consumed together with bread. All participants will be randomly allocated to the three test meals. Fifteen to twenty participants aged between 21 and 50 years will be recruited from the general public in Singapore. During the testing sessions, participants' glycemic, insulinemic, lipidemic responses and gastric emptying to the test meals will be measured. Gastric antral distention ultrasound measurement is an indirect measure of gastric emptying rate. Participants' metabolic satiety for the test meals will also be assessed at regular intervals throughout the testing session. Each testing session will take approximately four hours in duration and the testing sessions will take place at least five days apart.</detailed_description>
