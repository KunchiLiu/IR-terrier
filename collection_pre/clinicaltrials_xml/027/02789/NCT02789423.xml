	<brief_title>Clinical &amp; Radiographical Evaluation of the Effect of Dycal &amp; Biodentine in DPC in Primary Teeth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the present study is to compare Calcium Hydroxide cement (Dycal) 速 and Calcium Silicate cement (Biodentine)TM as pulp capping agents in primary molars. The objective of this study include the evaluation of clinical and radiographic efficacy of Calcium Hydroxide cement (Dycal) 速 and Calcium Silicate cement (Biodentine)TM, and their response in direct pulp capping treatment on primary molars during a 6 months follow up. After following the proper standardized procedure for direct pulp cap. In the current study direct pulp capping was performed using calcium hydroxide cement (Dycal)速 and Calcium Silicate cement (Biodentine)TM on 60 primary teeth of children equally divided between 2 study groups randomly of both the sexes aged 4-9 years old. Complete case history was recorded in detail and intraoral periapical radiograph was also taken for teeth indicated for direct pulp capping. Written consent was obtained from the parents of participants before starting the procedure. Strict standardized procedure had been followed and the pulp capping agent (Dycal速/BiodentineTM) were applied according to the manufacturer's instructions.Each patient was evaluated clinically and radiographically for any abnormal clinical signs and symptoms at 1,3 and 6 months postoperatively.Better results for the success of the study could be relatively enhanced by close attention to rigid criteria for case selection, standardization of direct pulp capping procedure and meticulous performance of the procedure appear to be prerequisites for successful treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Good health. 2. Cooperative behaviour. 3. Informed consent from parents. 4. Primary molars with clinically active caries. 5. No history of spontaneous pain in teeth. 6. Restorable tooth with at least one half of root length present. 7. Absence of pathological mobility. 8. Absence of tenderness to percussion. 9. Normal gingiva and periodontal condition without the sign of pathology such as redness and swelling of vestibule, draining sinus tract or sensitivity to palpate in the vestibule. In addition, the teeth treated by direct pulp capping had only a pin point mechanical exposure (0.5 to 1mm), for which haemorrhage control could be achieved within two minutes before proceeding with direct pulp capping. Radiographically, there was absence of internal resorption, external resorption, periapical or furcation radiolucencies and pathology of succedenous permanent tooth follicle. Patients with a history of spontaneous pain, tooth tender to percussion, absence of underlying permanent teeth, internal/external root resorption, apical/furcal lesions, sinus tract, physiologic or pathologic luxation, and/or presence of abscess were excluded from the study.</criteria>
