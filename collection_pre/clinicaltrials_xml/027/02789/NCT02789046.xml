	<brief_summary>The objective of the prospective multicenter observational study consists in defining a difficult intravenous access score in adult, during the preoperative period. The main objective: the outcome of interest is defined as failure of cannulation on first attempt. The risk factors of failure of cannulation on first attempt will be described. Adjusted multivariate models will be constructed. A prediction model will be proposed according to the transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis (TRIPOD)</brief_summary>
