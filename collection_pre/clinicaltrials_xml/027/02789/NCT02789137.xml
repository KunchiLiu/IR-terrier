	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to know about the quality of life of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who are being treated with sunitinib, pazopanib or sorafenib, and who suffer from fatigue and hand-foot syndrome, with personal inter-variability, and to explore measures that can be taken in terms of both everyday lifestyle and treatment to mitigate or cure such side effects that affect patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study On Fatigue- And Hand-Foot Syndrome-Related Quality Of Life In Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Receiving A Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor as First-Line Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective, multicentre, observational study in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) receiving a tyrosine kinase inhibitor as first-line treatment according to routine clinical practice, designed to evaluate the incidence of fatigue and hand-foot syndrome in order to determine how these affect the baseline characteristics of the patient and his/her disease (age, gender, baseline status, tumour histology, etc.) and the patient's lifestyle as such side effects develop. An exploratory analysis will be performed of measures that clinicians may adopt to improve patients' quality of life with regards to daytime naps, medication administration time, off-treatment periods, dose reductions and treatment breaks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients ≥ 18 years old and diagnosed with metastatic RCC who, in the investigator's opinion, are candidates for starting firstline treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor according to routine clinical practice. Patients who have no contraindications to the treatment. Baseline ECOG ≤ 2. Patients who are able to give informed consent on their own without the need for a legal representative. Committed patients who are able to complete the quality of life questionnaires and patient diary on their own without the need for a legal representative. Patients who are not candidates for firstline treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Patients who are receiving the treatment as secondline or subsequent therapy. Untreated hypothyroidism. Untreated severe anaemia. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. Myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) within the last 6 months. Severe hepatic impairment.
