	<brief_summary>The Investigator has chosen to study the reconstructive spinal surgery patient population because it is believed that the use of alvimopan in these patients at the University of Virginia will give the scientific community significant insight into the broader applicability of this drug into other surgical populations, the impact of this drug on the perception of pain (as opposed to simply the consumption of opioids), and its impact on total hospital charges, resource utilization, and functional outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Alvimopan in Major Spine Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain control following major spine surgery is difficult to achieve. Opiates are often necessary in high doses, and may be associated with significant side effects. Such side effects may include urinary retention, altered mental status, depressed respiratory drive, and constipation, and may lead to reduced nutritional intake in the postoperative period. Importantly, post-operative nutrition may impact the incidence of complications following spine surgery.1 Alvimopan is a peripheral-acting opiate antagonist designed to decrease the gastrointestinal complications of perioperative systemic opioid administration. Pain control following major spine surgery is difficult to achieve. Opiates are often necessary in high doses, and may be associated with significant side effects including constipation. Alvimopan is a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is used to help the bowel recover more quickly in patients who are having bowel surgery, so that they can eat solid foods and have regular bowel movements. Alvimopan is in a class of medications called peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists. It works by protecting the bowel from the constipation effects of opioid (narcotic) medications that are used to treat pain after surgery. The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of alvimopan in major spine surgery reduces the time to first bowel movement. By assessing the use of alvimopan in reconstructive spinal surgery patients, researchers hope to give the scientific community insight into the broader use of this drug in other surgical populations, as well as gathering information on the impact of hospital charges and overall post-operative patient satisfaction.</detailed_description>
