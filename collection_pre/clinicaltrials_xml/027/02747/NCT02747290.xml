	<brief_summary>This is an open-label positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) study to investigate the diagnostic performance and evaluation efficacy of 68Ga-NOTA-BBN-RGD in prostate cancer patients. A single dose of 111-148 Mega-Becquerel (MBq) 68Ga-NOTA-BBN-RGD will be injected intravenously. Visual and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the PET/CT images.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>68Ga-NOTA-BBN-RGD PET/CT in Prostate Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both GRPR and integrin αvβ3 are overexpressed in neoplastic cells of human prostate cancer. To target both receptors, a heterodimeric peptide BBN-RGD was synthesized from bombesin(7-14) and c(RGDyK) through a glutamate linker and then labeled with 68Ga. An open-label whole-body PET/ CT study was designed to investigate the safety and dosimetry of 68Ga-NOTA-BBN-RGD and diagnostic performance of 68Ga-NOTA-BBN-RGD PET/CT in patients with primary and/or metastasis prostate cancer.</detailed_description>
