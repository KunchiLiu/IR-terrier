	<brief_summary>Survivors of pediatric medulloblastoma (MB) are at-risk for neurocognitive and social deficits, including specific skills such as facial affect recognition which is the ability to recognize the emotional expressions of another person. Because the underlying mechanisms of these deficits are poorly understood, the investigators propose to examine social-cognitive skills (i.e. facial affect recognition) and indices of brain integrity, including an established core neural network of face perception in MB survivors and healthy controls. By comparing these outcomes between survivors of MB and healthy controls, investigators seek to identify the areas of the brain that help individuals recognize emotions. Primary Objective: - To evaluate social cognition in adolescent and young adult survivors of pediatric medulloblastoma. Secondary Objective: - To examine indices of brain integrity and function and their association with facial affect recognition in survivors of pediatric medulloblastoma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Comprehensive social-cognitive and behavioral data will be collected and structural and functional brain imaging will be completed in an attempt to determine if disruptions to brain integrity and function caused by prior treatment of medulloblastoma directly influence social-cognition and behavior in survivors. These outcomes will be compared between survivors and age-, gender-, and race-matched healthy community controls. Participants who meet eligibility criteria and consent will undergo neurocognitive (intelligence, attention, memory, processing speed, motor, executive function, and visuospatial) and social cognitive evaluations (affect recognition, prosody, social memory, withdrawal/isolation, loneliness, social anxiety, visuospatial, and executive function). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be completed during affect identification tasks to assess activation of the core face perception network. Magnetic resonance with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) will be obtained to quantify water diffusion within white matter tracts to assess white matter integrity and its association with functional outcomes.</detailed_description>
