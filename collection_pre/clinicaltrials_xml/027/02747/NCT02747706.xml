	<brief_summary>There are 7.1 million children with asthma. Asthma is the cause of 10.5 million missed days of school, 7.5 million outpatient visits, 640,000 ED visits, and 157,000 hospitalization visits in 2008. Recent work has demonstrated that trained peer mentors (individuals from the community) can be effective in reducing hospitalizations for asthmatic children. This study will evaluate the efficacy of technology-driven parent-to-parent mentoring to reduce asthma-related pediatric hospitalizations and emergency department visits.</brief_summary>
