Participants are adults or adolescents (16 year or older) who fulfill criteria for TTM according to DSM-IV. Inclusion started in January 2013 and will be completed by Mai 2016. Treatment is delivered at three treatment sites in Norway; in Kristiansand, Oslo, and Trondheim. Treatment is manualized, following the manual of Twohig and Woods, and consists of ten group sessions of three hours delivered at consecutive weeks, and two or three booster sessions during the first year after treatment. Treatment outcome is evaluated by three outcome measures; the Massachusetts General Hospital - Hairpulling Scale (self-report); the National Institute of Mental Health Trichotillomania Severity Scale (clinical interview, conducted by independent evaluators); and the Clinical Global Impression Scale for TTM. Outcome is measured at three points in time; at baseline, at the end of treatment, and at one-year follow-up. Mixed models procedures in SPSS is used to analyze longitudinal data. The first paper will be written on patients admitted to treatment from January 2013 to September 2014, and includes 53 patients (49 women and four men).
