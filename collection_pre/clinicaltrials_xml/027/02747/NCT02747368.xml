	<brief_summary>The aim is to study the use of Ocusweep system especially in driving health evaluation and compare the results produced by Ocusweep system to those of conventional devices. The main focus is in patients suffering from wet age-related macular degeneration. The study aims to find out how frequently these patients do not meet the European Union health criteria of safe driving and how Ocusweep finds these patients from a population of patients being treated in a busy medical retina clinic. The tests of Ocusweep system are compared against conventional visual field tests, contrast sensitivity tests, visual acuity tests and tests showing anatomical changes related to wet age-related macular degeneration (optical coherence tomography, fundus photography and fluorescein or indocyanine green angiography).</brief_summary>
