	<brief_summary>Background: Previous animal model studies at the University of Pittsburgh have shown a significant impact on inhibiting bladder over activity and increasing bladder capacity with neuromodulation techniques, specifically tibial nerve stimulation. This has been translated into adult clinical trials through the department of urology. Through the use of a commercially available subcutaneous nerve stimulator placed on the dorsum of the foot, researchers were able to demonstrate a significant increase in bladder capacity and the delay of voiding sensation for up to 5 hours after stimulation in eight healthy subjects. This prompted the clinical trial approved under IRB PRO13020474 which is currently enrolling patients. The incidence of night-time overactive bladder leading to nocturnal enuresis (bed wetting) is very common in the pediatric and teenage population, particularly in patients without daytime bladder over activity symptoms. When behavioral modification (i.e. refraining from night-time fluid consumption and bladder irritants, and bed wetting alarms for timed voiding) fails which it often does there is a paucity of effective and safe treatment options. Medications can be tried, but generally these are from the tricyclic antidepressant family and carry significant side effects limiting the use. Aim: Researchers aim to utilize the same technology currently being studied under IRB PRO14080250. Electrical stimulation will be applied to the foot via skin surface electrodes for a minimum of 1 hour before bed for 2 weeks to 5 normal subjects. Normal Subjects will be asked to complete a questionnaire about any skin irritation or experiences of toe twitching while wearing the newly designed TENS device, during a return visit with Dr. Stephany. The primary outcomes of this study are safety and functionality of the New TENS unit</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study: Foot Neuromodulation for Nocturnal Enuresis in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nocturnal Enuresis is a very common and difficult to treat problem in the pediatric population which can have significant negative impact on a child's quality of life. Apart from medications which can have significant side effects limiting the use, there is a lack of effective and safe treatment options for children with frequent nocturnal enuresis. If foot stimulation prior to bed does indeed improve the frequency of nocturnal enuresis, it may provide a safe and non-invasive therapeutic option. To achieve the aims Dr. Tai will work closely with Dr. Sun and Dr. Jia to design and develop a small, inexpensive, and easy-to-use stimulator for foot neuromodulation, and test its safety and usability in 5 healthy subjects for a 2-week period. . The straps in the design have three functions: 1) making an electrical connection to electrode, 2) securing the insole and the electronic unit, and 3) facilitating observation and hand access to the top panel for adjusting the stimulation strength.</detailed_description>
