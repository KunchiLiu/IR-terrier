	<brief_summary>Previously published studies have indicated that there exist difference in electrical properties (EPs), i.e., the conductivity and relative permittivity, between malignant and adjacent normal tissue, which will be useful in the early detection of cancers. However the EP information mainly based on ex vivo measurement of cancer tissues, and few data in vivo were published. The purpose of this study is to in vivo measure the electrical properties of the malignant tissues.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measuring the Electrical Properties of Malignant Tissues In Vivo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The measurements were safety guaranteed and were conducted during the cancer surgeries. Before the tissue was excised from the patient,the pathologist assisted the operator (already at the operating room) responsible for the measurement.The measurement of malignant and corresponding normal tissues were both performed. The tissues for dielectric properties measurement were classified as normal or malignant by the pathologist based on his own expertise and decision criteria (visual inspection, anatomy) and the per-operative histological examination. The measurements were directly performed on the tissue before excision.The sites of the measured malignant tissues were marked,doubletracked according to the pathological report to make sure the marked sites are malignant. The patient age and tissue temperature at the time of measurement were recorded.</detailed_description>
