	<brief_summary>A prospective, randomized, controlled open clinic trial to evaluate the effect and safety of combination of conventional hemodialysis(HD) and hemoperfusion(HP) on middle molecules removal and complications improvement in long-term maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. There are two phases of study for each subject. Phase 1 (screening phase). During this phase, each potential subject will be evaluated to determine if he/she is eligible for the study. Phase 2 (intervention phase). Each subject will be randomly allocated to HD+HP(HA130 once per week) group ,HD+HP(HA330 once per week) group and HD group. The follow-up duration was 3 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect and Safety of Hemodialysis and Hemoperfusion on Severe Renal Osteopathy and Itching in Uremia Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients recruited from these centers who met the inclusion criteria were randomly allocated to HD+HP(HA130 once per week) group ,HD+HP(HA330 once per week) group and HD group. The follow-up duration was 3 months. Hemoperfusion is performed by HA130 or HA330 resin adsorbents. Blood flow is 200ml/min，dialysate flow is 500ml/min， hemodialysis and hemoperfusion last for 2.5h，continue HD after removing the adsorbent to complete 4 hours'treatment.Heparin for anticoagulation ：first pulse 0.5-1mg/kg ，appending 8-10mg/h. Primary endpoint is the improvement of the clinic symptoms, meanwhile secondary endpoint is serum β2MG、iPTH、CRP、ADMA、BMP2 decrease compared with the baseline, life quality, nutrition condition, and cardiovascular (CVD) incidence.</detailed_description>
