	<brief_title>Comparison Between Kinesiotaping and Cold Therapy After Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been established as a valuable procedure patients with end-stage osteoarthritis and the rates of elective TKA are increasing steadily each year. Ninety percent of patients reported reduced pain, improved functional ability, and greater health related quality of life after TKA. Kinesiotaping (KT), a type of elastic tape that is being increasingly used for the management of pain and oedema after surgery 1. . Cold therapy (CT) can also help relieve pain and swelling during early postoperative period 2. . These two application may have impact on functional performance outcomes in patients with TKA. The number of studies that include KT in the rehabilitation process is increasing, but there isn't any study that compare KT application and CT after TKA. The aim was to compare the effectiveness of kinesiotaping and cold therapy on muscle strength and functional performance outcomes in patients with TKA during early postoperative period. Methods One-hundred-eleven patents with TKA are going to randomly assigned to control, KT and CT groups (nC=nKT=nCT=37). KT group are going to receive KT for lymphatic correction and rectus femoris facilitation technique. CT group are going to receive CT immediately after operation and following postoperative days. After surgery, all patients will receive standard post-operative treatment including continuous passive motion, active-assistive and active range of motion exercises, isometric and isotonic strengthening exercises, gait training and transfer training. After operation, pain intensity, active range of motion and knee function score [Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) score] Functional activities are going to evaluate using the Iowa Level of Assistance Scale, and walking speed was evaluated using the Iowa Ambulation Velocity Scale. Isometric muscle strength measure of quadriceps femoris and hamstring muscles assessed by Hand-Held Dynamometer. All measurements evaluated at the discharge. One way ANOVA is going to be used in statistical analysis.</detailed_description>
