	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, single center, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial comparing the efficacy of percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation to sham in the treatment of Bladder Pain Syndrome/Interstitial Cystitis (BPS/IC) through 12 weeks of therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PTNS Versus Sham Efficacy in Treatment of BPS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a pilot study to evaluate the efficacy of the systematic effects of posterior tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) treatment compared to an inactive sham intervention in female subjects with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) in an intent-to-treat analysis. The primary outcome measure will be the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) a single item questionnaire assessing overall impression of improvement over time at the initial 12 weeks endpoint. It is hypothesized that subjects randomized to the PTNS arm will demonstrate a greater improvement in both pain and quality of life scores, when compared with subjects who are randomized to the sham arm.</detailed_description>
