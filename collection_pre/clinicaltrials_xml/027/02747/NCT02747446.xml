	<brief_summary>The metabolic effects of 7-day weight-maintenance diets containing 10% total energy as acacia honey or a fructose:glucose mixture will be assessed in a group of healthy male volunteers. Primary outcome is plasma total triglyceride concentrations after ingestion of standardized breakfast and lunch containing 25% energy as honey or fructose:glucose mixture; secondary outcome is glucose tolerance and suppression of endogenous glucose production after ingestion of 75 g glucose. Results obtained with 10% honey and 10% fructose: glucose mixture diets will be compared to results obtained with a weight-maintenance, isocaloric diet in which starch is substituted for honey or fructose:glucose mixture</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eight health males volunteers will be studied three times in a randomized order - Honey: volunteers will be fed a weight-maintenance diet containg 5% sugars, 20% starch, 25% acacia honey, 35% fat and 15% protein during 6 days (day 1-6); On day 7, their plasma metabolites and hormones concentrations will be monitored over 10 hours during which they will receive a breakfast and a lunch containing honey; on day 8, they will have a 75g oral glucose4 + 375 mg 13C-labelled glucose tolerance test, and their plasma glucose and insulin concentrations will be monitored over 4 hours; glucose kinetics will be measured by 6,6 deuterated glucose - FG: volunteers will be fed a weight-maintenance diet containg 5% sugars, 20% starch, and 25% of a fructose:glucose mixture matching the composition of acacia honey, 35% fat and 15% protein during 6 days (day 1-6); On day 7, their plasma metabolites and hormones concentrations will be monitored over 10 hours during which they will receive a breakfast and a lunch containing fructose and glucose; on day 8, they will have a 75g oral glucose + 375 mg 13C-labelled glucose tolerance test, and their plasma glucose and insulin concentrations will be monitored over 4 hours; glucose kinetics will be measured by 6,6 deuterated glucose - Control: volunteers will be fed a weight-maintenance diet containg 5% sugars, 45% starch, 35% fat and 15% protein during 6 days (day 1-6); On day 7, their plasma metabolites and hormones concentrations will be monitored over 10 hours during which they will receive a breakfast and a lunch with no added sugar; on day 8, they will have a 75g oral glucose + 375 mg 13C-labelled glucose tolerance test, and their plasma glucose and insulin concentrations will be monitored over 4 hours; glucose kinetics will be measured by 6,6 deuterated glucose</detailed_description>
