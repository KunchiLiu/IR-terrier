	<brief_summary>Sixty patients aged between 60 and 75 years old of both sex of ASA physical status I and II were included in this randomized study who were divided into the study group of 30 patients who had been transfused autologous blood and the control group of 30 patients who had been transfused only allogeneic blood. Parenteral iron preparation was given to all patients of the study group after each donation. Intraoperatively all patients of the study group received 2 grams of intravenous tranexamic acid. This study was conducted through the laboratory analysis of the hemoglobin and the hematocrit values during blood donation and for both groups in the pre-operative and the post-operative period and the assessment of the amount of transfused blood units in both groups.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Elective revision total hip replacement surgery was performed in 60 patients aged between 60 and 75 years old of both sex of ASA physical status I and II of 7090 kg body weight and height 160180 cm. This study excluded cases of revision total hip arthroplasty (RTHA) for infection or fractures as well as early revisions for dislocations secondary to implant malposition. Preoperative autologous blood donation was not done in patients with cardiac decompensation, severe hemodynamic problems, respiratory insufficiency, severe defect of central nervous system, active infection, blood disease or coagulopathies.</criteria>
