	<brief_title>A Trial of SHR3680 in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer as Monotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consists of 2 phases. In the dose escalation phase, up to 6 dose levels of SHR3680 (40 mg/day, 80 mg/day, 160 mg/day, 240 mg/day, 360 mg/day, 480 mg/day) will be investigated with a sequential "3+3" design (3 or 6 participants in each dose level). There will be a single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) run-in period (7 days). Following the first dose, participants will enter a 1 week treatment-free period to evaluate safety and single-dose PK. If not dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are observed during the 1-week period, SHR3680 administration will resume at the same dose level. In the expansion phase, up to 12 additional participants will be enrolled at the MTD or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). The purpose of the expansion part of the study is to explore the clinical benefits of SHR3680 and to further identify its PK features.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male 18 to 80 years of age. 2. Ability to understand the purposes and risks of the trial and his signed informed consent form approved (ICF) by the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) of the trial site and obtained before entering the trial 3. Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without neuroendocrine differentiation or small cell features. 4. For patients who have not had an orchiectomy, there must be a plan to maintain effective GnRHanalogue therapy for the duration of the trial. 5. Serum testosterone level &lt;1.7 nmol/L (50 ng/dL) at the screening visit. 6. Ongoing androgen deprivation therapy with a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue or orchiectomy (i.e., surgical or medical castration). 7. Progressive disease by PSA or imaging after docetaxelbased chemotherapy in the setting of medical or surgical castration. Prior enzalutamide is allowed as long as patients had a PSA response &gt;50% or were treated for at least 6 months. Disease progression for study entry is defined as one or more of the following 3 criteria: PSA progression defined by a minimum of three rising PSA levels with an interval of ≥1 week between each determination. The PSA value at the Screening visit should be ≥2 ng/mL. Soft tissue disease progression defined by RECIST. Bone disease progression defined by two or more new lesions on bone scan 8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. 9. Life expectancy of at least 6 months. 10. Able to swallow the study drug and comply with the study requirements. 11. Acceptable liver function defined below: Total bilirubin ≤1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2 times ULN; however, ≤5 times ULN in a participant who has liver metastases or treated with biliary drainage. 12. Acceptable renal function: serum creatinine ≤1.5 times ULN. 13. Acceptable hematologic status (without hematologic support including hematopoietic factor, blood transfusion) defined below: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1500/μL Platelet count ≥100,000/μL Hemoglobin ≥9.0 dL 1. Treatment with androgen receptor antagonists (enzalutamide, bicalutamide, flutamide, nilutamide), 5alpha reductase inhibitors (finasteride, dutasteride), estrogens, or chemotherapy within 4 weeks of enrollment (Day 1 visit) or plans to initiate treatment with any of these drugs during the study. Ongoing therapy with biphosphonates or Rank Ligand inhibitors are acceptable. 2. Treatment with therapeutic immunizations for prostate cancer (e.g.,PROVENGE®) or plans to initiate treatment with any of these treatments during the study. 3. Metastases in the brain or active epidural disease (Note: patients with treated epidural disease are allowed). 4. Use of herbal products that may PSA levels (e.g., saw palmetto) or systemic corticosteroids greater than the equivalent of 10 mg of prednisone/prednisolone per day within 4 weeks of enrollment (day 1 visit) or plans to initiate treatment with any of these therapies during the study. 5. History of another malignancy within the previous 5 years other than curatively treated nonmelanomatous skin cancer. 6. Radiation therapy within 3 weeks (if single fraction of radiotherapy within 2 weeks) and radionuclide therapy within 8 weeks of enrollment (Day 1 visit). 7. Have used or plan to use from 30 days prior to enrollment (day 1 visit) through to the end of the study medications known to lower the seizure threshold or prolong the QT interval. 8. Cardiac disease with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV, including congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to the trial entry, unstable arrhythmia, or symptomatic peripheral arterial vascular disease. 9. Severe concurrent disease, infection, or comorbidity that, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for enrollment. 10. History of seizure, including any febrile seizure, loss of consciousness, or transient ischemic attack within 12 months of enrollment (Day 1 visit), or any condition that may predispose to seizure. 11. Use of an investigational agent within 4 weeks of enrollment or plans to initiate treatment with an investigational agent during the study. 12. Major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery, within 4 weeks prior to trial entry, without complete recovery. 13. Gastrointestinal disorder affecting absorption. 14. Structurally unstable bone lesions suggesting impending fracture.</criteria>
