	<brief_summary>Anecdotal data suggest that the buffered form of the local anesthetic is more potent at equal dosages, and a lower dosage of the buffered drug might be used with an effect equal to higher dosage not buffered. Clinical data are needed to confirm these anecdotal data. No published data exist comparing buffered local anesthetics at lower drug concentrations to current dosages commonly used in dental and oral surgical procedures</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Outcomes Maxilla: Buffered 1% Lidocaine vs. Non-buffered 2% Lidocaine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims: Compare clinical depths of pulpal anesthesia for maxillary molar and canine teeth at 30min intervals post injection after maxillary field block anesthesia with buffered 1% lidocaine with 1/100,000 epinephrine as compared to non-buffered 2% lidocaine with 1/100,000 epinephrine. Hypotheses: No differences exist in anesthetic depth for pulpal anesthesia after intraoral injection for maxillary field block anesthesia between buffered 1% lidocaine with 1/100,000 epinephrine as compared to non-buffered 2% lidocaine with 1/100,000 epinephrine. Study Time Frame: 6 months: Month One Recruit 24 volunteers as subjects, Prepare case-books. Months Two-Three Clinical Study. Months Four-Five Analyze Lab data. Month Six Prepare Abstracts, Papers Methods: Blinded, Randomized Clinical Design, Recruit subjects with Institutional Review Board approved consent at University of North Carolina. Subjects will serve as their own controls in a cross-over AB/BA study design which is uniform within sequences, uniform within periods, and balanced. Randomized subjects to be injected orally for maxillary field block (Posterior alveolar, Anterior alveolar, Palatal sensory nerves) alternatively with 4cc of buffered 1% lidocaine with 1/100,000 epinephrine and 4cc non-buffered of 2% lidocaine with 1/100,000 epinephrine. Assessment: pre, and post-anesthetic administration for pulpal anesthesia with cold, electronic pulp test at maxillary molar and canine at 30 minute intervals.</detailed_description>
