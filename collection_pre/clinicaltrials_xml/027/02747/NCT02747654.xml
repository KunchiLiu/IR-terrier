	<brief_summary>Isoniazid (INH) is an essential component of first-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) treatment. However, treatment with INH is complicated by polymorphisms in the expression of the enzyme system primarily responsible for its elimination, N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2), and its associated hepatotoxicity. The objective of this study was to develop an individualized INH dosing regimen using a pharmacogenetic-driven model and to apply this regimen in a pilot study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Eligible participants were patients newly diagnosed with active TB Who underwent standard four drug treatment for 6months: isoniazid (5 mg/kg, usually 300 mg), rifampin (450 mg for &lt;50 kg or 600 mg for 50 kg body weight), ethambutol(15mg/kg), and pyrazinamide (20 30 mg/kg) Given daily for two months and followed by isoniazid and rifampin with or without ethambutol for four months. Those patients with abnormal hepatic function on laboratory testing (increased serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, or total bilirubin) before antiTB treatment, underlying liver disease or systemic illness such as congestive heart failure, acute lifethreatening disease, or alcoholism, or disease that was resistant to INH at the start of treatment were excluded.</criteria>
