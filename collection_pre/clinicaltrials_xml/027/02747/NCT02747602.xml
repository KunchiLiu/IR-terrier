Seated blood pressure is less than 90/40 mmHg or greater than 140/90 mmHg at screening. 10. Seated heart rate is lower than 40 bpm or higher than 99 bpm at screening. 11. QTc interval is &gt;460 msec (males) or has ECG findings deemed abnormal with clinical significance by the PI or designee at screening. 12. Estimated creatinine clearance ≤80 mL/min at screening. 13. Unable to refrain from or anticipates the use of any drug, including prescription and nonprescription medications, herbal remedies, or vitamin supplements beginning 14 days prior to the first dose and throughout the study. Acetaminophen (up to 2 g per 24 hour period) and medications for the treatment of adverse events may be permitted during the study. 14.
