	<brief_summary>The aim of this randomized clinical trial is to compare the antibacterial effects of 1% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) during retreatment of teeth with apical periodontitis (AP).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antibacterial Effectiveness of Two Root Canal Irrigants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Root canal-treated teeth with AP were randomly distributed in two groups according to the irrigant used. After removal of the previous filling material, bacteriological samples were taken from the canals before (S1) and after chemomechanical preparation using either NaOCl or CHX (S2), and after calcium hydroxide medication for 2-3 weeks (S3). 16S rRNA gene-based real-time qPCR was performed to detect and quantify total bacteria, Streptococcus species and Enterococcus faecalis.</detailed_description>
