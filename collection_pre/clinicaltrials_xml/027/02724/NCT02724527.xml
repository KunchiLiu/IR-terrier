	<brief_summary>Cavosonstat (N91115) is being studied as a potential novel therapy for cystic fibrosis (CF), and this study assesses a target population of patients who are heterozygous for F508del-CFTR and a gating mutation that is approved for treatment with ivacaftor (G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, or S549R).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Cavosonstat (N91115) in CF Patients Who Are Heterozygous for F508del-CFTR and a Gating Mutation and Being Treated With Ivacaftor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Assess the effect of Cavosonstat (N91115) on lung function when added to preexisting treatment with ivacaftor in adult patients with CF who are heterozygous for F508del-CFTR and a gating mutation that is approved for treatment with ivacaftor (G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, or S549R).</detailed_description>
