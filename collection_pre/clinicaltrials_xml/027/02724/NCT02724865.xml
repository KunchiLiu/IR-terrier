	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common chronic sleep disorder that often requires lifelong care. The prevalence in the Netherlands is estimated around 300.000 patients. Due to longer life expectancy and increase in weight in the general population, its prevalence is expected to rise. Patients with mild and moderate OSA are treated primarily with an oral appliance at present time. Different oral appliances are available, but most used is the mandibular advancement device (MAD). This study focuses on two different types of MAD: the classic Herbst appliance, which is attached to the mandible and the maxilla and has an iron bar to regulate the open space; and the Somnodent, which consists of two separate splints, fixed on the mandible and the maxilla, but has no iron bar attached.</brief_summary>
