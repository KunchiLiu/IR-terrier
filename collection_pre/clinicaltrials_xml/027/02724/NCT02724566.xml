	<brief_summary>Preclinical studies have demonstrated in mouse models that (PYR1)-apelin-13 exerts a glucose-regulating action in vivo. The (PYR1)-apelin-13 effect on insulin sensitivity in healthy overweighed volunteers has been previously assessed in a phase I clinical trial (APELINS study; NCT02033473). The APELINS-2 clinical trial aims to expand the initial proof of concept to the population targeted by future innovative insulin-sensitizing therapies: patients living with type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Insulin sensitivity is measured using the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp method. The hypothesis of the investigators is that a continuous (pyr1)-apelin-13 infusion improves insulin sensitivity of type 2 diabetic patients compared to placebo infusion. This study could bring new elements for understanding the pathophysiology of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus in humans and could lead to the development of innovative therapies in type 2 diabetes mellitus.</detailed_description>
