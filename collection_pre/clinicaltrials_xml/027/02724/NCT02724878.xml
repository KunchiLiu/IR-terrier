	<brief_title>Study of Atezolizumab + Bevacizumab in Patients With Advanced Non-Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. In this research the investigators are studying the combination of Atezolizumab with Bevacizumab. Participants will receive both vascular endothelial targeted therapy and immunotherapy. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Atezolizumab for Advanced Non-Clear Cell Kidney Cancer, but it has been approved for other uses. The FDA has approved Bevacizumab with Interferon (IFNα) as a treatment option for Advanced Kidney Cancer.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Unresectable advanced or metastatic nonclear cell renal cell carcinoma to include but not limited to: Papillary renal cell carcinoma, any type Unclassified renal cell carcinoma Translocation renal cell carcinoma Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma Collecting duct renal cell carcinoma Medullary renal cell carcinoma Clear cell renal cell carcinoma or any histology with ≥ 20% sarcomatoid features will be eligible. Other nonclear cell histologies that are not included above need to be discussed with the Principal Investigator. Request for formalinfixed, paraffinembedded (FFPE) archival tumor specimens if available and willingness of the participant to undergo mandatory fresh tumor biopsy unless determined medically unsafe or not feasible. Participants with no available archival tumor tissue will be required to undergo a fresh tumor biopsy at baseline. A note from the study team should be provided documenting availability of tissue. The archival specimen should contain adequate viable tumor tissue. The specimen may consist of a tissue block (preferred and should contain the highest grade of tumor) or at least 30 unstained serial sections. Fineneedle aspiration, brushings, cell pellet from pleural effusion, bone marrow aspirate/biopsy are not acceptable. Fresh tumor biopsy at progression will be required in cases where patients experience relapse after an initial response if medically safe. Measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≤ 2. Adequate hematologic and endorgan function as defined by the following laboratory results obtained within 28 days prior to the first study treatment: Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500 cells/uL. Lymphocyte count ≥ 500/uL. Platelet count ≥ 100,000/uL. Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL (patients may be transfused to meet this criterion). Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal with the following exceptions: Patients with documented liver metastases should have aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase ≤ 5 x upper limit of normal. Serum bilirubin ≤ 2.0 x upper limit of normal with the following exception: Patients with known Gilbert's disease should have a serum bilirubin ≤ 3 x upper limit of normal. Serum albumin &gt; 2.5 g/dL. Creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min as calculated by CockcroftGault equation. For female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with partners of childbearing potential, agreement (by patient and/or partner) to use highly effective forms of contraception and to continue its use 6 months after the last dose of atezolizumab or bevacizumab. Signed informed consent form. Ability and capacity to comply with study and followup procedures. Prior treatment with CD137 agonists, anti cytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated protein 4, antiprogrammed death1, or antiprogrammed death ligand1 therapeutic antibody or pathway targeting agents. Prior interferon alpha or interleukin2 is allowed following 4 week washout from treatment start. Prior therapy with Bevacizumab. Thrombologics event within 3 weeks of treatment start date or stability of anticoagulation for 2 weeks. Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medications including but not limited to: prednisone, dexamethasone, cyclosporin, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, antitumor necrosis factor agents, hydroxychloroquine within 2 weeks of first study dose. Patients who have received acute, lowdose systemic immunosuppressant medications may be enrolled. Patients with adrenal insufficiency on physiologic replacement doses of steroids may be enrolled. The use of inhaled, topical intraocular, or intraarticular corticosteroids ormineralocorticoids are allowed. Radiotherapy for renal cell carcinoma within 14 days of first study treatment with the exception of a single fraction of radiation administered for palliation of symptoms. Known active metastases to the brain, spinal cord or leptomeninges unless adequately treated with radiotherapy, radiosurgery, or surgery and stable for at least 4 weeks of first study treatment as documented by magnetic resonance imaging or computerized tomography imaging and having no ongoing requirement for steroids. Malignancies other than renal cell carcinoma within 2 years of first study treatment with the exception of those with negligible risk of metastases or death (carcinoma in situ of the cervix, basal or squamous cell skin cancer, localized prostate cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast, nonmuscle invasive urothelial carcinoma, or other malignancy not deemed to impact that patients 5year life expectancy. Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible if they have been diseasefree for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. In addition, individuals with the following cancer are eligible regardless of when they were diagnosed and treated: cervical cancer in situ, basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.
