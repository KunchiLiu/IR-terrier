	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of single-agent MLN0128 and the combination of MLN0128 + MLN1117 compared with everolimus in the treatment of participants with metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (mccRCC) that have progressed on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MLN0128 and MLN0128 + MLN1117 Compared With Everolimus in the Treatment of Adults With Advanced or Metastatic Clear-Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drugs being tested in this study are called MLN0128 and MLN1117. MLN0128 and MLN1117 are being tested to treat people who have mccRCC. This study will assess the efficacy and safety of MLN0128 and MLN1117 as well as how it is processed by the body in participants with advanced or mccRCC. The study will enroll approximately 189 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groups: - Everolimus 10 mg once daily (QD) - MLN0128 30 mg once weekly (QW) - MLN0128 4 mg + MLN1117 200 mg QD x 3 days per week All participants will be asked to take the study drug at the same time on each scheduled day. This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this study is 2 years after last participant is randomized, or when the last participant discontinues study treatment (approximately 3 years). Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic including a follow-up visit 30 to 40 days after receiving their last dose of study drug or prior to start of subsequent anticancer therapy for safety assessment. Participants will then be followed for Progression Free and Overall Survival.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female participants aged 18 years or older. 2. Histologically confirmed renal cell carcinoma with a clearcell component. 3. Evidence that the renal cell carcinoma is advanced or metastatic. 4. Radiologic evidence of progressive disease (according to [RECIST Version 1.1) either during or within 6 months after stopping their most recent systemic therapy for RCC before enrollment into this study. 5. At least 1, prior line of VEGFtargeted therapy, but not more than 4 total prior lines of systemic therapy. Exposure to more than 1 line of VEGFtargeted therapy is acceptable. Participants may also have received prior therapies with interferon, interleukin 2 (IL2), antiPD1 antibodies, cabozantinib or other experimental agents, but not prior therapy with any agent that targets phosphoinositide 3kinase (PI3K) , serine/threoninespecific protein kinase (AKT), or mechanistic (or mammalian) target of rapamycin (mTOR). 6. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥70%. 7. Life expectancy of ≥3 months. 8. Female participants who: Are postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, OR Are surgically sterile, OR If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 1 highly effective method of contraception, and 1 additional effective (barrier) method, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent through 90 days (or longer, as mandated by local labeling [eg, United States Prescribing Information (USPI), Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), etc;]) after the last dose of study drug, OR Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods],withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female and male condoms should not be used together.) Male participants, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy), who: Agree to practice highly effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 120 days after the last dose of study drug (or longer, as mandated by local labeling [eg, USPI, SmPC, etc]), OR Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner], withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female and male condoms should not be used together.) Agree not to donate sperm during the course of this study or within 120 days after receiving their last dose of study drug. 9. Suitable venous access for the studyrequired blood sampling. 10. Screening clinical laboratory values: Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 2000/μL and platelet count ≥100,000/μL; Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 X the upper limit of normal (ULN); Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN; Estimated creatinine clearance by CockcroftGault ≥40 mL/min/1.73m^2; Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) &lt;7.0%, fasting serum glucose ≤ 130 mg/dL, and fasting triglycerides ≤ 300 mg/dL. 11. At least 14 days since the end of prior systemic VEGFtargeted treatment (ie, sunitinib, pazopanib, axitinib, or sorafenib), radiotherapy, or surgical procedure with resolution of all treatmentrelated toxicity (except alopecia and hypothyroidism) either to Grade 0 or 1 (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE] Version 4.03) or to baseline. 12. At least 21 days since the last dose of bevacizumab, other antibody, or interferon. 13. Voluntary written consent given before performance of any studyrelated procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the participant at any time without prejudice to future medical care. 1. Central nervous system (CNS) metastasis. 2. Other clinically significant comorbidities, such as uncontrolled pulmonary disease, active CNS disease, active infection, or any other condition that might compromise the participant's participation in the study. 3. Known human immunodeficiency virus infection. 4. Known hepatitis B surface antigenpositive, or known or suspected active hepatitis C infection. 5. Treatment with strong inhibitors and/or inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19 within 1 week preceding the first dose of study drug. 6.
