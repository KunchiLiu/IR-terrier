	<brief_summary>SIGNIFICANCE Since the introduction of the first Laryngeal Mask Airway, the Classic LMA, the use of Supraglottic airway (SGA) devices has experienced a remarkable evolution, and SGAs are now routinely used in clinical anesthesia. Some of the newer SGAs have a built-in gastric drainage channel to facilitate efflux of gastric fluid and gas, and to allow the insertion of a gastric tube. These devices are referred to as "Second Generation SGAs". One of the SGAs on the market is the LMA Supreme which is a single-use modification of the older, reusable LMA Proseal (Teleflex). The Supreme has a pre-curved rigid airway tube similar to the Ambu Aura SGAs. The concept of a curved airway tube is to imitate the airway anatomy during device placement, thus making insertion relatively easy and smooth. Due to the similarities between the AuraGain and the Supreme, a randomized, prospective clinical study with a detailed evaluation of the performance of these two devices will be conducted. A clinical evaluation of device insertion and function, both as a ventilatory device and an intubation conduit, oropharyngeal Leak Pressure (OLP), and functionality of the gastric drainage channel will be performed in elective patients with normal airway anatomy. Moreover, a fiberoptic assessment of the glottic view via the SGA device and signs of airway morbidity will be investigated. SPECIFIC AIMS The purpose of this study is to compare, the use of the Ambu AuraGain and Teleflex LMA Supreme regarding OLP, rate of successful intubation and ventilation, ease of SGA insertion, anatomical fit of the SGA, functionality of gastric drainage channel, and post-operative complications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ambu Auragain Vs Teleflex LMA Supreme Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims of Evaluation: - Glottic view via SGA by fiberoptic assessment. - SGA ease of insertion, Rate of successful intubation, functionality as a ventilation device. - Functionality of gastric drainage channel &amp; intubation conduit. - OLP - Oropharyngeal Leak Pressure. - Post-operative complications &amp; airway morbidity CRF: Age, Gender, Height, Weight, BMI, Fasting time, ASA, Mallampati, TM, SM and Interincisor distance, lower jaw protrusion. aScope Preparation Procedures: - Inspect scope for: damage, mechanical performance (110 ͦ flexion), monitor connection. - Evaluate picture quality: (contrast, light), place 1 cm from black letters on white background. - Lubricate insertion cord. - Place lubricated ETT tube without ISO connector on proximal portion of insertion cord. - When aScope fulfills functional criteria, place on prep. Table and turn off. Clean with alcohol wipe. - Pre-lubricate the SGA Patient: - Monitoring: 3 lead ECG / Pulse Oximetry / BP/ End-expiratory gas analysis - Record @ Pre-induction, Pre-Oxygenation, Post-induction, post-SGA insertion, 10 min after, q15min, PACU - Supine position - Circuit filled w/ 100% O2, 10 L/m (EtO2) - Preoxygenation by facemask (3min) - Induction: Fentanyl 1 µ/kg IV &amp; Propofol 1.5-2.0 mg/kg IV - Vital signs - No evidence of eyelash reflex and assurance of mask ventilation - Paralysis: Rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg IV - Attach "ToF" Train of Four twitch monitor I. Adequacy of Device Placement and Ventilation Insertion of SGA: - Sniffing Position. - Lubricate posterior surface of SGA. - T1 Start: tip of cuff touching patient's lips. T1 Stop: appearance of the first square end tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) trace. - Place cuff at anterior hard palate, using index finger of dominant hand to push device into hypo-pharynx. - During insertion- tip of cuff pressed upwards against hard palate and cuff flattened against it. - Use Jaw lift technique if necessary. - Confirm placement of SGA: teeth between bite absorption marks indicated on proximal end of SGA &amp; Quantitative waveform capnography. - No appearance of CO2 curve suggests incomplete placement of SGA. Remove SGA and Re-attempt. - An insertion ATTEMPT is when the SGA touches the patient's lips to the first complete CO2 trace. - A FAILED insertion is the need for &gt; 3 attempts or if the entire process exceeds 180 seconds. - Inflate SGA cuff to 60 cm H2O (aneroid manometer). *Note* volume of air. - Secure SGA to patient's cheek w/ tape. - Record position optimizing maneuvers: adjustments to head/neck, additional jaw lift, depth of insertion, lateral insertion technique, changing size of SGA. Fiber-optic evaluation of the SGAs anatomical position: - Determine laryngeal view after ventilation achieved. - Record Maximal optical view; POGO score and presence of blood. - If epiglottis is down-folded, perform jaw lift, and reassess POGO. - Use channel of aScope to remove secretions, blood or debris. - Remove aScope and use the suction catheter if this fails. - Clean lens of aScope w/ alcohol wipe before new attempt. Investigation of the Functionality of the gastric drainage channel of the SGAs: - W/ a pre-lubricated gastric tube; (16 Fr./ Ambu Auragain) &amp; (14 Fr./ Teleflex LMA Supreme). - Pass tube through gastric drainage channel to depth of 40-50 cm. - Confirm placement w/ (1) stethoscope &amp; (2) aspiration of gastric contents. - Minimum of 2 ml. of gastric content is needed to confirm placement w/o audible leak. - An insertion ATTEMPT is when the tip of the G-tube touches the proximal channel. - An insertion FAILURE is the inability to: (1) pass G-tube to appropriate depth, (2) auscultate inflated air, (3) aspirate gastric contents. - Record volume of air evacuated, volume of gastric contents, number of insertion attempts, ease of insertion of gastric tube and fluid observed in gastric channel. Measurement of the oropharyngeal leak pressure (OLP): - Record prior to surgical incision and at the end of surgery. - Close adjustable pressure-limiting valve w/ a fresh gas flow of 3 L/min. *Note* pressure at equilibrium. - Maximum pressure allowed is 40 cm H2O. - Auscultate epigastrium during measurement to detect air entrainment into stomach. - Record OLP and audible leaks (stomach, mouth). II. Use of SGA as an Intubation Conduit AuraGain Procedure: - Lubricate airway tube of SGA &amp; pass the aScope through until visualization of the carina. - Mallinckrodt size 7.0 mm ETT for females and a 8.0 mm ETT for males. - Pass ETT tube down the insertion cord of the aScope &amp; verify placement. - Inflate cuff and remove aScope. LMA Supreme Procedure: - Mount the (AIC) Aintree Catheter over the aScope &amp; insert assembly through SGA into trachea. - Withdraw aScope/ SGA &amp; pass a maximum recommended ETT over the AIC into trachea. - An ATTEMPT is when the tip of the ETT touches the SGA connector and advanced inside the SGA. - If an UNSUCCESSFUL attempt occurs, withdraw the ETT from SGA. Re-attempt. - Only 3 attempts w/ 2 differently sized SGAs permitted to place device. - Perform standard endotracheal intubation if unsuccessful after 3 attempts. - Record intubation time (tip of aScope touching SGA connector until endoscopic confirmation of placement). - Record: Size of SGA, Size of ETT, number of intubation attempts. - Qualitative Assessment of: Ease of intubation 1-5 (1: Very Easy, 2: Easy, 3: Slight Resistance, 4: Difficult, 5: Not Possible.) Removal of the ETT where the AuraGain has been used as an intubation conduit: Extubation procedure: - Inflate cuff of SGA to pressure of 60 cm H20. (measure w/ aneroid manometer). - Deflate completely cuff of ETT and remove. Continue ventilation w/ SGA. - Record Time of SGA cuff re-inflation &amp; ETT removal. - Record OLP. Removal of the SGA: - Remove "partially deflated" AuraGain at end of surgery w/ patient awake and upon Return of Spontaneous Respiration. - Remove "partially deflated" LMA Supreme during intubation procedure, while leaving the AIC in place. - Inspect SGAs for blood. Postoperative Complications: - Transport patient to PACU on 100% O2. - Obtain VS &amp; assess sore throat w/ VAS score 1-5 (1: No pain, 5: Severe) - Assess post-op sore throat, dysphonia, dysphagia, mucosal, lip, lingual, dental injury or bronchospasm 45 minutes after recovery. - Rescue analgesia chosen by investigator. If patient is asleep, analgesic will be given at discretion of attending. - Record VS and pain q30min. until discharge from PACU.</detailed_description>
