	<brief_title>Implementation of Brief Insomnia Treatments - Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTI) is the evidence-based first line treatment for chronic insomnia. Randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have established that CBTI is efficacious and effective. Despite the strong evidence for CBTI, chronic insomnia remains under-treated among Veterans because of several barriers that limit access to behavioral treatments. In recent years, the VA has taken substantial measures to train more clinicians to provide insomnia treatment; however, a deficit in treatment availability remains. In 2011, the VA began to train clinicians in CBTI as part of the VA's Evidence Based Psychotherapy (EBP) training program, with a goal to train 1000 clinicians. Even with 1000 VA clinicians trained in CBTI, a shortage of clinicians will likely remain due to the high prevalence of insomnia. High prevalence and a shortage of clinicians prevent the VA from meeting the care demand of Veterans with insomnia. While the CBTI roll-out is a significant investment from the VA, additional mechanisms, such as dissemination and implementation of other evidence-based treatments for insomnia with fewer implementation barriers, must be considered to address the high prevalence of insomnia. The in-person delivery and length of treatment for CBTI may be one of barriers to accessing care. Briefer protocols that use multiple delivery modalities have recently been developed and may help to increase session attendance and treatment completion. These shorter insomnia treatments are often referred to as Brief Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia (BBTI) and consist of ≤4 sessions. Besides fewer and briefer sessions, and utilizing both in-person and phone delivery of treatment, BBTI also emphasizes the behavioral components of CBTI (i.e., stimulus control and sleep restriction) rather than a combined approach focusing on both behavioral and cognitive components. BBTI is efficacious in adults—studies with older adults and Veterans found BBTI resulted in a significant decrease in insomnia severity with Cohen's d effect sizes in the moderate to large range. Like CBTI, BBTI significantly improves insomnia severity and may also help to improve secondary outcomes like depression and anxiety. Integration of newer insomnia treatments, like BBTI, will first depend on establishing its evidence directly compared to CBTI. Effectiveness trials of BBTI, especially those conducted with military Veterans in typical VA settings, have yet to be conducted. Before BBTI can be broadly implemented and integrated into the VA, it needs to be established as a clinically effective treatment for insomnia among Veterans and a statistically non-inferior treatment (not necessarily better or worse) for Veterans compared to CBTI.</detailed_description>
