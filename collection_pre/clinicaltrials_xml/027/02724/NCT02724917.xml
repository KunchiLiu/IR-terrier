	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of APN1125 in Subjects With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety profile, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of APN1125 following 14 days of once-daily oral dosing in subjects with schizophrenia on stable second-generation antipsychotic therapy. This is a randomized, double-blind, 2-week, multiple ascending dose study of APN1125. This study will enroll up to three sequential cohorts of subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia, each randomly assigned to receive one of three doses (low, medium, or high) of APN1125 or matching placebo. Following admission to an Early Phase Clinical Unit (EPCU), APN1125 will be administered once daily for 2 weeks. All subjects will remain confined to the EPCU for a total of 20 days, consisting of admission, dosing and observation periods.</detailed_description>
