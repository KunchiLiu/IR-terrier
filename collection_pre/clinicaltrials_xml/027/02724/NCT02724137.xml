	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to: 1. Determine whether the Physical Therapy (PT) &amp; Fitbit® intervention should proceed to a full-scale clinical trial. This decision will be based on three hypotheses: Treatment promise (Hypothesis 1A): People in the PT &amp; Fitbit® will walk 1250 more steps/day and spend 7 min/day more in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) than the control at discharge and at 6 months, Safety (Hypothesis 1B): &lt; 5% will have adverse events because of the intervention, Recruitment (Hypothesis 1C): 75 recruited, 90% to complete trial, and 85% complete visit at 6 months. 2. To evaluate the short- and long-term adherence of the PT &amp; Fitbit® intervention. Short-term Adherence (Hypothesis 2A): 90% of subjects in the PT&amp; Fitbit® group will wear the Fitbit® and participate in goal setting and behavioral counseling while in PT. Long-term Adherence (Hypothesis 2B): 75% of PT &amp; Fitbit® will wear the Fitbit® at 6 months. 3. To quantify changes in potential underlying mechanisms for increased physical activity. Hypothesis 3: Change in self-efficacy for physical activity, walking endurance and participation in daily activities will be associated with improvements in physical activity.</brief_summary>
