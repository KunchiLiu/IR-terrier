	<brief_title>The Effect of Red Blood Cells Storage Duration on Biochemical Changes in Pediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- A pretransfusion draw of a few drops of patient venous blood, send for analysis by i-STAT Portable Clinical Analyser. Samples are processed immediately and provide laboratory quality results in 2 minutes using the CHEM 8+ i-STAT cartridge for measurement of: 1. Potassium (K) 2. Ionized Calcium (iCa) 3. Glucose (Glu) 4. Urea Nitrogen (BUN)/Urea 5. Hemoglobin (Hb) and Hematocrit (Hct). - Concurrently, a few drops of blood will be taken from the unit to be transfused will be analysed by i-STAT Portable Clinical Analyser for measurement of previous biochemical parameters. - The details of the unit, such as draw date, volume of transfusion, and date of transfusion, will be recorded. The RBC unit will be delivered to the operative room from the blood bank in an insulated box. - The transfusion is then given as clinically indicated at a rate of 50 to 150 mL/h based on the clinician's orders, the patient's weight, and the patient's clinical situation. - Volumes will be transfused to children according to the following top-up transfusion equation: desired Hemoglobin (Hb) (g/dl) - actual Hemoglobin (Hb) (g/dl) x weight (kg) x 3. (usually 10-20 ml/kg). - A second patient blood sample will be drawn one hour after the transfusion and will be analyzed by i-STAT Portable Clinical Analyser. - Patient information will be recorded for age, weight, sex, and primary diagnosis. - Demographic and clinical variables will be collected, to include type and quantity of all blood products and fluids received and medications administered. All surgical procedures will be documented.</detailed_description>
