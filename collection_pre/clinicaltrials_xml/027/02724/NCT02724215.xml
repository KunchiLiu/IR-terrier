	<brief_title>Effect of Sleep Apnea on Blood Pressure Control and Outcome Early After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients admitted with non-traumatic SAH will be consented and screened for sleep apnea within 48 hours after hospital admission. Blood pressure and clinical outcome will be monitored throughout ICU treatment and hospital stay, respectively. Diagnosis of sleep apnea will be confirmed on follow-up 3-6 month after SAH by sleep apnea screening (portable cardiorespiratory monitoring and out-of-center polysomnography, respectively).</detailed_description>
