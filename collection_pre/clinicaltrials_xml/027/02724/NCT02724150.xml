	<criteria>High risk ulcers defined according to the Forrest classification With respect to highrisk stigmata, active bleeding was defined as a continuous blood spurting (Forrest IA) oozing (Forrest IB) from the ulcer base. A nonbleeding visible vessel at endoscopy was defined as a discrete protuberance at the ulcer base(Forrest IIA). An adherent clot was one that was resistant to forceful irrigation or suction (Forrest IIB). ulcer was malignant non ulcerative bleeding such as angiodysplasia , a MalloryWeiss tear....</criteria>
