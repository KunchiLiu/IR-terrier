	<brief_summary>Previous studies attempted to understand the dysphotopsia phenomenon by examining intraocular lens type, anterior capsule depth, iris-to-lens depth, lens refractive material, clear cornea incision wounds and anterior capsulorrhexis. However, there is limited literature in understanding haptic orientation and negative dysphotopsia; postulated theories and anecdotal reports relate to horizontal haptic orientation and the lateralization of rays such that light is received both in smaller width and anterior to the peripheral retina; however, no formal studies currently exist.</brief_summary>
