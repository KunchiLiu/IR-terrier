	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Food Effect on the Safety, Tolerability, PK of EC-18 After Oral Administration in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In vitro and in vivo efficacy studies and clinical trials have shown that EC-18 has a mode of action of improving neutropenia by promoting neutrophil production from hematopoietic stem cells and at the same time, efficiently controlling STAT6/Complement 3(C 3), suggesting its potential to be developed as an orally administered new drug for treatment of neutropenia resulting from decreased neutrophils caused by administration of an anticancer agent. This study is a randomized, open-Label, single -dose, crossover, phase I clinical trial to evaluate the effect of food on the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of EC-18 after oral administration in healthy volunteers</detailed_description>
