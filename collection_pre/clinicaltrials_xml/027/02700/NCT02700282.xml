	<brief_summary>Cystic Fibrosis is a hereditary, chronic respiratory illness. Cystic Fibrosis leads to a progressive decline in lung function. School-aged children with cystic fibrosis experience backpack carrying everyday. Backpack carrying induce a restrictive effect responsible for lower lung function. Respiratory muscle strength is also impaired. No studies assessed aerobic capacities during children's gait while carrying a backpack. The investigators hypothesized that backpack carrying will induce an acute decline in lung function in children with cystic fibrosis compared to healthy children. Investigators also hypothesized that aerobic capacities will be impaired.</brief_summary>
