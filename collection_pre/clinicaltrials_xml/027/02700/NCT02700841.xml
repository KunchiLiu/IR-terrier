	<brief_summary>This pilot, randomized phase II trial studies how well depleted immune suppressor stem cell transplant works compared to standard stem cell transplant in enhancing immune response to vaccines in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Chemotherapy and the patient's own stem cells are effective in treating MM, however there is a risk of disease returning due to poor recovery of the immune system as shown to poor response to vaccines to prevent infections. Before chemotherapy, patients' stem cells are collected and certain immune cells called suppressor cells are removed from the stem cells. Patients then receive chemotherapy to kill cancer cells and after that the immune depleted stem cells are returned to them to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy. Giving depleted immune suppressor stem cells transplant to patients with MM may result in a more robust immune response to vaccines after transplant and may prevent MM from returning. It is not yet known whether depleted immune suppressor stem cell transplant is more effective than standard stem cell transplant in enhancing immune response to vaccines in patients with multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare the cellular and humoral vaccine response post-transplant between the two arms. II. To determine the feasibility and safety of this approach. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare post-transplant recovery of innate and adaptive immune cells (cluster of differentiation [CD] CD8, CD4, CD19, natural killer cells [NK], gamma delta T-cells), in addition to T-cell phenotype markers between the two arms. II. To compare post-transplant recovery of regulatory T-cells (T-regs) and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) between the two arms. III. Progression free survival at 2 years post-transplant. IV. To compare multiple myeloma (MM) minimal residual disease (MRD) status at 3 months post-transplant between the two arms. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive X box binding protein-1(XBP1)-US/XBP1-SP/CD138/CS1 multipeptide vaccine PVX-410 subcutaneously (SC) every 2 weeks for 3 doses before transplant and on days 1, 15, and 30 and tetanus and influenza vaccines intramuscularly (IM) with the 3rd dose vaccine dose before transplant. Patients receive conditioning regimen comprising high-dose melphalan intravenously (IV) on day -2 and undergo autologous CD34 hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) on day 0. Patients also receive autologous donor lymphocyte (DLI) IV on day 2. ARM II: Patients receive XBP1-US/XBP1-SP/CD138/CS1 multipeptide vaccine PVX-410 subcutaneously and tetanus and influenza vaccines as in Arm I. Patients receive high-dose melphalan IV on day -2 and undergo autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AHSCT) on day 0.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of multiple myeloma The first 3 patients on the experimental arm will be high risk myeloma and subsequent patients will be low risk myeloma. High risk multiple myeloma patients: Have deletion (del) 17p, del 1p, T (4;14), T (14;16) Have plasma cell leukemia (PCL) Have &gt; 1 cytogenetic abnormality Are hypodiploid Have failed adequate initial therapy (lenalidomide, bortezomib, dexamethasone [RVD], thalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone [TVD], or cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone [CyBorD]) Have planned to receive nonchemotherapy/cytotoxic salvage regimens (except for single agent cyclophosphamide). Able to understand and sign a consent form Creatinine clearance equal or &gt; 50 ml/min (calculated) Ejection fraction equal or &gt; 50% before admission for transplant as per institutional standards. Patients with coronary heart disease (recent myocardial infarctions, angina, cardiac stent, or bypass surgery in the last 6 months or arrhythmia) need to be cleared by cardiology as per Emory bone marrow transplant (BMT) standards. Serum bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less than 3 X upper limit of normal Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) or diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) &gt; 50% predicted before admission for transplant as per institutional standards. Patients on home oxygen are not allowed on the protocol. No more than six months' worth of multiple myeloma chemotherapy is allowed (from the date of the start of the induction therapy) Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ≥ 70% Patients must be eligible to receive melphalan dose of 200 mg/m² Patients must be human leukocyte antigen (HLA) A2 positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) typing A female of childbearing potential, must have two negative urine pregnancy test results within 10 to 14 days prior to starting the first dose of vaccine and lenalidomide pretransplant Patient with a prior stem cell transplant (both autologous and allogeneic) Creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/min (calculated) Patients with documented central nervous system (CNS) disease Significant organ dysfunction deemed to be inappropriate for autologous transplantation Intention or plans for cyclophosphamide mobilization Patients with active hepatitis B, C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections (PCR positive) Enrollment on any other transplant related protocols Pregnant women are excluded from participating in this study; collect urine for pregnancy test for female patients who are not postmenopausal or surgically sterile which is part of standard of care. If positive, repeat and confirm results prior to visit 2; a second positive test will result in exclusion of the patient from the study.</criteria>
