	<brief_summary>The Feed1st proposed program of research will promote health of informal caregivers with a hospitalized child by testing a self-management intervention that addresses the widely overlooked problem of caregiver hunger. As many as 54% of parents and other informal caregivers of hospitalized children struggle with insufficient food to nourish themselves and their family during and after a hospital stay. Hunger impairs caregiver physical and mental health by depleting energy for self-care, emotional self-regulation, and supportive interactions with the child, the family, and the formal caregiver team. The long-term objective of the Feed1st program is to sustainingly alleviate unnecessary suffering due to hunger among families with hospitalized children. Established in partnership with nursing and chaplaincy leadership at our children's hospital and the Greater Chicago Food Depository, the Feed1st program currently operates self-serve food pantries on four inpatient units and the emergency department in our children's hospital on Chicago's South Side. Since 2010, Feed1st has provided nearly 8500 pounds of food to at least 4,000 individuals and 1500 households via the self-serve food pantries in the children's hospital. Over this same period, our team has also created a system for efficiently connecting families to community-based resources for hunger and other basic needs. This system, CommunityRx, integrates with our electronic medical record system and connects caregivers to a community health information specialist for navigation assistance. Leveraging both Feed1st and CommunityRx, we are using a randomized controlled trial, determine the health and health care impacts of a self-management intervention versus usual care to reduce informal caregiver hunger during and after a child's hospitalization. Findings from this study will be used to create a sustainable solution to the root cause problem of hunger among informal caregivers of a hospitalized child and will advance sensor-based methods for studying informal caregiver self-management behaviors, particularly in intimate settings.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>18 years of age or older and English speaking, the primary caregiver to a dependent child younger than age 18, have been screened for household food insecurity, reside in the 16 zip code primary service area geography, and self identify as the primary caregiver of a child with a chronic illness (such as asthma, diabetes, cancer, sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, etc.) or serious illness or injury (such as pneumonia, stroke, injury due to trauma, etc.). Caregivers of children in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) will be excluded to minimize infectious risk to critically ill newborns and their caregivers.</criteria>
