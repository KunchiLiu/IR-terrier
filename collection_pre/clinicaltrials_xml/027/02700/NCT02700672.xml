	<detailed_description>Falls are some of the most common events among elderly people. The odds of recurrent falls increase every year, which can cause impairment in basic activities of daily living, social isolation, fear of falling again and death. The aim of the present study is to analyze the role of cognition and gait speed as predictors to falls in institutionalized and non-institutionalized elderly people. Methods:Twenty-five individuals living in a long-term care facility and 25 non-institutionalized individuals participated in the study. A questionnaire about their history of falls, tests to evaluate cognition (global and executive function) and a pedometer with an accelerometer to measure kinematic variables were applied.</detailed_description>
