	<brief_summary>Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) inhibits lymphangiogenesis in the mouse tail model of lymphedema and is elevated in tissue in patients with lymphedema. Ubenimex is an inhibitor of leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H), the biosynthetic enzyme for LTB4. This proof-of-concept study is designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing ubenimex at 150 mg, 3 times daily (total daily dose of 450 mg) with placebo for 6 months treatment period in patients with secondary leg lymphedema. The primary objectives for the study are: - To evaluate the efficacy of ubenimex in patients with secondary leg lymphedema - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ubenimex in patients with secondary leg lymphedema</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Secondary leg lymphedema, based on a positive lymphoscintigraphy study of the affected leg. 2. Swelling of at least 1 leg not completely reversed by leg elevation or compression. 3. Stage II or greater lymphedema, based on the International Society of Lymphology (ISL) staging system. 4. Completion of a full course of complete decongestive therapy (CDT). 5. Stable limb volume (within 10% during screening for worse/affected leg) . 6. Ambulatory status (use of a walking aid is permitted). 7. Presence of an inciting event/risk factor for lymphedema, such as (but not limited to) surgery, trauma, or radiation therapy. 8. Agree to use a medically acceptable method of contraception, if the possibility of conception exists. Exclusions Based on Lymphedema: 1. Primary lymphedema, family history, or syndrome including lymphedema. 2. Occurrence of lymphedema of another body part (e.g, upper extremity, trunk, head and neck, genitalia). 3. Recent initiation of, or intention to initiate CDT or maintenance physiotherapy for lymphedema. Exclusions Based on Other Medical Conditions 4. Deep venous thrombosis in either lower limb or systemic anticoagulation within 6 months 5. Other medical condition that could lead to acute or chronic leg edema. 6. Other medical condition that could result in symptoms overlapping those of lymphedema in the affected leg. 7. History of clotting disorder (hypercoagulable state). 8. Chronic (persistent) infection in either lower limb. 9. Cellulitis or other infection in either lower limb or use of antibiotics for cellulitis within 3 months prior to screening. 10. Current evidence of malignancy. 11. History of malignancy within the previous 3 years, except for nonmelanoma skin cancer or cervical carcinoma in situ treated with curative intent. 12. Currently receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy. 13. Life expectancy &lt; 2 years for any reason. 14. Pregnancy or nursing. 15. Substance abuse (such as alcohol or drug abuse) within 6 months prior to screening. Exclusions Based on Concurrent Medication Use 16. Regular concurrent use or regular use within 6 months before screening of another leukotriene pathway inhibitor. 17. Concurrent antibiotic use. 18. Concurrent use of any agent active on the sphingosine1phosphate (S1P) pathway. 19. Concurrent use of unapproved (including herbal) treatments for lymphedema. Exclusions Based on Laboratory Values 20. Significant or chronic renal insufficiency or requires dialytic support. 21. Hepatic dysfunction. 22. Absolute neutrophil count &lt;1500 mm3 at screening. 23. Hemoglobin concentration &lt;9 g/dL at screening.</criteria>
