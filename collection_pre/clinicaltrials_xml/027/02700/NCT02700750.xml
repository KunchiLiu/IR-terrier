	<brief_summary>The investigators will enroll and scan normal eyes of healthy individuals using the Spectralis OCT. Each scan is graded on a scale of 0-40, with 0 representing the lowest quality and 40 the best possible one. Each of the participants will be scanned numerous times using this noninvasive imaging tool, while trying to get as many scans as possible of different quality. The differences in the parameters between the scans will then be recoded. Collected data will include age, sex, subjects' refractive status, visual acuity, full slit lamp exam and the participants' OCT characteristics and measurements.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators will enroll and scan 200 normal eyes of 100 healthy individuals using the Spectralis OCT. Each scan is graded on a scale of 0-40, with 0 representing the lowest quality and 40 the best possible one. Each of the subjects will be scanned numerous times using this noninvasive imaging tool, while trying to get as many scans as possible of different quality. The differences in the parameters between the scans will then be recoded. Collected data will include age, sex, subjects' refractive status, visual acuity, full slit lamp exam and the participants' OCT characteristics and measurements.</detailed_description>
