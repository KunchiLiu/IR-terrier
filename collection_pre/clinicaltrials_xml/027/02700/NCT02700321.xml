	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine whether High Flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen is more efficient than the standard High Flow face mask (HFFM) for preoxygenation before orotracheal intubation after crash induction in non severely hypoxemic patients</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Benefits of High Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygen for Preoxygenation During Intubation in Non Severely Hypoxemic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be designed as followed : patients will be randomized in 2 groups : High Flow nasal cannula "HFNC" or standard High Flow face mask "HFFM". Patients randomized in "HFNC" group will receive a four minutes preoxygenation period with Nasal High Flow Therapy (60 L/mn , fraction of inspired oxygen (FI02) = 100%) before orotracheal intubation under laryngoscopy after crash induction. After induction and during laryngoscopy, HFNC will be maintained in an attempt to achieve apneic oxygenation. Patients randomized in "HFFM" group will received a four minutes preoxygenation period with standard face mask (15 L/mn) before orotracheal intubation under laryngoscopy after crash induction. After induction, HFFM will be removed, enabling laryngoscopic vision</detailed_description>
