	<brief_summary>This study is a cluster randomised controlled trial, which aims to examine the short-term strategy of addressing treatment gap through increasing primary mental health service capacity. This study aims to compare after 6 months and 12 months, the effectiveness of a specialist model of mental health care and an enhanced usual care (task-sharing) framework, in terms of reducing mental health symptoms, reducing disability, and improving quality of life, as well as the health services costs (and potentially societal costs) associated with these outcomes in 400 patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating the Clinical Cost-effectiveness of Two Primary Mental Health Service Frameworks in Yogyakarta, Indonesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two primary mental health service frameworks in Yogyakarta are compared: the specialist framework and the enhanced usual care framework. Both frameworks have not been evaluated in the Indonesian context, despite their potential to be the framework of choice for other provincial and district governments to adopt. Extension to existing services has been planned, which provides us with the opportunity to implement in a random manner the enhanced usual care framework in new areas. This study aims to compare after 6 months and 12 months, the effectiveness of a specialist model of mental health care and an enhanced usual care (task-sharing) framework, in terms of reducing mental health symptoms, reducing disability, and improving quality of life, as well as the health services costs (and potentially societal costs) associated with these outcomes in 400 patients. This study receives ground-level support from the Centre for Public Mental Health, Universitas Gadjah Mada, which manages the specialist primary mental health framework in Yogyakarta province, regional and national-level support from the Ministry of Health of Indonesia, and will be hopefully funded by the LPDP, Ministry of Finance of Indonesia.</detailed_description>
