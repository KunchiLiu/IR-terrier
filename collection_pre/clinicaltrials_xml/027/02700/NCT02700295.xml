	<brief_summary>Orthokeratology has the benefit for slowing down myopia progression and enabling unaided vision during the day. To investigate proposed possible changes of conventional and multifocal orthokeratology in the cornea and choroid this study will image both structures with high resolution optical coherence tomographs over a six month period. Findings will help to plan larger trials over a longer period of time in adults and teenagers.</brief_summary>
