	<brief_summary>Background: Previous studies on Internet-based treatment with eating disorders have shown promising results. Objective: The first aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a tailored therapist guided internet-based treatment for individuals with eating disorders. The second aim was to examine the role of knowledge acquisition. Method: 138 participants were recruited. Screening consisted of online questionnaires followed by a telephone interview. A total of 92 participants were included after a semi-structured diagnostic interview and randomized to an 8 week treatment program (n=46) or to a control condition (n=46). Treatment consisted of individually prescribed cognitive behaviour therapy text modules in conjunction with online therapist guidance.
