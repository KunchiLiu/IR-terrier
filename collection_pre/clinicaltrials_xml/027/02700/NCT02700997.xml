	<brief_summary>This study seeks to gain a more thorough understanding of the postoperative location of the sutures placed during uterosacral ligament suspension. Characterization of the surrounding anatomy in a living model will enhance surgical technique by delineating safer suture locations and decrease the incidence of morbid complications for patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Uterosacral Ligament Suspension Clip</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uterosacral ligament suspension Is a commonly performed procedure to support the vaginal apex at the time of pelvic reconstructive surgery for pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Despite being a well established durable option for patients, there is little research detailing ligament suspension suture location in the living model. The available literature is limited to cadaveric studies, which suggest suture placement is in close proximity to vital structures such as the ureter, blood vessels, rectum and nerves. This study seeks to describe suture location in relation to the surrounding anatomy in postoperative patients following high uterosacral ligament suspension. The secondary aim is to determine safe zones for suture placement. Seventeen women (aged 18-85) under the care of Cincinnati Urogynecology Associates, a physician group of TriHealth, who have chosen vaginal hysterectomy with uterosacral ligament suspension (USLS) as the treatment choice for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) will be enrolled. At the time of surgery, a titanium vascular clip (size small) will be applied to the base of each delayed absorbable suture placed at the vaginal apex on the internal vaginal side to help in identification by imaging. On postoperative day (POD) 1, patients will undergo CT pelvis scans. The CT scan will involve administration of IV contrast for imaging of the ureters and vascular structures. The clip will fall off when the sutures dissolve at 12 weeks postoperatively. All patients will be asked to complete a lower extremity neurological questionnaire preoperatively and postoperatively.</detailed_description>
