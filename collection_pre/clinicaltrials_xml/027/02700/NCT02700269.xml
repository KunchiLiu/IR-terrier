	<brief_summary>Investigators will evaluate approaches using magnetic bead capture, isolation, and surface tension valve transfer of biomarkers to process capillary blood in order to improve the sensitivity of already approved Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) for detection of human malaria infection. Results will be compared to those obtained using unenhanced capillary blood specimens directly applied to approved malaria RDTs. Participants seeking care for possible malaria in Zambia will be recruited to enroll in the study.</brief_summary>
