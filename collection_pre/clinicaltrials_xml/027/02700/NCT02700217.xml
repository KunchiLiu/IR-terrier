	<brief_summary>About 1100 living donor nephrectomies are performed in the UK every year contributing to almost 35% of all the kidney transplants. Laparoscopic surgical techniques are general employed for donor nephrectomy as they are associated with a shorter hospital stay and faster return to normal physical functioning. Local anaesthetic infiltration technique with or without spinal anaesthesia in combination with a general anaesthetic is increasingly being used as part of enhanced recovery programme across general surgery. The impact of combined spinal and general anaesthesia along with local infiltration and rectus sheath blocks on acute pain has not been studied in patients undergoing hand assisted laparoscopic live donor nephrectomy. The investigators plan to investigate whether adding a spinal anaesthetic to a conventional general anaesthetic technique actually influences clinical outcomes of length of hospital stay and acute pain in patients undergoing hand assisted laparoscopic live donor nephrectomy. The investigators plan to randomise 90 patients undergoing hand assisted laparoscopic live donor nephrectomy over 24 month period at Central Manchester University hospitals and divide them in two groups of 45 each. Group A will receive a general anaesthetic (GA) with spinal anaesthesia (Spinal group) and Group B will receive a GA with a rectus sheath block (Rectus sheath group) and local anaesthetic infiltration</brief_summary>
