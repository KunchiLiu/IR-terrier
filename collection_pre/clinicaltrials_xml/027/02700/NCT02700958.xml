	<brief_summary>Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) has remained significant and severe complication of angiographic procedures despite the increasing use of preventative methods. It has been associated with prolonged hospital stay, high morality and the need for dialysis. Since classically used creatinine for diagnosing of CIN does not reflect the degree of tubular injury before 24-48 hours after exposure to contrast media alternative earlier biomarkers and preventative methods are needed. Remote ischemic preconditioning is a non-invasive and safe method which in some studies has been reported to protect against contrast-induced nephropathy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) (1) as an additional method to standard treatment to prevent subclinical and clinical contrast-induced acute kidney injury and (2) to assess its effect on functional properties of arterial wall, organ damage biomarkers and low molecular weight metabolites.</brief_summary>
