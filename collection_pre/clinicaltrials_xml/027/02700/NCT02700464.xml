	<brief_title>The Efficacy of the Bladder EpiCheck for Detection of Recurrent Urothelial Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Bladder EpiCheck test is an in vitro diagnostic device for the detection of DNA methylation patterns in urine that are associated with bladder cancer. It is intended for use as a noninvasive method for monitoring for tumor recurrence in conjunction with cystoscopy inpatients previously diagnosed with bladder cancer This is a, multicenter, prospective, blinded study to evaluate the efficacy (sensitivity and specificity) of a novel methylation test for the detection of recurrent Urothelial Cell Carcinoma in patients with a history of bladder cancer undergoing surveillance.</detailed_description>
