	<brief_title>Axitinib in Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Patients With Favorable Prognostic Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Axitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-Î±, and c-kit. The trial of comparative effectiveness of axitinib versus sorafenib in advanced renal cell carcinoma (AXIS) was an international randomized Phase III study designed for registration purposes. This trial randomized 723 metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients with any prognostic features to axitinib or sorafenib in the second-line setting and demonstrated significant clinical benefit of axitinib. Aim of present FavorAx study is to evaluate preliminary efficacy and safety of Axitinib in metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients with favorable IMDC prognostic factors who had progressed on sunitinib or pazopanib in the first-line setting.</detailed_description>
