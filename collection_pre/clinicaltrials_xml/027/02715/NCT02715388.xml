	<criteria>Patients older than 18. Pseudophakia patients with silicone oil in the vitreous cavity. Silicone oil density of 1500 centistoke or 5500 CS. Good corrected visual acuity (&gt; 6/10) in the second eye. Lack of additional ocular pathology that would reduce the quality of vision during surgery (corneal scar, Posterior Capsular Opacity, low transmission in the implantable lens, nonexpanded pupil). Additional ocular pathology that would reduce the quality of vision during surgery (corneal scar, Posterior Capsular Opacity, low transmission in the implantable lens, nonexpanded pupil). The presence of heavy silicone oil (OXANE) in the vitreous cavity. Posterior segment pathology in the second eye. Special populations (children under the age of 18, pregnant women)</criteria>
