	<brief_title>A Retrospective Chart Review Study of Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The medical community calls the movement from severe to mild disease and from mild to normal health, 'relieving symptoms', and the interventions that cause such movement, drugs, medications, or therapies. The alternative community calls the movement from normal health to superior health, 'boosting health' (or boosting the immune system, or improving your sex drive, or boosting any another well functioning physiological system), and the interventions that cause such movement, natural remedies, dietary supplements, complementary treatments, etc. In general, these interventions aim to achieve superior performance of a normal human body. Of course, boosting the body's normal performance improves many of its capabilities, such as higher resistance to diseases, faster recovery from fatigue, better mental concentration, etc. Each movement presents different objectives. Relieving symptoms represents the ability of an intervention to reduce the frequency, duration, and severity of a disease. In contrast, boosting health represents the ability of an intervention to increase the frequency, duration, and quality of a person's health. In the current study, the investigators would like to measure the changes in health-related complaints by analyzing charts of individuals, who are infected with latent virus, and who have used Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin.</detailed_description>
