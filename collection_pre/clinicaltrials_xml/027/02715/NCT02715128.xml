	<brief_summary>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, recurrent, and frequent chronic disorder. Among others, deficient cognitive control over emotional distraction is a central characteristic of MDD (Ochsner &amp; Gross 2005; Disner et al. 2011; Beck 2008). Hypoactivation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been linked with this deficit (Dolcos &amp; McCarthy 2006). Moreover, aberrant functional connectivity patterns have been found in MDD patients (Kaiser et al. 2015). Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method that has been largely investigated in experimental neurosciences and tDCS of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been proposed as novel treatment in MDD. So far, prefrontal tDCS has been shown to enhance cognitive control over emotional distraction in MDD patients (Wokenstein &amp; Plewnia 2013). Also, tDCS-induced connectivity changes found in fMRI studies comparing resting-state networks configurations before and after prefrontal tDCS may reflect a state of enhanced alertness (Keeser, Meindl, et al., 2011; Park et al., 2013). The aim of this study is to investigate the neurophysiological correlates of tDCS effects in MDD patients. For this purpose, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is collected during the execution of a cognitive control task as well as during a resting-state condition following real or sham tDCS. It is hypothesized that prefrontal tDCS as compared to sham a) reduces distractibility by compensating for deficient DLPFC activity and b) enhances functional connectivity in networks associated with externally directed attention or cognitive engagement. In this placebo-controlled study patients with a diagnosis of MDD receive a single treatment with prefrontal tDCS (anode over electrode position F3, cathode over F4, 20 min, 2mA intensity) or sham tDCS (frequency and duration correspondent active tDCS, ramp in and ramp out periods only without intermittent stimulation). Before, during, and after the treatment resting-state measurements in the fMRI scanner are conducted. Subsequently, participants perform the cognitive control task (in dependence of Plewnia, C., Schroeder, P. A., &amp; Wolkenstein, L. (2015)) in the scanner. The patients are assigned to either the real or sham tDCS condition according to a randomised, double-blind parallel design.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Men and women 1865 years of age. Primary DSM5 diagnosis of Major Depression as assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM5 Axis I Disorders, Research Version (SCID5RV) with a single or recurrent episode with the additional requirements of a current episode with a duration of ≥4 weeks. Current depressive episode is less than 5 years duration (the definition of an episode is demarcated by a period of ≥2 months in which the patient did not meet full criteria for the DSM5 definition of major depressive episode). Total HDRS21 ≥15 at the screening visit. No antidepressant medication and stable medication ≥4 weeks. Capable and willing to provide informed consent. Negative pregnancy test and willingness to use contraceptive measures during study treatment for women with childbearing potential (i.e. &lt; 2 years postmenopausal) Investigators, site personnel directly affiliated with this study, and their immediate families (immediate family is defined as a spouse, parent, child or sibling, whether by birth or legal adoption). Acute risk for suicide (MADRS, item 10 score of &gt;4 or as assessed by the CSSRS, agree to item 4 and/or agree to item 5). High degree of therapy resistance defined as &gt;4 sufficient treatment attempts in the current episode (each attempt with an ATHF score of &gt;3). Treatment with electroconvulsive therapy in the present episode. Treatment with deep brain stimulation or vagus nerve stimulation and/or any other intracranial implants (clips, cochlear implants). Any other relevant psychiatric axisI and/or axisIIdisorder. Any relevant instable medical condition. History of treatment with tDCS for any disorder. Pregnancy.</criteria>
