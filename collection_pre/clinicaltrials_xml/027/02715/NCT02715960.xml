	<brief_summary>In an early clinical research, 138 patients completed the treatment of Psoriasis Vulgaris by Acitretin Capsules in 8 weeks, the results indicate 75 cases effectively (54.3%), 50 cases invalid(36.2%), 13 cases serious(9.4%). To investigate the influence of genetic factors on the curative effect and find the relationships between genetic variants and the response of Acitretin Capsules to treatment of Psoriasis Vulgaris.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacogenomics Study on Treatment of Psoriasis Vulgaris by Acitretin Capsules</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators analyzed the various levels of genetic factors, including: 1.To analysis the key gene variants which associated with ADME affect the efficacy of Acitretin Capsules; 2.Direct full genetic sequencing of MHC genes, to explore the genetic variations of efficacy and side effects; 3. Direct sequencing of all exons in the gene in the patients of the response of serious and effectively, to explores the rare genetic variation may cause deterioration of treatment by Acitretin Capsules.</detailed_description>
