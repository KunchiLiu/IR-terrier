	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major health problem worldwide, and most cases are inoperable because of late presentation and underlying cirrhosis. It represents the fifth most common tumor in the world and the third most frequent cause of mortality amongst patients with cancer. Due to the worldwide difficulties in finding liver for transplantation, hepatic resection (HR) represents the main stay of curative treatment for patients with HCC. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is widely used as alternative treatments for unresectable HCC or for patients not eligible to be operated on . TACE also could be an adjuvant therapy for resectable HCC patients after hepatectomy, which could prevent recurrence and improve long-term survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role of (LMWH) in Prevention of Thromboembolic Complication After (TACE) in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thromboembolism is a well-recognised complication of malignant disease. Clinical manifestations vary from venous thromboembolism to disseminated intravascular coagulation and arterial embolism. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is most commonly observed in patients with haematological malignant disorders and those with wide spread metastatic cancer, whereas arterial embolism is most commonly observed in patients undergoing chemotherapy and in those with non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis . The goals of using antithrombotic therapy with TACE in HCC are to minimize mortality and to improve survival rate without provoking excessive bleeding.</detailed_description>
