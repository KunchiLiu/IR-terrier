	<brief_summary>Several studies have shown relationship between exercise intensity and improvement cardiometabolic health such as body composition, endothelial function, blood pressure and blood lipids. It has been suggested that high intensity interval training and also strength or resistance training generate positive effects on metabolic risk factors, nevertheless the comparison between both types of training and their combination has not yet provided conclusive evidence. Also, it has been shown that dietary restriction has similar or more positive effects that exercise alone and the effect is greater when it is combined with exercise. For these reasons, it is necessary to clarify which type of training, in combination with a dietary restriction, is more effective to improve cardiometabolic health</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiometabolic HIIT-RT Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators hypothesized that high intensity interval, resistance training or combined training would result in similar improvements in cardiometabolic health as compared to the usual clinical care in a cohort of sedentary overweight (age 30-50 years old).</detailed_description>
