	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the effect of EPA supplementation on muscle mass in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck locally advanced (stage III-IVb) to assess that supplementation with EPA can maintain muscle mass along the oncologic treatment. Other aims are to evaluate the nutritional status, acute and chronic toxicities related with the loss of muscle mass and the impact of the EPA supplementation on overall and disease-free survival.</brief_summary>
