	<brief_summary>Enhanced rehabilitation programs are based on new therapies and treatment combinations to reduce the length of hospitalization, duration of postoperative convalescence, morbidity, but also the overall cost of care. The operating stress and hypercatabolic conditions surrounding the surgery are sources of complications. In this enhanced rehabilitation approach, the principle is to fight through a series of actions against this surgical stress. Several North American studies, Chinese, Scandinavian or Batavian have shown the feasibility and the interest of enhanced perioperative rehabilitation in liver surgery. Nevertheless, there is not until now French data concerning the assessment of enhanced rehabilitation in liver surgery. The main objective of the study is to compare the effectiveness of the implementation of a multimodal management program after liver surgery in a French university center compared to conventional care. Secondary objectives of the study are to compare an enhanced rehabilitation program in liver surgery versus conventional treatment in terms of morbidity and mortality in the immediate postoperative period and until day 90, length of hospital stay, blood loss and the delay to bowel mobility recovery. Compliance to the program in both groups will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>
