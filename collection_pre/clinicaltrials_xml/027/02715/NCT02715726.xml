	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To demonstrate the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by alirocumab in comparison to ezetimibe as add-on therapy to stable maximally tolerated daily statin therapy in high cardiovascular (CV) risk patients with hypercholesterolemia in Asia. Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the effect of alirocumab on other lipid parameters: eg, Apolipoprotein (Apo) B, non-HDL-C, total cholesterol (TC), lipoprotein a (Lp[a]), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), and Apo A-1. - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab. - To evaluate the development of anti-alirocumab antibodies. - To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of alirocumab.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The maximum study duration will be 35 weeks per patient, including a screening period of up to 3 weeks, a 24-week randomized treatment period, and an 8-week follow-up period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Patients with hypercholesterolemia and established coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD risk equivalents who are not adequately controlled with a maximally tolerated daily dose of statin at a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to the screening visit (Week 3). Exclusion criteria: Patients without established CHD or CHD risk equivalents. LDLC &lt;70 mg/dL (&lt;1.81 mmol/L) at the screening visit (Week 3) in patients with history of documented CV disease. LDLC &lt;100 mg/dL (&lt;2.59 mmol/L) at the screening visit (Week 3) in patients without history of documented CV disease. Change in statin dose or dose regimen from screening to randomization. Currently taking a statin other than atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, or simvastatin. Atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, or simvastatin is not taken daily or not taken at a registered dose. Daily doses above atorvastatin 80 mg, rosuvastatin 40 mg, or simvastatin 40 mg. Use of cholesterol absorption inhibitor (ie, ezetimibe), omega3 fatty acid (at doses â‰¥1000 mg daily), nicotinic acid, fibrates, bile acidbinding sequestrant, or red yeast rice products in the past 4 weeks prior to screening visit (Week 3). Fasting serum triglycerides &gt;400 mg/dL (&gt;4.52 mmol/L) at the screening period. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
