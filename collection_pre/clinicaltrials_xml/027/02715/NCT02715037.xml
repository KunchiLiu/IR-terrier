	<brief_title>Microbiology of Severe Acute Tonsillitis, Peritonsillar Cellulitis, and Infectious Mononucleosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients referred to tertiary care centers with acute throat infections are most often treated with antibiotics. However, very little is know concerning the prevalent pathogens in patients with acute throat infections without abscess formation. Evidence suggests that Fusobacterium necrophorum plays an important role in complications of acute tonsillitis (e.g. peritonsillar abscess), but also uncomplicated acute tonsillitis. This study aims to explore the throat microbiology of patients with severe acute tonsillitis, peritonsillar cellulitis, or infectious mononucleosis with a special attention to a possible role of Fusobacterium necrophorum.</detailed_description>
