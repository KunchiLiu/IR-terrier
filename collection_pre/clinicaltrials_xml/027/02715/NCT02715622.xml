	<brief_summary>The objective of this prospective, multi-center post-market study is to prospectively collect uniform, evidence based outcomes for patients undergoing open, laparoscopic or robotic assisted hernia repair. The outcomes that will be collected include various routine clinical parameters, short term patient reported outcomes (quality of life, pain scores) and long term hernia recurrence information. Patients will be treated according to standard of care at the surgeon's institution and patients will be followed up to collect information related to complications information and patient satisfaction associated with the hernia repair procedure.</brief_summary>
