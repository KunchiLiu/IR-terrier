	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2D) and schedule for JNJ-63709178 in Part 1 and to characterize the safety and tolerability of JNJ-63709178 at the RP2D(s) in Part 2.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Study of JNJ-63709178, a Humanized CD123 x CD3 DuoBody in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is first-in-human (FIH) Phase 1, open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known), multicenter, dose escalation study with dose expansion to identify the RP2D and to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary antitumor activity of JNJ-63709178 in adult subjects with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are ineligible for or have exhausted standard therapeutic options. The study is divided into 3 periods: a Screening Phase (up to 28 days before the first dose of study drug), a Treatment Phase (first dose of study drug until the last dose of study drug) and a Post-treatment Follow-up Phase (up to the end of study participation or end of study). Subjects' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
