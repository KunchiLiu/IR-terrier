	<brief_summary>The principal research objective is to determine whether inorganic nitrate in the form of beetroot juice compared to placebo control prevents the systemic inflammation that underlies typhoid vaccine-induced endothelial dysfunction</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence of Dietary Nitrate on Vascular Dysfunction and Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We wish to determine in a prospective manner whether inorganic nitrate affects the endothelial dysfunction induced by systemic inflammation. At baseline we will measure flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and peripheral augmentation index, as well as aortic stiffness, as measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV). Volunteers will then receive ~8 mmols of dietary nitrate or nitrate free placebo juice once daily for 6 days. After this, depending on availability, volunteers will receive a typhoid vaccine Typherix®, GlaxoSmithKline UK or Typhim Vi ™, AAH Pharmaceuticals Ltd). This vaccine generates a mild systemic inflammation that is associated with vascular dysfunction. All vascular function measures will be repeated at 8 hours and 32 hours after vaccine administration.</detailed_description>
