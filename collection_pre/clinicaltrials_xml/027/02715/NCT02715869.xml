	<detailed_description>Preconditioning (PC) of the heart occurs when brief exposure to a stimulus protects the heart from subsequent ischemia. PC stimulus may be ( ischemic ; pharmacologic or Physical) Pharmacological PC may be induced by variable agents e.g. (Sevoflurane ;isoflorane, opioids etc) Ischemic PC includes local; remote and the idea is temporary interruption of blood supply to the organ so that liberation of protective mediators occurs. The liberated mediators have favorable effects not only upon the myocardium, but it extend to protect other organs against inflammatory activation; ischemia reperfusion injury Inotropic score (IS) is already an evident predictor of postoperative cardiac morbidity and mortality Aim of the work: Is to validate the impact of Sevoflurane versus ischemic &amp; Sevoflurane PC upon postoperative inotropic score in adult patient undergoing open heart surgery</detailed_description>
