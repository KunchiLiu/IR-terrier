	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of PEGylated Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase (PEGPH20) combined with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine (PAG treatment), compared with placebo combined with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine (AG treatment), in participants with hyaluronan (HA)-high Stage IV previously untreated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to PAG or AG treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Signed, written Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committeeapproved Informed Consent Form (ICF). 2. Stage IV pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) with histological confirmation of PDA via archived or fresh core biopsy of either the primary tumor or 1 metastatic site. 3. Participants must be determined to be hyaluronanhigh based on tumor biopsy that meets the requirements noted in the previous inclusion criterion. 4. At least 1 tumor metastasis measurable on computed tomography (CT) scan per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria, excluding the primary pancreatic lesion. 5. If a participant has had adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy for nonmetastatic pancreatic cancer in combination with or without radiation therapy), tumor recurrence or disease progression must have occurred no sooner than 6 months after completing the last dose of adjuvant therapy, provided all toxicities have returned to baseline or â‰¤ Grade 1. 6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 0 or 1. Exclusion criteria: 1. Clinical evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE) or other known thromboembolic (TE) event present during the screening period. 2. Previous radiotherapy, surgery, chemotherapy, or investigational therapy for the treatment of metastatic disease. a. Palliative radiotherapy for pain control of metastatic bone lesions is allowed. 3. Known central nervous system involvement or brain metastases. 4. New York Heart Association Class III or IV cardiac disease or myocardial infarction within the past 12 months. 5. History of cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack. 6. Preexisting carotid artery disease.</criteria>
