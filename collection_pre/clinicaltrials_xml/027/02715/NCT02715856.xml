	<brief_title>Using Telemonitoring to Optimize the Mobility of Cancer Survivors With Skeletal Metastases After Surgery to Preserve Limb Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups: If participant agrees to take part in this study, they will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. Participant will have an equal (50/50) chance of being assigned to either group. Both Group 1 and Group 2 will have standard, face-to-face follow-up visits. Group 1 will be the control group and will have no mobile device intervention. However, if participant is assigned to Group 2, they will also be asked to record videos between follow-up visits and send them to the study staff. The study staff will provide the mobile device for recording the videos. Visits for Group 1 (Control Group): About 2, 6, 12, and 24 weeks after surgery, participant will have standard follow-up visits. Participant will not have any visits or procedures that are specific to this study. However, participant will complete questionnaires that are specific to this study. Participant will be asked to sit in a chair, stand, walk about 10 feet, turn around, return to the chair, and sit down. During another test, participant will be asked to walk a certain distance (about 30 feet) while a physical therapist watches their steps. Participant will be asked to walk around the room in certain ways, and step over lines on the floor. Participant will also fill out a survey about their physical and emotional health as well as their pain. At the end of the study, participant will be asked to fill out another questionnaire regarding the study. Both the physical tests and the surveys should take about 15 minutes to complete. In addition, at the end of the study, participant will be asked to fill out a questionnaire about the study. Visits for Group 2: At a scheduled clinic visit before participant's surgery, they will be taught how to take photos of their surgical wounds and make videos using a mobile device. About 2, 6,12, and 24 weeks after surgery, participant will have standard follow-up visits which will include the same surveys and physical therapy measures described above. However, at Weeks 3, 7, 13, and 25 participant will use a mobile device to send the study staff photos of their surgical wound and video of them walking. These updates will help participant's doctor to check their recovery. The photos participants will take will only be of a small area of skin near their wound. For the videos, participants will need a family member or friend to hold the mobile device camera and record video of them as they walk 10 feet away from the camera and then walk back toward the camera. Participant will also repeat this with the camera viewing from the side as they walk 10 feet back and forth. At the end of each follow-up visit, participant will complete an electronic questionnaire about their quality of life. This should take about 10 minutes. In addition, participant's doctor will have a video conference at Weeks 3, 7, 13, and 25. At any time the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will also have a video conference with their doctor. Participant will be asked basic follow-up information about their wound and overall health questions. This should take about 5-10 minutes. Participant will return the mobile device after completion of their 25-week follow up visit using the mobile device. Length of Study: If participant is in Group 1, their participation in this study will be over after the 24-week follow-up has been completed. If participant is in Group 2, their participation will be over after the 25-week follow-up has been completed. Participant's study participation may end early if they are unable to follow study directions. This is an investigational study. Up to 60 participants will be enrolled in this study. Up to 12 clinicians will also take part in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
