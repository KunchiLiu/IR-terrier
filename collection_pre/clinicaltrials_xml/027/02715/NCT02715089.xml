	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to explore the precise treatment in hepatobiliary cancer patients and evaluate drug safety, progression free and overall survival. This trial study is based on genetic tests, then therapeutic target drugs are administered according to the genetic test reports. Patients with genetic abnormalities (such as mutations, amplifications, or translocations) may benefit from precise treatment which targets particular genetic abnormality. The identifications of these genetic abnormalities may help treat hepatobiliary cancer patients better.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The genetic tests are performed for the eligible subjects in this study, then therapeutic target drugs are administered according to the genetic test reports. While the precise treatments, follow-ups are conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the target drugs for the subjects, until the overall survival. Study Type: Non-Interventional. Masking: Open Label.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age from 18 to 65, male or female. Radiologically and pathologically confirmed as hepatobiliary cancers with stage IV. Palliative care as the preferred. The result of nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) test show the patient has gene mutation and also can be treated by the right commercial products that have been approved by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). ECOG performance status 02. Life expectancy ≥3 months. Voluntarily participate in the study and agree to sign informed consent form. Hepatobiliary cancer patient with stageIIII, or with any of the following items will not be eligible for screening.Such as, suitable for the treatment of radical resection, radical resection but evaluation unmeasurable. The result of NGS test show the patient has no gene mutation, or has gene mutation but no medicine. ECOG performance status ≥ 3. Female patients who are pregnant or not using a contraceptive method of birth control. History or presence of serious cardiovascular or cerebrovascular abnormalities. Abnormalities of the hepatic or renal functions, such as jaundice, ascites, bilirubin ≥ 1.5×ULN, alkaline phosphatase ≥ 3×ULN, persistent protein urine≥ grade 3 (according to National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] v4.0), creatinine ratio &gt; 3.5g/24 hours, renal failure. Persistent infection &gt; grade 2 (according to National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] v4.0). Patient has underwent a major operation 4 weeks prior to screening or has not yet recovered from the operation. Patient with epilepsy, known or untreated brain metastases. The presence of wounds, ulcers or fractures that can not be healed, or with a past history of transplantation. The presence of bleeding events ≥grade 3 (according to National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] v4.0) , present evidence or past history of coagulation dysfunction disorders. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection history. Patient with drug abuse or unstable compliance. The presence of unresolved toxicity caused by any previous treatment/operation &gt; grade 1 (according to National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] v4.0), except alopecia, anemia or hypothyroidism). Investigator consider that the patient should not be enrolled in this study by careful assessment. The subjects participate in any other clinical trial in the meantime.</criteria>
