	<brief_summary>The Investigators propose to conduct a pragmatic randomized controlled trial of 350 one to four year old children and their caregivers to study the effectiveness of 1) the Bright By Three (BB3) intervention for promoting children's language and socio-emotional development and 2) a modified version of the Safe 'N Sound (SNS) intervention for reducing safety hazards and injuries. The SNS intervention will serve as a control for the BB3 group and vice versa so that all study participants will receive a clinically meaningful intervention. In collaboration with primary care clinics that serve low-income and minority children, the Investigators will recruit and randomize 350 twelve to fifteen month olds and their parents/caregivers to one of the two intervention arms and deliver the interventions over a 2 year period.</brief_summary>
