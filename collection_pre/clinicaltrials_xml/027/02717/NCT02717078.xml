	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the use of a low biologically available and high protein diet (LoBAG) for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Subjects with type 2 diabetes will be recruited and asked to adhere to this diet or a control diet for 12 weeks. Food preparation will be done by subjects at home, following instruction from the study team including a dietitian. The study will test the hypothesis that the LoBAG diet will lead to a greater reduction in hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c) than a control diet over 12 weeks of intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The LoBAG Diet and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diet is a cornerstone of type 2 diabetes mellitus treatment. Current standard of care diet recommendations focus on caloric restriction and weight loss, goals which can be difficult to achieve. A moderate carbohydrate, high protein diet has been designed specifically for people with type 2 diabetes, and has shown promising results in preliminary studies. This diet, called the Low Biologically Available Glucose (LoBAG) diet, does not require caloric restriction or weight loss to produce beneficial effects. The purpose of this project is to expand upon the preliminary studies and to offer the LoBAG diet to a free-living population of people with type 2 diabetes (people who come to outpatient study visits for diet instruction, and then prepare and consume food in their own homes). People with type 2 diabetes will be enrolled in a randomized, parallel group trial of the LoBAG diet or a control diet over a 12 week intervention period. Diet assignment will be random (like the flip of a coin). The main intervention will be instruction in either the LoBAG diet or the control diet. Measures of diabetes control will be collected before, during, and after the diet intervention. Stool samples will be used to collect preliminary data on the gut microbiome during the diet intervention. The diets will be isocaloric and subjects will not lose weight during the study. There will be 6 study visits over a 12-13 week period.</detailed_description>
