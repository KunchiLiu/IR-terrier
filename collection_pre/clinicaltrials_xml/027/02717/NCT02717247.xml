	<brief_title>Transcranial Random Noise Stimulation in Food Addiction Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transcranial random noise stimulation is a noninvasive brain stimulation technic. The modulation of the electrical activity of the right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) by tRNS is able to act on the phenomenon of craving in other addictions. This allows us to make the assumption that tRNS stimulation could constitute a treatment for food addiction especially in obesity.</detailed_description>
