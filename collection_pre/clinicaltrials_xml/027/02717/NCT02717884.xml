	<brief_summary>The objective of the phase I part of the trial is the determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TCP (Tranylcypromine) in combination with fixed-dose ATRA (all-trans-retinoic acid) and with fixed-dose AraC (Cytarabine) and to derive the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) in patients with non-APL AML or MDS for whom no standard treatment is available or who failed azanucleoside treatment. The objective of the phase II part of the trial is a first evaluation of the efficacy of TCP at the RP2D in combination with fixed-dose ATRA and with fixed-dose AraC as basis for further investigations of TCP</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Sensitization of Non-M3 AML Blasts to ATRA by Epigenetic Treatment With Tranylcypromine (TCP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study treatment: TCP + ATRA + AraC Four dose levels of TCP (20 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, 80 mg on days 1-28) will be examined in combination with fixed dose ATRA (45 mg/m2 on days 10-28) and fixed-dose AraC (40 mg on days 1-10) in the first cycle. In further cycles patients will be treated in the same manner, except for ATRA which will be administered continuously with a nine-day interruption at the beginning of every fourth cycle. Follow-up per patient: Until twelve months after registration of the last patient. Duration of intervention per patient: Until relapse/progression, unacceptable toxicity or until twelve months after registration of the last patient, whatever occurs first</detailed_description>

Azanucleosides failure is defined as 1) no response after at least three (AML) or six (MDS) cycles of azacitidine or decitabine, 2) disease progression under treatment or 3) grade 34 nonhematologic toxicity. Patients eligible for this trial must not meet any of the following criteria: 1. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL, FrenchAmericanBritish classification system (FAB) M3); 2. Eligibility for standard induction or consolidation chemotherapy, immediate allografting, or a hypomethylating agent; 3. AML with central nervous system (CNS) involvement; 4. AraC treatment within one month prior to registration; 5. Prior exposure to histone deacetylase inhibitors, including sodium valproate within one month prior to registration; 6. Stem cell transplant patient with graftversushost disease (GvHD) or under systemic immunosuppression; 7. Previous gastrointestinal surgery that might interfere with drug absorption; 8. Pheochromocytoma; 9. Carcinoid tumor; 10. Confirmed or suspected cerebrovascular disease; 11. Vascular malformations including aneurysm; 12. Severe renal insufficiency; 13.

History or presence of malignant hyperthermia; 19. Known psychiatric disorders; 20. Known allergy against soy beans or peanuts; 21. Known hypersensitivity to or intolerance of one of the trial drugs or its constituents (e.g. lactose, corn starch, indigocarmine (TCP), corn starch (AraC), other retinoids (ATRA)); 22. Simultaneous intake of the prohibited medication, incl. linezolid, that is likely to cause interactions (see detailed list study protocol); 23. Patients who refuse to follow studyspecific dietary guidelines; 24. Known or persistent abuse of medication, drugs or alcohol; 25. Current or planned pregnancy, nursing period; 26. Failure to use safe methods of contraception; 27. Simultaneous participation in other interventional trials which could interfere with this trial and/or participation before the end of a required restriction period; 28.
