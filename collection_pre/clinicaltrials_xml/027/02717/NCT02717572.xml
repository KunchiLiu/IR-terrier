	<brief_summary>In the current study, the investigators plan to expand the knowledge of Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance (PET/MR) reliability by assessing the repeatability of fludeoxyglucose (FDG) standardized uptake values (SUV) measurements, as well as apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) measurements, in a broad population of patients with malignant solid tumors.</brief_summary>
