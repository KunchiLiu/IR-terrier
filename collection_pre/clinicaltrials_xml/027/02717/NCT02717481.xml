	<brief_title>Using US to Evaluate Aortic Aneurysm Size Based on 3D Co-registration to Previous CT Scan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Selection test for assessing aortic aneurysm is CT angio, it performed after injection of contrast material and allows a complete demonstration of the blood vessels. This test exposes the patient to ionizing radiation and the injection of iodine contrast medium. Repeated tests pose a risk of developing a malignancy in the future due to the use of ionizing radiation and risk of renal impairment and allergic reactions due to the injection of contrast material. Ultrasound is another test that enables the detection and evaluation of aortic aneurysm. Patients with a known diagnosis of aortic aneurysm detected on CT are required to continuous monitoring in light of its growth over time and the risk of rupture. Using Co-registration over the US device will enable to conduct a US directed aorta examination, which uses the information produced from the CT as a "roadmap" for detection and localization of the aneurysm. That can theoretically improve detection capabilities and characteristics of the aneurysm and outcomes of the invasive treatment.</detailed_description>
