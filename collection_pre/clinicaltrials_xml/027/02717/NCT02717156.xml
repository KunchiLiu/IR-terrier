	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein and pembrolizumab work in treating patients with urothelial (bladder) cancer that has spread from the primary site to other places in the body or has come back and does not respond to certain chemotherapy drugs. Combinations of biological substances in recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein may be able to carry tumor-killing substances directly to urothelial cancer cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein and pembrolizumab together may be a better treatment for patients with urothelial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Therapy With Pembrolizumab and sEphB4-HSA in Previously Treated Urothelial Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the feasibility of using pembrolizumab-recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein (sEphB4-HSA) combination in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma. II. To measure the overall survival (OS). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To measure the progression-free survival (PFS). II. To measure the objective response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To examine programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), programmed cell death 1 ligand 2 (PD-L2) and EPH receptor B4 (EphB4) expression by tumor cells (TC) as well as immune cells (IC)- macrophages and T cells- in tumor tissue and correlate them with ORR, PFS and OS. II. To examine the tumor tissue T cell frequency (counts), tumor tissue T cell clonality using T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, and peripheral blood T cell clonality, pre-treatment and post-treatment and correlate these with ORR, PFS and OS. III. To measure the phenotype of lymphocytes and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC), in pre and post-treatment blood samples and correlate these with ORR, PFS and OS; an extra blood sample for future studies will also be collected and banked. IV. To examine peripheral blood circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for enumeration and molecular analysis in pre and post-treatment blood samples, and correlate these with ORR, PFS and OS. V. To collect and bank tumor tissue. VI. To examine the role of adding positron emission tomography (PET) to a contrast computed tomography (CT) for evaluation of response to treatment. OUTLINE: Patients receive recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6-12 weeks.</detailed_description>

patients progressing within 12 months of their last dose of platinumbased neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy will be considered platinum refractory Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1 Be willing to provide tissue from a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion; newlyobtained is defined as a specimen obtained for up to 6 weeks (42 days) prior to initiation of treatment on day 1; subjects for whom newlyobtained samples cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or subject safety concern) may submit an archived specimen only upon agreement from the Sponsor; an optional core biopsy will be requested from an accessible metastatic site after 2 cycles of treatment Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance scale Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,500/mcL Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dL or &gt;= 5.6 mmol/L without transfusion or erythropoietin (EPO) dependency (within 7 days of assessment) Measured or calculated creatinine clearance (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] can also be used in place of creatinine or creatinine clearance [CrCl]) &gt;= 30mL/min for subject with creatinine levels &gt;
