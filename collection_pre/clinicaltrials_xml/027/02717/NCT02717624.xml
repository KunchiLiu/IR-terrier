	<criteria>Men and women ≥ 18 years of age. Pathologically confirmed MCL. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤ 2. Agreement to use highly effective forms of contraception during the study and for 90 days after the last dose of ACP 196, 120 days after the last dose of bendamustine, or 12 months after the last dose of rituximab, whichever is longest. Treatment Naive MCL patients requiring treatment with no exposure to prior therapies. Relapsed/Refractory patients defined as disease relapsed or been refractory to ≥ 1 prior therapies for MCL and requiring further treatment. Patient who discontinued any prior treatment for MCL for tolerability reasons can also be enrolled. Significant cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled or untreated symptomatic arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within 6 months of screening, or any Class 3 or 4 cardiac disease as defined by the New York Heart Association Functional Classification.Exception: Subjects with controlled, asymptomatic atrial fibrillation during screening are allowed to enroll on study Malabsorption syndrome, disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal function, resection of the stomach, extensive small bowel resection that is likely to affect absorption, symptomatic inflammatory bowel disease, partial or complete bowel obstruction, or gastric restrictions and bariatric surgery, such as gastric bypass Uncontrolled active systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection (defined as exhibiting ongoing signs/symptoms related to the infection and without improvement, despite appropriate antibiotics or other treatment), or intravenous antiinfective treatment within 2 weeks before first dose of study drug Breastfeeding or pregnant Concurrent participation in another therapeutic clinical trial.</criteria>
