	<detailed_description>Primary Endpoint: - Radiographic &amp; clinical fracture healing at 3 months post-surgery. Secondary Endpoints: - Complications - Radiologic &amp; clinical fracture healing at 6 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months post-surgery. - Callus size &amp; distribution at 6 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months post-surgery. Radiologic fracture healing is defined as bridging of three of the four cortices as seen on x-ray/CT. Clinical healing will be assessed using the Function Index for Trauma (FIX-IT). The FIX-IT instrument quantifies clinical healing by assessing weight-bearing and fracture site pain on an ordinal scale. It has been initially validated in patients with tibia and femur fractures. Callus size of the anterior, posterior, and medial aspect will be assessed for each time point using a validated and published computational method.</detailed_description>
