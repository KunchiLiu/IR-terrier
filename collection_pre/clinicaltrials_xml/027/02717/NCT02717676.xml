	<brief_summary>Previous studies concluded that striae gravidarum assessment appears to predict the occurrence of perineal tears and recommend training the health personnel to calculate the total striae score which can help them decide if episiotomy is to be given or not. Episiotomy definitely seems to be preventive for perineal tears but giving episiotomy for the same is still debatable as episiotomy in itself is associated with morbidity. the hypothesis is episiotomy done in patients with high score will definitely protects against perineal tears. So, the aim of study is to determine whether assessment of striae gravidarum score could predict occurrence of tears during labor or not, and if episiotomy will prevent perineal tears in women with high score.</brief_summary>
