	<brief_summary>The PATHway system is designed to help patients remain physically active and maintain a good cardiovascular health. It proposes a novel approach that aims to empower patients to self-manage their CVD, set within a collaborative care context with health professionals. This will be achieved via a patient-centric holistic approach that specifically addresses the above barriers. It involves an internet-enabled and sensor-based home exercise platform. It is represented by several modules with an exercise module as the core component which will provide individualized rehabilitation programs that use regular, socially inclusive exercise sessions as the basis upon which to provide a personalized, comprehensive lifestyle intervention program (managing exercise, smoking, diet, stress, alcohol use etc.) to enable patients to both better understand and deal with their own condition and to lead a healthier lifestyle in general. The goal of this trial is to assess the acceptability, short-term effectiveness on lifestyle and health related physical fitness and cost-effectiveness of the PATHway intervention in patients with CVD in a single blind multicentre pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT).</brief_summary>
