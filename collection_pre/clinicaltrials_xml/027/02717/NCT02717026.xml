	<brief_summary>Retinal blood flow measurement is of scientific and clinical value. For this purpose retinal vessel morphology (such as diameter, vessel wall thickness, etc) determination is crucial. Different imaging modalities might provide divergent results. Thus, quantification of such differences is valuable. The present study aims to reveal and quantify differences in vessel morphology between fundus photography, fundus angiography, and optical coherence tomography in health and disease.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is considered a pilot study and will pe performed on patients scheduled for routine fluorescein angiography. During the study day the following procedures will be performed: - Medical history and concomitant medication - Blood pressure and heart rate - Assessment of visual acuity using Snellen vision charts - Biomicroscopy - Intraocular pressure - Funduscopy - IOL-Master axial length measurement - Fundusphotography - Optical coherence tomography - Fluorescein Angiography Fundus photography analysis will be performed with an automated software and analysis of both angiography and optical coherence tomography will be performed via the devices inbuilt software.</detailed_description>
