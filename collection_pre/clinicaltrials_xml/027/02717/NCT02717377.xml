	<brief_summary>This study is designed to test the effects of six 5 minute microbursts of physical activity spread across the day as compared to either a sedentary control condition or a single 30 minute bout of moderate intensity physical activity on cognitive function, self-reported energy levels, aspects of eating behavior and measures of metabolic health. The primary hypotheses are: 1. Hourly 5 minute bouts of moderate intensity exercise during the day will increase afternoon cognitive function as compared to a no exercise condition. 2. Hourly 5 minute bouts of moderate intensity exercise during the day will increase afternoon cognitive function more than a single 30 minute AM bout. Secondary exploratory hypotheses include 1. Hourly 5 minute bouts of moderate intensity exercise during the day will increase self-reported energy levels, reduce orexigenic appetitive measures and improve measures of metabolic health as compared to a no exercise condition. 2. Hourly 5 minute bouts of moderate intensity exercise during the day will increase self-reported energy levels, reduce orexigenic appetitive measures and improve measures of metabolic health more than a single 30 minute AM bout.</brief_summary>
