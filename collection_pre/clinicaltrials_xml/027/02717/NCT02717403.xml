	<brief_summary>Objectives: The overall goal of this study is to use the principles of chronic disease management to develop and test an online social networking intervention using the FB platform in a randomized controlled trial. Our specific objectives are as follows: Aim 1: To develop and establish an independent closed community in FB for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, providing an educational platform for disease self-management and the potential for engaging in social networking with peers (Phase 2). Objective 1. To beta test the features and navigation buttons and panels in the newly developed website and FB group. Objective 2. To evaluate the contents, ease of use and satisfaction with the newly developed website and FB group by patient advocates (consultants to the study) who participate as members of the Facebook community. Aim 2: To evaluate the efficacy of the FB community intervention combined with an educational website to improve patients' self-management (including knowledge, which is the primary outcome), decision making and patient-reported outcomes compared with the educational website alone (Phase 3). We hypothesize that participation in an online closed community offering evidence-based information combined with peer interaction and support will improve patients' knowledge.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pilot Testing Phase: Five participants will be recruited to pilot test and give feedback on the control educational website and the FB community. Participants will have access to the educational website and FB, for a period of one week. The main purpose is to test ease of use and satisfaction with both platforms. After 1 week, research staff will call the participant to obtain feedback about the websites. The interview will last approximately 30 minutes and in the case the participant does not finish the interview, the investigators will conduct a follow-up phone interview. Randomization Phase: Participants will complete a self response electronic questionnaire at baseline. Participants then randomized into one of two arms: Intervention (FB + Website) and Control (Website alone). The participant will be shown how to access the website and the Facebook page on the internet about rheumatoid arthritis. Patients will be assessed at three and six months after baseline via email self response electronic questionnaires. This phase will recruit 220 participants.</detailed_description>

Ongoing or prior treatment with traditional diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs or biologic agents (RCT) 5. Adequate cognitive status as determined by a research coordinator at recruitment. To assess the participant's capacity to take part in the interview, the interviewer will note and comment on the participant's spontaneous speech and capacity to write date at the time of consent. Participants should be oriented to person, place, date, time, and events (RCT) 6. Living in the community (not institutionalized, etc. ) (RCT) 7. Able to communicate in English (RCT) 8. Use internet on average atleast once a week (RCT); 9. Disease duration 10 years or less (RCT) 10. Familiarity with and participation in social media (e.g. Facebook) (usability test and RCT) 1. Participants not willing to complete interviews or survey instruments (usability test and RCT) 2. Hospitalized (RCT) 3.
