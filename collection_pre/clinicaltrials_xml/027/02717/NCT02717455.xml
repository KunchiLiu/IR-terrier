	<brief_title>Trial of Panobinostat in Children With Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Description This is a multicenter, phase 1 trial of Panobinostat (LBH589) for children with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma tumors. Panobinostat is a pan-HDAC inhibitor of Class I, II and IV histone deacetylases (HDACs) involved in the deacetylation of histone and non-histone cellular proteins. Panobinostat inhibits purified total cellular histone deacetylase activity (IC50 = 0.03 uM) and activities of most HDAC isoforms (IC50 &lt;10nM). In addition, panobinostat induces expression of the cell-cycle control genes including CDKN1A (p21), and selectively inhibits the proliferation of a variety of tumor cells compared to normal cells. It has been extensively profiled for its in vitro and in vivo pharmacological activity on a variety of tumor cell lines and tumor xenograft mice models. Based on the in vitro and in vivo activity of panobinostat in preclinical models using DIPG cell cultures and orthotopic xenograft model systems, and the potentially important role of histone deacetylases and histone 3 K27M mutations in relation to pontine malignancies, the investigators are conducting a Phase 1 study of panobinostat in children with recurrent/progressive DIPG. The primary objectives of the study are to (1) describe the toxicity profile and define the dose- limiting toxicities of panobinostat in children with recurrent/progressive DIPG; (2) estimate the maximum tolerated dose and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose of panobinostat in children with recurrent/progressive DIPG; and (3) evaluate and characterize the plasma pharmacokinetics of panobinostat in children with recurrent/progressive DIPG. Schema Only patients with recurrent or progressive DIPG will be enrolled initially. Panobinostat will be administered every other day, 3 times/week, p.o. preferably on a Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule for three weeks, followed by a rest period. Three weeks of therapy plus the one week rest period (total 4 weeks) will constitute one course. Treatment will continue for up to two years (26 courses) unless the patient experiences progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity or any of the off-study criteria. The starting dose (dose level 1) is 10 mg/m2/day. Below are the proposed dose levels to be studied: Dose level # Panobinostat oral dose (mg) Minimum BSA Restriction 0*: 5 mg/m2/day MWF, three weeks on, one week off (1 course = 28 days). Patients must have a BSA ≥ 0.80 m2. 1 (starting dose level): 10 mg/m2/day MWF, three weeks on, one week off, (1 course = 28 days). Patients must have a BSA ≥ 0.65 m2. 2: 16 mg/m2/day MWF, three weeks on, one week off, (1 course = 28 days) . Patients must have a BSA ≥ 0.65 m2. 3: 22 mg/m2/day MWF, three weeks on, one week off, (1 course = 28 days). Patients must have a BSA ≥ 0.65 m2. 4: 28 mg/m2/day MWF, three weeks on, one week off, (1 course = 28 days) . Patients must have a BSA ≥ 0.50 m2. 5: 36 mg/m2/day MWF, three weeks on, one week off, (1 course = 28 days). Patients must have a BSA ≥ 0.50 m2. Panobinostat will be administered as a single agent * Dose level 0 represents a potential treatment dose for patients requiring a dose reduction from dose level 1 and may be used as a contingency dose level if the starting dose level of panobinostat is not tolerated in the initial cohort.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA DIAGNOSIS Patients with progressive DIPG, as defined by progressive neurologic abnormalities or worsening neurologic status not explained by causes unrelated to tumor progression (e.g., anticonvulsant or corticosteroid toxicity wean, electrolyte disturbances, sepsis, hyperglycemia, etc.), OR an increase in the bidimensional measurement, taking as a reference the smallest disease measurement recorded since diagnosis, OR the appearance of a new tumor lesion since diagnosis. Please note: patients with a radiographically typical DIPG, defined as a tumor with a pontine epicenter and diffuse involvement of more than 2/3 of the pons, are eligible without histologic confirmation. Patients with pontine lesions that do not meet these radiographic criteria will be eligible if there is histologic confirmation of malignant glioma WHO IIIV. AGE Patients must be ≥ 2 but &lt; 22 years of age at the time of enrollment. BSA Patients must have a BSA ≥ 0.80 m2 for dose 5mg/m2. Patients must have a BSA ≥ 0.65 m2 for doses of 10mg/m2 22 mg/m2. Patients must have a BSA ≥ 0.50 m2 for doses of 28 mg/m2 36 mg/m2. ABILITY TO SWALLOW Patient must be able to swallow capsules whole. PERFORMANCE STATUS Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS for &gt; 16 years of age) or Lansky Performance Score (LPS for ≤ 16 years of age) assessed within 7 days of enrollment must be ≥ 50%. Patients who are unable to walk because of neurologic deficits, but who are up in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the performance score.
