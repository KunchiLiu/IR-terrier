	<brief_summary>Characterizing the nature and severity of tinnitus in individuals presents a particular challenge. The nature of the sound (loudness and pitch) is not necessarily indicative of the effect on quality of life. Different methods are used to measure each parameter. Loudness is measured using a technique called "minimum masking," in which the subject is presented with a broadband white noise and asked to adjust the loudness level until they can no longer hear their tinnitus. Severity of tinnitus is commonly characterized using two questionnaires: the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) and the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI). These questionnaires assess the perceived severity of the tinnitus and the effect on everyday activities and quality of life. A visual analog scale (a scale from 0-10) is used as a general subjective measurement of tinnitus severity. In the first part of this study, we will measure each of these parameters over a series of sessions to establish a baseline variability for each individual. The second part will look at the influence of context-specific visual information on auditory perception. This involves watching silent videos of a person speaking, with and without an additional tone designed to match the subject's tinnitus. The effect of this audiovisual feedback on the subject's perception of tinnitus will be assessed using a subjective rating scale and the minimum masking task.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study is not specifically seeking to treat tinnitus, but is designed to investigate various parameters that can alter the tinnitus percept. Findings from this study will help identify parameters that can be more effective at decreasing or fully suppressing the tinnitus percept that will be systematically explored in a follow-up study.</detailed_description>
