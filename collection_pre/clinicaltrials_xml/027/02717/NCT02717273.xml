	<brief_title>A Study of Incidence of Surgical Site Infections in Liver Transplant Patients on an Extended Course of Peri-operative Antibiotics (Three Days) as Compared to Standard of Care Consisting of a Single Dose Pre-operatively and Intra-operative Re-dosing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be to prospectively determine differences in SSI if a prolonged course of post-operative antibiotics are used following liver transplantation. All adult patients, admitted to the University of Virginia (UVA) Medical Center for first-time liver transplantation will be randomized to the standard of care of peri-operative antibiotics or extended course of three total days. Patients will be evaluated primarily for the presence of post-operative surgical site infections but also for fever, elevated white blood counts, secondary infections (urinary tract, pneumonia, and blood stream), length of hospital stay, graft loss, and mortality for 30 days after liver transplant.</detailed_description>
