	<brief_title>Effect of Intermittent ThetaBurst Stimulation in Treatment-resistant Bipolar Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods: A double-blind randomized sham-controlled pilot study will be conducted in 40 patients with bipolar treatment-resistant depression receiving either active (n=20) or sham (n=20) iTBS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Depression severity will be assessed by an investigator blinded to iTBS condition before and after 10 to 30 iTBS sessions depending on remission onset. Remission will be defined as Beck Depression Inventory, BDI score&lt;10. Objective/Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesized the superiority of active iTBS over sham ITBS</detailed_description>
