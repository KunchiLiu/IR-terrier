	<brief_summary>Objective: Premolar autotransplantation represents an effective therapeutic option for the treatment of juvenile dentition in traumatic dental injury with tooth loss. Numerous studies report on the osteoinductive potency of the method, however, to date no quantitative data has been provided. The objective of this prospective clinical study was to quantitatively assess the bone and soft tissue levels after autogenous premolar transplantation by clinical and radiographic parameters. Materials/Methods: In the study 26 premolars were transplanted in 20 patients after traumatic dental injury (n=10) or tooth aplasia (n=16) in the upper front. Standard clinical parameters were evaluated. Based on a standardized photo documentation, the relative soft tissue level was measured in comparison to the healthy adjacent teeth. Radiographic findings involved the evaluation of root resorption, pulp canal obliterations and the relative bone height. Patient satisfaction was determined using a standardized questionnaire.</brief_summary>
