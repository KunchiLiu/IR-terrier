	<detailed_description>The proposed work will investigate the effects of avocados on abdominal obesity and glycemic control among overweight/obese adults. Further, changes in GI microbiota composition and cognitive function will be assessed to comprehensively understand systemic benefits of avocado consumption on gut and brain function. This research study has two aims: 1) To determine the effects of regular avocado intake on metabolic syndrome risk factors, specifically, abdominal obesity and glycemic control, among overweight and obese adults; and 2) to investigate the implications of avocado intake on measures of GI microbiota composition and cognitive function.</detailed_description>
