	<brief_summary>Purpose: of determining the role of Interactive Binocular Treatment (I-BiTTM) as a complementary method of patching in amblyopia therapy. Materials and Methods: In this randomized clinical trial study, 50 unilateral amblyopic children (25 male/25 female) less than 10 years with either best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) ≤0.3 LogMAR (Logarithm minimum angle of resolution) in amblyopic eye or difference of VA≥2 lines between two eyes will be included. Patients will be classified in the case and control groups (25 in each), randomly. Patching will be recommended in both, cases will also received I-BiTTM. The child will be asked to play I-BiTTM games through glasses with conjugate colored filters. Patching was continued for one month more in both groups. VA and stereoacuity were measured at baseline, one month at the end of I-BiTTM treatment and one month after I-BiTTM treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this clinical trial study, our case group will receive I-BiTTM in the format of three playing games which have been designed suitable to the age of our cases. The mechanism of I-BiTTM has been designed in three playing games with inducing more foveal stimulation for the amblyopic eye through presentation of movable targets with more detailed. In addition, unmovable targets will presented to the non-amblyopic eyes. Playing games were continued 30 minutes in each session for 5 days in each week within one month.</detailed_description>
