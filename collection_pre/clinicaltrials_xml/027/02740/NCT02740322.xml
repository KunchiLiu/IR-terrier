	<brief_summary>The sensitivity and specificity of the Hum Test is being investigated in it's ability to detect conductive hearing loss. The hum test is simply elicited by asking the subject to hum to him or herself for a few seconds at both a high and low pitch that is comfortable for the subject. The subject is then asked if the hum was heard on one side more than the other (left or right), or if the sound was equal on both sides. To simulate conductive hearing loss, ear plugs will be placed in one of the subject's ears. We will elicit the hum test as well as the standard Weber test and audiogram across two conditions, with an ear plug and without an ear plug. From this, it is hoped to assess how the Hum Test compares to the audiogram (gold standard) in detecting conductive hearing loss as well as how it compares to the standard Weber test. If the Hum Test demonstrates strong sensitivity and specificity in detecting conductive hearing loss, it could have application as being utilized as an alternative to the standard Weber test, or in a setting where a formal physical examination may not yet be possible but where the etiology of a patient's hearing change could be quickly assessed remotely and thus the urgency of intervention/ consultation could then be determined.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validating the Hum Test</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is presumed that the Hum Test works similarly to the Weber Test, where bone conduction of the skull is elicited to determine if a change in hearing is conductive or sensorineural in nature. Because the hum test is frequently employed in clinical practice yet its validation has yet to be demonstrated, investigation is warranted. To examine and compare the Hum Test, Weber Test, and audiogram in their ability to detect and identify hearing loss, hearing loss will be simulated with the use of ear plugs (mimicking conductive hearing loss). Subjects will serve as their own control as these tests will be conducted with and without ear plugs. Study data will be maintained using an online, password protected storage system. No identifiable information will be collected or stored (i.e. name, DOB, etc.). Limited demographic information will be collected for analysis purposes such as age and gender.</detailed_description>
