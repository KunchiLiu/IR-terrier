	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I, open-label, multicenter study of continuous oral dosing of AZD4635 administered as a single agent and then in combination with a PD-L1 antibody, durvalumab. The study design allows an escalation of dose with intensive safety monitoring to ensure the safety of the patients. The primary objective of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of AZD4635 in combination with durvalumab.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Clinical Study of AZD4635 and Durvalumab in Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be conducted in two segments. The first segment of the study (Phase 1a) will be a dose escalation design in order to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of AZD4635 given as monotherapy and in combination with durvalumab. The MTD will be determined by assessing adverse events and the incidence of abnormal laboratory measures. Once the maximum tolerated monotherapy dose of AZD4635 has been determined, combination dosing with durvalumab will start in a new cohort of patients at one dose level lower than the highest tolerated dose of AZD4635 monotherapy. The combination therapy cohorts in Phase 1a will also have a 2-week monotherapy lead-in after which patients who tolerate monotherapy AZD4635 will then continue twice daily dosing of AZD4635 in combination with durvalumab (anti programmed-death ligand 1 [PD-L1]) at the fixed dose of 1.5 grams IV every 4 weeks. When the maximum-tolerated dose in the combination setting is determined, additional patients with advanced solid malignancies will be enrolled to a dose expansion portion to explore further the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and biological activity at the selected doses. Approximately 24 to 36 patients with advanced solid malignancies will be treated in Phase 1a. The second segment of the study (Phase 1b) will consist of an additional expansion phase at the MTD of the combination in approximately 15 patients with non-small cell lung cancer who have previously received anti-PD-1 therapy, but either failed to respond or progressed after an initial response. At least one cohort in this study may investigate the preliminary effect of food on AZD4635. This may be performed in either a dose-escalation cohort (monotherapy or combination) or a dose-expansion cohort.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1. Age ≥ 18. 2. Availability of an archival tumor tissue sample. If archival tumour tissue is not available, then tissue from a fresh biopsy can be used. 3. Patients in the combination cohorts must have at least 1 tumour lesion amenable to biopsy and must be medically fit and willing to undergo a biopsy during screening and, unless clinically contraindicated, after 2 weeks on monotherapy. 4. Phase 1a: histological or cytological confirmation of a solid, malignant tumor (excluding CNS tumors), that is refractory to standard therapies or for which no standard therapies exist. Phase 1b: histological or cytological confirmation of NSCLC with prior antiPD1 therapy. 5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance 01. 6. Normotensive or well controlled blood pressure (BP) (&lt;140/90). 7. Females should be using adequate contraceptive measures from the time of screening until 3 months after study discontinuation, should not be breast feeding and must have negative pregnancy test prior to the start of dosing. 8. Male patients should be willing to use barrier contraception for the duration of the study and for 3 months after treatment discontinuation. 9. To participate in Phase 1b all of the following must apply: a) patients must have advanced or metastatic NSCLC; b) patients must have previously received an antiPD1 therapy, but either failed to respond or stopped responding after an initial response; c) patients must have measurable disease, i.e., at least one lesion that can be accurately assessed at baseline by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or Xray, that is suitable for repeated assessment. Exclusion Criteria 1. Treatment with any of the following: 1. nitrosourea or mitomycin C within 6 weeks of the first dose 2. any investigational agents or drugs from a previous clinical study within 28 days 3. any investigational medicinal product or other systemic anticancer treatment within 4 weeks or within 8 weeks after immunotherapy or other long halflife antibody therapy 4. Rx or nonRx drugs or other products known to be sensitive CYP3A4 substrates or CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, or to be potent inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4, sensitive substrates of CYP2C9, CYP 2C19, BCRP, and OAT1, which cannot be discontinued 2 weeks prior to Day 1 of dosing and withheld throughout the study until 2 weeks after the last dose of AZD4635. 5. herbal preparations/medications are not allowed throughout the study, including but not limited to St. John's Wort, kava, ephedra (ma huang), gingko biloba, dehydroepiandrosterone, yohimbe, saw palmetto, and ginseng. 6. prior therapy with any other A2aR antagonist 2. Major surgery within 4 weeks of the first dose of study treatment 3. Radiotherapy with a wide field of radiation within 4 weeks or radiotherapy with a limited field of radiation for palliation within 2 weeks of the first dose of study treatment. 4. Greater than 8 weeks since prior immune checkpoint therapy (with documented PD) or &gt;12 weeks post immune checkpoint therapy with initial response and then PD or prolonged SD. 5. Evidence of recent or significant cardiovascular (CV) disease. 6. Concomitant medication with another A1R antagonist that would increase the risk of seizure (e.g., theophylline, aminophylline). 7. AZD4635 in the present study (i.e., dosing with AZD4635 previously initiated in a different cohort in this study), or prior therapy with AZD4635 or any other A2AR antagonist; 8. Major surgery within 4 weeks. 9. Radiotherapy with a wide field of radiation within 4 weeks or radiotherapy with a limited field of radiation for palliation within 2 weeks 10.
