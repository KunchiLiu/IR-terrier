	<brief_summary>This multicentre, non-comparative design study will monitor the impact of long term management of DH with daily use of a sensitivity toothpaste on the quality of life of a population of sensitivity sufferers. Changes in oral health related quality of life will be monitored using the Dentine Hypersensitivity Experience Questionnaire (DHEQ). The study will be conducted in participants in good general health, with pre-existing self-reported and clinically diagnosed tooth sensitivity at screening.</brief_summary>

Sensitive teeth with contributing aetiologies other than erosion, abrasion or recession of exposed dentine and Sensitive tooth not expected to respond to treatment with an overthecounter dentifrice in the opinion of the investigator Use of an oral care product indicated for the relief of dentine hypersensitivity within 8 weeks of screening (participants will be required to bring their current oral care products to the site in order to verify the absence of known antisensitivity ingredients) Daily doses of medication/treatments which, in the opinion of the investigator, could interfere with the perception of pain. Examples of such medications include analgesics, anticonvulsants, antihistamines that cause marked or moderate sedation, sedatives, tranquilizers, antidepressants, moodaltering and antiinflammatory drugs, currently taking antibiotics or has taken antibiotics within 2 weeks of Baseline and daily dose of a medication which, in the opinion of the investigator, is causing xerostomia</criteria>
