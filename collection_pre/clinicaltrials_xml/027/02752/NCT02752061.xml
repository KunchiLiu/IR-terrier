	<brief_summary>Diagnostic and treatment delays contribute substantially to disparities in cancer morbidity and mortality between low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) and high-income countries. Individuals present with advanced stage disease resulting in minimal chance for cure or long-term survival. The Potlako project will implement and evaluate a multifaceted intervention to test the hypothesis that a package of enhanced coordination of care including an electronic messaging, transportation support, and training targeted at generalist clinicians at primary and secondary level facilities, can reduce time to diagnosis and stage at diagnosis for HIV-infected individuals with cancer.</brief_summary>
