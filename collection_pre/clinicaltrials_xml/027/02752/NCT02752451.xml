	<brief_title>Cigar Box Arthroscopy: A Study of Non-Anatomic Arthroscopy Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A non-anatomic set of training modules utilizing cigar boxes was developed at our institution to instruct residents in the basics of knee arthroscopy. Twenty-four medical students with no prior arthroscopic or laparoscopic experience were enrolled as subjects. Sixteen subjects were randomized to participate in four hours of either the cigar box arthroscopy trainer (CBAT) or a previously validated anatomic knee arthroscopy trainer (AKAT). The remaining eight subjects served as controls (CO). All subjects underwent a one-hour formalized training session provided by our orthopaedic sports faculty. Subjects' skills were assessed by one of two faculty members through repeated attempts at performing a diagnostic knee arthroscopy on a cadaveric specimen. Objective scores were given using the Basic Arthroscopic Knee Skill Scoring System. Total cost differences were also calculated.</detailed_description>
