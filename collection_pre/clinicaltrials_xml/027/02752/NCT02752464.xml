	<brief_summary>Overweight/obesity is strongly linked to mortality from multiple chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity-related cancers.The successful management of overweight/obesity requires management of nutrition and physical activity over time. For racial/ethnic minority and low-income populations, who face both higher prevalence of obesity and chronic diseases compared to others, interventions promoting behavioral change are a national health priority. From the available range of behavioral change intervention strategies, there is a growing knowledge base that documents the efficacy of peer support interventions for improving self-care, quality of life, and behavioral change. In this study, the investigators will examine the following research question: What is the preliminary efficacy and degree of implementation and acceptability of an intervention approach in which peer counselors provide evidenced-based counseling about nutrition and physical activity behaviors for weight management to public housing residents using a computer-assisted program called CuesWeight?</brief_summary>
