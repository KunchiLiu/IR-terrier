	<brief_summary>The infiltration of the surgical wound is an effective strategy for postoperative analgesia. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatories are useful in this way. Objective: To compare the analgesic effectiveness of diclofenac sodium, bupivacaine or bupivacaine plus diclofenac sodium infiltrating wound appendectomies. Method: Comparative, double blind, American Society Anesthesiologist classification I-II,18-65a√±os. Group 1 (Bupivacaine n = 14), Group 2 (Diclofenac Sodium n = 14), Group 3 (Bupivacaine + Diclofenac Sodium n = 15). Pain at rest and dynamic, rescue analgesic consumption in Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) and 24 hours after surgery were evaluated.</brief_summary>
