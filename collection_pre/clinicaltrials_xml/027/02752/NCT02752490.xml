	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine if a strategy of indicated compared to liberal oxygen administration in labor decreases the rate of cesarean delivery. The hypothesis is that women who undergo a strategy of indicated compared to liberal oxygen administration in labor will have lower rate of cesarean delivery and fetal acidemia at birth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Comparative Effectiveness of Liberal Versus Restricted Maternal Administration of Oxygen During Labor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-site before and after study comparing the strategy of liberal versus indicated use of maternal oxygen in the first and second stages of labor in the setting of a category 2 fetal heart rate tracing (FHR) tracing, as defined by American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) and National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) guidelines. All patients who are at term and are undergoing labor at Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston, Texas during the time frame of the study will be included in the study. The study will be conducted over 18 weeks. It will involve two 8 week time periods during which all patients will under either a strategy of liberal administration of oxygen use (current practice) in the "before" portion of the study and indicated administration of oxygen in the "after" portion of the study (new practice). There will be a transition period where training, education, and audit + feedback will be done to prepare for a strategy of indicated administration of oxygen.</detailed_description>
