	<brief_summary>The objective of this trial is to determine whether an opioid-free general anesthetic (OFA) technique utilizing ketamine, dexmedetomidine, and lidocaine infusions can help reduce postoperative pain in opiate-dependent chronic pain patients (CPPs) undergoing spine surgery when compared with traditional opioid-containing techniques. It is expected that this OFA regimen will have a measurable reduction on postoperative opioid consumption and pain scores in CPPs.</brief_summary>
