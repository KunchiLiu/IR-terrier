	<brief_title>DyeVert System RCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized, parallel group, single center clinical evaluation of the DyeVert System. Subjects undergoing a diagnostic coronary angiogram procedure with a 5 French catheter are eligible to participate in this study. The treatment group will use the DyeVert System. The trial will be conducted at one center, located in Germany. A sample size of 96 evaluable subjects will provide a sufficient number of samples to evaluate the primary objectives. Randomization will occur following confirmation that the subject meets the inclusion/exclusion criteria and has signed an informed consent. Subjects that are anticipated to be a diagnostic only procedure, but end up being an ad-hoc PCI, can still remain enrolled in the trial. If a subject proceeds to a PCI, data will only be collected through the diagnostic portion of the case.</detailed_description>
