	<brief_summary>Intestinal anastomosis plays an important role in various general surgeries, but the complications such as anastomotic leakage,stenosis and hemorrhage cannot been avoided. Although many ways are put up to solve this problem, there are still many imports need to improve. Therefore, the Biodegradable Stenting Anastomoses(BSA), which make intestinal anastomosis easily and less complications, have been produced.The major goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Biodegradable Stenting Anastomoses(BSA) for reconstruction in surgery of intestinal anastomosis.</brief_summary>
