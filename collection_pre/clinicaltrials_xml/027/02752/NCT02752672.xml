	<brief_summary>Dithranol (known in the U.S.A. as anthralin and in Germany as cignolin) is one of the oldest and safest topical anti-psoriatic treatments. However, despite explorative investigations, the skin disease-clearing mechanisms of dithranol remain poorly understood (Painsi et al, JDDG 2015). The purpose of this study is to investigate the therapeutic mechanisms of dithranol in psoriasis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study on the Therapeutic Mechanisms of Dithranol Treatment in Patients With Chronic Plaque Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Skins biopsies from psoriatic skin and blood samples will be taken before (day 0) and at several time points after start (day 4, week 2-3, and week 6-7) of dithranol therapy to be subjected to an explorative analysis (see outcome measures). A total of maximal 15 psoriasis patients will be enrolled. Normal lesion-adjacent skin from 10 patients undergoing surgery for non-inflammatory conditions will serve as control.</detailed_description>
