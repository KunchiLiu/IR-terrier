	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To compare LixiLan to insulin glargine in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) change from baseline to Week 26 in patients with type 2 Diabetes. Secondary Objective: To compare the overall efficacy and safety of LixiLan to insulin glargine (with or without OADs) over a 26 Week treatment period in patients with type 2 Diabetes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The maximum study duration per patient will be approximately 29 weeks: an up to 2-week screening period, a 26-week randomized open-label treatment period and a 3-day post-treatment safety follow up period.</detailed_description>
