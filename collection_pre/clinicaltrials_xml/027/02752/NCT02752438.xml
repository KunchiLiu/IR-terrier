	<brief_title>Rescue High Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation in Newborns Who Do Not Respond to Conventional Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although High Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation (HFOV) has been used in case of unresponsive to conventional mechanical ventilation both in children and newborns, there is no data on its success and the factors that affect its success in the literature. The aim of the study is to define the factors that affect the success of HFOV in newborns who do not respond to conventional mechanical ventilation through an online registry among neonatal intensive care units in Turkey.</detailed_description>
