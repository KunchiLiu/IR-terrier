	<detailed_description>The study will be presented to clients, who will be asked to formally consent to participate. Clients residing or working in northern Thailand and able to communicate with the counselor will be eligible. Foreigners staying in Thailand for vacation or retirement will be excluded, except if presenting together with their partner who is otherwise eligible for the study. At each visit, participants will be proposed an appointment for a re-test. If they wish, the study team will send them reminders. At the first visit, participants will be randomly assigned to one of three different methods for counseling on HIV, hepatitis B and C, and syphilis: standard face-to-face counseling, computer-assisted informational/educational counseling followed by a face-to-face counseling, or minimal counseling (the counselor invites the participant to ask questions). At each visit, blood sample will be collected to test for HIV, hepatitis B and C, and syphilis. at the Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences. Laboratory examinations will be free of charge for all participants. After the blood draw, participants will be invited to complete a questionnaire to assess their knowledge, attitudes and practices with regard to HIV and other infections. Test results will then be provided. In case of confirmed HIV infection, participants will be provided with further counseling, CD4 cell count measurement and referral options for immediate treatment. Blood samples collected during the study for the diagnosis will be stored for determination of the Fiebig stage (duration since HIV primary infection), evaluation of transmitted HIV drug resistance (sequencing) and investigation of viral transmission networks.</detailed_description>
