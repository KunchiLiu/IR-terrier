	<detailed_description>The purpose of our study is to evaluate the effect of air ambulance transport on patients presenting with an ischemic stroke and receive tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA). Primary outcome will be the evaluation of air ambulance transfer and if it leads to protocol violations or significant delays in therapy. Protocol violations include inaccurate dosing or preparation at the outside hospital, uncontrolled blood pressure before and during the flight, unnecessary medication administration before and during the flight and adverse events (intracranial bleeding, allergic reaction) associated with transfer process. Additional evaluation will include the effects of vibration of the air ambulance and its effects on the lytic activity of rtPA. rtPA is not supposed to be significantly agitated after it is prepared in solution and there is significant vibration and agitation during air ambulance transfer.</detailed_description>
