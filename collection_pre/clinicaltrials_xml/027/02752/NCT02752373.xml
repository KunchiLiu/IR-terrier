	<brief_title>A Health Economic Study Evaluating the Brain Sentinel® GTC Seizure Detection and Information Systems Impact on Epilepsy and Healthcare Utilization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Brain Sentinel® GTC Seizure Detection and Information System is an ambulatory system designed to continuously monitor and perform real-time analysis of surface electromyography (sEMG) data to detect GTC seizures and to provide an alarm to alert caregivers within 30 seconds of bilateral, appendicular, tonic extension that a seizure is occurring. The System is for recording and storing sEMG data, which is subsequently reviewed by a trained healthcare professional in the outpatient clinical setting. The Brain Sentinel® GTC Seizure Detection and Information System is intended for real time monitoring of pediatric and adult patients who have an arm circumference ranging from at least 16 cm to no greater than 51 cm at the biceps. It may be used in the home or healthcare facilities for real-time monitoring during the day, night, or for continuous monitoring, including during the titration of, or the withdrawal from anti-epileptic drugs.</detailed_description>
