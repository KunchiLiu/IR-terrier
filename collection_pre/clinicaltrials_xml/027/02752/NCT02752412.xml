	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To compare LixiLan to insulin glargine in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) change from baseline to week 26 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Secondary Objective: To compare overall efficacy and safety of LixiLan to insulin glargine over 26 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of LixiLan Versus Insulin Glargine Alone Both With Metformin in Japanese With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Inadequately Controlled on Basal Insulin and Oral Antidiabetic Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The maximum study duration per patient will be approximately 41 weeks: an up to 14-week screening period (consisting of an up to 2-week screening phase and a 12-week run-in phase), a 26-week randomized treatment period, and a 3-day post-treatment safety follow-up period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : Patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) diagnosed for at least 1 year before the screening visit (V1). Patient treated with a stable, once a day basal insulin regimen (ie, type of insulin and time/frequency of the injection), for at least 3 months before the screening visit. The total daily basal insulin dose should be stable (± 20%) and &lt;15 U/day for at least 1 month before the screening visit. Patient receiving 1 or 2 oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs): the OAD dose(s) must be stable during the 3 months before the screening visit. The OADs can be 1 to 2 out of: Metformin; Sulfonylurea (SU); Glinide; Dipeptidylpeptidase4 (DPP4) inhibitor; Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor; Alpha glucosidase inhibitor (alphaGI). Signed written informed consent. Exclusion criteria: Age &lt;20 years at screening visit. HbA1c at screening visit &lt;7.5% or &gt;9.5%. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) &gt;180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L) at screening visit. Pregnancy or lactation, women of childbearing potential with no effective contraceptive method. Use of oral or injectable glucoselowering agents other than those stated in the inclusion criteria in the 3 months before screening visit. Previous use of insulin regimen other than basal insulin, eg, prandial or premixed insulin. Note: Shortterm treatment (≤10 days) due to intercurrent illness including gestational diabetes is allowed at the discretion of the Investigator. Use of thiazolidinedione (TZD) within 6 months prior to screening visit. History of discontinuation of a previous treatment with a glucagonlike peptide1(GLP1) receptor agonist due to safety/ tolerability issues or lack of efficacy. Laboratory findings at the screening visit; including: Amylase and/or lipase &gt;3 times the upper limit of the normal (ULN) laboratory range; Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;3 ULN; Calcitonin ≥20 pg/mL (5.9 pmol/L); Positive serum pregnancy test. Any contraindication to metformin use according to local labeling. History of hypersensitivity to any GLP1 receptor agonist or to metacresol. Contraindication to use of insulin glargine or lixisenatide according to local labeling. History of hypersensitivity to insulin glargine or to any of the excipients. Personal or immediate family history of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) or genetic condition that predisposes to MTC (eg, multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes). History of pancreatitis (unless pancreatitis was related to gallstones and cholecystectomy has now been performed), pancreatitis during previous treatment with incretin therapies, chronic pancreatitis, pancreatectomy, stomach/gastric surgery. Exclusion criteria for randomization at the end of the runin phase: HbA1c &lt;7.5% or &gt;9.5% at visit 6 (Week 1). Mean fasting self monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) &gt;160 mg/dL (8.9 mmol/L), calculated from all available (minimum of 4 selfmeasurements) values during the 7 days prior to randomization. Note:fasting SMPG on the day of randomization can be included if assessed before randomization. Average insulin glargine daily dose ≥15 U/day or &lt;5U/day calculated for the last 3 days before Visit 7. Metformin total daily dose &lt;750 mg/day. Amylase and/or lipase &gt;3 ULN at Visit 6 (Week 1).
