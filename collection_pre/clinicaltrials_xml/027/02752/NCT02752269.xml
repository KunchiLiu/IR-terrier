	<brief_summary>According to the literature available pulmonary hypertension is present in 12 to 23% of patients suffering from Sjögren Syndrome. However epidemiological data are based on non-invasive measurements using echocardiography. Furthermore, no data are available regarding exercise hemodynamics in those patients. This study investigates pulmonary hemodynamics at rest and during exercise in patients suffering from primary and secondary Sjögren Syndrome. Patients under suspicion for pulmonary hypertension (PH) will be offered further investigations including right heart catheterization.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients with primary and secondary Sjögren Syndrome will be investigated using echocardiography, exercise echocardiography, pulmonary function testing, laboratory testing, electrocardiogram and 6 minute walking test. Those patients under clinical suspicion for pulmonary hypertension will be offered further investigations including right heart catheterization to rule out or verify the diagnosis of manifest pulmonary hypertension.</detailed_description>
