	<brief_summary>Along with the improvement of living standard, the prevalence of Lower extremity arterial occlusive disease (LEAOD) is also increasing, which has become an important cause of lower extremity amputation and greatly affected the patients' life quality. Currently, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), including balloon dilatation and stent implantation, has been regarded as the most widely applied and accepted treatment for LEAOD. The therapeutic effects of lower extremity interventional treatment, varied in different reports. It was reported that the therapeutic effects were influenced by some traditional risk factors, including age, gender, smoking, and so on. More risk factors are still unknown. The difference of therapeutic effects, the endpoint events were compared between interventional and conventional treatment group to analyze the effect of interventional treatment on LEAOD and explore its risk factors.</brief_summary>
