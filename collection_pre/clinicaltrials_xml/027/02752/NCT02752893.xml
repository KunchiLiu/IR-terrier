	<brief_summary>The investigators will establish a platform at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center to generate novel models of estrogen receptor alpha-positive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer, which will be used for research studies to develop novel treatment strategies and dissect signaling pathways underlying drug sensitivity and resistance.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria 1. Men and women &gt; age 18 with histologically documented ER+/HER2 breast cancer or with a history of ER+/HER2 breast cancer, for whom a tumor biopsy or surgical resection is clinically indicated and will be performed as standard of care. Tumor specimens may be from breast (primary/recurrent) or metastatic sites. Patients with multicentric or bilateral disease are eligible. 2. ER positivity is defined as &gt;10% of malignant tumor cells staining positively for ER by immunohistochemistry (IHC). HER2 negativity is defined as IHC 01+, or with a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) ratio of &lt;1.8 if IHC is 2+ or if IHC has not been done. 3. Excess LIVE tumor tissue must be available from the surgically resected tumor specimen, or from 13 extra core needle or incisional biopsy. LIVE tumor tissue must be available within 2 hours of removal from patient (shorter time is preferable). 4. A primary breast cancer must be greater than 1 cm in greatest diameter. 5. Prior therapy is allowed as long as excess viable tumor tissue is available from the biopsy or surgical excision procedure. 6. Ability to give signed informed consent. Exclusion Criteria 1. Fine needle aspirates and effusions of bodily fluids are not eligible as sources of tumor cells.</criteria>
