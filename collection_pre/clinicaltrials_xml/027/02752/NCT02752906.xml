	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to describe the safety and antibody response to revaccination with MenACYW conjugate vaccine in persons who received their first quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine dose at ≥ 10 years of age. Primary Objective: - To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the vaccine seroresponse of meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W following the administration of a booster dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine compared to those observed following the administration of a booster dose of a licensed Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine (MCV4) in subjects who were first vaccinated with 1 dose of MCV4, 4 to 10 years before the booster dose. Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the vaccine seroresponse of meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W measured using human serum bactericidal assay (hSBA) in serum specimens collected 6 days after vaccination in a subset of subjects - To evaluate the antibody responses (geometric mean titers) to serogroups A, C, Y, and W measured using hSBA on Day 0 (pre-vaccination) and Day 30 after vaccination Observational Objectives: - To describe the antibody titers against meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W measured by hSBA assessed at Day 0, Day 6, and Day 30 days after vaccination - To describe the safety profile of MenACYW conjugate vaccine compared to that of a licensed MCV4 after booster vaccination.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Healthy adolescents and adults who had received 1 dose of a quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine 4 to 10 years previously will be randomized to receive either 1 dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine or a licensed MCV4 . All participants will undergo immunogenicity assessment at baseline (pre-vaccination) and 1 month post-vaccination and will also be evaluated for safety up to Day 180 post-vaccination. In addition, a subset will have an additional blood sample collected at 6 days post-vaccination for immunogenicity assessment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Aged ≥ 15 years on the day of inclusion Subject has documented record of having received 1 dose of a quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine 4 to 10 years prior to enrollment Subject aged 15 to &lt; 18 years: assent form signed and dated by the subject and informed consent form (ICF) signed and dated by the parent or guardian Subject aged ≥ 18 years: ICF signed and dated by the subject Subjects aged 15 to &lt; 18 years: both the subject and parent / guardian are able to attend all scheduled visits and to comply with all trial procedures Subjects aged ≥ 18 years: able to attend all scheduled visits and to comply with all trial procedures Subject is pregnant, lactating, or of childbearing potential (to be considered of nonchildbearing potential, a female must be premenarche or postmenopausal for at least 1 year, surgically sterile, or using an effective method of contraception or abstinence from at least 4 weeks prior to vaccination until at least 4 weeks after vaccination) Participation in the 4 weeks preceding the trial vaccination or planned participation during the present trial period in another clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical procedure Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks (28 days) preceding the trial vaccination or planned receipt of any vaccine before Day 30 visit except for influenza vaccination, which may be received at least 2 weeks before study investigational vaccines. This exception includes monovalent pandemic influenza vaccines and multivalent influenza vaccines Previous vaccination against meningococcal disease with either an investigational or approved meningococcal B vaccine Receipt of immune globulins, blood or bloodderived products in the past 3 months Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy, such as anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy, within the preceding 6 months; or longterm systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months) History of meningococcal infection, confirmed either clinically, serologically, or microbiologically At high risk for meningococcal infection during the trial (specifically, but not limited to, subjects with persistent complement deficiency, with anatomic or functional asplenia, or subjects travelling to countries with high endemic or epidemic disease) Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a lifethreatening reaction to the vaccine(s) used in the trial or to a vaccine containing any of the same substances Personal history of an Arthuslike reaction after vaccination with a tetanus toxoidcontaining vaccine Personal history of GuillainBarré syndrome Verbal report of thrombocytopenia, contraindicating intramuscular vaccination in the Investigator's opinion Bleeding disorder, or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion, contraindicating intramuscular vaccination in the Investigator's opinion Deprived of freedom by an administrative or court order, or in an emergency setting, or hospitalized involuntarily Current alcohol abuse or drug addiction Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, is at a stage where it might interfere with trial conduct or completion Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to the Investigator's judgment) on the day of vaccination or febrile illness (temperature ≥ 100.4°F). A prospective subject should not be included in the study until the condition has resolved or the febrile event has subsided Receipt of oral or injectable antibiotic therapy within 72 hours prior to the first blood draw Identified as an Investigator or employee of the Investigator or study center with direct involvement in the proposed study, or identified as an immediate family member (i.e., parent, spouse, natural or adopted child) of the Investigator or employee with direct involvement in the proposed study.</criteria>
