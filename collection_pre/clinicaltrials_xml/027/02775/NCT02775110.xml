	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the discontinuation of natalizumab either immediately or tapered off in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Half of the fifty (50) participants will discontinue natalizumab immediately and the other half will taper off the drug, having two additional infusions, one at six weeks- and one at eight weeks-post discontinuation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Natalizumab Temporary Discontinuation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Natalizumab is a pharmaceutical intervention used in the management of multiple sclerosis. The decision to discontinue natalizumab therapy is often raised in patients defined as high-risk for PML despite good clinical efficacy. During the therapy cessation period following large phase III trials, a return to the prestudy disease activity was reached by four months post-discontinuation. Shorter therapy was associated with a trend for a more severe disease activity pointing to a possible 'rebound' effect after natalizumab discontinuation. This study focuses on two different approaches: an immediate versus a step-wise/tapered down natalizumab discontinuation protocol, both with reinstitution of a different disease modifying therapy (DMT) within 1-6 months from the last natalizumab infusion.</detailed_description>
