	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators will test the impact of a modified Ramadan Fasting regimen on health and well-being. The 2016 Ramadan is around summer solstice in Germany making it one of the most challenging fasting periods for participating Muslims. The modified Ramadan Fasting consists of educational components around fasting, and advice for nutritional modifications in order to support health and well-being during Ramadan, while the control group will continue to fast as usual. The investigators will measure not only body weight/fat but also include measures of psychological well-being, and spiritual practice, and serum markers for blood lipids, and blood sugar. With this trial the investigators aim to determine, whether such modifications around Ramadan will be beneficial for health and well-being.</brief_summary>
