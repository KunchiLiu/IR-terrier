	<brief_title>Measurements of Kidney Perfusion After Transplantation by Intraoperative Fluorescence Angiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Additional to the common transplant procedure, measurements of the graft perfusion should be established in two ways. Firstly, each kidney should be measured by a common duplex ultrasound measurement to assess the resistance index (RI) in the three poles of the kidney (upper, middle, lower pole). Secondly, intraoperative fluorescence angiography is going to be performed. Therefore, the camera of the fluorescence angiography system (SPY Elite System, Novadaq, USA) is positioned over the organ, and the fluorescence dye (ICG) is applicated intravenously. The aim will be to correlate the fluorescence angiography findings with the RIs and therefore to establish valuable fluorescence parameters.</detailed_description>
