	<brief_summary>This is a clinical research protocol to determine the feasibility of assessing lead levels in hunters who use lead projectiles. This study will determine if it is possible to perform an interventional double-blind placebo-controlled study of lead levels in hunters using lead or lead-free projectiles following consumption of self-harvested wild game. The hypothesis for the subsequent study is that minute lead particles from shrapnel dispersed through the animal during harvest are ingested and result in increased lead serum levels. This current observational study establishes if this conclusive interventional study is possible through establishing if hunters using lead projectiles in New Zealand have elevated lead levels after eating animals harvested with lead projectiles. This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice Standards, associated regulations and institutional research requirements. This study aims to assess if hunters eating meat shot with lead projectiles experience elevated lead levels. Hunters will be asked to provide blood samples 2-4 days after they eat meat harvested with lead bullets and provide a subsequent sample when they have abstained from eating wild game harvested with lead bullets. We have chosen to use deer as the species for this study to reduce variation and New Zealand is the ideal place to conduct this study because of year-round hunting of deer. This design will allows paired testing of subject lead levels.</brief_summary>
