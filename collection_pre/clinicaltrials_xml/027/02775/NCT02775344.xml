	<brief_summary>This is a prospective randomized study involving 124 patients. All participates will be given written information on 3D laparoscopy. They will be randomized according to computer-generated random sequence into two groups, 2D and 3D group. The operation will then be performed either using 2D or 3D laparoscopy. Surgeons are allowed to change to the other type of laparoscopy if difficulty encountered. After the operation, the surgeons will be required to fill in a questionnaire self-evaluating the performance using Global rating scale component of the intraoperative assessment tool (GOALS), any discomfort encountered, any need for change of laparoscopy and their preference on the type of laparoscopy. The level of complexity of the operation, duration of operation, blood loss and complications will be recorded.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>3D Versus 2D Laparoscopic Ovarian Cystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laparoscopy has greatly replaced laparotomy in most gynaecological operations including oncological procedures. Laparoscopic approach is the mainstay for ovarian cystectomy nowadays. However the loss of depth perception and dexterity remains the drawback of laparoscopy. With the development of robotic surgery, the three-dimension vision and presence of "wrist" motion allowed surgeon to perform more complicated operations in sophisticated manner. Expensive instruments and the need for prolonged time of setup restricted the extensive use of it. Having those considerations in mind, three-dimension (3D) laparoscopy is another possible alternative. With the advancement of technology in 3D vision, it may provide better precision especially in perception of depth and spatial orientation. Dizziness, nausea, headache and ocular fatique are occasional side effects in 3D surgery which created concerns of the surgeons. There have been studies using standardized tasks shown that 3D laparoscopy will improve the performance in surgeon both objectively and subjectively especially when performing complex task. It was suggested to be able to fasten the learning curve for beginners. The operation time was shorter when laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed using 3D imaging without any major complications encountered. Yet evidence in the applicability and use in clinical service in gynaecological operations are still inadequate. The investigators would like to evaluate the difference of 2D versus 3D laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy.</detailed_description>
