	<brief_summary>Pancreatic resections carry a high risk for complications, especially pancreatic fistula. Both hydrocortisone and pasireotide have been shown to be effective in reducing complications in earlier RCTs. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of these two drugs in preventing complications of pancreatic surgery.</brief_summary>
