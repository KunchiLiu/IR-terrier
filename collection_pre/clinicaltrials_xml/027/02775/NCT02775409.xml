	<brief_summary>This study is for women scheduled to have immediate breast reconstruction following mastectomy using a tissue expander.

The study will evaluate pain, wellbeing, and overall satisfaction with reconstruction. A secondary purpose is to learn whether there are differences in complications and costs between the two locations.</brief_summary>
