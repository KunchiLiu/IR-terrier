	<brief_summary>Compelling epidemiological evidence indicates that alterations length of telomere, are associated with the initiation and development of ischemic heart disease. This study was undertaken to investigate whether mtDNA copy number in peripheral blood leukocyte could be used as a risk predictor for acute coronary syndrome.</brief_summary>
