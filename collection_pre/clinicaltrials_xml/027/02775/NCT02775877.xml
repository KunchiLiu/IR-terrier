	<detailed_description>To evaluate the efficacy of letrozole and clomiphene in PCOS patients is important,especially in resistent PCOS patients. Although most medications prove the effectiveness of letrozole and clomiphene,the subjects of letrozole and sequential clomiphene in PCOS patients are rarely.The trial may provide further basis for this medication in PCOS patients in ovulation. If the medication demonstrates efficacy, the method would help the patients with PCOS to deal with the problem of infertility.</detailed_description>
