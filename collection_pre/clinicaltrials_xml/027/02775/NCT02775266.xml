	<brief_summary>To evaluate the effectiveness of non surgical periodontal therapy in addition to antioxidant(ALA) on resistin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes and periodontal disease</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Antioxidant Intake on Resistin Levels In Patients With Gum Disease and Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 40 patients with diabetes and chronic periodontitis attending the department of periodontics will be recruited in the study. 40 subjects will be randomly divided into two groups(control group and test group with 20 subjects in each group). Clinical parameters such as gingival index, periodontal index, random blood sugar levels(RBS) and glycosylated hemoglobin levels (Hb1aC) will be recorded at baseline and after 3 months and 2ml of blood sample will be collected by venepuncture ( baseline and after 3 months) and stored in Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid containing vials to identify the levels of resistin in the patients by Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Group A will receive Alpha lipoic acid at baseline for a period of 3 months. Both the groups will receive scaling and rootplaning at baseline.</detailed_description>
