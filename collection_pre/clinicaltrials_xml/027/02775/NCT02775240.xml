	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine how an investigational treatment (maribavir) is handled by the body when administered with two already approved drugs (digoxin and dextromethorphan). The study will also look at the safety and tolerability when maribavir is coadministered with digoxin and dextromethorphan versus digoxin and dextromethorphan alone.</brief_summary>

Within 30 days prior to the first dose of investigational product: 1. Have used an investigational product (if elimination halflife is &lt;6 days, otherwise 5 halflives). 2. Have been enrolled in a clinical study (including vaccine studies) that, in the investigator's opinion, may impact this study. 3. Have had any substantial changes in eating habits, as assessed by the investigator. Confirmed systolic blood pressure &gt;139 mmHg or &lt;89 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure &gt;89 mmHg or &lt;49 mmHg. Twelvelead ECG demonstrating QTcB &gt;450 msec at screening. A positive screen for alcohol or drugs of abuse at screening or Day 1, Period 1. Male subjects who consume more than 21 units of alcohol per week or 3 units per day; female subjects who consume more than 14 units of alcohol per week or 2 units per day (1 alcohol unit=1 beer or 1 wine [5 oz/150 mL] or 1 liquor [1.5 oz/40 mL] or 0.75 oz alcohol). A positive human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B surface antibody, or hepatitis C virus antibody screen.

Exusers must report that they have stopped using tobacco for at least 30 days prior to receiving the first dose of investigational product.

Current use (defined as use within 14 days prior to the first dose of investigational product) of any medication (including overthecounter, herbal, or homeopathic preparations [eg, St. John's wort, ginkgo biloba]) with the exception of hormonal replacement therapy and occasional use of ibuprofen and acetaminophen. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparininduced thrombocytopenia.
