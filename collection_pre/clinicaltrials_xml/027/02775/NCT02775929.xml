	<brief_summary>The purpose of this protocol is to determine user preferences for antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV-1 infected partners and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) HIV-1 un-infected partners and to optimize targeted delivery and sustained use of these interventions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Partners Demonstration Project of PrEP and ART</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An open-label, prospective cohort study of higher-risk HIV-1 serodiscordant couples in order to determine barriers and facilitators to uptake and sustained adherence to ART for HIV-1 infected partners and daily oral PrEP for HIV-1 uninfected partners. The investigators developed a risk score tool to identify couples at highest risk for HIV-1 transmission. PrEP was offered as a 'bridge' to ART in the partnership - i.e., until ART initiation by the HIV-infected partner and for the first 6 months after ART is started; ART was recommended following national ART guidelines. A subset (up to 80 couples per site) was invited to participate in qualitative in-depth interview and focus group discussions.</detailed_description>
