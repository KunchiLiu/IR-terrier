	<brief_title>Effect of Short-term Motilitone Therapy on Health-related Quality of Life in PD Patients With Gastrointestinal Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are frequently complained by PD patients. To improve their symptoms, prokinetics are often used in clinics. However, some prokinetics are dopamine receptor antagonist which can aggravate motor symptoms of PD patients or develop tardive dyskinesia when it affects dopamine receptors of the brain. DA-9701 (Motilitone) is recently developed herbal medication which has both 5-HT4 agonism and D2 antagonism. Furthermore, it does not cross the blood brain barrier that can be safely used in PD patients. Hypothetically it has a potential to be a good choice for the treatment of GI symptoms of PD patients. However, there has been no study that evaluates its efficacy and safety by randomized clinical trials in PD patients. This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of DA-9701 in the double-blind placebo-controlled phase 1 (4 weeks), and the long-term safety of DA-9701 in the open-label phase 2 (8 weeks after phase 1).</detailed_description>
