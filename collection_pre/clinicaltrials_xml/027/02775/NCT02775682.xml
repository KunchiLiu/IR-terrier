	<brief_title>Cerebral Autoregulation in Patients With Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The relationship between epileptic seizures and cerebrovascular disease is complex, ranging from mechanisms to clinical manifestation. Stroke is one of the most common causes of epilepsy in adulthood. It was also reported that patients with epilepsy exhibited a higher risk of stroke. But its potential mechanism was never fully understood. Dynamic cerebral autoregulation(dCA), a mechanism to maintain the cerebral bold flow, has been proved to be critical for the occurrence ,development and prognosis of ischemic neurovascular disease. In this study, we hypothesis that impaired dCA play a role in epilepsy and subsequent stroke.</detailed_description>
