	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to examine the effect of dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation on subjects' pan CD4+ T cell function, cognition, and muscle function. Half of the participants will receive fish oil, while the other half will receive a placebo (olive oil).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fish Oil T Cell Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Generalized inflammation has been consistently associated with aging and metabolic diseases, often characterized by reduced muscle and cognitive function. Although much of the aging-associated inflammation has been attributed to chronic activation of the innate host defense system, activated CD4+ T cells have been shown to contribute directly to the pathogenesis of several other inflammatory diseases. In humans, dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), have anti-inflammatory properties and reduce disease symptoms, in part, through suppression of CD4+ T cell activation. Therefore, the Researchers' overall hypothesis is that dietary supplementation with DHA and EPA in humans will ameliorate inflammatory symptoms, in part, by suppressing CD4+ T cell activation, positively affecting muscle and cognitive function.</detailed_description>
