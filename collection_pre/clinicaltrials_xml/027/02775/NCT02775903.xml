	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, open-label study consisting of 3 phases: Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up. To confirm the safety, ie, the absence of overlapping toxicities of the combination treatment regimen, an early safety monitoring will be performed based on approximately the first 12 subjects randomized. A total of approximately 72 subjects will be included in the Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) cohort and approximately 110 subjects in the Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) cohort.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Safety Study of Azacitidine Subcutaneous in Combination With Durvalumab (MEDI4736) in Previously Untreated Subjects With Higher-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) or in Elderly Subjects With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The enrollment period for this study is expected to last approximately 15 months. The treatment and follow-up periods are expected to conclude approximately 12 months after the last subject is randomized. Therefore, the total duration of the study is expected to be approximately 27 months, from first subject enrolled until the last subject last visit. Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive subcutaneous azacitidine alone or in combination with durvalumab. The treatment phase will be conducted in 2 stages, with an interim analysis for futility purpose, for each of the 2 study cohorts determining whether that cohort proceeds to Stage 2 as outlined in Section 9. The primary analysis will follow completion of Stage 2 with additional analyses conducted approximately 12 months after the last subject is enrolled, as described in Section 9. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and immunogenicity sampling will be performed in subjects receiving the combination therapy to assess durvalumab PK profile and development of antidrug antibodies.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For both cohorts: 1. Subject must understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form (ICF) prior to any studyrelated assessments/procedures being conducted. 2. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2. 3. Female subjects of childbearing potential1 may participate, providing they meet the following conditions: 1. Have 2 negative pregnancy tests as verified by the investigator prior to starting any investigational product (IP) therapy: serum pregnancy test at screening and negative serum or urine pregnancy test (investigator's discretion) within 72 hours prior to starting treatment with IP (Cycle 1, Day 1). They must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the course of the study (before beginning each subsequent cycle of treatment), and after the last dose of any IP. This applies even if the subject practices complete abstinence2 from heterosexual contact. 2. Agree to practice true abstinence2 (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis and source documented) or agree to use at least two effective methods of contraception (eg, oral, injectable, or implantable hormonal contraceptive; tubal ligation; intra uterine device; barrier contraceptive with spermicide; true abstinence; or vasectomized partner) from 28 days prior to starting durvalumab or azacitidine, and must agree to continue using such precautions while taking durvalumab or azacitidine (including dose interruptions) and for 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab or azacitidine. Cessation of contraception after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician. 3. Agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and for at least 90 days after the last dose of IP. 4. Refrain from egg cell donation while taking durvalumab and for at least 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab. A female subject of childbearing potential (FCBP) is a female who: 1) has achieved menarche at some point 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 3) has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months). True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 4. Male subject must: 1. Either practice true abstinence3 from heterosexual contact (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis) or agree to use male condom plus spermicide during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential (even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy) from starting dose of IP (Cycle 1 Day 1), including dose interruptions through 90 days after receipt of the last dose of durvalumab or azacitidine. 2. Refrain from semen or sperm donation while taking IP and for at least 90 days after the last dose of IP. True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 5.
