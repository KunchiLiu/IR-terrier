	<brief_summary>Not only caries but also exposure to acids can lead to loss of tooth structure. This acid-related tooth structure loss is defined as dental erosion. A relationship between dental erosion and occurence of reflux disease was shown in numerous studies. On the one hand, patients with dental erosions frequently show reflux disease. On the other hand, many - but not all - reflux patients show dental erosions. It is believed that certain salivary parameters might explain, why not all reflux patients alike are affected of dental erosions. The aim of this study is to analyze the relationship and the extent of occurrence of dental erosions and reflux symptoms, including investigation of certain salivary parameters.</brief_summary>
