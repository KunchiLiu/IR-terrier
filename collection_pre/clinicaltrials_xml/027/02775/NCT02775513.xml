	<detailed_description>Loss-of-function mutations in voltage-gated potassium channels cause long QT syndrome (LQTS) due to a prolonged cardiac repolarisation phase. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv-) channels are known for their relation to malignant cardiac arrhythmias, but also play a role in pancreatic alpha- and beta cell hormone secretion, and possibly in incretin hormone secretion. We hypothesised that patients with loss-of-function mutations also exhibit altered hormone release upon glucose ingestion.</detailed_description>
