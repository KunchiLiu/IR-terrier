	<brief_summary>RAS genotyping is mandatory for the prescription of anti-EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) therapies in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The standard genotyping is assessed on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumour tissue. This study compares RAS and BRAF genotyping results achieved in analyzing circulating plasma DNA using OncoBEAM™ technique with those achieved using the standard genotyping techniques and formalin-fixed paraffin embedded samples.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Detection of KRAS, NRAS et BRAF Mutations in Plasma Circulating DNA From Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be proposed to all patients with a metastatic colorectal cancer. Study information will be given to the patient during a routine medical examination. The patient will be included after checking inclusion criteria and signature of the informed consent form Blood sampling (30 ml) will be performed before the initiation of the first line metastatic chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
