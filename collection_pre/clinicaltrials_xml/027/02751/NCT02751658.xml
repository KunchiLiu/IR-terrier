	<brief_summary>The bacteria live in community and in some cases it is the combination of several microorganisms that facilitates transmission and pathogenicity. The concept of pathobiome follows from this finding. Investigators hypothesize that the microbial community water point is a pathobiome influencing installation and transmission of pathogens associated with care</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Goals : Key: To study the impact of bacterial communities on the risk of transmission of waterborne pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients hospitalized from a contaminated water source by this bacterium. secondary: 1. Assess the role of communities on installing the water points in P. aeruginosa by comparing contaminated and uncontaminated water sources. 2. To evaluate the effect of the quality of water and the conditions of use of water points network on the composition of bacterial communities associated or not with P. aeruginosa. Experimental Study conducted from 6 points of water, contaminated deliberately experimental backs onto the project to assess conventional and alternative measures decontamination network and water points</detailed_description>
