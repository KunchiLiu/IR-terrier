	<brief_summary>Anetumab ravtansine is developed for the treatment of patients with recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. The purpose of the proposed trial is to identify the maximum tolerated dose of anetumab ravtansine that could be safely combined with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in this indication.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject must provide a signed informed consent before any screening procedures. Subject must be female and aged â‰¥18 years. Subject must have histologically confirmed, locally invasive or metastatic, predominantly epithelial platinumresistant ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Subject must have recurrent, platinumresistant cancer Subjects must provide samples of archival tumor tissue (tissue block or at least 5 formalinfixated, paraffinembedded [FFPE] slides) at any time during the study. Subject must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. Subjects must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Subject must have adequate bone marrow, kidney and liver function and coagulation, as assessed by the standard laboratory test results Women of reproductive potential must have a negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (beta HCG) pregnancy test obtained within 7 days before the start of anetumab ravtansine. Women not of reproductive potential are female subjects who are postmenopausal or permanently sterilized (e.g., tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy). Women of reproductive potential must agree to consistently use adequate contraception / birth control between signing of the informed consent and 60 days after the last administration of the last study drug. The investigator or a designated associate should advise the subject how to achieve adequate contraception. Due to the lack of adequate reproductive toxicity data on anetumab ravtansine, subjects must concomitantly use 2 forms of adequate contraception. Subjects who have a previous or concurrent cancer that is distinct in primary site or histology from the cancer being evaluated in this study. Subjects who have a history or current evidence of bleeding disorder within 4 weeks before the start of anetumab ravtansine. Subjects who have new or progressive brain or meningeal or spinal metastases. Subjects who have QTc (QT interval corrected for heart rate) &gt;480 ms, or heart rate &gt;/=100 bpm, or LVEF (left ventricular ejection fraction) &lt;50%, or a history or current evidence of uncontrolled cardiovascular disease. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Subjects who had a major surgery or significant trauma within 4 weeks before the start of anetumab ravtansine. Subjects who have had organ allograft or hematopoietic transplantation. Subjects who have a history of hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs, or any other antigen. Subjects who have a history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or an active hepatitis B or C virus infection requiring treatment. Subjects with a nonhealing serious wound, ulcer, or bone fracture unrelated to the primary tumor. Subjects with corneal epitheliopathy or any eye disorder that may predispose the subjects to druginduced corneal epitheliopathy. Subjects who have received systemic antitumor therapy or radiotherapy to target lesions within 4 weeks before the start of anetumab ravtansine Subjects who have unresolved CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v4.03) Grade &gt;1 toxicity of previous anticancer therapy. Subjects who have received GCSF (granulocyte colonystimulating factor(s)), or GMCSF (granulocyte macrophagestimulating factor(s)), or erythropoietinstimulating agents within 3 weeks before the start of screening. Subjects who have received chemotherapy with anthracycline agents at the cumulative dose of 550 mg/m2. Subjects who have received any investigational drug treatment outside of this study within 4 weeks before the start of anetumab ravtansine. Use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or strong CYP3A4 inducers oral or parenteral anticoagulation therapy started within 2 weeks before the start of anetumab ravtansine until the EoT (end of treatment) visit.</criteria>
