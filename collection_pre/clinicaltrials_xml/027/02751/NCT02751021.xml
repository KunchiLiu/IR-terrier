	<brief_summary>Little is known about potential relationships between sleep apnea, plasma aldosterone and diastolic dysfunction which is a very frequent finding among patients requiring permanent cardiac pacing. Sleep apnea is often under diagnosed by clinical examination. Confirmation tests are expensive and access is limited. A specific algorithm available in a recent pacemaker allows assessing breathing variations using minute ventilation sensor, with a good agreement between the respiratory disturbance index and polysomnography results for the diagnosis of severe sleep apnea. The purpose of the study is to examine the diagnostic accuracy of a new pacemaker algorithm for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in patients presenting with diastolic dysfunction. The investigators also aim to highlight a correlation between plasma aldosterone levels and the severity of sleep apnea, with a reversal effect of ventilation therapy in this specific population.</brief_summary>
