	<brief_title>The Feasibility of an Active Lifestyle Programme in Patients Recovering From Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was a randomized controlled feasibility trial consisting of a 3-months active lifestyle intervention and a 3-months follow-up period. Participants were allocated to an active lifestyle programme (ALP) or the standard (SC) care group. ALP was offered 12 supervised exercise sessions over 3 months and six supportive behaviour change workshops. SC was encouraged to continue with their usual lifestyle. The intervention was informed by Self-Determination Theory. The supervised exercise sessions took place in small groups of maximum 7 participants and lasted approximately 1 hour. Exercise included aerobic and resistance exercises. The behaviour change workshops were delivered in a motivational interviewing style, also in small groups of maximum 7 participants. Participants were followed-up at 6 months. There was no contact with participants during the post-intervention and follow-up period.</detailed_description>
