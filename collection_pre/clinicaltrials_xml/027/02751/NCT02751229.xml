	<brief_title>Honest Open Proud for Adolescents With Mental Illness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both due to fear of public stigma and due to self-stigma or shame, people with mental illness may decide to keep their condition a secret or even to withdraw from other people altogether in order to minimise the risk of being labelled. Secrecy can help on the short term to protect individuals from public stigma, but often it has negative long-term consequences such as social isolation, distress and unemployment. Disclosure, on the other hand, carries the risk to be discriminated by others, but can reduce the burden of secrecy, lead to support by others and reduce public stigma. In this study investigators aim to evaluate whether a group program run both by people with mental illness (peers) and professionals helps to reduce self-stigma and makes it easier for adolescents to handle the necessary choices related to secrecy versus disclosure.</detailed_description>
