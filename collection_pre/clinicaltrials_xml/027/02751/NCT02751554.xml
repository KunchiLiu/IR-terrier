	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to help develop a special PET/CT scan to help the investigator to develop a new drug and see where this drug goes in the body and how long it stays in diseased and normal tissue. The drug is called PU-AD. In this study, the investigators will give a tiny dose of PU-AD, a dose which they expect to be much too small to affect the disease. This tiny dose will be labeled with (attached to) a very small amount of radiation (called Iodine-124 or 124I) so that the investigators can follow where it goes in the body by using a PET/CT scanner. Doing this will help the investigators figure out how to best give higher doses of PU-AD to other patients in the future, and will help the investigators see if this tiny dose of PU-AD with radiation (124I-PU-AD) might be used in the future to detect disease using a PET/CT scanner.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age between 2190 years old. Negative serum pregnancy test for females of childbearing age (1150 years) and/or lack childbearing potential. No breastfeeding. Patients with a diagnosis of cancer and/or Alzheimer's Disease, meeting trial eligibility criteria as specified below for either disease. For cancer patients: Patients with eligible histologic type of cancer. Eligible histologic types of cancer types include solid malignancy, myeloma, and lymphoma. Cancer histology confirmed by MSKCC Department of Pathology. Cancerous disease is radiologicallymeasurable or evaluable as defined by published tumor response criteria (including but not limited to RECIST 1.1). For Alzheimer's Disease patients: Established diagnosis of mildmoderate Alzheimer's disease based upon neurological and neuropsychological evaluation following the National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's disease Association criteria that recently revisited the NINCDSADRDA criteria. Citation: PMID: 21514250 Documentation of diagnosis of mildmoderate Alzheimer's disease, as above, by boardcertified neurologist (MSKCC or nonMSKCC) Patient has an appointed health care proxy specifically designated for research consent and that this appointment is documented. Patient has designated athome caregiver(s) responsible for providing daily medications to the patient, who will document the patient's daily doses of SSKI oral medication, for 2 weeks as per study protocol. For patients who have both cancer and Alzheimer's Disease, patients are considered eligible if they meet all eligibility requirements for either Alzheimer's Disease or cancer patients, as specified above. Previous allergic reaction to Xray CT iodinated contrast medium. Hypersensitivity to iodide products.
