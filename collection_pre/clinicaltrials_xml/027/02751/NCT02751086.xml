	<brief_summary>The overall purpose is to develop and maintain a multi-institutional database comprising of information regarding surgical, clinical and oncological features of patients that will be treated for gastric cancer with robotic, laparoscopic or open approaches and subsequent follow-up. The main objective is to compare the three surgical arms on surgical and clinical outcomes, as well as on the oncological follow-up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Robotic, Laparoscopic and Open Gastrectomy Compared on Short and Long Term Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A review of the scientific literature, which was recently published by the IMIGASTRIC study group, aimed to perform a more complete analysis of the current situation regarding performing minimally invasive surgery for gastric cancer. Significant limitations were found in the analyzed studies, including: - Small samples of patients, mostly low-quality comparative studies - Selection bias in the comparison groups (e.g. stage, extent of lymphadenectomy) - Absence of subgroup analysis in significant research fields - Lack of information on the surgical techniques adopted A large prospective multicenter registry could thus be the optimal way to clarify the role of minimally invasive surgery for gastric cancer and permit the evaluation of its short and long-term effects. A working basis for analyzing outcomes of interest and obtaining directions for guidelines and future study developments can also be created. The following would be the main advantages of a large prospective multicenter registry: - Achieving a large sample of patients - Collecting multiple variables, allowing for the making of a comprehensive statistical report - Standardizing the methodology to be adopted, thus increasing accuracy - Bringing together the experiences of both East and West to discover shared points A prospective registry can become a powerful tool that can guide research in this field to new developments and pave the way for other investigational opportunities.</detailed_description>
