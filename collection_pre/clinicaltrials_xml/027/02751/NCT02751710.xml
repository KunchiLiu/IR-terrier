	<brief_summary>This trial is being conducted to determine the impact of whole body FDG PET-CT vs. conventional staging in the management of patients presenting with clinical Stage III breast cancer. Eligible consenting patients with ductal or mixed histology breast cancer will be randomized 1:1 to whole body FDG PET-CT or conventional staging. Eligible consenting patients with lobular only histology will be entered into a separate single arm prospective study and will undergo whole body FDG PET-CT, CT with contrast of the chest/abdomen &amp; pelvis and a bone scan.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Women (or men) with histological evidence of breast cancer for whom potentially curative treatment is planned. Based on clinical information (physical exam, imaging): 1. Stage III breast cancer (T0N2, T1N2, T2N2, T3N1, 2 or T4), or 2. Stage IIb breast cancer (T3N0), Note: T2N1 is not eligible Considered for combined modality therapy (surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) of curative intent. Age &lt; 18 years, ECOG performance status &gt; and = 3, Prior systemic therapy (e.g. neoadjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapy) for current breast cancer, Previous staging investigations for current breast cancer, Breast cancer with primary histological subtypes other than ductal or lobular (Note: Patients with mixed disease will be eligible for randomization), Clinical suspicion of metastatic disease, Relative contraindications to PET (e.g. uncontrolled diabetes (i.e. inability to decrease serum glucose below 10.2 mmol/L), claustrophobia, inability to be still for 30 minutes), Inability to lie supine for imaging with PETCT, Inability to undergo CT because of known allergy to contrast, History of another invasive malignancy within the previous two years (exception of non melanoma skin cancer) or a synchronous primary cancer, including a synchronous contralateral breast cancer (Note: Patients found to have a contralateral breast cancer on study imaging following randomization will remain in the study), Known pregnancy or lactating female, Inability to complete the study or required followup.</criteria>
