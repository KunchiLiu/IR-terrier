	<brief_title>Effect of Infraorbital and Infratrochlear Nerve Block on Emergence Agitation in Patients Undergoing Septorhinoplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emergence agitation is a postanesthetic phenomenon characterized as confusion, disorientation and violent behavior. Although its etiology is not well understood, risk factors associated with the condition include pain and ENT (ear, nose and throat) surgery. Bilateral infraorbital and infratrochlear nerve block in patients undergoing septorhinoplasty is effective in treating postoperative pain. The investigators have designed this study to evaluate the effect of infraorbital and infratrochlear nerve block on emergence agitation in patients undergoing septorhinoplasty.</detailed_description>
