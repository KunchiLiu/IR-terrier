	<brief_title>An Algorithm for Predicting Blood Loss and Transfusion Risk in Fast Track Total Hip Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two different cohorts of patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty will be analyzed to obtain data about hemoglobin trends. The first group will be used to obtain the algorithm, the second one to validate results of the first group, determining sensitivity and specificity.</detailed_description>
