	<criteria>Participants who have had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus Participants who have been treated with insulin therapy (basal insulin, premixed insulin, or basal/mealtime insulin regimen) with or without 1 or 2 oral antidiabetics (OADs) at stable dose for at least 3 months before screening Participants who have an HbA1c value ≥7.0% and ≤10.5% at screening if the participant is washing out OADs (dipeptidyl peptidase4 [DPP4] inhibitors, sulfonylurea [SU], or glinides) or ≥7.5% and ≤10.5% at screening if the participant is not washing out OADs Participants who have stable weight (±5%) ≥3 months prior to screening Participants who have a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 35.0 kilograms per meter squared (kg/m^2) Participants who have a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes Participants who have previously received therapy with a glucagonlike peptide1 receptor agonist within 3 months prior to screening Participants who have been previously treated with dulaglutide prior to screening Participants who have been treated with 2 of the following at screening: DPP4 inhibitor, SU, and glinide (ie, DPP4 inhibitor and SU, or DPP4 inhibitor and glinide) Participants who have been treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) at screening Participants who have clinically significant gastric emptying abnormality, hepatitis, pancreatitis, renal dysfunction, or thyroid abnormalities Participants who have a history of clinically significant cardiovascular disease, transplanted organ, or active or untreated malignancy</criteria>
