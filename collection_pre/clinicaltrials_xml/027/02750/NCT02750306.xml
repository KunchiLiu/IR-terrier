	<brief_summary>This study aims to examine the safety and efficacy of suvorexant (MK-4305) to improve sleep in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The primary hypothesis for the study is that suvorexant is superior to placebo in improving insomnia as measured by change from baseline in polysomnography (PSG)-derived total sleep time (TST) at Week 4.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease based on either a) the National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Association (NIAAA) criteria or b) the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition, (DSM5) criteria for AD. Have a DSM5 diagnosis of insomnia (e.g., difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, and/or early morning awakenings with inability to return to sleep for at least 3 nights per week for ≥ the past 3 months prior to study start, despite adequate opportunity for sleep) based on the investigator's judgment and by the subject's sleep history, as assessed by the sleep items on the Insomnia Diagnostic Interview and Sleep History assessments. Be willing to stay overnight in a sleep laboratory and must be willing to stay in bed for at least 8 hours for PSG testing Regular bedtime is between 8 pm and 1 am and is willing to maintain it for the duration of the trial Be able and willing to wear an activity/sleep watch on the wrist throughout the day and night Based on the investigator's judgment the participant should: a) be able to speak, read, and understand the language of the trial staff and the informed consent form; b) possess the ability to respond verbally to questions, follow instructions, and complete study assessments; c) be able to adhere to dose and visit schedules. Have a reliable and competent trial partner (e.g., spouse, family member, or other caregiver) who: a) Signs their own informed consent, after the trial has been explained to them, and before Screening assessments; b) Resides with the participant overnight and has a close relationship with the participant (defined as daily facetoface contact, at least 15 waking hours a week for at least 3 months prior to Visit 1); c) Accompanies the participant to and from trial visits and stays overnight at the sleep laboratory for the three PSG visits; d) Assumes responsibility for trial medication procedures (e.g., witnessing and/or helping to administer trial medication, assessing compliance), for completion of the sleep ediary each morning, and oversight of the activity/sleep watch worn throughout the trial; e) Answers questions regarding the trial partner's sleep quality and trial partner's distress related to the subject's behaviors. If female, not of childbearing potential as indicated by one of the following: has reached natural menopause, defined as: a) ≥ 45 years of age with either: ≥ 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea OR ≥ 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels &gt; 40 IU/L as determined by the central laboratory b) has had a hysterectomy; c) has had bilateral tubal ligation; or d) has had a bilateral oophorectomy (with or without a hysterectomy) and greater than 6 weeks have passed since the surgery Be willing to provide a blood sample for Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping Resides in a nursing home (or similar institutional facility) Has a Modified Hachinski Ischemia Scale (MHIS) Score &gt; 4 at Screening (i.e., evidence of vascular dementia) Has a known history of recent (or past) stroke that in the investigator's opinion confounds the diagnosis of either AD or insomnia Has evidence of a clinically relevant neurological disorder other than the disease being studied (i.e., probable AD) at Screening, including but not limited to: vascular dementia, parkinsonism, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, progressive supranuclear palsy, neurosyphilis, dementia with Lewy bodies, other types of dementia, mental retardation, hypoxic cerebral damage, cognitive impairment due to other disorders, or history of head trauma with loss of consciousness that either led to persistent cognitive deficits or in the opinion of the investigator confounds the diagnosis of either AD or insomnia.

NOTE: "Medical Conditions" may include chronic pain syndromes, chronic migraine, cardiac disease, nocturia (&gt; 3 times/night), asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or hot flashes. Has evidence of a current episode of major depression based on investigator's judgment. Major depression in remission is not exclusionary.

Has a history of excessive daytime napping (defined as more than 3 hours a day for more than 3 days of the week based on trial partner estimates, on average for the past 4 weeks). Has a recent or ongoing, uncontrolled, clinically significant medical condition or major surgery where participation in the trial would pose a significant medical risk to the subject within 3 months of study start, such as: conditions including but not limited to diabetes, hypertension, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or other relevant infections, thyroid or endocrine disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), delirium, congestive heart failure, angina, cardiac or gastrointestinal disease, or renal disease requiring dialysis. Note: controlled comorbid conditions (including diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, etc.) are not exclusionary if stable within three months of the study start.
