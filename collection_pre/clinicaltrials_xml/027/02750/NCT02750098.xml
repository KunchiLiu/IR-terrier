	<brief_summary>Comparison of aqueous and plasma glucose level in diabetic patients High glucose concentrations in aqueous humor are thought to be related of diabetic ocular injury, including cataract and diabetic keratopathy. The primary mechanisms are nonenzymatic glycation, oxidative stress and activation of polyol pathway. However, glucose concentrations in aqueous humor of diabetic patients was only examined in a few patients in the past. This study will compare glucose concentration in blood plasma and aqueous humor in diabetic patients undergoing cataract surgery. Perioperative Hemoglobin A1c concentrations will also be examined. Correlation between these parameters will be analyzed.</brief_summary>
