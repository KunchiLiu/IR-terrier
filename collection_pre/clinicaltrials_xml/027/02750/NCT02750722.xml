	<brief_summary>The investigators aim to compare a single bout of moderately intense cycling exercise incorporating Flutter® breathing maneuvers with a single bout of moderately intense cycling exercise alone on sputum viscoelasticity (primary endpoint) and the diffusion capacity of the lungs in adult patients with cystic fibrosis. The investigators further aim to analyze the short-term variability of resting diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) and nitric oxide (DLNO) in patients with cystic fibrosis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Regular airway clearance is an integral component of cystic fibrosis care and of critical importance to lung health. Exercise and standardized chest physiotherapy are accepted airway clearance techniques in cystic fibrosis. Different airway clearance techniques are available, but there is no evidence that one technique or a combination is superior. Oscillatory positive expiratory pressure with the Flutter® is a widely used airway clearance technique in the European countries and has been shown to favourably alter sputum viscoelasticity in cystic fibrosis. This randomized crossover study is designed to assess the acute effects of combined cycling exercise and Flutter® therapy on sputum viscoelasticity (primary outcome measure) and gas diffusion in adults with cystic fibrosis.</detailed_description>
