	<brief_summary>Assess the clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of secukinumab subcutaneous injections up to 52 weeks in Japanese patients with active AS despite current or previous non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α therapy. Efficacy and safety data will be used to support the registration of secukinumab in Japan for the treatment of active AS.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of moderate to severe AS with prior documented radiologic evidence (xray or radiologist's report) fulfilling the Modified New York criteria for AS with active AS assessed by BASDAI ≥ 4 (010) and spinal pain as measured by VAS≥ 4 cm (BASDAI question #2) at Baseline Patients should have been on NSAIDs at the highest recommended dose for at least 3 months prior to baseline with an inadequate response or failure to respond, or less than 3 months if therapy had to be withdrawn due to intolerance, toxicity or contraindications Patients who have been on a TNFα inhibitor (not more than one) must have experienced an inadequate response to previous or current treatment given at an approved dose for at least 3 months prior to baseline or have been intolerant to at least one administration of an antiTNFα agent Patients with total ankylosis of the spine Patients previously treated with any biological immunomodulating agents except for those targeting TNFα Active ongoing inflammatory diseases other than AS that might confound the evaluation of the benefit of secukinumab therapy, including inflammatory bowel disease or uveitis Known infection with HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C at screening or baseline</criteria>
