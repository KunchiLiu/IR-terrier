	<detailed_description>Nonpsychotic, nonbipolar, physically healthy depressed patients keep sleep, mood and energy logs for a week, complete the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (measuring "morningness" and "eveningness") and determine the time patients want to sleep. Patients then miss a night of sleep and subsequently are allowed later and later sleep times until patients are sleeping at their desired time. Beginning the morning following their Wake Night, patients sit in front of bright lights at their intended wake-up time for the next six weeks and once their allowed sleep time is their intended sleep time, patients also continue to only be allowed to sleep between those times (e.g., 11 p.m. to 7 a.m.). Daily sleep, energy and mood logs and activity monitoring are maintained throughout with weekly clinician ratings. In additional, daily telephone check ins occur during the first week following the Wake Night both to be sure the patient is following the protocol and to obtain symptom ratings. Saliva to be measured for melatonin is collected prior to and following sleep adjustment.</detailed_description>
