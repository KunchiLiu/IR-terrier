	<brief_summary>This trial will be comparing the combination of amiodarone and NAC (n=122) to amiodarone alone and NAC matched placebo (n=122) to determine the rates with which sustained (lasting &gt;30 seconds) or clinically significant POAF is reduced in high risk patients within 7 days after major thoracic surgery.</brief_summary>
