	<brief_summary>Aim: The aim of this study was to compare the analgesic efficacy of two combinations of opioid and non-opioid analgesics for acute periradicular abscesses. Methodology: This study included 24 patients who sought emergency care in a Brazilian dental school. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: Codeine/Acetaminophen - oral prescription of codeine (30 mg) plus acetaminophen (500 mg), every 4 h, for 3 days or Tramadol/Acetaminophen - oral prescription of tramadol hydrochloride (37.5 mg) plus acetaminophen (500 mg) on the same schedule. Patients recorded pain scores in a pain diary 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment, using the Visual Analogue Scale.</brief_summary>
