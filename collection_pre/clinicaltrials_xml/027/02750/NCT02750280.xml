	<criteria>1. Male and female subjects 1885 years of age with diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2) 2. Subject's foot ulcer is on the plantar surface of the foot. 3. DFU has not healed after more than2 months of SOC treatment administered 4. Subject's ulcer must be Wagner type 1 or 2 (uninfected, extending through the dermis and into subcutaneous tissue or granulating but without exposure of tendon, bone, or joint capsule. 5. Subject's wound is free of necrotic debris (post debridement) and clinical infection, should be comprised of healthy, vascular tissue. 6. Subject's AnkleBrachial Index (ABI) by Doppler method is ≥ 0.7 7. The subject has adequate circulation to the foot to allow for healing. This must be demonstrated by methods described in section 5.1 8. Subject's diabetes is under control as determined by the Investigator 9. Study subject must be reliable, responsible and able to visit the clinic weekly for the full 16 week period. The subject is willing and able to tolerate TCC. Subject is willing to comply with the monthly followup regimen for 32 weeks (8 months) The subject is able to return to the clinic if ulcer recurrence occurs 10. Subject or his/her legal representative has read and signed the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved Informed Consent form before treatment 11. No active malignancy except nonmelanoma skin cancer 1. Subject has clinical evidence of gangrene on any part of the affected foot 2. Subject has a Wagner type 3 or greater ulceration 3. The subject's ulcer is due to a nondiabetic etiology, Ulcers of arterial, venous stasis, pressure, radiation, traumatic, rheumatoid, vasculitis, collagen vascular disease, or other nondiabetic etiologies 4. Subject has a known sensitivity to bovine or porcine derived devices 5. Subject has one or more medical condition(s) including renal, hepatic, hematological, neurologic, or immune disease that in the opinion of the Investigator would make the subject an inappropriate candidate for this wound healing study 6. Subject has or has had a malignant disease (other than cutaneous epithelioma) not in remission 7. Subject is receiving oral or parenteral corticosteroids, immunosuppressive or cytotoxic agents, or is anticipated to require such agents during the course of the study 8. Subject has chronic osteomyelitis as determined by high resolution ultrasonography 9. Subject's ulcer is infected or accompanied by active cellulitis as determined by the Investigator 10. Subject has any condition(s) that seriously compromises the subject's ability to complete the study 11. Subject is pregnant or lactating at the time of treatment 12. Subject has received growth factor therapy (e.g. autologous plateletrich plasma gel, bacaplermin, bilayered cell therapy, dermal substitute, extracellular matrix) within two weeks of enrollment. If Santyl or any other collagenase is used, a subject must have a washout period of 2 weeks before MatriStem® can be applied. 13. Subject is currently receiving or has received radiation or chemotherapy within 3 months of randomization 14. Subject has a history of alcohol or drug abuse 15. Subject allergic to a broad spectrum of primary &amp; secondary dressing materials, including occlusive dressings and the adhesives on such dressings. 16. Subject is currently enrolled or participated within the previous 30 days of enrollment in another device, drug or biological trial.</criteria>
