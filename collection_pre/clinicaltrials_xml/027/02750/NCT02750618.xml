	<brief_summary>UX023-CL205 is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 2 study in children from 1 to 4 years old with XLH to assess the safety, PD, and efficacy of KRN23 administered via subcutaneous (SC) injections every 2 weeks (Q2W) for a total of 64 weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Safety, Pharmacodynamics and Efficacy of KRN23 in Children From 1 to 4 Years Old With X-linked Hypophosphatemia (XLH)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will enroll approximately 10 pediatric subjects between 1 and 4 years old, inclusive, with a confirmed diagnosis of XLH and radiographic evidence of rickets. Subjects will discontinue oral phosphate and active vitamin D therapy after initial Screening and for the duration of the study. All subjects will receive treatment with KRN23. Safety, PD, pre-dose KRN23 concentrations, and efficacy measures (rickets, growth, functional outcomes) will be evaluated throughout the study. Radiographs will be taken to assess rickets periodically throughout the study duration.</detailed_description>
