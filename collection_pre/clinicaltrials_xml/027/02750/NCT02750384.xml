	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, open label, single dose, parallel group study consisting of 3 groups of 14 subjects each. Subjects will be confined for 3 days followed by outpatient assessments until Day 21. Blood samples for assessment of DSM265 plasma concentrations will be collected for 480 hours after dosing.
