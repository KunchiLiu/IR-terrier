	<brief_summary>This will be a single-center, 12 week, examiner-blind, randomized, stratified (gender and baseline mean whole mouth MGI score), two-treatment, parallel group, clinical study in healthy adult volunteers with moderate gingivitis. This study will evaluate the efficacy of a dentifrice containing 0.454% weight by weight (w/w) stannous fluoride to control gingivitis and gingival bleeding following 12 weeks twice daily brushing, compared to a negative control dentifrice.</brief_summary>

Absence of any condition that would impact on the subject's safety or wellbeing or affect the individual's ability to understand and follow study procedures and requirements. A minimum of 20 permanent gradable teeth. (Gradable teeth are those where restorative materials cover less than 25% of the tooth surface graded). Moderate gingivitis present at the screening visit in the opinion of the investigator from a gross visual gingival assessment. Visible blood in toothpaste expectorant at Screening and Baseline (Visit 2). Women who are known to be pregnant or who are intending to become pregnant over the duration of the study. Women who are breastfeeding Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the study materials (or closely related compounds) or any of their stated ingredients. Participation in another clinical study (including cosmetic studies) or receipt of an investigational drug within 30 days of the screening visit. Previous participation in this study. Recent history (within the last year) of alcohol or other substance abuse. An employee of the sponsor or the study site or members of their immediate family. An employee of any toothpaste manufacturer or their immediate family. Medical History/Current Medication A. Current or relevant history of any serious, severe or unstable physical or psychiatric illness or any other medical condition (e.g. Diabetes Mellitus) that would make the subject unlikely to fully complete the study or any that increases the risk to the subject or undermines the data validity B.Screening i. Currently taking antibiotics or requiring antibiotic use prior to dental prophylaxis or other dental procedures. ii. Currently taking an antiinflammatory medication which, in the opinion of the Investigator, could affect gingival condition. iii. Currently taking a systemic medication which, in the opinion of the C. Baseline, Day 28 and Day 96 Assessment Visits i. Has taken antibiotics in the previous 14 days. ii. Has taken an antiinflammatory medication which, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect gingival condition in the previous 14 days. iii. Has taken a systemic medication which, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect gingival condition in the previous 14 days (e.g. calcium channel blockers, or aspirin therapy).could affect gingival condition in the previous 14 days (e.g. calcium channel blockers, or aspirin therapy).Investigator, could affect gingival condition (e.g. calcium channel blockers, or aspirin therapy). Have current active caries or periodontitis that may, in the opinion of the investigator, compromise the study or the oral health of the subjects if they participate in the study. Restorations in a poor state of repair. Partial dentures or orthodontic appliances. Teeth bleaching within 12 weeks of screening. Use of a chlorhexidine mouthwash within 14 days of baseline. Current smokers or smokers who have quit within the past 6 months prior to screening or subjects currently using smokeless forms of tobacco, e.g. Gutkha, Pan containing tobacco, Pan Masala or nicotine based ecigarettes.</criteria>
