	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Collecting and storing bone samples from patients with osteoporotic and nonosteoporotic fracture to study a special vessel subtype in the laboratory may help surgeon learn more about the relationship between bone mineral density (BMD) and a special vessel subtype (type H vessel). PURPOSE: This research study is looking at changes of a special vessel subtype in bone samples from patients with osteoporotic and nonosteoporotic fracture.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of A Special Vessel Subtype in Bone Samples From Patients With Osteoporotic and Nonosteoporotic Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: 1. Establish type H vessel in bone specimen in patients with hip fracture. 2. Explore the correlation of BMD and type H vessel. OUTLINE: 1. Collect human bone specimens from patients with Osteoporotic and Nonosteoporotic Fracture. 2. Provide a repository for storage of tissue and make these specimens available for approved projects by laboratory-based investigators. 3. Observe the type H vessel in bone slice by immunofluorescence staining. 4. Collect clinical data on these patients including bone mineral density. 5. Investigate the relationship between BMD and type H vessel.</detailed_description>
