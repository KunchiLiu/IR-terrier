	<brief_summary>This randomized clinical trial studies how well a tailored interactive digital versatile disc (DVD) with or without patient navigation works in improving screening rates in rural women for breast cancer, cervical cancer or colorectal cancer. A tailored interactive DVD and patient navigation may help rural women to learn more about cancer screening and to better understand the results.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rural Interventions for Screening Effectiveness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the effectiveness of a tailored and interactive DVD (TIDVD) versus (vs.) TIDVD + telephone-based patient navigation (PN) intervention (TIDVD + PN) vs. usual care (UC), to increase guideline-based cancer screening rates at 12 months post randomization for breast cancer (BC), cervical cancer (CC), and colorectal cancer (CRC) among 1058 women age 50 to 74 living in rural northwest Ohio and northeast Indiana. II. Compare the cost effectiveness of the TIDVD and the TIDVD + PN intervention vs. UC, for adherence to each screening outcome or combination of screening tests. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms. ARM I: Patients watch a tailored interactive DVD program and answer questions posed by the DVD program. ARM II: Patients engage in TIDVD and PN. ARM III: Patients receive brochures that explain and provide encouragement for cancer screening. After completion of the study, patients are followed up at 2 and 12 months.</detailed_description>
