	<brief_summary>The purpose of Phase I of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of the investigational drug, OTS167, and that of Phase II of this study is to confirm the potential response benefit of OTS167. OTS167 is a maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) inhibitor which demonstrated antitumor properties in laboratory tests. It is being developed as an anti-cancer drug. In this study OTS167 will be administrated to patients with AML, ALL, advanced MDSs, advanced MPNs, or advanced CML.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Diagnosis of relapsed or refractory AML, ALL, acute biphenotypic leukemia (assigned to the appropriate group by the treating physician and pathology/cytogenetics), advanced MDS defined as ≥10% bone marrow blasts, advanced MPN, MDS/MPN overlap syndrome with ≥10% bone marrow blasts, or advanced CML after failure of at least 3 TKIs 2. Age ≥18 years 3. No prior antineoplastic drug therapy for at least 14 days, with the exception of hydroxyurea, prior to starting OTS167. Patients with rapidly proliferative disease may continue to receive hydroxyurea. 4. Patients with a diagnosis of advanced CML must have been treated with 3 prior TKIs, and the last therapy must have been discontinued 14 days prior to starting OTS167. 5. Adequate organ function as defined below: Liver function (total bilirubin &lt;2mg/dL and aspartate aminotransferase and/or alanine aminotransferase &lt;3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) or &lt;5 × ULN if related to leukemic involvement) Renal function (creatinine &lt;1.5 × ULN) 6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2 7. Negative urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 for each woman of childbearing potential 8. Able to understand the potential risks, benefits, and requirements of the study and are willing to provide informed consent; an informed consent form for this study that is signed by the patient or his/her legally authorized representative is required prior to enrollment 1.
