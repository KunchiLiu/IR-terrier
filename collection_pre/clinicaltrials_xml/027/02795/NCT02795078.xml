	<brief_summary>Atherosclerotic intracranial arterial（ICA） stenosis and intracranial aneurysms are the common causes of ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke, respectively. Investigators aimed to assess the prevalence of cerebral aneurysms in patients with atherosclerotic intracranial arterial stenosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Coexistence of Atherosclerotic Intracranial Arterial Stenosis With Intracranial Aneurysms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based on prospective data of patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic ICA stenosis admitted to Beijing Tiantan Hospital between Jan 2015 and July 2016, all patients underwent brain CTA / MRA/DSA. Investigators determined the number of the patients with intracranial aneurysms, calculated overall prevalence of the coexistence of atherosclerotic ICA stenosis with aneurysms and analyzed the clinical features.</detailed_description>
