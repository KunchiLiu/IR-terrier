	<brief_summary>The current study is a continuation of the study "Effect of early rehabilitation in patients with acute aSAH" which was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics, South-East Norway, archive number 2011/2189, Clinical Trials number 0925-0586 (Clinical Trials gov. identifier NCT01656317). The original study was a prospective, controlled, interventional study comprising patients managed at the neuro-intermediate ward following repair of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm in 2011-2012. 157 patients signed the informed consent form and were included in the study. Patients were assessed in the acute phase, as well as a 3 and 12 months post ictus. The main research goal of the present study will be to assess physical, cognitive and emotional function 5 and 10 years after aSAH in the 2011-2012 population. In addition we will also describe quality of life and work-status along with the time-course of recovery from the acute sage after aSAH to the chronic phase.</brief_summary>
