For the treatment group, MaZiRenWan 10g plus HuangQi 20g are chosen as the core prescription. Furthermore, two out of six herbal granules can be added according to the syndrome differentiated for individual participant. Placebo is made from dextrin (76.03%), tea essence (23.61%), gardenin (0.02%), and caramel (0.34%) to achieve color, smell, taste, and texture comparable to the herbal granules. Patients are instructed to dissolve the granules in 150ml of hot water, twice daily for two weeks. The primary end point is the global symptom improvement. Secondary outcome measures include stool frequency, stool form, use of rescue herbal granules, constipation visual analogue scale (CVAS) (0=none to 7=most severe) and individual assessment of constipation related symptoms. For the safety profiles of herbal intervention, the important adverse events reported and clinical laboratory evaluations of liver and renal function are determined.</brief_summary>
