	<brief_title>Study of the What the Body Does to the Drug in Subjects With Mild, Moderate, and Severe Liver Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label single-dose study. Approximately 40 total subjects will be enrolled. In each of the 3 hepatic impairment groups (mild hepatic dysfunction [Child-Pugh score of 5 - 6], moderate hepatic dysfunction [Child-Pugh score of 7 - 9], severe hepatic dysfunction [Child Pugh score of 10 - 12]) approximately 10 subjects will be enrolled in order to achieve 8 subjects completing the study in each group. In addition, approximately 8 12 healthy subjects with non-impaired hepatic function will be enrolled to match the subjects in the hepatic impairment groups. Subjects with non-impaired hepatic function may be matched to more than 1 hepatically impaired subject and may be matched to impaired subjects in different Child-Pugh categories; ie, mild, moderate, and/or severe. In order to obtain matched control subjects, after each subject with hepatic impairment has completed the study, a subject with non-impaired hepatic function will be sought; the already enrolled matched control subjects will be checked for a match prior to screening and enrollment of a new match. Each matched control subject will be selected to be demographically comparable to one or more hepatic dysfunction subjects in age (± 10 years), gender, and weight (± 20%). Subjects who do not complete the study may be replaced in order to achieve 8 subjects completing the study in each hepatic impairment group and appropriate healthy matched control subjects. The study will consist of Screening (Days -28 to -2), Inpatient Period (Days 1 through 7), and Follow-up (Days 8 28). Screening assessments will be used to classify the degree of a subject's hepatic impairment. The degree of impairment will be assigned based on the Child-Pugh category for classification for severity of liver disease. Subjects will be admitted to the clinical site on the day prior to administration of study drug and remain inpatient until discharge on Day 7 (approximately 168 hours after treatment). Subjects may be discharged on Day 5, if in the investigator's opinion they can be relied upon to return for the Day 6 and 7 visits. The following safety assessments will be performed: physical examination; vital signs; clinical laboratory evaluations (hematology, prothrombin time, serum chemistry, and urinalysis); AE collection, ECGs, and C SSRS. Blood and urine samples will be collected for analyses of study drug concentrations and plasma protein binding. The blood sampling duration (648 hours postdose [Day 28]) was chosen to determine the terminal half-life of dasotraline, with the expectation that this time may be extended in hepatically impaired subjects compared to the control subjects. A blood sample for pharmacogenetics will be collected only from subjects who provide separate informed consent to collect this sample. The sample will be utilized for potential evaluation of genetic polymorphisms upon selected enzymatic pathway(s) responsible for the metabolism of dasotraline; this sample is optional for participation in the study. Exclusion Criteria continued from Eligibility Section: Any subject with hepatic impairment meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded: 1. Subject who does not tolerate venipuncture or has poor venous access that would cause difficulty for collecting blood samples. 2. Subject with a Child-Pugh classification score ≥ 13. 3. Subject with encephalopathy grade &gt; 1. 4. Subject experienced hepatic coma within the 12 months prior to screening. 5. Subject, who has any abnormal medical history, physical examination, ECG, or laboratory result which, in the opinion of the investigator and medical monitor, may affect the safety of the subject. Subjects with abnormal medical history that is stable may be enrolled. 6. Subject with clinically significant cardiovascular disease, including any of the following: 1. history of cardiac surgery or myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to screening; 2. unstable coronary artery disease; 3. congestive heart failure greater than New York Heart Association (NHYA) Functional Class 1; 4. cardiac arrhythmia or conduction disturbance resulting in atrioventricular block (AV) block, ventricular fibrillation or causing syncope, near syncope or other alterations of mental status; 5. severe mitral or aortic valvular disease; 6. moderately symptomatic peripheral vascular disorder; 7. uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt; 200 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 110 mmHg).

Subject with stable, chronic medical conditions (eg, hypertension and hyperlipidemia) in addition to hepatic impairment that, in the opinion of the investigator, will not significantly alter the disposition of the study drug, will not place the subject at increased risk by participating in the study, and will not interfere with interpretation of the data may be permitted to enroll in the study after discussion and agreement between the investigator and medical monitor. 7. Subject exhibits vital signs within the reference range for their age and level of hepatic impairment; subjects with vital signs outside the reference ranges may be eligible for the study if the investigator and medical monitor agree that the results are not clinically significant based on the age and hepatic impairment status of the subject, and will not impact study conduct. 8. Subject with outofrange laboratory results that are related to the subject's underlying condition are eligible; however, the results will need to be carefully reviewed by the investigator and medical monitor to determine if a subject is eligible for study participation. Out of range results could indicate a stable or unstable situation. If the subject is unstable (eg, rapidly changing liver tests, significantly worsened anemia compared to earlier labs, etc), then such subject would be excluded from study participation. Serum bilirubin, albumin, and prothrombin time will be assessed individually for a point score according to the ChildPugh classification. 9. Subject has a diagnosis of chronic hepatic impairment for at least 6 months and, in the opinion of the investigator, the severity of the subject's hepatic disease is stable, which is defined as having no clinically significant change in disease status within the 90 days prior to study drug administration, as documented by the subject's recent medical history. Copies of documentation of any clinical information used to make a previous diagnosis of hepatic dysfunction must be available. This may include abnormal liver function tests, clinical evidence of portal hypertension, a positive liver biopsy (eg, for cirrhotic disease, portal hypertension), and/or hepatic ultrasound. 10. The total score of the Child Pugh classification must be 5 or 6 for subjects with mild hepatic dysfunction, and between 7 and 9, inclusive, for subjects with moderate dysfunction, and between 10 and 12, inclusive, for subjects with severe hepatic dysfunction. 11. Subject receiving medication for underlying disease states or medical conditions related to hepatic dysfunction must be on a stable dose of medication and/or treatment regimen.

Subject with a history of alcohol abuse is eligible provided the urine alcohol test is negative. 14. Subject with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus is eligible provided that, in the investigator's opinion, he or she has stable diabetes.
