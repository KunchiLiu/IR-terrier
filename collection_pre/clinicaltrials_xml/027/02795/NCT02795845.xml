	<brief_summary>During pregnancy, bacterial vaginosis (BV), abnormal vaginal flora (AVF) and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) are associated with serious complications and discomfort. Yet, treatment options are limited. Lactobacilli administration was suggested to treat and prevent vaginal infections. However, this has not been examined in pregnant women, the information regarding oral treatment is scarce, and the mechanisms in which oral ingestion of probiotics induce vaginal lactobacilli proliferation are not well established. In the present study we will examine if oral probiotics are effective in prevention and eradication of vaginal infections by migration of lactobacilli from the digestive system to the vagina in pregnant women.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>During pregnancy, bacterial vaginosis (BV), abnormal vaginal flora (AVF) and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) are associated with serious complications and discomfort. Yet, treatment options are limited. Lactobacilli administration was suggested to treat and prevent vaginal infections. However, this has not been examined in pregnant women, the information regarding oral treatment is scarce, and the mechanisms in which oral ingestion of probiotics induce vaginal lactobacilli proliferation are not well established. Working hypothesis: Oral probiotics will be effective in prevention and eradication of vaginal infections by migration of lactobacilli from the digestive system to the vagina in pregnant women. Type of research and methods of data collection: randomized placebo-controlled trial. Pregnant patients with symptoms consisted with vaginal infection will be examined and vaginal smear will be obtained, according to which the patients will be allocated to the following groups: Normal vaginal flora (primary prevention) Positive for AVF/BV- those will be treated with oral antibiotic. Following treatment, another smear will be taken according to which the patients will be divided into: (1) patients with normal vaginal flora (secondary prevention). (2) patients with persistent AVF/BV (eradication). Positive for VVC- those will be treated with vaginal clotrimazole after which, patients with eradication will be included (secondary prevention). In each group the patients will be divided into two subgroups, which will receive one capsule twice a day of either the Probiotic capsules or placebo. At the initial examination and once a month all the study groups will be tested for the presence of AVF/BV, candida and semi-quantitative assessment of vaginal lactobacilli. Additional vaginal samples will be taken to evaluate the presence of lactobacilli from the capsule.</detailed_description>
