	<brief_title>Mindfulness Based Smoking Cessation Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will introduce a mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) training program at Boston Medical Center's oncology clinic to promote engagement of low-income and minority smokers with cancer in smoking cessation. This training will follow an adapted MBSR curriculum designed by and for Boston Medical Center patients with chronic pain in the Integrated Medical Group Visit research program in Family Medicine. The investigators will tailor this adapted MBSR curriculum to address smoking cessation. To test the feasibility and acceptability of our intervention, the investigators will pilot test it with 30 patients over the course of three MBSR training programs (each cohort is 9 weeks). The investigators will acquire feasibility data (number of inquiries, number of sessions attended, and satisfaction with MBSR). Additionally, pre and post questionnaires will assess readiness to quit, stress level, and satisfaction with and acceptability of MBSR after every cohort). The primary outcome is engagement in smoking cessation treatment which includes counseling and/or pharmacotherapy. Additionally, the investigators will hold a focus group after each of the 3 cohorts have completed the program to discuss acceptability of study materials as well as facilitators and barriers to participation in the training. Data collected from this study will generate preliminary data to successfully justify and secure future funding for a larger controlled study.</detailed_description>
