	<brief_summary>This is a study to find out whether cardiac rehabilitation is a program that can work in Western Kenya. This study will test whether cardiac rehabilitation is feasible by measuring how many participants are able to follow and complete two different exercise protocols; one at home and one in hospital. It will also measure how the exercise intervention affects quality of living, depression and improvement in exercise tolerance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility of Cardiac Rehabilitation in Patients With Heart Failure at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular diseases are major drivers of global disease burden. Heart failure, has a 50% mortality at 5 years and is thought to be higher in resource limited settings. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a multi-disciplinary intervention which has been demonstrated to improve functional status, quality of life, and reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. In sub-Saharan Africa, despite a significant heart failure disease burden, CR is largely non-existent. There is a compelling need for urgent development of access to CR in the region. However, feasibility and potential utilization of CR is unknown. The investigators aim to conduct a mixed methods study to evaluate feasibility of home based and institution based CR. Participants will be voluntarily recruited from a convenience sample at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) outpatient cardiology clinic. Based on a reasonable estimate of expected subject recruitment over the time frame of study, 25 patients will be recruited into the institution based cardiac rehabilitation (IBCR) arm. In consideration of the potentially larger population and a wider geographical spread of home based cardiac rehabilitation (HBCR), 75 patients will be recruited to the HBCR arm. While the study is not designed to make comparative outcome inferences between the HBCR and the IBCR groups, the sample size will be large enough to detect a clinically significant mean post intervention increase in 6 minute walk time distance in the HBCR arm of 50m. The participants will be involved in physical exercises, nutritional counseling and educational sessions. Upon completion of the rehabilitation protocols, patients from both study arms will also be invited to participate in focus group discussions. Data will be analyzed and numeric data will be expressed as number (percent), means (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range). Wilcoxon rank-sum and Fisher's exact tests for pre - post intervention comparisons of continuous and binary variables, respectively. Focus group discussions will be transcribed and analyzed to identify discussion themes.</detailed_description>
