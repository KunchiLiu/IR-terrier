	<brief_title>Bemiparin Versus Enoxaparin in the Prevention of Venous Thromboembolism Among ICU Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective randomized trial to compare thromboprophylaxis using bemiparin and enoxaparin in critically ill patients in ICU. The study included one hundred bedridden patients in intensive care unit who are at high risk for developing venous thromboembolism and require long term anticoagulation Patients were divided into two groups each one consists of 50 patients. One group received bemiparin 3500 IU subcutaneous once daily and the other group received enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneous once daily as a prophylaxis against thromboembolism. Patients were followed up for 60 days for the development of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and complications related to the injected anticoagulant.</detailed_description>
