	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to look for abnormal genes and gene expression profiles that help determine why a person develops amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and related motor neuron diseases (MND) and why their symptoms present and progress with a particular pattern.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genomic Translation for ALS Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In all patients, ALS/MND is caused by the progressive death of motor neurons. However, every patient is affected differently. Some develop symptoms in their 80's while others get sick in adolescence. Swallowing/speech are affected first in some patients, but most have weakness in their hands or feet at onset. Some individuals show very rapid progression, even as others live for decades. Finally, some patients have loss of mainly motor neurons in the brain (as in primary lateral sclerosis), while others lose mainly lower motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain stem (as in progressive muscular atrophy). Research has uncovered a few genetic factors that contribute to the variability of ALS/MND. For example, mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene makes onset in the legs more likely and decreases the chance of developing dementia. Conversely, having a mutated C9ORF72 gene makes dementia much more likely. Uncovering additional factors causing ALS variability is an important research priority and is likely to provide clues about how to better diagnose and treat the disease. This study is called "Genomic Translation for ALS Care" (GTAC). The investigators will analyze the genome and gene expression patterns of people with ALS/MND and carry out research on that data, finding insights that the investigators hope will translate into better care for ALS/MND patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Study participants meeting all of the following criteria will be eligible for enrollment in GTAC: 1. Men or women of any race or ethnicity aged 18 or older 2. Diagnosis of familial or sporadic ALS (definite, probable, or possible according to El Escorial Criteria, Appendix 1), or those with primary lateral sclerosis or progressive bulbar/muscular atrophy forms of motor neuron disease. Allcomers with ALS/MND should be enrolled without regard to familial vs sporadic or gene mutation status (i.e. participants with known gene mutations should still be enrolled), or phenotype. 3. Capable of providing informed consent and following study procedures (in the case that a subject lacks the ability to provide informed consent, informed consent will be sought from the subject's surrogate representative). 4. Willing to return to clinic site (or another participating center) for followup care. Study participants meeting any of the following criteria during screening evaluation will be excluded from enrolling in GTAC: 1. Invasive ventilation (i.e. tracheostomy) in place. 2. Noninvasive ventilation dependent (defined as &gt;22 hours per day) 3. Pregnancy. 4. Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) , chronic Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C (because cells will be frozen down for future cell line generation).</criteria>
