	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double blind, active control study of PRX-102 in Fabry disease patients with impaired renal function. Patients treated for at least 1 year with agalsidase beta and on a stable dose for at least 6 months will be screened and then randomized to continue treatment with either agalsidase beta at the same dose or to treatment with 1 mg/kg of PRX-102. The identity of the enzyme will be blinded to the patient and the investigator. Patients will receive intravenous infusions every two weeks. Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio of PRX-102 to agalsidase beta. Randomization will be stratified by urinary protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) of &lt; or ≥ 1 g/g by spot urine sample.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Symptomatic adult Fabry disease patients, age 1860 years 1. Plasma and/or leucocyte alpha galactosidase activity (by activity assay) less than 30% mean normal levels 2. One or more of the described characteristic features of Fabry disease: i. neuropathic pain, ii. cornea verticillata, iii. clustered angiokeratoma Screening eGFR by CKDEPI equation 40 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 Linear negative slope of eGFR based on at least 3 serum creatinine values over approximately 1 year (range of 9 to 18 months, including the value obtained at the screening visit) of ≥ 2 mL/min/1.73 m2/year Treatment with a dose of 1 mg/kg agalsidase beta per infusion every 2 weeks for at least one year and at least 80% of 13 (10.4) mg/kg total dose over the last 6 months. History of anaphylaxis or Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction to agalsidase beta History of renal dialysis or transplantation History of acute kidney injury in the 12 months prior to screening, including specific kidney diseases (e.g., acute interstitial nephritis, acute glomerular and vasculitic renal diseases); nonspecific conditions (e.g, ischemia, toxic injury); as well as extrarenal pathology (e.g., prerenal azotemia, and acute postrenal obstructive nephropathy) Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy initiated or dose changed in the 4 weeks prior to screening Urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) &gt; 0.5 g/g and not treated with an ACE inhibitor or AR Cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, unstable angina) in the 6 month period before randomization Congestive heart failure NYHA Class IV Cerebrovascular event (stroke, transient ischemic attack) in the 6 month period before randomization Known history of hypersensitivity to Gadolinium contrast agent Presence of any medical, emotional, behavioral or psychological condition that, in the judgment of the Investigator and/or Medical Director, would interfere with the patient's compliance with the requirements of the study</criteria>
