	<brief_summary>Purpose: To evaluate the retention and caries preventive effect of the glass-ionomer fissure sealants and resin-based fissure sealant. Materials and Methods: Using a split mouth design ,a double blind randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted to compare the retention and the caries preventive effect of light cure resin base sealant (3M ESPE) and Glass ionomer sealant (FUJI). The study comprised of 120 government school children of 7-9 years age group. The glass-ionomer sealant and resin-based sealant were applied randomly on either side of the first mandibular permanent molars. They were recalled for assessment of sealant retention at intervals of 3, 6 and 12 months.</brief_summary>
