	<brief_summary>The investigators plan to determine the incidence of hemi-diaphragmatic paresis (HDP) with two commonly used techniques of supraclavicular nerve block, the single and double injection techniques. It is our hypothesis that a double injection peripheral nerve block technique will increase the risk of HDP when compared to a single injection technique.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diaphragmatic Dysfunction After Ultrasound-guided Supraclavicular Block With Single or Double Injection Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will perform a prospective, blinded, randomized controlled trial to assess the two methods of supraclavicular block (single and double injection), and the resultant incidence of temporary diaphragm dysfunction, or hemi-diaphragmatic paresis (HDP) will be measured with ultrasound. Patients having forearm or hand surgery will be asked by the attending anesthesiologist if they will agree to be approached by someone from the research team for consent and possible inclusion in the study. This will be done in the anesthesia preoperative assessment clinic, or in the pre-op area on the day of surgery (if a patient was not seen in clinic). Once consented, all patients in the study will have baseline measurements of their sensation and movement of the arm for surgery, as well as an ultrasound examination of the movement of the diaphragm. Patients will then be randomized to either the single or double injection supraclavicular nerve block. The blocks will be performed by attending anesthesiologists with experience in regional anesthesia, or by residents and fellows under the direct supervision of such anesthesiologists.</detailed_description>
