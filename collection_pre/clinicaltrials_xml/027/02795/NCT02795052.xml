	<brief_summary>This is a human clinical study involving the isolation of autologous bone marrow derived stem cells (BMSC) and transfer to the vascular system and inferior 1/3 of the nasal passages in order to determine if such a treatment will provide improvement in neurologic function for patients with certain neurologic conditions.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Various clinical studies have registered with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to study neurologic diseases and damage. There have also been a number of journal reports of the benefits of treatment with BMSC for diseases and damage to nervous tissue. The investigators hope to add to the volume of literature regarding the use of BMSC in those neurologic diseases and conditions identified as likely to respond to this treatment. Intravenous administration of BMSC is a well-established approach to neurologic disease and injury with much support for its effectiveness in the pre-clinical and clinical literature. BMSC and the associated bone marrow fraction are posited to have a number of different mechanisms by which they may potentially improve neurologic function. In regards their ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier for potential neuronal transdifferentiation and direct impact on the neurons and glial tissue within the brain, it should be remembered that within the diencephalon there are specific circumventricular organs which lie in the wall of the third ventricle. These are noteworthy for a significantly diminished blood-brain barrier and glial limitans which facilitates their function of coordinating homeostatic mechanisms of the endocrine and nervous systems. Therefore the investigators believe entry of BMSC may be facilitated in this area of the brain. In addition to Arm 1 providing intravenous BMSC, the NEST Study provides a treatment Arm 2 which combines intravenous BMSC with topical application of BMSC to the lower 1/3 of the nasal passages as a means of introducing BMSC to the Central Nervous System (CNS). This is applied bilaterally to the inferior nasal conchas and meatuses. The Trigeminal Nerve or 5th Cranial Nerve is a paired, large sensory and motor nerve with multiple branches. It provides sensation to the surface and interior structures of the face including the nasal mucosa that lines the nose. The nerves of the Trigeminal Nerve providing sensation to this area converge and enter the brain at the level of the pons. There is documentation in the scientific literature that intranasal delivery of BMSC allows the BMSC to follow the pathways of the trigeminal nerve, facilitating entry into the parenchyma and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) for effects on the CNS.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Have documented functional damage to the central or peripheral nervous system unlikely to improve with present standard of care. 2. Be at least 6 months postonset of the disease. 3. If under current medical therapy (pharmacologic or surgical treatment) for the condition be considered stable on that treatment and unlikely to have reversal of the associated neurologic functional damage as a result of the ongoing pharmacologic or surgical treatment. 4. In the estimation of Dr. Weiss and the neurologists have the potential for improvement with BMSC treatment and be at minimal risk of any potential harm from the procedure. 5. Be over the age of 18 and capable of providing informed consent. 6. Be medically stable and able to be medically cleared by their primary care physician or a licensed primary care practitioner for the procedure. Medical clearance means that in the estimation of the primary care practitioner, the patient can reasonably be expected to undergo the procedure without significant medical risk to health. 1. All patients must be capable of an adequate neurologic examination and evaluation to document the pathology. This will include the ability to cooperate with the exam. 2. Patients must be capable and willing to undergo follow up neurologic exams with the subinvestigators or their own neurologists as outlined in the protocol. 3. Patients must be capable of providing informed consent. 4. In the estimation of Dr. Weiss the BMSC collection and treatment will not present a significant risk of harm to the patient's general health or to their neurologic function. . 5. Patients who are not medically stable or who may be at significant risk to their health undergoing the procedure will not be eligible. 6. Women of childbearing age must not be pregnant at the time of treatment and should refrain from becoming pregnant for 3 months post treatment.</criteria>
