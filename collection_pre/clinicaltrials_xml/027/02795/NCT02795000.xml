	<detailed_description>Many researches show primary ovarian insufficiency(POI) etiology is related with gene,immunization,iatrogenic, infection factors and social factors etc. In fact, approximate 70-90% POI have no definite cause, so a lot of patients don't know what will happen when they in occult stage of POI. In this research, researchers will investigate all possible factors in POI patients and normal women and select the valuable risk factor by integrated by statistical method to establish the reasonable predictive model. This study consists two stages.The fist stage is the model establishment, the second stage is the certificate and evaluate the model.</detailed_description>
