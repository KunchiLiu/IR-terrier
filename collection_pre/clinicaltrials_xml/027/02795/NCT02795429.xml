	<criteria>1. Histologically or cytologically documented locally advanced recurrent or metastatic HCC or for patients with cirrhosis according to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) criteria. Current cirrhotic status of Child Pugh Class A (56 points), with no encephalopathy and/or ascites. 2. Patients must have received prior systemic sorafenib treatment for HCC with documented progression during or after discontinuation of sorafenib treatment (for France only: patients must have received at least 8 weeks of prior sorafenib treatment), are intolerant to sorafenib (defined as documented Grade 3 or 4 adverse events that led to sorafenib discontinuation). 3. ECOG Performance Status ≤ 1. 4. Willing and able to swallow and retain oral medication. Other protocol defined Inclusion criteria may apply. 1. Use of any vaccines (except inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines) within 4 weeks of initiation of study treatment. 2. History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). 3. Clinically significant pleural effusion that either required pleurocentesis or is associated with shortness of breath. 4. Active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease. 5. Clinically significant, uncontrolled heart diseases. 6. Patient having out of range laboratory values defined as: Total bilirubin &gt; 2 mg/dL, except for patients with Gilbert's syndrome who are excluded if total bilirubin &gt; 3.0 x ULN or direct bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 5 x ULN Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 5 x ULN Coagulation: Prothrombin Time (PT) ≥ 4 seconds or International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≥ 1.7 Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1.5 x 109/L Platelet count &lt; 75 x 109/L Hemoglobin &lt; 9 g/dL Creatinine clearance (calculated using CockcroftGault formula, or measured) &lt; 45 mL/min Asymptomatic serum amylase grade &gt; 2 (1.52.0 x ULN). Patients with grade 1 or grade 2 serum amylase at the beginning of the study must be confirmed to have no signs or symptoms suggesting pancreatitis or pancreatic injury (e.g., elevated Pamylase, abnormal imaging findings of pancreas, etc.) Serum lipase &gt; ULN Potassium, Magnesium, Phosphorus, total Calcium (corrected for serum albumin) outside of normal limits (patients may be enrolled if corrected to within normal limits with supplements during screening) Other protocoldefined Exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
