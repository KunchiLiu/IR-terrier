	<brief_title>Effect of Alendronate With β - TCP Bone Substitute in Surgical Therapy of Periodontal Intra-osseous Defects.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the bone formation potential of 400µg alendronate(ALN) delivered in β-TCP in the treatment of periodontal intra-osseous defects. Materials and Methods: Thirty patients with periodontal defects were randomly assigned to 400µg ALN + β-TCP + saline (test) group and β-TCP + saline (active-control) group. Clinical parameters like clinical attachment level (CAL) gain, probing depth (PD) reduction, post-operative gingival recession (GR) were assessed from the baseline, 3 months and 6 months recordings. Radiographic parameters like linear bone growth (LBG), percentage bone fill (%BF), change in alveolar crest height (ACH) were assessed from baseline and 6 months radiographs.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Systemically healthy patients having an intraosseous defect with probing depth ≥ 7mm at baseline, presence of a ≥ 4mm vertical interproximal bone defect with at least one bony wall after surgical debridement and with no history of previous periodontal therapy were included into the study Patients with known systemic diseases, aggressive periodontitis, smoking habit, known or suspected allergy to bisphosphonates, pregnant and lactating women, study tooth exhibiting tooth mobility greater than grade II and class III furcation defect were excluded from the study.</criteria>
