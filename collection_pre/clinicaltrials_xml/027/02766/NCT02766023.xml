	<brief_summary>This Phase 2b trial is designed to provide a screening evaluation for the hypothesis that, following a 5-day treatment with MetroGel® to treat BV, L. crispatus CTV-05 (LACTIN-V, Osel, Inc.) administered at 2 x 10^9 cfu/dose using a vaginal applicator reduces the 12-week incidence of BV recurrence when compared to placebo. The primary objectives of this study are: 1) To estimate the efficacy of repeated doses of LACTIN-V (2 x 10^9 cfu/dose) as compared to placebo in preventing BV recurrence by 12 weeks following treatment of BV with MetroGel vaginal gel (MetroGel). 2) To assess the safety of LACTIN-V over 24 weeks by comparing the incidence of AEs between individuals randomized to LACTIN-V or placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LACTIN-V Study for Recurrent Bacterial Vaginosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase II-b multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy of repeated doses of LACTIN-V compared to placebo in preventing BV recurrence in women diagnosed with BV. The study will also assess the safety of LACTIN-V by comparing the incidence of AEs between women randomized to LACTIN-V or placebo. The study plans to enroll 228 non-pregnant, pre-menopausal women age 18 to 45 years. Women will be randomized 2:1 to receive LACTIN-V or placebo. Potentially eligible women will start a standard 5-day course of MetroGel. Women will return to the study clinic within 2 days after completing the 5-day course of MetroGel to re-evaluate eligibility criteria and review the BV test results from the screening visit. Women with Amsel criteria &gt; /=3 and Nugent score 4-10 will be instructed to administer the LACTIN-V or placebo at home for 5 consecutive days and then twice weekly for 10 weeks. The primary objectives of this study are: 1) To estimate the efficacy of repeated doses of LACTIN-V (2 x109 cfu/dose) as compared to placebo in preventing BV recurrence by 12 weeks following treatment of BV with MetroGel vaginal gel (MetroGel). 2) To assess the safety of LACTIN-V over 24 weeks by comparing the incidence of AEs between individuals randomized to LACTIN-V or placebo. Secondary objectives are: 1) To investigate the colonization of LACTIN-V (presence of L. crispatus CTV-05 in the vaginal specimen) and fluctuations over 12 weeks, in relation to menses and sexual intercourse 2) To evaluate user acceptability and tolerability of LACTIN-V over 12 weeks, including perceptions around method of delivery and dosing. 3) To measure long-term colonization of LACTIN-V at 24 weeks (12 weeks after last dosing) 4) To estimate the long-term efficacy of repeated doses of LACTIN-V (2 x 109 cfu/dose) as compared to placebo in preventing BV recurrence at 24 weeks (12 weeks after last dosing)</detailed_description>

Diagnosis of two or more outbreaks of N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, T. pallidum, T. vaginalis, or herpes simplex virus (herpes genitalis) within 6 months prior to screening 3. Positive for syphilis or HIV at screening 4. Current pregnancy or within 2 months of last pregnancy and/or currently breastfeeding**. Criteria will be assessed at screening and enrollment. 5.
