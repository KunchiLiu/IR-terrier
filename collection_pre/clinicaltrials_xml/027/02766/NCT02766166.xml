	<brief_summary>By integrating approaches from the physical, biological, computational, statistical and clinical sciences, this study will test the hypothesis that early diagnosis of subclinical signatures of critical illness encoded within physiological signals complements conventional clinical predictors by providing unique prognostic insight. Early diagnosis of these subclinical signatures may lead to earlier treatment that can save additional lives. Our goal is to validate predictive algorithms and identify subclinical signatures of illness, ranging from asymptomatic adults in the community to very sick patients in the hospital.</brief_summary>
