Assessment of clinical, radiographic and patient-reported outcomes of Physica CR and PS designs 2. Incidence of adverse events and identification of possible risk factors for unsatisfactory results 3. Mid-term survivorship of the implants</brief_summary>

Patients with painful primary knee osteoarthritis 7. Patients with painful secondary knee osteoarthritis 8. Patients who have undamaged and functional collateral and posterior cruciate ligaments for the group requiring Physica CR 9. Patients who have undamaged and functional collateral ligaments for the group requiring Physica PS 10. Patients with flexion ≥90° on the affected side 11. Patients with a fixed flexion contracture &lt;20° 12. Patients with previous metaphyseal tibial or femoral osteotomy performed more than 5 years before the screening visit, in case of plate removal surgery it is done not early than 1 year 13. Patients who understand the conditions of the study and are willing and able to comply with the prescribed rehabilitation and to perform all scheduled followup visits 14. Patients who have signed the Ethics Committee approved studyspecific Informed Consent Form prior to the surgery 1. Patients with BMI above 35 kg/m2 (severe obesity) 2.

Patients with an history of infections (on the affected knee or systemic) 10. Muscular insufficiency or absence of muscoligamentous supporting structures required for adequate soft tissue balance 11. Patients who have damaged or absence of the posterior cruciate ligament for the group requiring Physica CR 12. Patients with known or suspicious metal hypersensitivity 13. Recurrent medical history of severe allergic or immunemediated reactions 14. Vascular insufficiency of lower limbs severe enough to interfere 15. Current treatment or treatment within the previous 2 years before the screening visit for malignant and lifethreatening nonmalignant disorders 16. Any clinically significant pathology based on clinical history that the Investigator feels may affect the study evaluation including: any intercurrent chronic disease or condition that may interfere with the completion of the 5year followup, such as liver disease, severe coronary disease, drug or alcohol abuse significant neurological or musculoskeletal disorders or disease that may adversely affect gait and compromise functional recovery neuromuscular or neurosensory deficit which would limit the ability to assess the performance of the device known metabolic disorders leading to progressive bone deterioration 17. Patients who have known coexistent medical condition with less 5 years of life expectancy 18. Previous organ transplant surgery 19. Any psychiatric illness that would prevent comprehension of the details and nature of the study 20. Participation in any experimental drug/device study within the 6 months prior to the screening visit 21. Female patients who are pregnant, nursing, or planning a pregnancy</criteria>
