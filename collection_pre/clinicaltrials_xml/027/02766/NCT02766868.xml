	<brief_summary>Patients with refractory and relapse lymphoblastic leukemia had poor outcome even with marrow ablative conditioning mostly standard iv-Bu-Cy or Cy-TBI. In this study, we focus on a new treatment strategy with high-dose chemotherapy regimen consisting of fludaraibine+cytarabine+cyclophosphamide+etoposide followed by reduced intensity condiotning regimen consisting of fludarabine, busulfan and post-infusion cyclophophamide.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sequential Intensive Chemotherapy Followed by RIC for Refractory and Relapse ALL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients with refractory and relapse lymphoblastic leukemia will receive a high-dose chemotherapy regimen consisting of fludaraibine+cytarabine+ cyclophosphamide+etoposide. At day 7 after chemo, a bone marrow aspiration and MRD study by flow-cytometry is planned. For those patients with no residual blasts will undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation with reduced intensity condiotning regimen consisting of 5-day fludarabine and 3-day busulfan and post-infusion cyclophophamide (D+3 and +4) as GVHD prophylaxis.</detailed_description>
