	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to compare the measurements of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), macula and optical disc parameters obtained by optical coherence tomography (OCT), and intraocular pressure (IOP) between the patients with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) and healthy controls.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optic Disc, Macula, and Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer Measurements Obtained by OCT in Thyroid Associated Ophthalmopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One hundred and thirty two eyes of 66 patients with TAO and 72 eyes of 36 healthy controls were included in the study. Proptosis level was determined by Hertel exophthalmometer. Optic disc, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer and macula parameters were measured by OCT. All measurements were compared between the patients and age and sex-matched healthy controls.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient group consists the consecutive patients with thyroid associated ophthalmopathy consulted by endocrinology department. The control group was chosen among healthy volunteers who have no eye pathology, 20/20 vision (corrected or uncorrected), age and sexmatched with the patient group. For both groups, those who had significant sight impairment, high myopia ( &lt; 5Diopters ), high hyperopia ( &gt; +3Diopters ), optic disc anomaly, vitreoretinal interface disease, vascular and degenerative retinal diseases, cornea or lens opacity, ocular surgery history, glaucoma, neurological diseases that can affect the visual field, history of trauma, amblyopia, diplopia, keratitis, history of topical or systemic steroid</criteria>
