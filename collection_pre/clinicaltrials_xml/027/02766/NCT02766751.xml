	<brief_title>Treating Comorbid Pain and Depression in HIV+ Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of this RCT is to evaluate the HIVPass intervention. HIV+ participants (n=236) with chronic pain and depression will be recruited at the primary care HIV Clinics at the Miriam Hospital through posted advertisements in the waiting rooms of the PCP offices and by physician referral. After an initial phone study screen, research staff will meet with interested individuals in their PCP offices for informed consent, baseline interview and randomization into one of two study groups (Health Education or HIVPass Counseling). Seven intervention sessions (HE or HIVPASS) will occur during the first 3 months of study participation. For all participants, the first session is a collaborative in-person joint session with the participant, his/her PCP and the study BHS. Session 2 is conducted immediately after this collaborative session, and is also in-person. Sessions 3-7 are conducted by phone. Follow-up assessment interviews will be at months 1, 2, 3 (post-intervention), 4, 6, 9 and 12.</detailed_description>
