	<brief_summary>A prospective, multi-center, single-arm study, planned in 110 patients. The primary objective of the study is to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided transurethral ultrasound therapy system (TULSA-PRO) intended to ablate prostate tissue of patients with localized, organ-confined prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pivotal Study of MRI-guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation in Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Profound Medical Inc. has developed a novel technology called the MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound therapy system (TULSA-PRO). The technology is developed for patients with organ confined prostate cancer. The therapeutic endpoint of this technology is thermal coagulation of prostate tissue. The treatment is conducted within a MRI suite, which enables real-time temperature images of the heated region to be acquired as the ultrasonic treatment is delivered. Using MRI thermometry during treatment, dynamic temperature feedback control over the intensity of the ultrasound beams and rotation of the Ultrasound Applicator can shape the pattern of thermal coagulation accurately and precisely in the prostate gland. It provides advantages of a non-invasive procedure with short treatment times.</detailed_description>

Clinical stage ≤ T2b 4. Gleason score ≤ 3 + 4 5. PSA ≤ 15 ng/ml 6. Eligible for MRI [Form GCP10131] 7. Eligible for general anesthesia (ASA category ≤ 3) 8. Prostate volume ≤ 90 cc, on Baseline MRI 9. Prostate size ≤ 5.0 cm in sagittal length, and ≤ 6.0 cm in axial diameter, on Baseline MRI 10. Life expectancy ≥ 10 years 1. Evidence (including Baseline MRI and bone scan) of extracapsular extension, sphincter involvement, seminal vesicle invasion, lymph node invasion or metastases 2. Suspected tumour on Baseline MRI within 3 mm of the prostatic urethra, or in the prostate apex within 3 mm from the sphincter plane 3. Prior definitive treatment of prostate cancer 4. Prior transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) 5. Use of 5alpha reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) or hormone therapy within 3 months prior to the baseline visit. Baseline PSA must be established after a minimum of 3 months following 5ARIs discontinuation. Additionally, use of 5ARIs is not permitted following treatment during the study followup period. 6. Prostate calcifications &gt; 1 cm in largest diameter, on Baseline Ultrasound 7. Cysts &gt; 1 cm in largest diameter, on Baseline MRI 8. Bleeding disorder (INR &gt; ULN and PTT &gt; ULN) 9. Abnormal coagulation and current anticoagulant therapy. Patients whose anticoagulation therapy can be temporarily reversed within 7 days prior to treatment are eligible. Platelet inhibitors (ie: ASA) and heparin are not exclusion criteria. 10. Acute unresolved Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) 11. Interest in future fertility 12. History of any other malignancy other than skin cancer, or low grade bladder cancer which has been completely resected, within the previous 2 years. Patients that have had curative treatment of a previous malignancy and no recurrence of that malignancy within the past 2 years will be allowed. 13. Patients with peripheral arterial disease with intermittent claudication or Leriches Syndrome 14. Patients with diabetes who have evidence of complications from their diabetes, such as end organ sequelae of diabetes or Hemoglobin A1c &gt; 7%. 15. History of any major rectal or pelvic surgery or radiotherapy 16. History of ulcerative colitis or other chronic inflammatory conditions affecting rectum (includes rectal fistula, anal stenosis) 17. Documented clinical prostatitis requiring therapy within 6 months prior to Treatment 18. History of urethral and bladder outlet disorders, including urethral stricture disease, urethral diverticulae, bladder neck contracture, urethral fistulae, urethral stenting, urethral sling, urethroplasty or chronic indwelling urethral catheter 19. Patients with artificial urinary sphincter or any penile implant 20. Severe neurogenic bladder 21. Untreated bladder stones 22. History of acute urinary retention within the last 12 months 23. Active untreated gross hematuria for any cause 24. Post Void Residual (PVR) bladder volume &gt; 250 mL 25. Obstructing median lobe enlarged out of proportion to the rest of the prostate and protruding significantly into the bladder, sometimes referred to as "ball valve" median lobe, determined on Baseline MRI 26. Any prostate related investigational therapy within 6 months of Visit 1 27. History of Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis 28. History of drug abuse 29. Known infectious disease including HIV positivity or AIDSrelated illness, HBV and HCV 30. Current unilateral or bilateral hydronephrosis 31. Allergy or contraindications to administration of the GI antispasmodic drug: 1. Patients in the USA: Glucagon 2. Patients in Canada and Europe: Buscopan (Hyoscine) 32. Contraindications to administration of gadoliniumbased MRI contrast agent (e.g. Magnevist), such as chronic, severe kidney disease, acute kidney injury, history of Sickle Cell Disease, history of anemia, or intolerance/allergy to the contrast agent 33. Other severe, acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results</criteria>
