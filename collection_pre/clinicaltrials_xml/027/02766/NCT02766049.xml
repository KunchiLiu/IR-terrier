	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to assess tolerability and safety of three different formulations of an anti-HIV immunotherapy based on autologous dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with HIV chemically inactivated with Aldrithiol™-2 (AT-2). Patients were chronically infected with HIV, naïve for antiretroviral drugs. A possible immunological and virological favorable impact was also assessed.</brief_summary>
