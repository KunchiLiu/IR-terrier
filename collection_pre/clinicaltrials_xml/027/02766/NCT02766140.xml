	<brief_summary>The present trial will be performed to evaluate whether SHR1020 in combination with docetaxel in patients with Local Advanced or Metastatic or recurrent Non Squamous NSCLC is more effective as compared to placebo in combination with docetaxel. A secondary aim is to obtain safety information as well as information on quality of life of patients treated with SHR1020 in combination with docetaxel.</brief_summary>
