	<brief_summary>Treatment of complex unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA) remains challenging to date. Therefore, advanced techniques are required to achieve an optimal result in treating these patients safely. In this study, the safety and efficacy of rapid ventricular pacing (RVP) to facilitate microsurgical clip-reconstruction has been studied prospectively in a joined neurosurgical, anesthesiological and cardiological study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment of complex unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA) remains challenging to date. Therefore, advanced techniques are required to achieve an optimal result in treating these patients safely. In this study, the safety and efficacy of rapid ventricular pacing (RVP) to facilitate microsurgical clip-reconstruction has been studied prospectively in a joined neurosurgical, anesthesiological and cardiological study. Patients with complex UIA were prospectively enrolled and the safety and efficacy of RVP were evaluated recording cardiovascular events and outcome of the patients as well as the amount of aneurysm occlusion after the surgical clip-reconstruction procedure.</detailed_description>
