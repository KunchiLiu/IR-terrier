	<brief_summary>Long surgical wait-times and limited hospital capacity are common obstacles to surgical care in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Ambulatory surgery might offer a solution to these problems. The aim is to study the introduction of ambulatory surgery in a pediatric hospital in SSA. This is a cross-sectional descriptive study which took place over 6 months. It includes all the patients assigned to ambulatory surgery in the Pediatric University Hospital in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.</brief_summary>
