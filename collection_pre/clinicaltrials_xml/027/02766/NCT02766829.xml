	<brief_title>Comparison of Successful Spinal Needle Placement Between Crossed Leg Sitting Position and Traditional Sitting Position</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approval from Ethical Committee of Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia was acquired prior conducting the study. Subjects were given informed consent before enrolling the study. Subjects were randomly divided into CLSP Group for crossed leg sitting position (n=105) and TSP Group for traditional sitting position (n=106). Non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitor, eletrocardiography (ECG), oxygen nasal cannula and pulse-oxymetry was set on the subjects in the operation room. Baseline information was recorded. Spinal anesthesia was done by anesthesiology registrars that have done 50 spinal anesthesia procedures and have been explained about the protocol of spinal anesthesia injection in this study (to avoid bias). Outcome measures were the number of successful spinal needle placement in the first attempt, the difficulty level of landmark palpation for injection, and the number of needle-bone contact. Data was analyzed by SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Scientist) using Chi-Square test, Fisher Exact test, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Significance value used was 5% with 80% power.</detailed_description>
