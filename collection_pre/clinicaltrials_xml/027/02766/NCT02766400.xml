	<brief_summary>Individuals with cognitive impairments after stroke sustain significant disability in their daily tasks, and account for a significant proportion of stroke-related healthcare costs. This loss of independence is costly because individuals with stroke-related cognitive impairments require more rehabilitation and more resources to support their living, whether in institutional or community settings. The proposed study examines the effects of directed and guided training on the recovery of independence with daily activities in adults with stroke-related cognitive impairments in acute rehabilitation. The investigators predict that patients in both groups will demonstrate significant improvement in independence with daily activities in the first 12 months after rehabilitation admission, but that patients who receive guided training will demonstrate significantly more improvements than patients who received directed training.</brief_summary>
