	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Solely For Liver Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a potential role to systematically implement MRI to establish appropriate workflow of the implementation for tumor motion management in liver SBRT. Compared to CT, MRI has many significant advantages for radiotherapy planning, including superior tumor and soft-tissue contrast, flexible imaging orientation, freedom from radiation exposure and real-time imaging. MRI solely based liver SBRT will allow for more precise delineation of target volume, less uncertainties in treatment planning, better motion management, and potentially better treatment outcome</detailed_description>
