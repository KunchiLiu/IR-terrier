	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy and safety of an experimental drug, demcizumab, when given in combination with pembrolizumab. Demcizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody and was developed to target cancer stem cells. Demcizumab may block the growth of cancer stem cells, the remaining cancer cells, and it may also impair the productive growth of new blood vessels, which tumors need to grow and spread. This study is sponsored by OncoMed Pharmaceuticals, which is referred to as OncoMed or the Sponsor in this consent form.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1b Study of Demcizumab Plus Pembrolizumab in Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, Phase 1b dose escalation and expansion study of demcizumab plus pembrolizumab designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of demcizumab in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This study consists of a screening period, a treatment period and a post-treatment follow up period in which patients will be followed for survival for approximately 12 months. Patients will be enrolled in two stages: a dose-escalation stage and an expansion phase. Approximately 42 patients will be enrolled in this study at approximately 10 study centers in the United States (U.S) and Europe.</detailed_description>
