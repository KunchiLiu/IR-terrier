	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of gabapentin relative to tramadol for the treatment of chronic, neuropathic or mixed pain in the paediatric population. Children from 3 months to less than 18 years of age experiencing moderate to severe chronic pain will receive either gabapentin or tramadol for 15 weeks. The difference in average pain scores between treatment arms at the end of the treatment period will be assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Compare Gabapentin to Tramadol in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gabapentin is indicated for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain in adults. In the absence of specific paediatric studies, it is not approved for the same condition in children. The paediatric use of gabapentin is hampered by a) the lack of a suitable paediatric formulation, b) the significant variability of gabapentin PK profile and c) efficacy and safety data in this specific population. The GABA-1 study is designed to demonstrate the efficacy of gabapentin oral solution relative to tramadol and to document the PK and safety profile of gabapentin in this indication. GABA-1 is a non-inferiority trial because gabapentin is expected to be equally effective but better tolerated than tramadol, thus providing a clinical benefit to affected children.</detailed_description>
