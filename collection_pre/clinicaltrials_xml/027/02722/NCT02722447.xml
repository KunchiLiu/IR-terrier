	<brief_summary>The treatment of isolated distal deep vein thrombosis remains one of the most debated issues in the field of venous thromboembolism and only very few studies have directly addressed the issue of treatment in objectively confirmed isolated distal deep vein thrombosis. Aim of this study is to assess the long-term risk of recurrent venous thrombotic events in patients with a first acute symptomatic isolated distal deep vein thrombosis of the leg treated with a standard (12 weeks) or with a shorter (6 weeks) duration of therapy with rivaroxaban.</brief_summary>
