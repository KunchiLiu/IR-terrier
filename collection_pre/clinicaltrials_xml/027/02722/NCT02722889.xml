	<brief_summary>Aim of this study is to measure length of the ascending aorta in adults and to investigate the clinical implication of 'elongation' of the aorta.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aortic Elongation and Dissection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regarding to aortic geometry, attention is often drawn to aortic diameters since an increase in these diameters (e.g. aneurysm) can lead to life-threatening complications such as dissection and/or rupture. In daily practice however (e.g. imaging reports), the investigators often encounter patients with elongation of the ascending aorta. Little is known about the length of the proximal aorta. Furthermore, the clinical implications of an elongated aorta are unknown.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Underwent recent (&lt;6 years) contrastenhanced CT scan which allows for segmentation and assessment of aortic geometry. Age &lt;18 years old. Prior thoracic, cardiac or aortic surgery. Genetic disease with cardiac and/or aortic involvement (e.g. Marfan's disease). Infectious disease of the aorta. Malignant disease with involvement of heart and/or aorta.</criteria>
