	<brief_title>Randomized Trial of G-CSF Alone Versus Intermediate-dose Ara-C Plus G-CSF Mobilization in Hodgkin's Lymphoma or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (autoHSCT) is a standard treatment of eligible patients suffering from Hodgkin's Lymphoma or non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (HL, NHL). AutoHSCT allows to further improve results of the therapy. Nowadays, 99% of the procedures are performed using peripheral blood as a source of stem cells. Hence, the crucial point is to harvest adequate number of stem cells allowing hematopoietic recovery. The number of 2 Ã— 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg is considered the minimal level in autoHSCT. There are two main mobilization strategies being used: based on G-CSF alone or in combination with chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide (CY) at dose range 1.6 g/m2 is mainly used in HL and NHL setting). However, a proportion of patients (5-40%) fail to collect the minimum number of cells required. Novel agents, like plerixafor, CXCR4 inhibitor, may enable effective CD34+ cell harvest in "poor mobilizers". Nevertheless, the optimal first-line and cost-effective protocol for mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells has not been determined so far. Randomized trials compare chemomobilization with the use of CY + G-CSF to G-CSF alone, which had been conducted so far, did not demonstrate clear advantage of addition of CY to the growth factor. Intermediate-dose cytosine arabinoside (AraC), 1.6 g/m2 plus filgrastim, has been shown to produce very high efficacy as a first or second-line mobilization regimen in patients with lymphoid malignancies. In a retrospective comparison, this strategy was significantly more effective than CY + G-CSF. This suggest that the type of chemotherapy agent added to G-CSF may play role in mobilization efficacy and that the combination of AraC and G-CSF may be more effective than G-CSF used alone. The goal of current study is to verify this hypothesis in randomized controlled trial.</detailed_description>
