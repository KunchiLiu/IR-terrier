	<brief_title>Resuscitation Registry - Surrogate Markers of Outcome After Cardiac Arrest</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to determine surrogate markers for prognostication of unfavorable outcome (death or persistent vegetative state) in cardiopulmonary arrest survivors. These patients are comatose. Conscious patients are unsuitable for prognostication. This will be a prospective mono-center survey (Department of Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital Bern), evaluating the survival and neurological outcome after cardiac arrest. The study will be performed in cooperation with the Department of Neurology and Neuroradiology, University Hospital Bern. Inclusion: all patients surviving resuscitation after cardiac arrest older than 18 years. Detailed medical and neurological examination including 6-lead continuous EEG, 10/20 EEG and somatosensory evoked potentials, standard blood tests including Neuron-specific Enolase (NSE) and cerebral MRI will be assessed during the first 72 hours after cardiac arrest. Structured telephone interviews to determine outcome parameters (Cerebral Performance Category CPC, modified Ranking Scale mRS) will take place at day 30, after 3 and 12 month. The results of the registry could identify early comatose patients after cardiac arrest with no chance of a good neurological recovery and regain consciousness to avoid unjustified expectations of relatives and prolonged life-sustaining therapies. A good neurological recovery is defined as a CPC of 1 and 2 or a mRS 0-2. An unfavourable neurological outcome will be defined as persistent vegetative state and death (CPC 4 and 5, mRS 5-6).</detailed_description>
