	<brief_summary>In this prospective study different methods of haemoglobin measurement in term and preterm neonates are compared with the gold standard. Non-invasive haemoglobin measurement with the Radical-7速 (SpHb, Masimo速), point-of-care haemoglobin-measurement (HcHb, HemoCue@, Radiometer), blood-gas-analysis (BGAHb,ABL800速, Radiometer) are compared with haemoglobin measurement by an automated hematology analyzer (labHb, Siemens Advia速).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care unit or to a normal neonatal ward are enrolled in the study, if parents have given their written informed consent. Non-invasive SpHb measurements are recorded prior to routine venous sampling. Routine venous sampling includes labHb and BGAHb. Additionally HcHb is taken from the routine venous sampling (HcHbart/ven) and from an additionally capillary puncture of earlobe or heel (HcHbcap). Every neonate can participate in two measurements.</detailed_description>
