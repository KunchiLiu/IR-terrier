	<brief_summary>Bronchiectasis is a result of chronic inflammation compounded by an inability to clear mucoid secretions. Inflammation results in progressive destruction of the normal lung architecture, in particular the elastic fibers of bronchi. Currently there is no effective drug for bronchiectasis. This study intends to carry out an open, single-center, non-randomized, self control phase I/II clinical trial. During the treatment, bronchial basal cells (BCCs) will be isolated from patients' own bronchi by bronchoscopic brushing and expanded in vitro. Cultured cells will be injected directly into the lesion by fiberoptic bronchoscopy after lavage. After six-month observation, the investigators will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the treatment by measuring the key indicator-- the CT imaging of dilated bronchi as well as four secondary indicators including the pulmonary function, laboratory factor level, incidence of acute exacerbation and the patients' self-evaluation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Bronchial Basal Cells Transplantation for Treatment of Bronchiectasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bronchiectasis is a term for irreversible lung damage resulting from recurrent episodes of infection and inflammation. Bronchial basal cells (BCCs) have been proven with stem cell activity to regenerate bronchi and repair lung damage. In this single-center, non-randomized, self control phase I/II clinical trial, patients' own BCCs will be grown in laboratory before injected to the damaged part of lung tissue. Transplanted BCCs have the potential to replenish the bronchial epithelium and reconstruct respiratory architecture.</detailed_description>

Subjects with a history of mental illness or suicide risk, with a history of epilepsy or other central nervous system disorders. Subjects with severe arrhythmias (such as ventricular tachycardia, frequent superventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter, etc.) or cardiac degree II or above conduction abnormalities displayed via 12lead ECG. Subjects with a history of alcohol or illicit drug abuse. Subjects accepted by any other clinical trials within 3 months before the enrollment. Subjects with poor compliance, difficult to complete the study. Any other conditions that might increase the risk of subjects or interfere with the clinical trial.</criteria>
