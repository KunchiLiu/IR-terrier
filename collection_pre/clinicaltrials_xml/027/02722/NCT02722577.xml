	<brief_title>EGM Analysis in Idiopathic Outflow Tract Ventricular Arrhythmia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study aims to evaluate the predictive value of using reversed polarity in adjacent bipolar EGMs (bi-RP method) and unipolar EGM with QS morphology (uni-QS method) for identifying successful ablation site, and evaluate the feasibility of enhancing uni-QS method's performance by using its morphology characteristics such as descending slope and symmetry.</detailed_description>
