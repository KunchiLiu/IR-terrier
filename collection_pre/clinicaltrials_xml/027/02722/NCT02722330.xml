	<brief_title>Evaluation of Cochlear Baha 5 SuperPower Sound Processor on the Baha Attract System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Cochlear Baha bone conduction hearing implant offers two alternative ways to transmit vibrations from the external sound processor to the osseointegrated implant: The Baha Connect System uses a skin-penetrating abutment and allows direct bone conduction. The Baha Attract System uses a magnetic connection through intact skin. Magnetic bone conduction hearing implants have the advantage over skin-penetrating systems of eliminating the daily cleaning of the site and are perceived as a more cosmetically appealing by some subjects. With modern sound processor technology, it is possible to obtain good sound transmission despite the soft tissue attenuation that is inherent to magnetic bone conduction hearing implants. Clinical investigations have shown that the Baha Attract System, when used in combination with existing head-worn sound processors within the Premium (e.g. BP100, Baha 4 Sound Processors) and Power (BP110 Sound processor) segments, provides good hearing outcomes in subjects with conductive and mild mixed hearing loss. The Cochlear Baha 5 SuperPower Sound Processor is the first head-worn sound processor within the Super Power segment and has a fitting range of 65 dBHL. It is CE marked and is intended for subjects with mixed hearing loss or single-sided sensorineural deafness (SSD). It can be used with the Baha Connect and Baha Attract Systems and with a Baha Softband. When used in combination with the Baha Attract System, it will be able to compensate for a larger sensorineural component than the current Premium and Power sound processors and, hence, will allow more subjects to benefit from the Baha Attract System. The combination Baha Attract System with Baha 5 SuperPower Sound Processor is the most powerful non-skin penetrating bone conduction hearing implant solution available today. The Baha 5 SuperPower Sound Processor includes discreet design, advanced signal processing and improved connectivity to external sound sources. The new sound processor supports Cochlear's 2.4 GHz wireless protocol and is programmable with a new version of the Baha 5 Fitting Software. The aim of this clinical investigation is to evaluate objective and subjective hearing performance with the Cochlear Baha 5 SuperPower Sound Processor on the Baha Attract System, compared to the unaided hearing performance. Comparison of audiological test results with the same sound processor on a Baha Softband will also be performed. Short term safety parameters will be collected.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult subjects â‰¥ 18 years of age Mixed hearing loss in the ear to be implanted. Bone conduction thresholds with pure tone average (PTA4, Mean of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4kHz) of 3055 dBHL or Singlesided sensorineural deafness: Bone conduction thresholds with a pure tone average [PTA4, Mean of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz] of lower or 30 dBHL in the best ear. Subjects who have, for some reason, experienced no or limited benefit from other sound processors when tested on a Baha Softband. Subjects suitable for surgery according to the recommended surgical procedure for Cochlear Baha 5 SuperPower with no previous implant on the side to be investigated. Signed inform consent. Subject scheduled for simultaneous bilateral implant surgery. The investigation is limited to subjects with unilateral use of the Investigational device (however, bilateral hearing loss is not an exclusion criterion). Suitable implant position for the BI300 Implant (4 mm or 3 mm) not found during surgery due to insufficient bone quality and/or bone thickness Less than 3 mm soft tissue thickness at the planned implant site. (Intraoperative exclusion criteria judged by the surgeon at Visit 1 or Visit 2 according to local practice). Subjects that have received radiation therapy at the same side of the skull where the Investigational device will be positioned. Uncontrolled diabetes as judged by the investigator. Condition that could jeopardise osseointegration and/or wound healing (e.g. osteoporosis, psoriasis and longterm systemic use of corticosteroids) or condition that may have an impact on the outcome of the investigation as judged by the investigator. Unable to follow investigational procedures, e.g. to complete quality of life scales. Participation in another clinical investigation with pharmaceutical and/or device.</criteria>
