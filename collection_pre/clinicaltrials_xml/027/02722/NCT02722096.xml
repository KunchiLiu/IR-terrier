	<brief_summary>Recommended by the KDOQI vascular access guidelines, antebrachial arteriovenous fistula is the best primary vascular access for hemodialysis in patients with end stage renal disease. The primary complications are common, of the order of 10-36 %, including lack of maturation and dominated by stenosis and thrombosis. Local anesthesia associated with sedation is a validated method of anesthesia for made arteriovenous fistula but does not cause the motor block and not blocking vasospasm, deleterious to the surgery. Multiple injections necessary to cover the operating zone expose patient to pain and to intravascular injection of local anesthetics. Regional anesthesia provides better conditions for realize more distal fistula. Sympathetic block provides arterial, venous vasodilation and decreases the incidence of vasospasm . It enables an increased flow rate at an early time fistula and faster maturation. However, studies included low numbers of patient or are non-randomized. They cannot concluded a significant difference in the complication rate of arteriovenous fistula at an early time depending on the type of anesthesia . This study aims to demonstrate that axillary block for surgical creation of arteriovenous fistula allows a reduction of complications at 6 weeks compared to local anesthesia</brief_summary>
