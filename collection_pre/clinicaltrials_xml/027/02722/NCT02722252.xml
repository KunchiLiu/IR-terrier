	<brief_summary>The centre for Medically-Assisted Procreation (MAP) of Dijon CHU has two high-technology embryo culture systems, with incubation characteristics that are potentially superior to those provided by classical culture systems. Indeed, these two systems, available in only two MAP centres in France, make it possible to maintain a stable temperature and gaseous environment during the in-vitro development of the embryos. It is necessary to observe the development of the embryos to determine which embryos have the highest implantation potential. These observations are done from time to time by microscope for one system and continuously using an incorporated video camera for the other (cinematographic study). The MAP centre in Dijon wishes to compare the interest of these two systems.</brief_summary>
