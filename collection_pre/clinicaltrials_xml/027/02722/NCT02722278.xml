	<brief_title>A Study of Oral Testosterone Undecanoate (TU) in Hypogonadal Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, Phase 3, randomized, open-label, active-comparator group, efficacy (based on Cavg of T), and safety study in adult hypogonadal male subjects. Enrollment is based on criteria designed to select the general population of hypogonadal men. Study drug doses will be titrated using a dose-titration algorithm based on total T Cavg. Subjects may be androgen treatment-naïve or washed out of prior androgen replacement therapies. Subjects must have 2 total T levels &lt; 300 ng/dL based on 2 blood samples obtained in the morning (AM) on 2 separate days approximately 7 days apart. Approximately 180 subjects will be randomly assigned to receive open-label treatment in a 3:1 ratio of oral TU to Axiron (ie, approximately 135 subjects will be randomly assigned to oral TU and approximately 45 subjects will be randomly assigned to Axiron topical solution). Subjects who complete the study will receive 105 days of treatment. Serial pharmacokinetics (PK) samples over 24 hours will be obtained after 21, 56 and 105 days of treatment. Dose titrations will be based on the T Cavg on day 21 and 56 of treatment. A subset of 30 subjects will participate in a cosyntropin stimulation test. Subjects will receive an injection of cosyntropin on Day 1 (before administration of study drug) and Day 106 after the last 24-hour PK sample has been drawn. Cortisol assay will be collected immediately before the injection, as well as 30 and 60 minutes after the injection.</detailed_description>
