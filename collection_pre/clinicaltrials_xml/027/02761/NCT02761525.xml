	<brief_title>Topical Application of Silver Nanoparticles and Oral Pathogens in Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients were performed with oral hygiene as recommended by the clinical practice guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia associated with mechanical ventilation. After that, placed the treatment of an innocuous gel compound with 12ppm of silver nanoparticles or gel alone according to randomization. Then obtain and plant samples taken before the treatment 6 hours after. Comparing the results of the baseline sample with the final.</detailed_description>
