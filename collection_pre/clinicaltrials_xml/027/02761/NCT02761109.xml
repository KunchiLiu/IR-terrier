	<brief_summary>Incidence and risk factors for renal, cardiovascular and pulmonary complications after liver transplantation are not well defined. Blood products requirement is an important aspect of orthotropic liver transplantation (OLTx) management and has a great impact on patient's outcome. Transfusions of blood products increase perioperative complications and reduce graft and patients survival. The primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate the incidence of renal complication during ICU stay after liver transplantation using RIFLE criteria; secondary endpoint is to evaluate the incidence of cardiovascular and pulmonary complications. In addition patients' survival and the relationship between blood components use with the development of post-operative complications are evaluated.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It is conducted a prospective observational cohort study in all Italian liver transplant centers. Adult (&gt; 18 years old) recipients of deceased liver graft between January 2011 and December 2013 were eligible for inclusion. Exclusion criteria were the use of living organ donation, retransplantation, pediatric transplantations, combined transplantation and fulminant hepatic failure. Investigators collected data using a prospectively maintained computer database managed by the Italian Ministry of Health "Centro Nazionale Trapianti". Anesthetic and perioperative management followed the routine local institution protocols.</detailed_description>
