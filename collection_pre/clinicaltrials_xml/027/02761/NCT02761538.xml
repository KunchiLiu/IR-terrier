	<brief_summary>The investigators developed the Aviitam® online platform. The purpose of the project is to test the medico-economic impact related to the utilization of the Aviitam online platform in primary care. Primary objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness at 24 months follow-up of the utilization of the Aviitam® online software in primary care for people with obesity and at least one comorbidity compared to a usual follow-up in primary care. Secondary objectives: Weight loss; quality of life ; blood pressure change; changes in lipid profile, blood glucose and HbA1c; physician satisfaction; patients satisfaction, profiling of patients and data mining analysis on the collected data. Method : Overweight &amp; obese patients with associated comorbidities will receive a 24 months follow-up to assess the impact of the use of the online platform Aviitam®. Practitioners will be randomized by lot between an Aviitam® group and a control group (usual care). A medico-economic analysis will be conducted with a cost-effectiveness analysis and a budget impact analysis. With no hypothesis on the primary endpoint, the calculation of the required number of subjects was based on the quality of life. 150 patients will be included per group Patients of the 2 groups will be assessed at baseline and after 24 months. The first day of each month, each patient included in the study will receive a questionnaire to fill online to evaluate their health care consumption in the previous month and the EQ5D questionnaire , a standardized questionnaire validated in French to assess the effects on health and to be used to calculate cost - utility. Expected results and perspectives Proving the effectiveness of the Aviitam® online program focused on non-drug therapies and therapeutic lifestyle changes for overweight and obesity management with reduced health costs, improvement in quality of life, reduction in weight and improvement of comorbidities. In terms of public health, the use of the platform Aviitam® can be expect to improve management of excess body weight and reduced health costs. Furthermore, Aviitam® could be a valuable tool to support healthcare professionals in outpatient therapeutic education approaches.</brief_summary>
