	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well cabozantinib-s-malate, crizotinib, volitinib, or sunitinib malate work in treating patients with kidney cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes or to other places in the body. Cabozantinib-s-malate, crizotinib, volitinib, and sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cabozantinib-S-Malate, Crizotinib, Volitinib, or Sunitinib Malate in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma (mPRCC) treated with sunitinib malate (sunitinib) to PFS in patients with mPRCC treated with MET kinase inhibitors. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) response rate (RR; defined as the combined rate of confirmed and unconfirmed partial response [PR] and complete response [CR]) in patients with mPRCC treated with sunitinib to RR in patients treated with putative MET inhibitors. II. To compare overall survival (OS) in patients with mPRCC treated with sunitinib to OS in patients with mPRCC treated with putative MET inhibitors. III. To compare the safety profile of sunitinib and putative MET inhibitors in patients with mPRCC. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the prognostic and predictive value of MET mutations, MET copy number or other markers of MET signaling in patients with mPRCC treated with putative MET inhibitors. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive sunitinib malate orally (PO) on days 1-28. ARM II: Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate PO on days 1-42. ARM III: Patients receive crizotinib PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-42. ARM IV: Patients receive volitinib PO on days 1-42. In all arms, courses repeat every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed papillary histology renal cell carcinoma which is metastatic or locally advanced disease not amenable to surgical resection; (NOTE: a designation of type I or type II should be made by the local pathologist if possible); mixed histologies containing type I or type II will be allowed provided that they contain &gt;= 50% of the papillary component Patients must also have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension; disease Xrays, scans or physical examinations used for tumor measurement must have been completed within 28 days prior to registration; if there is clinical suspicion for bone metastases at the time of enrollment (at the discretion of the investigator), bone scan should be performed at baseline (within 42 days prior to registration); all disease must be assessed and documented on the Baseline Tumor Assessment form Patients with a history of treated brain metastases who are asymptomatic and have not received steroid therapy in the 14 days prior to registration are eligible; antiseizure medications are allowed provided they are nonenzyme inducing (e.g. topiramate, levetiracetam, gabapentin) Patients must not have cavitating pulmonary lesions; patients must not have tumor invading the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or evidence of endotracheal or endobronchial tumor within 28 days prior to registration Patients may have received prior surgery; at least 28 days must have elapsed since surgery and patient must have recovered from any adverse effects of surgery Patients may have received up to one prior systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma; if a patient develops metastatic disease within six months of discontinuation of adjuvant therapy, this will constitute one prior systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC); if a patient develops metastatic disease and more than six months has elapsed since discontinuation of adjuvant therapy, this will not constitute prior systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic RCC; patients must not have received a MET/hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) inhibitor or sunitinib as prior therapy; at least 14 days must have elapsed since completion of prior systemic therapy; patients must have recovered from all associated toxicities at the time of registration Patients may have received prior radiation therapy, but must have measurable disease outside the radiation port; at least 14 days must have elapsed since completion of prior radiation therapy; patients must have recovered from all associated toxicities at the time of registration Patients must not be taking, nor plan to take while on protocol treatment, strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, fluvoxamine, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir) and/or strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, rifampin, rifabutin) within 14 days prior to randomization; moderate inhibitors or inducers of isoenzyme CYP3A4 should be avoided, but if necessary can be used with caution Patients must not be receiving or planning to receive any other investigational agents Patients must have a complete physical examination and medical history within 28 days prior to registration Patients must have a Zubrod performance status of 0 1 White blood cell count (WBC) &gt;= 2,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,000/mcL Platelet count &gt;= 75,000/mcL Serum bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limits of normal (ULN) Serum transaminase (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]/aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]/alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) must be =&lt; 2.5 x the institutional ULN unless the liver is involved with the tumor, in which case serum transaminase (SGOT/SGPT) must be =&lt; 5 x the institutional ULN Serum creatinine must be =&lt; 2 x the institutional ULN OR creatinine clearance (either measured or calculated) must be &gt; 30 mL/min Patients must not have any clinical evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF) (specifically, New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III [moderate] or class IV [severe]) at the time of registration; baseline echocardiogram within 28 days of registration must demonstrate an ejection fraction (EF) &gt;= 50%; patients must have corrected QT (QTc) interval &lt; 500 msec on prestudy electrocardiogram (EKG) and no known history of congenital long QT syndrome; patients must not have experienced unstable angina pectoris, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias, or stroke (transient ischemic attack [TIA] or other ischemic event) within 3 months prior to registration and not have experienced myocardial infarction or thromboembolic event requiring anticoagulation within 6 months of registration; prestudy EKG must be obtained within 28 days prior to registration Baseline urinalysis should show urine protein &lt; 3+ and must be obtained within 28 days prior to registration; if urine protein is 3+ or greater, then urine protein by 24 hour collection must show less than 3 grams of protein Patients must not have inadequately controlled hypertension;
