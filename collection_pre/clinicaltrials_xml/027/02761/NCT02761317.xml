	<brief_summary>The study compares the efficacy of bowel cleansing between the standard preparation (2 L polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution, 2 L PEG-ELS), low-volume preparation (10 mg bisacodyl plus 2 L PEG-ELS) and high-volume preparation (4 L PEG-ELS) in patients with previous colorectal resection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimal Bowel Preparation Regimen in Patients With Colorectal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colonoscopy is the standard approach for evaluating the colon currently. Thorough bowel cleansing is critical for adequate visualization of colonic mucosa during colonoscopy. Inadequate bowel cleansing results in adverse consequences for the examination, including lower adenoma detection rates, longer procedural time, lower cecal intubation rates, shorter intervals between examinations and an estimated 12-22% increase in overall colonoscopy cost. A history of colorectal resection represents an independent predictor for inadequate colon cleansing,hence strategies to improve bowel preparation may be a demanding goal in this subset of patients. The study compares the efficacy of bowel cleansing between the standard preparation (2 L polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution, 2 L PEG-ELS), low-volume preparation (10 mg bisacodyl plus 2 L polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution) and high-volume preparation (4L polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution, 4L PEG-ELS) in patients with previous colorectal resection. Then the investigators can select the optimized regimen for patients with colorectal surgery.</detailed_description>
