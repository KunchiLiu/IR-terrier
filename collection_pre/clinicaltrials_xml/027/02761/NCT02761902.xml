	<brief_summary>The study is designed to investigate normal polysomnographic respiratory values of Chinese healthy children and adolescents. By collecting the polysomnography (PSG) data and parameters of respiratory and sleep architectureï¼Œwe hope to characterize normal polysomnography values in Chinese children and adolescents and to establish respiratory reference values for pediatric polysomnography which based on Chinese children's data.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We plan to recruit 200 healthy, normal children and adolescents in this study, age ranging from 3 to 15 years. All of them will be invited to undergo an overnight polysomnography for at least 7h in Beijing Children's Sleep Center, meanwhile the parameters about sleep including EEG, electromyography, electrooculography, ECG, pulse oximetry arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), chest wall and abdomen motion, oral and nasal airflow, and end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2) will be recorded. Based on the data we hope to give recommendation of normal PSG parameters of Chinese kids, and on this basis,to develop the diagnosis creteria for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome which will be more suitable for Chinese children conditions.</detailed_description>
