	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to measure the expression of HOXA10 and HOXA11 in the endometrium of infertility patients with an endometrial polyp before and after polypectomy. HOXA10 and HOXA11 are well-established markers of implantation. It is uncertain as to whether an endometrial polyp interferes with embryo implantation. A higher expression of HOXA10 and HOXA11 after polypectomy can indicate that endometrial polyp does interfere with embryo implantation.</brief_summary>
