	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Alone Versus Dose-dense Temozolomide Followed by Bevacizumab for Recurrent Glioblastoma, Phase III</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glioblastoma (GBM), the most frequent malignant primary brain tumor, has yet been incurable despite recent progress on its standard of care using TMZ as the main trunk of initial therapy in the newly diagnosed setting. One of the main reasons accounting for the dismal prognosis would attribute to lack of active therapeutic regimens at recurrence. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against cardinal angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has recently shown efficacy for recurrent GBM, and has been approved in Japan, thereby being a standard care for recurrent GBM. Since there is no effective drugs or regimens developed at bevacizumab failure, insertion of another active drug prior to bevacizumab induction would enhance survival time for patients with recurrent GBM. In Japan, there are currently only few chemotherapeutic agents approved and available for GBM. Among them rechallenge with alternating dosing of TMZ have shown certain efficacy with acceptable toxicities for patients with TMZ-pretreated recurrent GBM, thus being a good candidate for the regimen used prior to bevacizumab at recurrence. The present proposal of sequential administration of dose dense TMZ (7/14d) followed by bevacizumab wishes to define a new standard of care for recurrent disease and hopes to identify the subgroups of patients with progressive or recurrent glioblastoma that respond particularly well to dose-dense temozolomide regimens. This study is carried out as a JCOG Brain Tumor Study Group multicenter randomized phase III trial under approval by Advanced Medical Care B system, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan.</detailed_description>
