	<brief_summary>The purpose of prospective cohort study is to describe the developmental profile of refraction change in a large cohort of Chinese CC patients. The decisive factors to the range of myopic shift in unilateral CC appeared to be different from that in bilateral CC, indicating dramatic differences in the etiopathogenesis and refractive prognosis between bilateral and unilateral CC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Developmental Profile of Ocular Refraction in Patients With Congenital Cataract</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The refractive status is crucial to visual function and may change throughout life. For patients with congenital cataract (CC), the developmental profile of refraction is complicated due to the potential influences of diverse clinical manifestations and various treatments, and has not yet been fully characterized. The investigator described the developmental profile of refraction change in a large cohort of Chinese CC patients. The decisive factors to the range of myopic shift in unilateral CC appeared to be different from that in bilateral CC, indicating dramatic differences in the etiopathogenesis and refractive prognosis between bilateral and unilateral CC. The refraction data from CC patients provided in the study are of clinical significance to the guidelines for CC treatment, especially for IOL calculation concerning the laterality of CC.</detailed_description>
