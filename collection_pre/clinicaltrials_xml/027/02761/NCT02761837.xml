	<brief_summary>The Breathe Well Study is a pragmatic, controlled trial to assess the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and implementation of the Breathe Well intervention, which combines evidence-based EHR and interactive behavior-change technologies (IBCT) and team-based care to improve asthma outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Breathe Well Program for Adults With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breathe Well uses the Kaiser Permanente Electronic Health Record (EHR) to identify asthma exacerbation risk factors. For patients with a history of frequent exacerbations or B-agonist overuse, the EHR notifies a nurse who uses an EHR-generated tailored clinical report and patient directed decision support tool to engage and empower patients to develop an action plan in collaboration with providers. EHR-templated notes and order sets facilitate care plan execution. Poor controller medication adherence or unaddressed smoking results in the patient being automatically enrolled in an IBCT medication refill or smoking cessation program. Breathe Well uses multiple EHR functions and a patient and provider team to address barriers to evidence-based asthma care for providers (therapeutic inertia, insufficient time), patients (poor adherence, smoking), and systems (challenges with data, monitoring, communication, and medication refill).The study will be conducted in 26 primary care clinics of Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO) using a cluster-randomized pragmatic clinical trial design. More than 10,400 high-risk asthma patients will be assigned to Breathe Well or guideline-based usual care based on their clinic.</detailed_description>
