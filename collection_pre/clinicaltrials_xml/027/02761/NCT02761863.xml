	<brief_summary>This is a prospective study evaluating the effect of expression of CD74 and VEGF on outcome of treatment in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma receiving Pemetrexed/Platinum protocol. The paraffin blocks of the patients will be tested for CD74 and VEGF before starting treatment using IHC and the results will be correlated with the outcome of treatment during evaluation.</brief_summary>
