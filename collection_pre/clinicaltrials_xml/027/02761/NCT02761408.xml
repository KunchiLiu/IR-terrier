	<detailed_description>- One-site audit. The enrolled subject is confirmed by PIs ◦◦Source data is compared to external data sources medical records, either paper or electronic case report forms. - NCI CTCAE v5.0 for AE records - Patient recruitment according to inclusion criteria: 1. Newly diagnosed locally head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; 2. Apply for primary chemoradiation or adjuvant chemoradiation; 3. Signed informed consent - Sample size assessment: 60 subjects will be included in one year for total 120 subjects - Missing data to address situations where variables are reported as missing, unavailable, "non-reported," uninterpretable, or considered missing because of data inconsistency or out-of-range results - Fisher's exact test is for category comparison.
