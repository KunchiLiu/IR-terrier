	<brief_title>Post Approval Study of the Commercially Available U-Motion II+ Acetabular System and UTF Reduced Stem</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, single arm, multi-center, post-approval study designed to evaluate the short and long term clinical performance and safety in subjects receiving primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) with the U-Motion II+ Acetabular System and UTF Reduced Stem. The acetabular and femoral components will be uncemented. Study outcomes will be analyzed and published when 1.) all enrolled and implanted subjects complete their 6-week follow up, 2.) all implanted subjects complete their 2-year follow up, 3.) at the conclusion of the study. It is anticipated that up to 200 subjects will be enrolled at up to 5 sites. The subjects will be evaluated at predetermined intervals: baseline, procedure/ discharge and 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months post treatment for primary analysis and annually up to 5 years for device survivorship. The estimated study duration from first enrollment through completion of the final report is expected to be approximately 7 years. This study will be conducted at up to 5 investigational sites in the United States with previous clinical research experience and with adequate population of orthopedic patients requiring primary total hip arthroplasty.</detailed_description>
