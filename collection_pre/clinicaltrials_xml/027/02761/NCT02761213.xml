	<brief_title>Oral Sulfate Solution (SUPREP) Versus Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) Plus Ascorbic Acid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High-quality bowel cleansing is critical to effective colonoscopy. Studies in the past decade have demonstrated that many clinical practices continue to have rates of adequate preparation as low as 60% to 80%. Low-volume preparations for colonoscopy are designed to improve patient tolerability, another important aspect of bowel preparation. In addition, low-volume preparations should ideally not sacrifice efficacy. There are few data comparing the efficacy of available low-volume bowel preparations. In this study, we describe a prospective, single-blind, randomized, controlled trial comparing oral sulfate solution (OSS) (SUPREP, Braintree Laboratories, Braintree, Mass) with low-dose polyethylene glycol plus ascorbic acid (2-L PEG/Asc).</detailed_description>
