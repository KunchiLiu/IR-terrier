	<brief_summary>Resistant maltodextrin (RMD) is an indigestible water soluble fiber that increases fecal bulk by enhancing growth of specific microbial populations; however the effect of RMD on bifidobacteria and total fecal weight is not clear. The purpose of this research study is to determine whether incorporating about ¼ cup of a fiber supplement into the diet will induce beneficial changes in gastrointestinal function, the fecal microbiota profile (increased number of healthy bacteria in stool) and immune processes resulting in improved quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Resistant Maltodextrin Supplementation: Gastrointestinal Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. After obtaining informed consent, participants will be randomized to either consume 0, 15 or 25 grams of resistant maltodextrin (RMD) during the first arm of the study. During the first intervention period, participants will consume the RMD everyday for 3 weeks. After a 2-week post intervention period, participants will be crossed to one of the other treatments for 3 weeks, followed by a 2-week post intervention and then receive the final intervention for 3 weeks. Participants will complete daily questionnaires and weekly gastrointestinal symptom questionnaires during the intervention and post-intervention periods. Stool samples will be collected at the baseline and final time points of each intervention. Dietary intake will also be assessed weekly during each intervention period.</detailed_description>
