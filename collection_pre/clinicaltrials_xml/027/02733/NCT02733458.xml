	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine, etoposide, pegaspargase and dexamethasone (GELAD) chemotherapy and sandwiched radiotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with de novo stage IE/IIE extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GELAD Chemotherapy and Sandwiched Radiotherapy in the Treatment of Stage IE/IIE Natural Killer/T-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTCL), nasal type, is a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with relatively high incidence in China. Radiotherapy alone for stage IE/IIE diseases has good response rate but with high relapse rates, ranging from 20-50%. The combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy improved the long-term survival for patients with stage IE/IIE diseases. But the optimal treatment schedule has not been established. This study is designed with two cycles GELAD chemotherapy, followed by 50-56Gy radiotherapy, and completed with additional two cycles GELAD chemotherapy. The efficacy and safety of this sandwiched chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of stage IE/IIE ENKTCL will be measured.</detailed_description>
