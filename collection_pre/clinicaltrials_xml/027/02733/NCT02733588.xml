	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to test an optimized control system for sensor-guided (physician administered) delivery of glucagon, and test Proof-of-Concept (POC) in a clinical setting in patients with severe hypoglycemia following bariatric surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Delivery of G-Pump™ (Glucagon Infusion) From an OmniPod® to Prevent Hypoglycemia in Post-Bariatric Surgery Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2a, single-center, open-label, proof-of-concept study designed to test the ability of the control algorithm to detect and direct timing of G-Pump™ glucagon infused from an OmniPod® pump to prevent hypoglycemia in patients with post-bariatric hypoglycemia syndrome. While the algorithm will provide an alert as to when glucagon should be dosed to prevent hypoglycemia, there will be no automation in this clinical trial and it will ultimately be up to the physician to initiate dosing via the OmniPod® controller. Participant on continuous glucose monitoring will arrive at the clinic and IV line will be inserted for venous access. Subject will then be asked to drink a liquid mixed meal containing 60 g of carbohydrates, e.g. Boost® Nutritional Drink, over 10 minutes. Blood samples will be collected for glucose and hormone measurement. The open-loop system will be set to recognize low sensor glucose values, triggering an alert to the physician, who will deliver a bolus of 150 or 300 µg of glucagon via the pump, with the goal of preventing further decline in glucose values. Depending on response, a second bolus dose of 150 or 300 µg of glucagon may be administered. Plasma glucose will be measured after glucagon administration to ensure successful treatment and glucose stability, and glucagon levels will be analyzed concurrently to determine magnitude of increase above baseline. Sensors will be downloaded for subsequent analysis of appropriateness of alert timing and trigger for glucagon bolus delivery.</detailed_description>
