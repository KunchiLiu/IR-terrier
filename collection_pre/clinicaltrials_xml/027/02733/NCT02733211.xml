	<brief_summary>The MD-Logic Automated Insulin Delivery System is intended for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus for subcutaneous infusion of insulin and the continuous measurement of interstitial glucose to aid in the management of their diabetes. The product automatically adjusts basal insulin delivery and delivers correction boluses in response to real-time glucose measurements by CGM to maintain blood glucose within the desired range, to improve metabolic control without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. The proposed study is an open-label, two-center, randomized, cross-over study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of night closed-loop control using the MD-Logic automated insulin delivery system compared to sensor augmented pump therapy in poorly controlled patients with type 1 diabetes at home The objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 4 weeks glucose control using the MD-Logic System in individuals with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes at patient's home</brief_summary>

An allergy to contrast medium, use of other active medical devices and planned imaging Any significant diseases or conditions including psychiatric disorders and substance abuse that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to affect the subject's ability to complete the study, or compromise patient safety Diabetic ketoacidosis in the past 1 month Severe hypoglycemia six month prior to enrollment Current use of the following medications: medications that are used to lower blood glucose , Beta blockers, glucocorticoids and other medications, which in the judgment of the investigator would be a contraindication to participation in the study Subject is participating in another drug or device study that could affect glucose measurements or glucose management Female subject who is pregnant or breastfeeding or is planning to become pregnant within the planned study duration Not sufficient vision or hearing to recognize pump/sensor alarms or to perform Blood Glucoseself measurements 4times daily.
