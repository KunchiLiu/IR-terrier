	<brief_summary>Hypoglycemia is an increasingly recognized complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) that is poorly understood and difficult to treat. Investigators hypothesize that after RYGB some patients have incomplete carbohydrate absorption in the small intestine which leads to inconsistent glucose levels and hypoglycemia during oral consumption of a meal. Investigators further hypothesize that pancreatic enzyme supplementation with (Creon) during meals and snacks will improve carbohydrate absorption and lead to more stable glucose levels in patients with post-RYGB hypoglycemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CREON for the Treatment of Post-RYGB Hypoglycemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: Evaluate the feasibility and safety of Creon in the treatment of post-RYGB hypoglycemia as add-on therapy to a diet higher in protein and lower in carbohydrate. Secondary Objective: Evaluate utility of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in monitoring hypoglycemia as an adjunct to standard venous blood testing using a glucometer in post-RYGB hypoglycemia.</detailed_description>
