	<brief_summary>The control of diabetes is related both to food, treatment but also to physical activity. Despite these recommendations and these positive findings, patients are always sedentary because of brakes in the practice of a regular physical activity. It is therefore interesting to consider the representations of patients and particularly on the way of establishment in order to reach a goal. The Hope Theory highlights the hope as the sum of the will and means that an individual has to achieve its goals. Will be discussed in this study to identify a relationship between the level of hope for patients and their ability to permanently change their behavior in regular physical activity as part of the goals set during the week of therapeutic education patient.</brief_summary>
