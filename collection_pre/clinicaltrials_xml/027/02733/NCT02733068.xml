	<brief_title>A Phase III Study of Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18 Vaccine.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-centre, randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled study. The study vaccine is recombinant human papillomavirus bivalent (types 16 and 18) vaccine (Yeast), the placebo is aluminium phosphate diluent. This study planned to enrol 12000 healthy female aged 18-30 in 10 study sites. Each participants will received a three-dose schedule of vaccine or placebo randomly but with the proportion controlled as 1:1 for vaccine group and placebo group. After each inoculation, the immediate reaction will be observed for 30 minutes, and the local and systemic reaction will be systematically observed for 7 days. After the first inoculation, adverse event will be collected until one month after the final inoculation, while serious adverse event will be collected until 6 months after the final inoculation. Blood samples will be collected before the first inoculation, and one month after the final injection, blood samples will also be collected in a group of participants containing 800 people to detect antibody titer. Follow-up visit will be conducted 14 times: month 0, month 0 + 8 days, month 2, month 2 + 8 days, month 6, month 6 + 8 days, month 7, month 12, month 18, month 24, month 30, month 36, month 48, month 60.
