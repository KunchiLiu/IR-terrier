	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the utility of sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) block to manage ipsilateral shoulder pain (ISP) after thoracotomy. This will be an open label preliminary pilot study to determine if SPG block has potential utility to manage ISP in post-thoracotomy patients. The primary outcome variable will be reduction of shoulder pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block to Treat Shoulder Pain After Thoracotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label preliminary pilot study which will evaluate the utility of sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) block to manage ipsilateral shoulder pain (ISP). It will determine if SPG block has potential utility to manage ISP in post-thoracotomy patients One hundred (100) patients will initially be consented in this study. Patients have to develop ISP and have a pain VAS &gt;= 5. The study is seeking ten (10) eligible participants. Patients will be followed after the SPG block(s), and the duration of pain relief will be monitored by serial assessments of the VAS. This assessment will occur for the initial SPG block and for all follow-up blocks, if performed. The follow-up assessments will only involve having the patient rate the ISP using a verbal VAS; This will take less than a minute of patients time. In addition, all patients will have PRN access to standard systemic analgesics as routinely ordered by the surgical service Safety assessments will be performed on all subjects. Blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate will be obtained every 15 minutes after each SPG block for 90 minutes. Dr. Grant will monitor the subjects for 90 minutes after each SPG block.</detailed_description>
