	<brief_summary>Obesity if a health endemic problem over the entire world. Bariatric surgery is the best chance for those patients with morbid obesity to loss weight and to maintain the loosed weight. Metabolic surgery is the new name for bariatric surgery like sleeve gastrectomy and gastric by pass due to the recognized changes in the homeostasis of the hormonal secretion responsive to the hunger status. After sleeve gastrectomy we observe many patients with thrombus of the portal vein system. This phenomena may be attributed to changes in the portal flow due to devascularization of the great curvature of the stomach. The aim of the study is to compare the portal flow by intra-operative Doppler ultrasound before and after surgery of the two procedures as sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass, were the vascularization is not changed by the surgery.</brief_summary>
