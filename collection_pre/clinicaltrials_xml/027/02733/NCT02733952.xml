	<criteria>â€¢ Women in the reproductive age (20 40 years) diagnosed as having uterine fibroids who are consenting to have transabdominal myomectomy in the postmenstrual period diagnosed by: Clinical symptoms and signs: Abnormal uterine bleeding (menorrhagia or (and) metrorrhagia). Pain (dull aching lower abdominal pain or dysmenorrhea). Pressure symptoms (dyspareunia, dysuria, dyschezia or (and) backache). Progressive abdominal enlargement (abdominal swelling). All women with clinical presentation suggestive of uterine fibroid will undergo abdominal and transvaginal ultrasound to confirm the clinical diagnosis and to exclude patients with: Submucous uterine myomas. Cervical or supracervical myomas. Broad ligamentary and pedunculated myomas. Associated pelvic pathology. Ultrasound criteria of uterine fibroids of included patients: Maximum diameter of the largest fibroid is greater than 4cm. Maximum number of uterine myomas is not to be more than 5 myomas. Uterine fibroid may be subserous or intramural. Obesity (body mass index &gt;30 kg/m2). Cardiac, endocrine, pulmonary or hematological disease (including anemia; hemoglobin level below 10gm/dl). Patients known to be allergic to tranexamic acid. Patients who received preoperative hormonal therapy (such as a GnRH analogue). Patients presented by or with suspected malignant gynecological disease. Patients diagnosed as having submucous uterine fibroids, cervical or supracervical fibroids, broad ligamentary fibroids and pedunculated fibroids. Patients with contraindication to general anaesthesia. Patients with positive pregnancy test. Virgin patients.</criteria>
