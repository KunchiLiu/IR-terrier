	<brief_summary>A premarket, international multicenter, prospective, open label, adaptive, randomized controlled study. The aim is to evaluate the efficacy of sensor augmented pump therapy with MiniMed™640G and SmartGuard™in preventing hypoglycemic events in comparison with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy in type 1 diabetes adults with an increased risk of hypoglycemia. The primary objective is to demonstrate a reduction in the mean number of hypoglycemic events when using the MiniMed™640G system with SmartGuard™ and the secondary objectives will aim at evaluating the difference in glycemic parameters and HbA1c.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age 2475 years old at time of screening. Diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes ≥10 years prior to screening. On pump therapy for ≥ 6 months prior to screening. Not on Real Time continuous glucose monitoring for ≥ 3 months prior to screening. HbA1c value ≥5.8% and ≤10.0% as assessed by local lab ≤ 15 days prior to screening or performed at screening. A documented Severe Hypoglycemia event ≤ 12 months prior to screening, OR Clarke score ≥4 assessed at time of screening, OR Gold score ≥4 assessed at time of screening. Subject is willing to sign and date informed consent, comply with all study procedures and wear all study devices as required during the study. Untreated Addison's disease, thyroid disorder, growth hormone deficiency, hypopituitarism or definite gastroparesis, per investigator judgment. Subject is using Pramlintide (Symlin) SGLT2 inhibitor, GLP agonist at time of screening. Renal failure defined by creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min, as assessed by local lab test ≤ 3 months before screening or performed at screening at local lab. Hearing or vision impairment hindering perception of glucose display and alarms, or otherwise incapable of using the study devices, per investigator judgment. Current pregnancy or intention to conceive. Any unresolved adverse skin condition in the area of sensor placement (e.g. psoriasis, rash, Staphylococcus infection). Alcohol or drug abuse, other than nicotine, per investigator judgment. Any other disease or condition that may preclude the patient from participating in the study, per investigator judgment. Legally incompetent, illiterate or vulnerable person. Randomization Criteria: If subjects meet the above criteria, as well as all of the following criteria assessed at the end of the runin period, they may continue to participate in the treatment period of the study: Subject has worn two weeks the sensor with transmitter during the runin period. Subject has shown acceptable tolerance of sensor wear, per investigator judgment. Subject performed ≥ 4 finger stick blood glucose measurements daily, as determined by CareLink™ Clinical data upload as the mean number of SMBG/day over the past 14 days (SMBG number / day ≥ 3.5 rounds up to 4). Subject showed ability to comprehend the pump training and study procedures, per investigator judgment.</criteria>
