	<brief_summary>The lymph nodes or masses,positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) standardized uptake values(SUV) results, whole body magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) intravoxel incoherent motion(IVIM) sequence D, D*, f values and MRI volumes of lymphoma patients were compared before and after the chemotherapy in this project prospectively to provide data for evaluating the dependency and differences of PET/CT and whole body MRI in lymphoma staging and therapeutic evaluation. Long-term therapeutic effect indexes obtained in follow-up visits of patients such as Overall Survival(OS), Progression Free Survival (PFS) etc. were used to evaluate the diagnostic sensitivity and differences of MRI and PET/CT. The research could provide a new method of nonionizing radiation iconography for physicians to give appropriate treatments and predict prognosis.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Lymphoma subtypes were diagnosed on the basis of tissue samples obtained by biopsy or surgery according to the criteria outlined in the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification of hematologic and lymphoid malignancies, by a reference pathologist. Patients who gave written informed consent were referred for DWIMRI and 18FFDGPET/CT. Stable physical medical conditions (patients conscious and comfortable, scheduled for an elective diagnostic imaging). Pregnancy, general contraindications to MRI, and therapeutic interventions between DWIMRI and 18FFDGPET/CT were used.</criteria>
