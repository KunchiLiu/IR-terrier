	<brief_summary>Based on real cases, daily life scenarios of peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients were shooted and edited into video films, including environment of home dialysis, dietary patterns, water intake, sports mode, daily work, short time of travel and other activities, covering a certain natural day of either peritoneal or hemodialysis and some important time points in the way of life, such as nursing and treatment for common complications of the corresponding dialysis mode. The videos will also show the advantages and disadvantages of the two modes of dialysis. According to their actual living conditions, patients will decide the right dialysis modality that suite them well, thus improving dialysis compliance and psychological adaptability.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Based on real cases, daily life scenarios of peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients were shooted and edited into video films, including environment of home dialysis, dietary patterns, water intake, sports mode, daily work, short time of travel and other activities, covering a certain natural day of either peritoneal or hemodialysis and some important time points in the way of life, such as nursing and treatment for common complications of the corresponding dialysis mode. The videos will also show the advantages and disadvantages of the two modes of dialysis. According to their actual living conditions, patients will decide the right dialysis modality that suite them well, thus improving dialysis compliance and psychological adaptability. By "informed decision score" questionnaire, comparison of two groups of patients on dialysis awareness of the pattern and ratio of patients choosing hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis were performed. Dialysis mode conversion rates of the two groups were finally calculated and the correlation between awareness of dialysis modality and conversion rates of dialysis methods was analyzed.</detailed_description>
