	<brief_summary>A total of 120 patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (including continuous and long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation) and 60 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation will receive radiofrequency ablation. Patients in each group will be randomly allocated into the statin treatment group and non-statin treatment group (allocation ratio, 1:1). Left atrial appendage flow velocity of all patients are measured by Transesophageal Echocardiography(TEE) 24 hours before the operation. Real-time ultrasound examinations of left atrial function are carried out for all patients before the operation and after the operation. Blood samples are extracted in all patients before the operation and after the operation. This study will clarify whether the application of statin drugs can improve postoperative left atrial function. This study will identify the time course and influence factors of left atrial recovery of atrial fibrillation after the operation to guide the time and the degree of anticoagulation and effectively prevent thromboembolic events. At the same time, biochemical indicators are detected to analyze which indicators are related to the postoperative recurrence of atrial fibrillation, the incidence of postoperative thrombosis and the recovery of postoperative left atrial function. Furthermore, this study will investigate whether the application of statin drugs can improve postoperative left atrial function by affecting these indicators.</brief_summary>
