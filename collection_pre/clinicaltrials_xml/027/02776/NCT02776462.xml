	<criteria>Subjects will need to consent in compliance with 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 56 and able/willing to participate and meet criteria for concussion. Subjects must have baseline vision correctable to within 20/500 bilaterally. Subjects must have intact ocular motility. Subjects must have ability to provide a complete ophthalmologic, medical and neurologic history as well as medications/drugs/alcohol consumed within the 24 hours prior. ER visit has been more than 2 weeks since the injury which may have caused the concussion. Have received penetrating trauma or have a head CT demonstrating evidence of acute brain injury (subdural, epidural or intraparenchymal hemorrhage, edema/mass effect per attending radiologist read). Suffering burns, anoxic injury or multiple/extensive injuries resulting in any medical, surgical or hemodynamic instability. Blind (no light perception), are missing eyes, do not open eyes. It is pertinent that subjects be able to detect light and have both eyes in order for the eye tracking data to be effective and significant. Previous history of: ocular motility dysfunction or extensive prior eye surgery. Any physical or mental injury or baseline disability rendering task completion difficult. Inability to participate in longitudinal care. Obvious intoxication or blood alcohol level greater than 0.2.</criteria>
