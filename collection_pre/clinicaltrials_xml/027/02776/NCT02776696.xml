	<brief_summary>The proposed study is two-arms, cross-over, randomized and single-center, in clinic Investigation in subjects with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy. The purpose of the study is to compare two closed-loop strategies in terms of glycemic control in Type 1 Diabetes during a camp setting. A total of 20 up to 60 subjects will be enrolled . Subjects will be randomized to participate in two periods of closed-loop treatment, each period will last 3-5 days in a camp setting. In one period glycemic control will be controlled by the Hybrid Closed-Loop System (HCL) and another period by Hybrid Logic Closed-Loop System (HLCL). The sequence of treatments with first period HCL therapy than HLCL or vice versa will be randomly assigned.</brief_summary>
