	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate the safety of the investigational drug called cirmtuzumab in combination with the breast cancer drug paclitaxel. Cirmtuzumab is a type of drug called a monoclonal antibody. This drug is designed to attach to a protein called ROR1 that is on the surface of breast cancer cells. This blocks growth and survival of the breast cancer cells. ROR1 is rarely expressed on healthy cells so this drug should target the cancer cells. Cirmtuzumab is considered experimental because its use is not approved by United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Although there is evidence from tests on laboratory animals that cirmtuzumab can decrease the number of breast cancer cells, we do not know if this will work in humans. This drug has been tested in humans before, but has never been tested in patients with breast cancer, or in combination with paclitaxel in humans. Therefore, the goal of this study is to see if cirmtuzumab is safe and tolerable, when in given in combination with paclitaxel in study participants. You will be evaluated to find out what effects (good and bad) cirmtuzumab has on you and we would like to learn more about how cirmtuzumab might affect the growth of your cancer cells. We would also like to see how long the drug stays in your body and what affects the drug may have on your body.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Cirmtuzumab and Paclitaxel for Metastatic or Locally Advanced, Unresectable Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, dose escalation study in patients with Her2 negative metastatic or locally advanced, unresectable breast cancer who have not previously received paclitaxel in the metastatic setting. All patients providing informed consent will be screened for eligibility. Baseline assessments will include vital signs, physical exam, blood hematology and chemistries, ECOG Performance Status evaluation, a bone scan and tumor assessment by physical exam and/or CT scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis. Patients who are eligible and proceed with study participation will be asked to provide an optional tumor sample for correlative studies within 30 days prior to study treatment initiation. Cirmtuzumab will be administered via intravenous infusion every two weeks (i.e., Day 1 and Day 15 of a 28-day cycle). Two dosing cohorts are planned and the starting dose will 8 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg. The 8 mg/kg dose has been tested and found to be safe in patients with CLL. Patients will receive four doses of cirmtuzumab unless the patient exhibits disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 is administered weekly by intravenous infusion on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28-day cycle. Patients may discontinue study treatment if they have progressive disease, are experiencing unacceptable toxicity, withdraw consent, or if the treating physician determines it's in their best interest. Patients may also continue to receive paclitaxel after cirmtuzumab has been discontinued. Clinical evaluation of history and symptoms, physical exams, and vitals will be performed on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle, and blood draws for laboratory work will be performed weekly during treatment. Blood draws for pharmacokinetics will occur on Days 1 and 2 of Cycle 1. Patients will be asked to provide a second optional tumor sample for correlative studies 15-30 days after Cycle 2 Day 15. An end of treatment visit for clinical evaluations and safety assessments will be performed approximately 28 days after the last dose of cirmtuzumab. Tumor response will be assessed approximately 56 days after the last dose of cirmtuzumab by physical exam and/or CT scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis, and a bone scan if applicable. A follow-up assessment for adverse events will occur approximately 84 days after the last dose of cirmtuzumab.</detailed_description>
