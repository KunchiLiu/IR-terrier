	<detailed_description>Objectives Primary 1. To evaluate the response (complete hematologic response [CHR], complete cytogenetic response [CCyR], major molecular response [MMR] and complete molecular response [CMR] of the combination of ponatinib with standard chemotherapy (according to PETHEMA ALL Ph08 trial) in young patients with Ph+ (BCR-ABL) ALL. 2. To evaluate the event free survival (EFS) of the combination of ponatinib with standard chemotherapy (according to PETHEMA ALL Ph08 trial) in young patients with Ph+ (BCR-ABL) ALL. Secondary - To evaluate the rate of patients receiving an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT) in first CR - To evaluate the frequency of MMR and CMR at the time of alloHSCT - To evaluate the transplant-related mortality (TRM) - To evaluate the CR duration and overall survival (OS) of the combination of ponatinib with standard chemotherapy (according to PETHEMA ALL Ph08 trial) in young patients with Ph+ (BCR-ABL) ALL. - To evaluate the outcome measures (CR duration, OS and EFS) in context of those observed in the PETHEMA ALL Ph08 trial. - To observe the type and number of BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations developing during and after the study. - To evaluate side effects, adverse events (AE) and serious AE (SAE). Interventions: 1. Pre-phase (maximum 7 days, -7 to -1): Prednisone 60 mg/m2/day IV over 7 days (-7 a -1) and triple intrathecal therapy (TIT) (Methotrexate [MTX]: 12 mg, ARA-C: 30 mg, hydrocortisone: 20 mg). 2. Induction (day 1 to day 28 or up to hematological recovery) Vincristine (VCR): 1.5 mg/m2 (maximum 2 mg) IV days 1, 8, 15 and 22. Daunorubicin (DNR): 45 mg/m2 IV days 1, 8, 15 and 22. Prednisone (PDN): 60 mg/m2/day, IV or PO, days 1 to 27. Ponatinib 30 mg, PO from day 1 to consolidation. TIT, days 1 and 22. 3. Consolidation (day 1 to day 63) Mercaptopurine (MP): 50 mg/m2, PO days 1 to 7, 28 to 35 and 56 to 63. MTX: 1,5 g/m2, IV (24 h continuous infusion) days 1, 28 and 56. VP-16: 100 mg/m2/12 h, IV, days 14 and 42. ARA-C: 1000 mg/m2/12 h, IV, days 14-15 and 42-43. TIT (MTX: 12 mg, ARA-C: 30 mg, hydrocortisone: 20 mg), , days 1, 28 and 56. Ponatinib 30 mg/d PO, from day 1 to 15 days before HSCT. 4. HSCT (performed ideally within 1 month from the end of consolidation). AlloHSCT preferred over autoHSCT (autoHSCT only indicated if alloHSCT not feasible). Myeloablative conditioning with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (TBI) whenever possible. 5. Post HSCT therapy After alloHSCT. Frequent monitoring of MRD (every month). If MRD negative: no therapy. If MRD positive, Ponatinib 30 mg/d, po, until 2 yr. after HSCT. The ponatinib dose will be reduced to 15 mg/d in the second year in patients with sustained molecular response. After autoHSCT: Frequent monitoring of MRD (every month). All patients will receive Ponatinib: 30 mg/d, PO, mercaptopurine, (40 mg/m2/d, PO) and methotrexate (15 mg/m2/week, IM), during the first year after HSCT. The ponatinib dose will be reduced to 15 mg/d in the second year in patients with sustained molecular response.</detailed_description>
