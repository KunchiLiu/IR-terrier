	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to improve both physical fitness and sarcopenia of patients with ESLD who are potentially eligible for liver transplantation through a 16-week physical training program. Secondary aims will focus on changes in anthropometrics, body composition, quality of life, and metabolic profile. This is a randomized clinical trial including 50 patients, with half allocated to the active group (physical training program) and half to standard of care.</brief_summary>
