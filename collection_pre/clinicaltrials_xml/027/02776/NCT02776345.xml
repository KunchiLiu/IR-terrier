	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether minimally invasive treatments like ultrasound guided needle fragmentation with and without lavage is associated with better clinical outcomes compared to the subacromial bursal corticosteroid injection treatment only.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound Guided Interventions of Calcific Tendonitis of Rotator Cuff (SUCTION)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objectives of this study are to compare the clinical outcomes of the three treatment arms: ultrasound guided needle fragmentation with lavage, ultrasound guided needle fragmentation without lavage, and subacromial bursal corticosteroid injection treatment. The study design is a randomized control trial.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Adult men or women ages 18 to 60 years 2. Shoulder pain ( including impingement pain) and reduced range of shoulder movement for greater than 6 months with no relief from nonoperative means (physiotherapy, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication, rest). 3. Documentation of failed physiotherapy and conservative management. 4. Calcific tendonitis as diagnosed on ultrasound. 5. Informed consent from participant. 6. Ability to speak, understand and read in the language of the clinical site. 1. Previous inclusion in a study involving calcific tendonitis of the rotator cuff 2.
