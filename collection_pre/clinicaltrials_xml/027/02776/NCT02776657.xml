	<brief_summary>This study involves the use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to determine whether blood clots can be identified within the blood vessels supplying blood to the heart in patients with angina and who have recently suffered a heart attack.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intracoronary Thrombus Detection by Magnetic Resonance Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The majority of heart attacks are caused as a result of small blood clots forming within the blood vessels supplying blood to the heart, obstructing blood flow to the heart muscle. Research has also shown that blood clots may form in the blood vessels of the heart without causing a heart attack. At present, blood clots may be identified by techniques used during invasive coronary angiography, but we wish to determine whether a non-invasive test (MRI scanning) can be used to detect small blood clots within the blood vessels supplying blood to the heart muscle.</detailed_description>
