	<detailed_description>To conduct a very first pilot trial, a monocentric, single-arm clinical study is conducted. The study is approved by the local ethics committee of the Canton of Zurich in Switzerland and the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products. It is conducted in full accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, with all subjects providing their electronic informed consent prior to participation. As the main interest lies in a proof of concept of the proposed MOSS app, emphasis is put on real life conditions. A range of different recruitment channels is used to attract subjects from the general public; they include physical flyers, online posts on relevant online bulletin boards and the Google Play Store.</detailed_description>
