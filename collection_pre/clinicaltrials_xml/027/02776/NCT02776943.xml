	<brief_title>UCMSC Transplantation in the Treatment of Cartilage Damage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human cartilage only has limited regenerative potential. Transplantation of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs) is a promising strategy given the high proliferative capacity of MSCs and their potential to differentiate into cartilage-producing cells - chondrocytes. The acquisition of ucMSCs does not require invasive surgical intervention or cartilage extraction from other sites as required by other cell-based strategies. The investigators inject allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells to the cartilage lesions in patients via intra-articular injection method, and to investigate the efficacy and safety。</detailed_description>
