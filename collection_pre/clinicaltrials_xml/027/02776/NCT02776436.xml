	<brief_summary>The manufacturer recommends two different regimens of prophylactic dexamethasone to prevent hypersensitivity and fluid retention reactions caused by docetaxel: a 3-day regime of dexamethasone 8mg twice a day starting the day before chemotherapy for breast cancer and for prostate cancer 3 times 8mg dexamethasone on the day of docetaxel infusion, given the concurrent use of prednisone 2dd5mg. There is little evidence that supports this high dose regimen used nowadays. There is need to re-evaluate this high dosage of dexamethasone for three main reasons. First, dexamethasone can give side effects such as manifestation of latent diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, personality changes, irritability, euphoria, or mania and mood swings. Second, dexamethasone is an immune suppressor, which might inhibit chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and compromise the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents. Third, dexamethasone is a CYP3A4 inducer, which might increase docetaxel clearance. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of reducing prophylactic of dexamethasone around docetaxel infusion.</brief_summary>
