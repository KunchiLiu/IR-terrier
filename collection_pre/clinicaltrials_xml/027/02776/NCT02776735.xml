	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To describe the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of sarilumab in patients with pcJIA in order to identify the dose and regimen for continued development in this population. Secondary Objective: To describe: - The pharmacodynamic (PD) profile, the efficacy and the safety of sarilumab in patients with pcJIA. - The long-term safety of sarilumab in patients with pcJIA.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open-label, Ascending, Repeated Dose-finding Study of Sarilumab in Children and Adolescents With Polyarticular-course Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (pcJIA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The total study duration per patient will be 114 weeks that will consist of a 4-week screening, a 12-week core treatment period, a 92-week extension phase, and a 6-week post-treatment follow-up.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Male and female patients aged ≥2 and ≤17 years at the time of the screening visit. Diagnosis of rheumatoid factornegative or rheumatoid factor positive polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) subtype or oligoarticular extended JIA subtype according to the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) 2001 Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Classification Criteria with at least 5 active joints as per American College of Rheumatology (ACR) definition for "active arthritis" at screening. Patient with an inadequate response to current treatment and considered as a candidate for a biologic diseasemodifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) as per Investigator's judgment. Exclusion criteria: Body weight &lt;10 kg or &gt;60 kg. If nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, including cyclooxygenase2 inhibitors [COX2]) taken, dose stable for less than 2 weeks prior to the baseline visit and/or dosing prescribed outside of approved label. If nonbiologic DMARD taken, dose stable for less than 6 weeks prior to the baseline visit or at a dose exceeding the recommended dose as per local labeling. If oral glucocorticoid taken, dose exceeding equivalent prednisone dose 0.5 mg/kg/day (or 30 mg/day) within 2 weeks prior to baseline. Prior treatment with antiinterleukin 6 (IL6) or IL6 receptor (IL6R) antagonist therapies, including but not limited to tocilizumab or sarilumab. Treatment with any biologic DMARD within 5 halflives prior to the first dose of sarilumab Treatment with a Janus kinase inhibitor within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of sarilumab Treatment with any investigational biologic or nonbiologic product within 8 weeks or 5 halflives prior to baseline, whichever is longer. Active tuberculosis patients or latent tuberculosis patients without adequate treatment. Exclusion criteria related to past or current infection other than tuberculosis. Any live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the baseline, such as varicellazoster, oral polio, rubella vaccines. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
