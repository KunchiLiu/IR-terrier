	<brief_summary>Bedside clinical case learning, such for respiratory distress, represent a challenge for medical teachers, especially in critical conditions. In fact, this kind of learning implicate the presence of an appropriate case (the patient itself), framework and may be time consuming which could compromise the patient's safety and wellbeing. New pedagogic tools have emerged to strengthen the medical reasoning and the acquisition of knowledge. in recent years, the development of medical simulation has found a growing interest in the medical teaching field. Contextualization, reproducibility and reliability are the characteristics of high-fidelity simulation (HFS) which guarantee a lifetime experience of clinical conditions without putting at risk patient's safety and comfort. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of HFS on fifth year medical students learning skills in the assessement and management of an acute asthma attack in the emergency room, and to compares it to other modern teaching tools such as "video-case"</brief_summary>
