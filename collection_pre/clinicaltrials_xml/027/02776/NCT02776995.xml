	<brief_summary>This research aims to investigate the correlation between tumor temperature difference and biological factors, such as size, metabolism, treatment response, and tumor aggressiveness. In addition, normal tissue response to adjuvant radiation therapy in treated organs following surgery, will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tumor Monitoring Using Thermography During Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During radiation session, the investigators would evaluate the changes that will be detected by thermal imaging and correlate them with visible side effects as well as with known tumor biology factors and skin-tumor distance.</detailed_description>
