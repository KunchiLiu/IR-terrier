	<brief_title>Patient-Centered Anticoagulation Self-Monitoring in Minority Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite favorable results and enhanced patient convenience, the adoption of patient self-monitoring for anticoagulation therapy has been limited primarily to non-minority and higher socioeconomic status individuals. While effectiveness has been studied, the factors influencing the adoption of self-monitoring of anticoagulation in minorities with the most barriers to accessing quality care in specialized clinics, are not known. Hypothesis: Patient centered education and training intervention for minority patients will result in effective adoption of self-monitoring of anticoagulation therapy, resulting in anticoagulation control of comparable quality to that seen in specialized anticoagulation clinic-based monitoring. The research objective of this proposal will be accomplished through 3 specific aims: 1. Identify patient and provider factors that influence adoption of anticoagulation self-monitoring in a minority population. 2. Adapt and refine an education intervention that both addresses identified barriers and emphasizes identified positive influences to anticoagulation self-monitoring. 3. Demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of anticoagulation self-monitoring coupled with an educational intervention in a minority population.</detailed_description>
