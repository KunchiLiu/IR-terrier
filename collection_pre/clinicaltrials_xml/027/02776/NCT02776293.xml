	<brief_title>Listening to Songs Composed for Pregnancy Reduces Prenatal Anxiety and Depression: a Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prenatal anxiety and depression has negative implications for both the mother and the developing child, including developmental disorders, low birth weight, and altered immune function. It is therefore very important both to detect and to help ameliorate symptoms of anxiety and depression in pregnant women. Many women do not want pharmacological interventions at this time, and with less severe symptoms it may not be appropriate. Thus there is a need to find non-pharmacological methods of intervention. Psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy or interpersonal therapy can be effective. But these are often not available for the large numbers of women who could benefit. Though there has been evidence that music has the ability reduce anxiety, no study has quantitatively measured prenatal anxiety and depression over a long period of time. Proof of efficacy could justify investment into music as an inexpensive, and non-stigmatizing method to reduce prenatal anxiety and depression and therefore benefit both the mother and child.</detailed_description>
