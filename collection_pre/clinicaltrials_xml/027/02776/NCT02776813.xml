	<criteria>Signed written informed consent obtained prior to study procedures Histologicallyconfirmed relapsed or refractory CD20+ Bcell lymphoma of one of the following types, with documented disease progression or recurrence following the immediate prior therapy: DLBCL, regardless of cell of origin or underlying molecular genetics MCL PMBCL Gr3bFL THFL Biopsyconfirmed CD20+ expression of the underlying malignancy by immunohistochemical staining or flow cytometry between the most recent dose of an antiCD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and study enrollment At least 1 measurable lesion on imaging. Lesions that have been previously irradiated will be considered measurable only if progression has been documented following completion of radiation therapy Must have received adequate prior therapy for the underlying CD20+ Bcell lymphoma, defined as an antiCD20 mAb in combination with an anthracyclinecontaining chemotherapy regimen (i.e. chemoimmunotherapy) and at least one of the following: biopsyproven refractory disease after frontline chemoimmunotherapy relapse within 1 year from frontline chemoimmunotherapy and ineligible for autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (autoHSCT) For subjects with DLBCL, PMBCL, and Gr3bFL: relapsed or refractory disease following at least 2 prior regimens or following an autoHSCT For subjects with THFL: relapsed or refractory disease following at least 2 prior regimens or following an autoHSCT. At least 1 prior regimen with an antiCD20 mAb in combination with chemotherapy is required following documented transformation For subjects with MCL (confirmed with cyclin D1 expression or evidence of t(11;14) by cytogenetics, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) or PCR): relapsed or refractory disease after at least 1 prior regimen with chemoimmunotherapy (prior autoHSCT is allowable) Karnofsky performance scale ≥ 60% Life expectancy of at least 6 months ANC &gt; 1000/µL Platelet count &gt; 50,000/µL For women of childbearing potential (defined as physiologically capable of becoming pregnant), agreement to use of highly effective contraception for at least 1 year following ACTR087 infusion. For men with partners of childbearing potential, agreement to use effective barrier contraception for at least 1 year following ACTR087 infusion Known active central nervous system (CNS) involvement by malignancy. Subjects with prior CNS involvement with their lymphoma must have completed effective treatment of their CNS disease at least 3 months prior to enrollment with no evidence of disease clinically and at least stable findings on relevant CNS imaging Prior treatment as follows: alemtuzumab within 6 months of enrollment fludarabine, cladribine, or clofarabine within 3 months of enrollment external beam radiation within 2 weeks of enrollment mAb (including rituximab) within 2 weeks of enrollment other lymphotoxic chemotherapy (including steroids except as below) within 2 weeks of enrollment experimental agents within 3 halflives prior to enrollment, unless progression is documented on therapy Serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 X ageadjusted upper limits of normal (ULN) Pulse oximetry &lt; 92% on room air Direct bilirubin ≥ 3.0 mg/dL (50 mmol/L) Alanine transaminase (ALT) ≥ 3 times the ULN, unless determined to be directly due to lymphoma. Aspartate transaminase (AST) ≥ 3 times the ULN, unless determined to be directly due to lymphoma Class III or IV heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA), history of cardiac angioplasty or stenting, documented myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months prior to enrollment, cardiac ejection fraction of &lt; 45%, or other clinically significant cardiac disease Clinical history of, prior diagnosis of, or overt evidence of autoimmune disease, regardless of severity Clinically significant active infection, in the judgment of the investigator Pregnancy (negative serum pregnancy test to be obtained within 6 days prior to enrollment for subjects of childbearing potential) Breastfeeding Primary immunodeficiency Seropositive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) 1 or HIV 2, or positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibody Will need or has needed active treatment of a second malignancy within the prior 3 years before enrollment, other than FL, nonmelanoma skin cancers, localized prostate cancer treated with curative intent, or cervical carcinoma in situ Is unable to receive any of the agents used in this study due a history of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction (e.g. hypersensitivity to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) History of prior allogeneic HSCT History of Richter's transformation from CLL Prior infusion of a genetically modified therapy</criteria>
