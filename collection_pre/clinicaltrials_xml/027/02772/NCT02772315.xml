	<brief_title>Omics Signature in the Diagnosis of Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Arterial hypertension is the most important cause of death in the world. At referral hypertension centers about 25% of patients have a single cause for hypertension, so-called secondary hypertension, mostly of endocrine, adrenal origin (primary aldosteronism, pheochromocytoma/ paraganglioma, Cushing's syndrome). This rate steps up to 50% in patients with drug resistant hypertension. Proper treatment of secondary hypertension improves prognosis considerably but depends on adequate diagnosis. Classically the diagnosis of such forms of hypertension rests on cumbersome biochemical and imaging procedures that may not completely take away uncertainty. Modern '-omics' techniques (genomics, metabolomics, proteomics of plasma and urine) may allow faster and better diagnosis. In addition, they may provide a basis for stratification of hypertensive patients that do not have a identifiable cause of hypertension, so-called primary hypertension. This stratification may help predicting response to antihypertensive drugs and determining prognosis and thus, help to establish personalized medicine in hypertension care.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Aged from 18 to 75 years old A signed and dated informed consent form A diagnosis of hypertension defined either as: Use of antihypertensive drug (s) Arterial hypertension: in untreated patients this must be confirmed by daytime ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), or home blood pressure monitoring, with blood pressure higher or equal to 135 mmHg for systolic blood pressure and/or higher or equal to 85 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure. In order to be eligible to participate in the nested case control study, a subject must also meet the following criteria: A conformed diagnosis of PA, PPGL or CS for case patients and PHT (exclusion of secondary forms) for their matched counterparts Any severe comorbid conditions that, according to the attending physician, could decrease the life expectancy to less than 3 years Any active malignancy unrelated to adrenal disease or PPGL Guardianship for incapacity A potential control subject who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in the nested case controlled study in case of: Existence of any other forms of secondary hypertension such as renal artery stenosis, renal disease, Munchausen's syndrome in which the patient induces hypertension regardless of method. Druginduced (included factitious use of illicit substances) hypertension</criteria>
