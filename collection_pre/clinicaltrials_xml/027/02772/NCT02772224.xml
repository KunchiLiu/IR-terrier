	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Paclitaxel-eluting Balloons for Below the Knee Peripheral Arterial Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over the past decade, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) has established its position in the treatment of below the knee arterial occlusive disease with intermittent claudication and/or critical limb ischemia. However, the efficacy of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with conventional balloons, is limited by the high 12-month restenosis and target lesion revascularization (TLR) rates. Local delivery of newer anti-proliferative drug via drug-eluting balloons (DEBs) has recently shown promising results in the treatment of femoropopliteal disease, and in the BTK area, a reduction in 3-month binary restenosis has been observed compared with historical controls treated with PTA. Drug eluting balloon has three potential advantages: (1) homogenous drug transfer to the vessel wall; (2) highest drug concentrations at the vessel wall at the time of injury; and (3) absence of a stent or delivery polymer. This study sought to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of new drug (Paclitaxel)-eluting balloons (DEB) for the treatment of below the knee peripheral arterial disease.</detailed_description>
