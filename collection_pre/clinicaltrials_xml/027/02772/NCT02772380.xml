Women of childbearing potential are required to have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to the ASD2 Acute Testing procedure Subject meets exclusion criteria required by local law (e.g. age, breast feeding,etc.) Subject is legally incompetent 1. Screening subjects at high risk for infection will be based on the local investigator judgment decision. 2. Subjects who are at high risk for stroke should be screened according to local country guidelines or, in case of their absence, according to ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 Guidelines for High Risk Factors for Stroke (i.e. exclusion of subjects with previous stroke, TIA, or embolism; Mitral stenosis; prosthetic heart valve). 3. Screening will be based on the local investigator judgment decision.</criteria>
