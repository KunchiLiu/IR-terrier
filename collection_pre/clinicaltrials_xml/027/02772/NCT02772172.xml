	<brief_summary>The main purpose of the present study is to evaluate the dental implant placement using two different CBCT-derived templates and to study the related factors that affect accuracy so as to support the further clinical application of the technique. Thirty patients with partial edentulous denture are recruited. They are randomized to two groups. A radiographic guide is prepared before CT/CBCT scan. The CT/CBCT scan DICOM ﬁles are loaded in a planning program and converted into 3D computer images. A surgical template is fabricated through this virtual planning. After 6 weeks, if the implants are judged stable, the patient has the option of replacing the ﬁxed prosthesis. Patients are recalled for oral hygiene maintenance and prosthetic controls every 6 months for the entire duration of the study.</brief_summary>

Subjects smoking &lt;20 cigarettes per day were requested to stop smoking before and after surgery</criteria>
