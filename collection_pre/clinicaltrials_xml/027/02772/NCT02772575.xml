	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if certain genes the tumor can help predict how the tumor will respond to Trans-Arterial Embolization (TAE). A gene is the basic physical and functional unit of heredity. Genes are made up of DNA; DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the hereditary material in humans. Identifying a gene that can predict how liver tumors will respond to TAE will also help to determine if adjuvant therapy will be needed after TAE.</brief_summary>
