	<brief_title>T-cells Expressing Anti-CD19 CAR in Pediatric and Young Adults With B-cell Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autologous T cells transduced with chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) that recognize the CD19 antigen (CD19-CAR T cells) have been used in multiple clinical trials at several institutions worldwide. We established an in-house manufacturing process for CD19-CAR T cells with a CD28 (cluster of differentiation 28) costimulatory domain. Primary Objectives: 1. To study the safety of administration of CAR T cell at the Sheba Medical Center 2. To determine the feasibility and efficacy of administering anti-CD19-CAR T cells in children and young adults with B cell malignancies. Secondary Objectives 1. To study in vivo and in vitro behavior of CAR T cell in patients, including persistence, expansion, cytotoxic potential and exhaustion. 2. To study the cytokine milieu in CAR treated patients. Eligibility Patients 1-39 years of age, with a CD19-expressing B-cell malignancy that has recurred after, or not responded to, one or more standard chemotherapy-containing regimens. Design Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)will be obtained by leukapheresis. Anti-CD19 CAR T cells will be manufactured from fresh autologous PBMCs. PBMC will be cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 (cluster of differentiation 3) antibody and interleukin-2 followed by retroviral vector supernatant containing the anti-CD19 CAR. Total culture time is between 7-10 days. Patients will receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy composed of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine prior to cell infusion, and on day 0 will receive one million CAR T cells per kilogram. Patients will be monitored for toxicity including cytokine release syndrome, hematologic toxicities and B-cell aplasia; for response of their underlying malignancy; and for CAR-T cell persistence in the blood, marrow and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF).</detailed_description>
