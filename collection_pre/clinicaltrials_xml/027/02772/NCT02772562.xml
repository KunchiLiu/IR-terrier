Use of inhaled steroids, nasal sprays, and topical preparations for small body areas is allowed. Use of systemic immunosuppressant agents including antimetabolites, glucocorticoids, TNF antagonists, antibodies to IL6 or IL6R, calcineurin inhibitors, mTOR antagonists Prior history of serious toxicity or a systemic reaction to vaccinia immunization such as myopericarditis progressive vaccinia infection, or eczema vaccinatum.

Persons with vitiligo are not excluded. Uncontrolled diabetes. Subjects with diabetes are not excluded if the condition is wellcontrolled (A1C &lt; 7.5) Vaccination with live attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to day 1 of PROSTVACV/F administration or vaccination with a killed vaccine within 14 days prior to day 1 of PROSTVACV/F. Inability to avoid close contact or household contact with the following highrisk individuals for three weeks after the Day 1 vaccination or until the vaccination site heals completely: (a) children â‰¤ 3 years of age, (b) pregnant or nursing women, (c) individuals with prior or concurrent extensive eczema or other eczemoid skin disorders, or (d) immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV.
