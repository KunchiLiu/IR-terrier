	<criteria>Pediatric Crohn's Disease (PCD) patients, &lt; 21 years of age, â‰¥20 kg, initiating antiTNF therapy with infliximab or adalimumab. Diagnosis of Crohn's Disease (CD) established confirmed by the treating clinician, and established by standard clinical criteria (radiography, endoscopy, histology). Ability to provide parental permission and child assent (where applicable), or adult consent for patients ages 1820. Prior use of antiTNF or other biological therapy for CD Inability to swallow pills Lack of stable home address that study medications can be mailed to Anticipated short length of follow up at study center (plans for family to move, transition to adult GI (gastrointestinal) provider, etc.). Patients expected to leave practice &lt; 24 months from enrollment should not be enrolled. Abdominal abscess within the last 3 months Prior intraabdominal surgery without a clinically significant relapse (i.e. patients starting on antiTNF for postop prophylaxis or for endoscopic recurrence only should not be included) Receipt of a live virus vaccine within the last 30 days Pregnancy, planning to become pregnant, or high risk of pregnancy as determined by the local investigator Breastfeeding Refusal to stay abstinent or utilize 2 forms of birth control while on study medication (for female patients) BMI &gt; 95% for gender and age Known previous or concurrent malignancy (other than that considered surgically cured, with no evidence for recurrence for 5 years). A recent history of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma, which is considered surgically cured, does not exclude the subject.Those with a recent history of colonic adenoma or dysplastic lesions should be excluded. Known high alcohol consumption (more than seven drinks per week) Patients with serum albumin &lt; 2.5 g/dl at baseline Patients with white blood cell count (WBC) &lt; 3.0 x109th/L at baseline Patients with platelet count &lt; 100 x109th/L Patients with initial elevation of liver enzymes (AST or ALT) &gt; 1.5 times above normal limit at baseline Patients with known C. difficile at screening visit Patients with preexisting hepatic disease Patients with preexisting renal dysfunction (creatinine &gt; 0.8 for children age&lt;10, creatinine &gt; 1.2 mg/dl for children age 1018, and creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dl for adults age 18 years and older). Patients with a preexisting chronic lung disease other than well controlled asthma Current treatment with one of the following drugs: Probenecid (Probalan), Acitretin (Soriatane), Streptozocin (Zanosar), Azathioprine (Imuran, Azasan), 6mercaptopurine (Purinethol, Purixan) Other concerns about the patient/family's ability to participate in the study</criteria>
