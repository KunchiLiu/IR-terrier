	<brief_summary>Recent epidemiologic studies are identifying a number of modifiable risk and protective factors that may influence in the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, the combination of an early detection of individuals at risk together with interventional studies targeted to the control of modifiable risk factors makes primary prevention programmes to become a new and real therapeutic strategy. In this scenario, the investigators have designed the ALFAlife study, a programme of control and intervention on the modifiable AD risk factors. Throughout this study, participants will be given a number of healthy lifestyle guidelines that are personalised depending on their specific risk profile. These guidelines refer to smoking and dietary habits and physical, cognitive and social activity. The investigators hypothesis is that the follow-up of these guidelines will favor a change of participants' lifestyle habits towards healthier ones. In addition, the investigators hypothesise that changes in these lifestyle habits will have an effect on objective physiological measures (such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels).</brief_summary>
