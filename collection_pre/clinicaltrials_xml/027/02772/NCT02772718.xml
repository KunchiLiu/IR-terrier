	<brief_title>An Open-Label Study of XOMA 358 in Patients With Hypoglycemia After Gastric Bypass Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Hypoglycemia</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Aged at least 18 years of age Body Mass Index &lt; 35 kg/m2 at baseline, unless discussed with Medical Monitor and patients with higher body mass index do not have significant medical comorbidities that would confound ability to assess safety and efficacy of study drug. Received gastric bypass surgery more than 1 year before dosing Occurrence of postprandial hypoglycemia (blood glucose less than 60mg/dL) during the Baseline provocation assessments and/or by continuous glucose monitoring, as defined in the protocol. History of type 1 diabetes Planned use of the following medications on or after Day 3 (Part 1): Any agent for hypoglycemia, such as diazoxide or octreotide Antihyperglycemic agents, including subcutaneous insulin therapy, sulfonylureas, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP1 agonists Systemic glucocorticoids or Î² agonists that may affect glucose metabolism Longacting somatostatin analogs or glucoseaffecting medications During Part 2, the following therapies are prohibited as specified below: Tramadol and any other medications not used in the treatment of postbariatric surgery hypoglycemia that may cause hypoglycemia or fluctuations in blood glucose levels. Acetaminophencontaining products during periods of continuous glucose monitoring. Medications such as tramadol may cause hypoglycemia or fluctuations in blood glucose levels and, as such, use of such medications is subject to the restrictions as described above during the study. Acetaminophen can interfere with the accuracy of the glucose sensor of the continuous glucose monitoring system and is, therefore, prohibited during continuous glucose monitoring. Major general surgery within 3 months before study entry or anticipated during the study period Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
