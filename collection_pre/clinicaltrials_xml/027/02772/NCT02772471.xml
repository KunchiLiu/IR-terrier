	<brief_summary>Invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, using modalities such as parenchymal pressure transducer or external ventricular drain (EVD), provides an ICP waveform that encapsulates valuable diagnostic and monitoring clinical information. HS-1000 device, a proprietary new non-invasive ICP monitor, is expected to display an ICP waveform safely and accurately with minimal discomfort to patients, compared to standard invasive ICP monitoring procedures used at the participating institutions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development and Evaluation of the ICP Waveform Tracing Capabilities and Safety of HS-1000 Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A study will be conducted on 100 patients who undergo invasive ICP measurement due to suspected ICP elevation, regardless to etiology. Each enrolled patient will be monitored with the HS-1000 device and data will be collected throughout the entire procedure. Once the data collection is done, results of the non-invasive measurements will be analyzed accordingly. The end-point of the study is to collect at least half an hour of measurements for each participant.</detailed_description>
