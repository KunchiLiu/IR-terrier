Nonischaemic Cardiomyopathy; Cardiac surgery planed in the 6 months; Mechanical complication of STEMI (ventricular septal rupture, free wall rupture, acute severe mitral regurgitation); Renal or hepatic failure; Malignancy, HIV, or central nervous system disorder; Cardiopulmonary resuscitation &gt;15 min and compromised level of consciousness; Cardiogenic shock; Current participation in any research study involving investigational drugs or devices; No written consensus; Previous myocardial infarction.</criteria>
