	<brief_summary>A single-center, prospective, non-randomized, clinical and first-in-human study. Each patient will be studied during a single treatment session of ten hours. The device will be connected to an existing, standard PD catheter that the patient will be using routinely prior to the study (i.e. a peritoneal dialysis catheter will not be specifically inserted for the study). The patient will be hospitalized for observation during the test day and during the night following the study session. Ultrafiltration volume, dialysate glucose concentrations, blood glucose concentrations as well the patient's acceptability and tolerance of the wearable device will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
