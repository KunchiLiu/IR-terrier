	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that the pregnancy rates of women (ages 18-50 years) undergoing transfer of vitrified-warmed blastocysts (frozen at less than 41 years of age) as part of their IVF treatment are not different with respect to the administration of progesterone (Crinone速 8% vaginal gel versus intramuscular progesterone).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Vaginal and Intramuscular Progesterone in Vitrified-warmed Blastocyst Transfer Cycles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis of this study is that the type of progesterone administered (intramuscular progesterone or Crinone速 8% vaginal gel) does not affect implantation and clinical pregnancy rates in women receiving cryo-thawed blastocysts that were produced using their own eggs and frozen before age 41 years. Both intramuscular progesterone (25-100 mg compounded in oil) or vaginal progesterone (Crinone速 8% vaginal progesterone gel) are widely used for luteal phase support in patients receiving vitrified-warmed embryos. Crinone速 8% is FDA approved for progesterone supplementation or replacement as part of an Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) treatment for infertile women with progesterone deficiency (FDA approval letter, 1997).</detailed_description>
