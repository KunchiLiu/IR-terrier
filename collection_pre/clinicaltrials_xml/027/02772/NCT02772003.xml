	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Presence of chronic HCV infection. Age ≥18 years. Willingness to use adequate contraception to avoid pregnancy or impregnation for the duration of study participation. Willingness to avoid excessive use of alcohol during the study. Willingness to provide blood samples for research tests specified in the protocol. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Serum or plasma HCV RNA level ≥ 10,000 IU/mL. Screening HCV genotype, demonstrating genotype 1. Alpha feto protein (AFP) levels within normal institutional limits or judged to be not clinically significant by the investigator. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0 or 1. Screening laboratory values (serum chemistry, hematology, prothrombin time (PT)(International Normalized Ratio (INR))/Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT), and creatine phosphokinase (CPK)) within institutional normal range or judged to be not clinically significant by physician and medical monitor. 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) showing normal heart rhythm or judged to be not clinically significant by physician and medical monitor. Failure of previous HCV therapies. HIV infection. Any previous treatment for HCV ≤ 6 months prior to registration. Other uncontrolled immunecompromising illness Autoimmune disorders, transplant recipients, other immunosuppression including any concurrent condition requiring the use of immunosuppressive/ immunomodulating agents. Ongoing HBV infection. Documented evidence of fibrosis or cirrhosis (Metavir 2, 3,and 4) and subjects with significant extrahepatic manifestations of hepatitis C (such as cryoglobulinemia with symptoms or evidence of endorgan manifestations, renal disease, type 2 diabetes, or porphyria cutanea tarda. Other known causes of significant liver disease including chronic or acute hepatitis B, acute hepatitis A, hemochromatosis, or homozygote alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency. Active malignancy. History of major organ transplantation with an existing functional graft. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. History of cardiac arrhythmia, controlled or uncontrolled, including ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmia. Pregnant or nursing women. Current diagnosis or history of cardiac preexcitation syndromes (e.g. WolffParkinsonWhite). Metal implants on same limb as intended administration site. Tattoos, scars, active lesions, or rashes ≤ 2 cm of the intended site of study treatment. Documentation of history of seizure within previous 5 years. Pacemaker or other implanted device. Any condition that, in the clinical judgement of the investigator, would place a participant at unreasonably increased risk. Receiving any other investigational agents ≤ 6 months prior to Registration. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to INO8000 and INO9012.</criteria>
