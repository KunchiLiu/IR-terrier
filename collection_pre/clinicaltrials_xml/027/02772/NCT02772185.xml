	<brief_summary>This study is a double blind, sham-controlled clinical trial aiming to compare the long-term effects of stimulation in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Sixty early AD patients will take part in a phase II/III clinical study over a 1-year period. The study involves transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), cognitive training (CT), detailed neuropsychological and neurological testing. These assessments will occur at baseline, then again at two month (end point). Those who achieve clinical improvement with neurostimulation and cognitive therapy will be invited to receive treatment for 12 months as part of a follow-up study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The patients will be randomized into 1 of 4 groups: active tDCS plus real CT, active tDCS plus placebo CT, sham tDCS plus real CT, sham tDCS plus placebo CT. Each group will receive treatment for 30 minutes a day, 3 days a week for 8 weeks.</detailed_description>
