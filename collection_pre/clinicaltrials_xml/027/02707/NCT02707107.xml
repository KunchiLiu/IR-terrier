Resting supine blood pressure of 90 to 139 (systolic)/40 to 89 (diastolic) mmHg and a resting pulse rate of 40 to 100 beats per minute. 3. Calculated creatinine clearance â‰¥80 mL/min (CockcroftGault method). 4. All values of hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis showing no clinically significant deviations from normal as judged by the Principal Investigator. 1. Participation in another investigational drug or device study or treated with an investigational product within 30 days or 5 halflives, whichever is longer, before investigational product administration in this study. 2. History/evidence of clinically relevant pathology related to the cardiovascular system, central nervous system, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, endocrinology, immunology, hematology or any other systemic disorder/major surgeries, that in the opinion of the Principal Investigator would confound the subject's participation and followup in the study. 3. History of clinically significant food or drug allergy, including known hypersensitivity to cefepime or any other related drugs. 4.
