	<criteria>Screening central laboratory result indicating HCV single genotype infection for the appropriate treatment arm, without coinfection of any other genotype. Chronic HCV infection defined as one of the following: Positive for antiHCV antibody (Ab) and/or HCV RNA at least 6 months before Screening. A liver biopsy consistent with chronic HCV infection. Must voluntarily sign and date an informed consent form, approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) prior to the initiation of any screening or study specific procedures. Subjects must be able to understand and adhere to the study visit schedule and all other protocol requirements. Absence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as indicated by an ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Female who is pregnant, planning to become pregnant during the study, or breastfeeding; or male whose partner is pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the study. Recent (within 6 months prior to study drug administration) history of drug or alcohol abuse that could preclude adherence to the protocol in the opinion of the investigator. Positive test result at Screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or anti human immunodeficiency virus antibody (HIV Ab). Receipt of any investigational product within a time period equal to 10 halfâ€‘lives of the product, if known, or a minimum of 6 weeks (whichever is longer) prior to study drug administration. Consideration by the investigator, for any reason, that the subject is an unsuitable candidate to receive ABT493/ABT530.</criteria>
