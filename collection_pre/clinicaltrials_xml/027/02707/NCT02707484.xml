	<brief_summary>Gastrointestinal vascular malformation (GIVM), which is an important cause of acute or chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, currently lacks of effective treatment. The investigators' previous study first confirmed thalidomide treatment of GIVM bleeding was safe and effective. This prospective multi-center randomized controlled clinical trial intends to investigate the efficacy of thalidomide to the recurrent small intestinal hemorrhage due to GIVM.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>the Efficiency of Thalidomide for Recurrent Small Intestinal Bleeding Due to Gastrointestinal Vascular Malformation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-institutional clinical trial investigates the efficacy of thalidomide to the recurrent small intestinal hemorrhage due to GIVM. Patients with annual average bleeding 4 times or more and lesions located in the small intestine which are not suitable for endoscopic therapy will be randomly assigned to receive A(25mg,Thalidomide，qid), B(25mg, Thalidomide, bid&amp; placebo bid ) or placebo(deferred treatment group) for 4 months. The primary endpoints were the difference in yearly bleeding Episodes, followed by the difference in Blood Transfusions, Total Transfused Red Cell Requirements, Bleeding Duration, yearly mean Hemoglobin (Hb) level, hospitalization and iron requirement. After one year follow-up, the treatment of 100mg thalidomide might be paid as supplementary therapy for non-responders if necessary. This study will be done at 10 centers in China.</detailed_description>
