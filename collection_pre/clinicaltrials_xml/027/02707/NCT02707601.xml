	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate efficacy of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) as measured by the proportion of participants achieving hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) 12 weeks after the last dose of LDV/SOF (sustained virologic response (SVR) 12). This study will consist of 2 parts. In Part 1, the participants will be randomized to switch from stable antiretroviral (ARV) therapy to either E/C/F/TAF or F/R/TAF. The participants maintaining HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL and tolerating E/C/F/TAF or F/R/TAF through Part 1 will continue to Part 2 where they will receive the LDV/SOF treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Chronic genotype (GT) 1, HCV infected, male and nonpregnant/ nonlactating female individuals, without cirrhosis, treatmentnaive or treatmentexperienced with interferon (IFN) +/ ribavirin (RBV) +/ HCV protease inhibitor (PI). Compensated cirrhotic individuals must be HCV treatmentnaive. No prior treatments with NS5A and NS5B or any HCV direct acting antivirals, except boceprevir, telaprevir and simeprevir, in combination with IFN and RBV Currently on an ARV regimen (2 NRTI + a third agent) without change for 6 months prior to screening. Documented plasma HIV1 RNA levels &lt; 50 copies/mL (or undetectable HIV1 RNA level according to the local assay being used if the limit of detection is ≥ 50 copies/mL) for ≥ 6 months preceding the screening visit. After reaching HIV1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL, single values ("blips") of HIV1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL followed by resuppression is allowed. For individuals with 3 or more prior ARV regimens, a regimen history should be provided for approval by the Sponsor. Note: Individuals that changed from TDF to TAF less than 6 months ago will be eligible as long as the TDF/ TAF change was the only change to the regimen. Plasma HIV1 RNA level &lt; 50 copies/mL at the screening visit Have no documented resistance to any of the HIV study agents at time in the past, including but not limited to the reverse transcriptase resistance mutations K65R, K70E, K101E/P, E138A/G/K/R/Q, V179L, Y181C/I/V, M184V/I, Y188L, H221Y, F227C, M230I/L, the combination of K103N+L100I, or 3 or more thymidine analog associated mutations (TAMs) that include M41L or L210W (TAMs are M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, K219Q/E/N/R). If a historical genotype prior to first ARV is not available or individual had 3 or more prior ARV regimens, individual will have proviral genotype analysis for archived resistance prior to Day 1. No history of HIV virologic failure No evidence of Hepatitis B infection Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min as estimated by CockcroftGault formula NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/ Exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
