	<brief_title>Biomarkers for the Early Identification of Sepsis in the Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The management of patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) requires investigative biological parameters that help clinicians to make the right diagnosis. Sepsis concerns patients with infection associated with a systemic inflammatory response. While this inflammatory profile is observed in many clinical situations in the ED, the challenge is to characterize in these patients suspected of sepsis those who have a real infection. Currently, no individual biomarker of sepsis is sufficiently discriminant. The objective of this study is to measure in patients suspected of sepsis in the emergency department, a combination of biomarkers (covering several distinct pathophysiological pathways) that could provide high specificity and sensitivity for the diagnostic and prognostic. The originality of this study is that compared with patients admitted to intensive care units, patients investigated for suspected sepsis in the ED are seen earlier in their medical history and usually before any therapeutic intervention (intravenous fluids, antibiotics, catecholamines) interfering with several biomarkers of interest.</detailed_description>
