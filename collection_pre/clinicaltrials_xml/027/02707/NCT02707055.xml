	<brief_summary>Background: Hormones are naturally occurring chemicals in the body. Ghrelin is a hormone that stimulates appetite. It may also stimulate alcohol cravings and use. Researchers want to learn more about alcohol cravings and test if a drug that blocks ghrelin lowers alcohol cravings. Objective: To test if the drug PF-05190457 decreases alcohol craving. Eligibility: People ages 18 65 who have: Alcohol use disorder No other serious medical problems Woman must be postmenopausal or have had surgery to prevent pregnancy. Design: Participants will stay on the inpatient unit here at the Clinical Center for two 2-week stages, which will be separated by at least 2 days. The inpatient phase include: Taking the study drug or placebo by mouth twice daily Blood tests Tasting several sweet solutions Physical exams Smokers will smoke cigarettes through a device that gives information about how they smoke a cigarette. Exposure to alcohol, water, and food cues in a bar-like room. Participants answer questions on a computer. Blood pressure and heart rate are monitored through an arm cuff and sensors on the chest. Saliva is collected through cotton rolls in the mouth. MRIs: Participants lie on a table that slides in and out of the cylinder, and a coil is placed over the head. They complete tasks on a computer screen while in the cylinder. This lasts up to 2 hours. Wearing a virtual reality headset, walking around a virtual room, and selecting virtual food and drink. Participants will have 8 hour long follow-up visits in our Outpatient Clinic These include: Counseling to abstain from alcohol use. Sessions may be videotaped. Physical exams</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective: Ghrelin is a 28-amino acid peptide that stimulates appetite and food intake. It is an endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR1a). Preclinical studies suggest that ghrelin modulates alcohol reward processing. Previous work from our research team, indicated that intravenous (IV) ghrelin administration, compared to placebo, results in an acute increase in alcohol craving during a cue-reactivity experiment in alcoholic individuals. Therefore, an oral bioavailable, ghrelin receptor antagonist that is able to pass through the blood brain barrier holds particular promise as a treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD). This protocol is part of a grant project funded by National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) aimed to generate preliminary evidence in AUD on the safety and efficacy of a ghrelin receptor (GHSR1a) antagonist, PF-05190457, an existing molecule available under the NIH-Industry Pilot Program at NCATS. Completed preclinical and clinical (Protocol #14-AA-0042) work has demonstrated the safety of PF-05190457/alcohol interaction. The goal of this protocol is to conduct a proof-of-concept human laboratory study to assess an early-signal of efficacy of PF-05190457 in AUD. Study population: The study population will be AUD individuals (n = 55). Study Design: A within-subject, counterbalanced, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Outcome measures: The primary aim will be to determine whether PF-05190457, compared to placebo, reduces alcohol cue-elicited craving. The main secondary aim will be to determine whether PF-05190457, compared to placebo, reduces brain blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response during exposure to alcohol cues, during a task-based fMRI scan. We will also investigate the effects of PF-05190457 on food craving as well as on food choices using a virtual buffet experimental procedure. All these outcomes will be assessed in the inpatient Unit at the NIH CC. After the inpatient portion of the protocol, patients will be followed-up as outpatients. During the outpatient phase, patients will be offered motivational interviewing and video feedback to explore the effects of this intervention, compared to supportive counseling, on maintaining motivation for alcohol abstinence and inform future studies where medications like PF-05190457 and behavioral treatments may be combined. The outpatient phase is optional for treatment seeking and nontreatment seeking participants.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: Male or female individuals 1865 years old (inclusive) Current Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) by DSM5 criteria based on the SCID Most recent urine drug test is negative Most recent Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol revised (CIWAAr) score is less than or equal to 8 Heart rate less than or equal to 100 on two separate measurements, both assessed after CIWAAr score is less than or equal to 8 Female subjects must be of non childbearing potential as defined by at least one of the following criteria: a) Females 4565 years old, who are menopausal, defined as follow: i) Females who are between 4555 years old: they will be considered menopausal if they satisfy all the following three requirements during screening: 1) they are in amenorrhea, defined as absence of menstruation for the previous 12 months; 2) they have a negative urine pregnancy test; and 3) they have a serum FSH level within the laboratory s reference range for postmenopausal females. ii) Females who are between 5665 years old: they will be considered menopausal if they are in amenorrhea, defined as absence of menstruation for the previous 12 months before screening. OR b) Females 2165 years old, who have a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy. All other female subjects (including females with tubal ligations and females that do NOT have a documented hysterectomy) will be considered to be of childbearing potential. Male subjects must use one of the following methods of contraception from the first dose of study medication and until 28 days after dosing (given that it is unknown whether the effects of this drug can cause birth defects): 1. Abstinence. 2. A condom AND one of the following: Vasectomy for more than 6 months. Female partner who meets one of the following conditions: 1. Has had a tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy; 2. Is post menopausal; 3.
