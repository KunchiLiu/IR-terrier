	<brief_title>Clinical Utility of Capnography in the PACU( Post-anaesthesia Care Unit)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All Study device information is blinded to medical staff but the Study Coordinator will have full access to device measurements, alarms, notification and events via a local Wi-Fi hub sent to a portable tablet. The tablet Case Report Form (CRF) will allow all observation be inserted with a time stamp on the electronic device data. In addition, all electronic data will be collected from the bedside monitor.</detailed_description>
