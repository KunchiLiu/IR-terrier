	<brief_summary>A new era of outcomes for pediatric burn patients has begun as burn care continues to improve. Unfortunately, complete restoration of burn-injured skin may be limited by the development of hypertrophic scarring. Treatment with ablative fractional carbon dioxide laser therapy is one of the newest forms of scar therapy available. Although laser therapy has only been adopted by burn clinicians within the last several years, early evidence suggests that it may offer significant benefits. At present, a well-designed randomized controlled trial that evaluates the effectiveness of laser therapy for improving hypertrophic burn scars in children has not yet been conducted. Thus, the proposed study will answer the following research question: In children aged 1 to 18 years with a hypertrophic burn scar, is the addition of ablative fractional carbon dioxide laser therapy to standard scar management more effective at improving the appearance and texture of the scar compared to standard scar management alone, as measured by the Vancouver Scar Scale from baseline to month 12? Ultimately, the completion of this study may lead to a fundamental change in the standard treatment of pediatric hypertrophic burn scars. In addition, the study findings will also be applicable to children and adults with scars resulting from other etiologies.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This will be a pragmatic, single-centre, 2-arm parallel-group superiority randomized trial to be conducted at the Hospital for Sick Children Burn Program in Toronto, Canada. The trial will use permuted randomized blocks with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Blinding of clinicians and trial participants will not be possible due to the nature of the intervention; however, outcome assessors and data analysts will be blinded.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age 118 years at presentation 2. Patients with a hypertrophic burn scar that has been clinically diagnosed by a burn care specialist (physician, nurse, or rehabilitation therapist)§ 3. Hypertrophic burn scar resulting from any etiology 4. Hypertrophic burn scar is ≥ 2 months post healing 5. Ability to complete English language POSAS questionnaire § Hypertrophic burn scars are characterized by their symptomatic presentation (scars are typically raised, red, and stiff). The individuals who will be involved in the diagnosis will be experienced burn care providers and highly familiar with diagnosing hypertrophic burn scars. 11) Patients with concomitant skin disease (i.e. chronic skin conditions, herpes infection) 2) Patients with a history of keloid scarring 3) Patients who cannot tolerate the intravenous (IV) sedation used to perform laser therapy procedures § 4) Patients who have had previous laser therapy procedures § A standard checklist that was developed by the Anesthesiology Department at SickKids will be used to determine whether a patient can tolerate the IV sedation needed for laser procedures.</criteria>
