	<brief_summary>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is the fastest growing neurodevelopmental disorder in the world. Approximately 1% of the population worldwide is affected by this disorder. Children with ASD exhibit some very stereo-typical behaviors. Their daily functionality depends on very rigid and predictable schedules and routines. Any changes in their schedules can often trigger negative emotional outbursts. The need to come to the hospital for procedures can be one such trigger. The purpose of this study is to examine the post anesthesia behavior outcomes of children with ASD.</brief_summary>
