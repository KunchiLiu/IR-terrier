	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of Low Field Magnetic Stimulation (LFMS) in treating symptoms of depression and anxiety in older adults suffering from bipolar depression. The investigators also aim to assess any cognitive benefits from regular LFMS treatments in older adults suffering from bipolar depression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LFMS: Initial Trial in Geriatric Bipolar Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators have previously observed mood improvement in participants with bipolar depression in a population aged 21-60. Here the investigators hope to extend these results to a similar but new population, geriatric bipolar depression (GPD). In addition to the evaluation of the effect of multiple treatments, as well as observation of the duration of the effect after a delay of one week in this population, the investigators will assess whether this population presents any noticeable difference in tolerance or effect. The protocol involves three treatments on consecutive days with one follow-up visit; this is a crossover study in which the treatments and follow-up are repeated after a one-week washout with the alternate (active, sham). The mechanisms of depression in a geriatric population may differ from those in a younger population. In particular, brain structures and connectivity have changed, and there is the increased risk of comorbid diagnoses such as dementia that might confound treatment and assessment. In this study the investigators hope to extend the findings of LFMS in the general population to directly address the treatment of bipolar depression in a geriatric population.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Subjects will be men or women aged 55 years or older. 2. Subjects will have a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Type I or II, current episode depressed as measure by a MADRS ≥ 20. 3. Subjects must have failed at least one FDA approved treatment for bipolar depression before enrolling in this study. Failed treatment is defined as 8 weeks of treatment at standard dose (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI) , Selective Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRI), mood stabilizer, or typical or atypical antipsychotic). 4. Subjects must be maintained on a stable dose of all psychotropic medications for a period of at least two weeks prior to screening. 5. Subjects must be capable of providing informed consent. Exclusion criteria: 1. Subjects meeting Diagnostic Statistical ManualIVTR (DSMIVTR) criteria for any Axis I disorder other than Bipolar Disorder or an anxiety disorder (eg. Major Depressive Disorder, dementia). 2. Subject has an Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) score ≤ 24. 3. Subject is pregnant or plans on becoming pregnant. 4. Subject has recent history (within 7 days of screening) of ECT or TMS treatment. 5. Subject has recent history of substance abuse (cannot meet DSMIVTR criteria for substance abuse, no significant drug abuse within last 3 months, no history of dependence in last year, no drug use within last month, other than marijuana use). 6. Subject has any contraindication for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) (i.e. Presence of a pacemaker, neurostimulator, or metal in head or neck).</criteria>
