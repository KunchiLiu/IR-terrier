	<brief_summary>The investigators will evaluate the concentrations of cytokeratin 8 in aqueous humor in eyes with exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) before therapy with intravitreal Ranibizumab, and identify associations with visual and anatomical outcome after treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cytokeratin 8 Level in Age-related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this non-randomized, and open-label study, the investigators will prospectively evaluate 40 patients with treatment naive exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) who receive intravitreal ranibizumab injection. A mean volume of 0.1 ml of aqueous humor samples will be taken each time an intravitreal injection is indicated and performed. Cytokeratin 8 level in aqueous humor will be evaluated, and associations of baseline cytokeratin 8 level and visual (the best corrected visual acuity change) and anatomical (optical coherence tomography parameters) after Ranibizumab injection will be investigated.</detailed_description>
