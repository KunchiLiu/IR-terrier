	<brief_summary>The study is evaluating NEOX®CORD 1K, a cryopreserved human umbilical cord allograft. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety, incidence and rate of wound closure following application of the product compared to standard of care in the treatment of difficult to heal diabetic foot ulcers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-healing Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU) Treated With SoC With or Without NEOX®CORD 1K</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 114 patients presenting with a non-healing diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) that is located below the malleoli (plantar only) of at least 4 weeks in duration and a size of at least 0.5 cm2 up to 5.0 cm2 for plantar wounds meeting all inclusion criteria but none of the exclusion criteria will be recruited from different trial sites. All patients will receive sharp debridement to remove non-viable tissue followed by standard of care including a sponsor approved standard dressing with a non-adherent wound contact layer, a foam pad or gauze for moderately draining wounds, a secondary bandage, and off-loading device specific to plantar wounds. Eligible patients return at two consecutive visits approximately two weeks apart to assess wound closure. Patients that exhibit a change of less than 30% reduction of the original surface area of their target wound two weeks after the screening visit following debridement will be randomized into the control group or the treatment group at this baseline visit, Week 1. The control group will continue to receive the standard of care and the treatment group will receive standard of care and NEOX® CORD 1KTM. At each weekly visit, all wounds will be adequately debrided of devitalized and necrotic tissue, and the wound dressing will be replaced. For the treatment group, application of NEOX® CORD 1KTM will be considered at each weekly treatment visit following the Investigator's assessment of wound progression. If the Investigator determines it is medically necessary, additional NEOX® CORD 1KTM will be applied, up to and including Week 12 for a maximum of no more than 10 applications. All wounds that close before Week 13 will be followed for an additional two consecutive weekly visits approximately to confirm closure before exiting the trial. Patients who experience closure at the Week 13 visit will be followed for an additional two consecutive visits up to Week 15 to confirm closure. Patients who do not experience wound closure prior to Week 13 will be considered a failure and complete the end of study/Withdrawal Visit 15 exiting the trial. At each weekly visit, efficacy will be assessed by the extent of wound closure as determined by the wound surface area and volume measured by an electronic measurement device (Silhouette®, ARANZ Medical), after debridement if performed, using a standardized protocol. After confirmation of closure, or at Visit 15, all patients will complete the trial. Safety will be assessed by clinical laboratory tests at screening and at End of Study/Withdrawal Visit 15, adverse event (AE) collection, and focused physical exams.</detailed_description>

Use of excluded concomitant medications, therapies, or procedures during the Runin period. Clinical signs or symptoms of infection of the index ulcer.</criteria>
