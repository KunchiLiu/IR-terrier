	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to 1) evaluate the safety of a series of injections with the AGS-004 product in combination with a series of Vorinostat doses and 2) to help scientists evaluate ways of reactivating latent (non-acting) HIV virus and determine if the immune system can be made stronger to eliminate the activated HIV virus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Trial of the Effect of Vorinostat and AGS-004 on Persistent HIV-1 Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose: Phase I study to measure the potential of AGS-004 combined with Vorinostat to: 1) stimulate expression of persistent proviral HIV from resting CD4+ cells, 2) generate an HIV-specific immune response, and 3) when combined, clear persistent infection in HIV-infected participants in whom viral replication and spread is inhibited by uninterrupted antiretroviral therapy (ART). This is a phase I, single-site, pilot study intended to evaluate the association of serial AGS-004 vaccinations in combination with serial VOR doses on the expression of persistent proviral HIV, HIV-specific immune responses, and the frequency of resting CD4+T cell infection. Twelve participants with durable viral suppression will be enrolled. All participants will receive the same treatment and doses of AGS-004 and VOR and continue their baseline ART regimen throughout the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Confirmation of HIV1 infection HIV infection is defined as documentation by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV1 antigen, plasma HIV1 RNA viral load. NOTE: The term "licensed" refers to a US FDAapproved kit. WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or different test principle (eg, indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV1 RNA viral load. 2. Ages ≥ 18 to &lt; 65 years old. 3. Karnofsky performance status &gt;70. 4. Ability and willingness of participant to give written informed consent. Note: Due to the lack of foreseeable benefit to study volunteers, illiterate or mentally incompetent volunteers will not be enrolled. 5. Able and willing to provide adequate locator information. 6. Stable ART regimen for ≥ 6 months prior to Screening (Visit 1). NOTE: The ART regimen is defined by current treatment guidelines. Participants may have had one or more changes in their ART regimen for tolerance, change of guidelines, or dosing simplification. 7. On potent antiretroviral therapy, defined as at least 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, integrase inhibitor, or a protease inhibitor without interruption (defined as missing doses for more than two consecutive days or more than four cumulative days) in the 24 weeks immediately prior to entry. Other potent fully suppressive antiretroviral combinations will be considered on a casebycase basis. Prior changes in or elimination of medications for easier dosing schedule, intolerance, toxicity, or other reasons are permitted if an alternative suppressive regimen was maintained. 8. All participants must continue cART throughout the study. 9. Able and willing to adhere to protocol therapy and judged adherent to antiretroviral therapy. 10. Plasma HIV1 RNA&lt; 50 copies/mL at two time points in the previous 6 months and never &gt; 50 copies/mL on two consecutive time points in the last 24 months. A single unconfirmed plasma HIV RNA &gt; limit of detection but &lt; 1000 c/mL allowed if a subsequent assay was below the limit of detection; but none in the 6 months preceding the study screening visit. 11. Plasma HIV1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL at screening (Visit 1). 12. CD4+ cell count ≥ 300 cells/mm3 at screening (Visit 1). 13. Availability of an adequate sample of frozen plasma (may have been thawed and refrozen only once) drawn no more than 90 days (and preferably within 30 days) before the start of effective ART therapy defined as the therapy that resulted in HIV RNA suppression to below detectable limits; Note: The VL documented from the HIV plasma sample should preferably be ≥8,000 copies/ml (abstracted from medical records). If there is no viral load measurement associated with the plasma sample, another preART VL measurement of ≥8,000 copies/ml can be used to accept the sample for AGS004 manufacturing. A plasma sample with &lt;8,000 copies/ml may be acceptable and will be considered on a case by case basis. 14. No history of autoimmune disease or autoimmune manifestations. 15. No active HCV infection (HCV antibody negative or no measureable HCV RNA) within 90 days of enrollment (Visit 3). 16. No active HBV infection (measureable HBV DNA or HBVsAg+) within 90 days of enrollment (Visit 3). 17. Ability and willingness to communicate effectively with study personnel; considered reliable, willing, and cooperative in terms of compliance with the protocol requirements. 18. Adequate vascular access for leukapheresis. 19. Able to swallow pills without difficulty. 20. Able and willing to receive Intradermal (ID) injections without difficulty. 21. Women with written documentation of any of the following: 1. prior hysterectomy OR bilateral oophorectomy (removal of both ovaries) 2. bilateral tubal ligation 3. Women with intact uterus and ovaries who have not had a period for ≥ one year AND have a documented FSH level indicating postmenopausal status. 22. All male study volunteers must agree not to participate in a conception process (e.g. active attempt to impregnate, sperm donation, in vitro fertilization) and, if participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, the male study volunteer and his female partner must use two reliable methods of contraception (condoms, with or without a spermicidal agent; a diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide; an IUD; or hormonalbased contraception) simultaneously while receiving the protocolspecified study products and for 6 weeks after stopping the study products. Participants must use a reliable barrier method of contraception (condom, cervical cap) along with another form of contraception. For the female partners of male study volunteers who are receiving ritonavir, estrogenbased contraceptives are not reliable and an alternative method should be suggested. 23.
