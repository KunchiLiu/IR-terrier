	<brief_title>Anti-oxLDL IgM Antibodies as a Novel Therapy for Metabolic Lipid Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Growing evidence describes the central role of oxidized low density lipoproteins (oxLDL) in diseases related to lipid metabolism. Moreover, oxLDL has been shown to be involved in pathological processes such as an inappropriate inflammatory response, disturbance of cholesterol metabolism and dysfunction of the lysosomal apparatus. Relevantly, it has been shown that immunizing mice with Streptococcus pneumoniae results in higher serum titers of anti-oxLDL IgM antibodies due to molecular mimicry.</detailed_description>
