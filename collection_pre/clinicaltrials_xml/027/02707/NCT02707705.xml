	<brief_summary>Preoperative anxiety before cesarean section is common and may be severe. Stress consequences are often deleterious for the mother and for the upcoming newborn. Means to reduce anxiety before cesarean section are limited. Anxiolytic drugs are avoided in the context of the birth of a newborn. Auricular acupuncture has been shown to relieve anxiety disorders. The aim of this study is to evaluate the anxiolytic effect of auricular acupuncture administered before an elective cesarean section. Anxiety will be measured at T0: inclusion (approximately 1-2 hours before cesarean section) and T1: departure to surgical unit (approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour after T0). Patches (needle or needle-free) will be set up at T0 just after the initial anxiety assessment (anxiety Visual Analog Scale aVAS).</brief_summary>
