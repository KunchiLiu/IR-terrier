	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is to evaluate the influence of platelet rich fibrin (PRF) in extraction socket healing with or without particulate bone graft. The hypothesis of this study is that PRF will enhance the extraction socket healing and new bone formation when compared to extraction sockets grafted without PRF.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects ≥ 18 years of age Hopeless or nonrestorable single nonmolar tooth per quadrant with adjacent teeth present Maximum of two teeth can qualify per patient. The buccal plate must be ≥ 1mm in width with a 4wall configuration. Cases requiring minimal sinus grafting (&lt;3mm) Bone grafting limited to the apical portion of the osteotomy site Untreated periodontal disease, endodonticperiodontal disease and/or caries The buccal plate must be ≤ 3mm in width with a 4wall configuration. Patients with uncontrolled or severe systemic disease (Diabetes) Patients with medical conditions or taking medication associated with compromised bone healing (Diabetes, Autoimmune Dysfunction, Prolonged Cortisone Therapy, Chemotherapy, or Bisphosphonate Therapy) Current Smokers Subjects with extensive parafunctional habits (ie; bruxism) Subjects who demonstrate inadequate oral hygiene</criteria>
