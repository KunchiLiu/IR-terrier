	<brief_summary>This study aims to evaluate the acute effects of neonatal hydrokinesiotherapy in reducing stress in newborn preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit. Salivary cortisol samples were collected, pain applying the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale Scale (NIPS), heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation before and after hydrotherapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Newborns have the neurological maturity to perceive pain, including preterm. In the environment of the neonatal intensive care unit newborns are subject to environmental stress and numerous painful interventions. Based on the physiological properties of water, it is known that the hydrotherapy promotes comfort, reduces stress, and as a resource for treatment of various diseases. This study aims to evaluate the acute effects of neonatal hydrokinesiotherapy in reducing stress in newborn preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit.</detailed_description>
