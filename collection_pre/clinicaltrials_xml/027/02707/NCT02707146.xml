	<brief_title>Aligning Patients and Their Primary Care Providers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this clinical trial is to enroll new and/or complex patients and their physicians in a 12-month randomized study. At each scheduled primary care visit during the trial period, Intervention Patients will be provided with a waiting room Tablet loaded with the "Visit Planner" intervention tool designed to support prioritization and discussion of top health care concerns. Control Patients will be given a written educational handout to review. Patient-centered outcomes will be obtained at baseline and after visits using validated survey instruments. Clinical outcomes focus on differences in quality of care. If successful, this approach to aligning patient and provider visit priorities can potentially be disseminated and adapted to a wide variety of different care settings.</detailed_description>
