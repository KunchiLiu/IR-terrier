	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to: 1. determine if a smartphone enhanced treatment for LETS ACT (LETS ACT-SE) is associated with increased long term treatment engagement, and in turn, improved long term treatment outcomes, and 2. use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify the effects of LETS ACT-SE on the neuromarkers of reward sensitivity.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Comorbid substance use disorder (SUD) and depression is highly prevalent and associated with elevated rates of post treatment relapse to substance use, HIV risk behavior, and associated poor mental and physical health outcomes. Further, rates of substance use and depression disproportionately affect minority groups and those living in poverty. Although efficacious, the often complex, specialized nature of CBT poses problems in its integration into substance use treatment programs. Budget cuts for mental health and substance use treatment both nationally and in the state of North Carolina, reduce availability of publically funded treatment programs and staff to patient ratios. To address this limitation, a behavioral activation (BA) treatment, the Life Enhancement Treatment for Substance Use (LETS ACT), was developed to treat depressive symptoms among a predominantly African American sample of low income illicit drug users currently receiving residential substance use treatment. Collectively, two Stage I studies and 1 year follow-up data from the investigators Stage II R01DA026424 indicate that compared to a control condition, LETS ACT is associated with significantly better outcomes for treatment retention, post treatment abstinence, HIV sexual risk behavior, depressive symptoms, and environmental reward. Although these strong outcomes suggest that LETS ACT may be ready for a Stage III dissemination trial, it is of note that there was a significant indirect effect of LETS ACT homework compliance on post treatment substance use and HIV sexual risk behavior via the theoretically proposed BA mechanism of action, environmental reward. In the context of limited access to care, these findings point to the need to identify cost-effective delivery-vehicles to increase treatment engagement outside of clinician sessions. Further, identifying neuroscience based biomarkers (neuromarkers) underlying key theoretical aspects of BA (i.e., reward sensitivity), and their relation to heterogeneity in BA treatment response among substance users with depression, are critical for the identification of accurately targeted interventions.</detailed_description>
