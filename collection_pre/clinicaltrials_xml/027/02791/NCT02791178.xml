	<brief_summary>The overall objective of this research proposal is to use OCT to investigate those morphological culprit plaque characteristics associated with the risk of developing MVO in reperfused STEMI patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optical Coherence Tomography in STEMI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific research objectives include: 1. To use OCT to determine the type of plaque (plaque rupture, plaque erosion or calcified nodule) most associated with the presence and severity of MVO (as measured by IMR and cardiac MRI). 2. To use OCT to investigate the relationship between the extent of tissue protrusion and the amount of residual stent thrombus with the presence and severity of MVO (as measured by IMR and cardiac MRI).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Confirmed STEMI as per the incharge consultant based on presenting history, ECG and angiogram findings. 2. &lt; 12 hours of onset of chest pain. 3. Ability to provide informed consent 1. Previous myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass graft surgery 2. Cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock 3. Inability to advance the OCT catheter or to obtain good image quality 4. Ostial lesions 5. Significant renal impairment 6. Contraindications for cardiac MRI 7. Contraindication for adenosine (for IMR measurement)</criteria>
