	<brief_summary>This multicenter multinational prospective two-arm matched-pair observational study aims to establish a prospective comparison of active lipoprotein apheresis treatment approved and conducted according to German guidelines for the indication of elevated Lp(a) versus a maximum tolerated lipid-lowering therapy as standard care. Due to the prospective character and the inclusion of a control arm, this will be the first clinical study that can confirm the relevance of the established approach to use lipoprotein apheresis in those subjects and its effects to reduce the individual cardiovascular risk. The optimized management of subjects in the control group (not receiving lipoprotein apheresis) will also help to clarify the controversial issue, to which extent intensive medical care per se can influence the occurence of subsequent cardiovascular events. Primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the clinical benefit of Lp(a) reduction using lipoprotein apheresis on myocardial infarction, PCI, CABG and death from cardiovascular disease. The primary objective of this study evaluates the clinical benefit of weekly lipoprotein apheresis in subjects with progressive cardiovascular disease, as accepted by the German Federal Joint Committee as indication for subjects with elevated Lp(a). Comparator will be matched subjects under maximum tolerated lipid lowering therapy without access to lipoprotein apheresis treatment. The clinical benefit will be defined as the reduction of the composite endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as either myocardial infarction, PCI, CABG or death from cardiovascular disease over a period of at least 2 years after completion of visit 1b and until at least 60 events of the primary end-point occurred in group B. If the number of at least 60 documented primary endpoint events within 2 years of the completion of enrolment did not occur, the study will continue until this number of primary endpoint events has accumulated.</brief_summary>
