	<brief_title>SPECT/CT Imaging of Skeletal Muscle Perfusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a progressive atherosclerotic disease of the lower limbs that affects 8 to 10 million Americans, and is more prevalent and progresses more quickly in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). There is a critical need for a standard non-invasive approach to assess response to treatment by three-dimensional (3D) perfusion to vascular territories of the feet in PAD patients. Assessing the response to treatment is particularly important in DM patients, who suffer from poor distal runoff and often require more distal revascularization to achieve limb salvage. In this clinical study, the investigators will evaluate lower extremity skeletal muscle perfusion in the feet of healthy controls and PAD patients who are undergoing revascularization using conventional sodium iodide SPECT/CT imaging, as well as dynamic SPECT/CT imaging with a unique cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) system. Healthy control subjects (n=15) will be recruited from Yale University and the greater New Haven area. In addition to healthy control subjects, 35 PAD patients with previously diagnosed diabetes will be recruited from Vascular Surgery and Interventional Cardiology at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Patients who are undergoing revascularization procedures will be identified and asked to participate in the imaging study prior to their revascularization procedure and will be imaged once again 1-3 days following revascularization, prior to hospital discharge. Subjects will undergo resting perfusion imaging of the feet using two separate SPECT/CT systems. They will be injected with a low dose radiotracer. In healthy control subjects, arterial blood will be continuously sampled from the radial artery for calculation of a blood input function and K1 values for foot angiosomes. Additionally, we will sample heated venous "arterialized" blood from a hand vein retrograde to evaluate the potential for heated venous blood in the calculation of a blood input function, thus eliminating the need for arterial access in future PAD patient studies.</detailed_description>
