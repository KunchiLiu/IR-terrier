	<brief_summary>This proposed study aim to: 1. Determine intra-LV pressure-time profile non-invasively using recently developed echo Doppler VFM analysis and applanation tonometry and myocardial elastic properties, in HF subjects (both HFNEF and HFREF) compared to normal volunteers. 2. Correlate calculated intra-LV pressure parameters with NT ProBNP levels.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Heart Failure Ventricular Pressure Time Profile</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure (HF) is a common disease and its syndrome is difficult to diagnose. HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF) may be diagnosed based on impaired LVEF (&lt;50%). However, diagnosis of HF with normal ejection fraction (HFNEF) is mainly based on the presence of signs and symptoms. Central to diagnosis of HF is estimation of intra-cardiac pressure, which can only be obtained from invasive catheterization. This proposed study aim to: 1. Determine intra-LV pressure-time profile non-invasively using recently developed echo Doppler VFM analysis and applanation tonometry and myocardial elastic properties, in HF subjects (both HFNEF and HFREF) compared to normal volunteers. 2. Correlate calculated intra-LV pressure parameters with NT ProBNP levels.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Either 1. has presented to hospital with a primary diagnosis of Heart Failure or 2. is attending a hospital clinic for management of Heart Failure within 6 months of an episode of decompensated heart failure, which either: resulted in a hospital admission (primary diagnosis) or was treated in outpatient clinic LVEF &gt;50% is used as cutoff value for HFNEF and LVEF &lt; 50% for HFREF. NTproBNP within 7 days of admission &gt; 220pg/ml. If there is no result available, NTproBNP on the same day as echo scan must be &gt; 220pg/ml. Haemodynamically significant valve disease defined as more than mild degree of valve stenosis, or more than moderate degrees of mitral or aortic valve regurgitation. History of valvular disease, i.e. rheumatic heart disease and/or having undergone valvular replacement. Isolated right heart failure due to pulmonary disease. Presence of haemodynamically significant obstructive lesions of left ventricular outflow tract. History of any organ transplant or who was on a transplant list (life expectancy &lt; 6 months at time of enrollment). Presence of endstage renal failure. Pregnancy. The patient is unable to provide written informed consent.</criteria>
