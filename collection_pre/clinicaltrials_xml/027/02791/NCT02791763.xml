	<brief_summary>This is a Phase III, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study to compare the efficacy (verification of noninferiority) and safety of GSK1278863 administered for 52 weeks versus epoetin beta pegol in approximately 270 Japanese non-dialysis (ND) and 50 peritoneal dialysis (PD) subjects with renal anemia. The study will consist of 2 cohorts of different subject populations. This study consists of a 4-week screening phase, a 52-week treatment phase (including the primary efficacy evaluation period [Weeks 40 to 52]), and a 4-week follow-up phase following the treatment phase. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of GSK1278863 to epoetin beta pegol based on hemoglobin (Hgb) in the ND subject population included in this study. Study results will be used as pivotal study data for an NDA submitted for GSK1278863 for the treatment of renal anemia in Japan.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age (informed consent): &gt;=20 years of age Stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD) (ND subjects only): CKD stages 3, 4, and 5 defined by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the Japanese Society of NephrologyChronic Kidney Disease Initiatives (JSNCKDI) formula Dialysis: Not on dialysis for at least 12 weeks prior to screening (ND subjects) On peritoneal dialysis (PD subjects) Use of erythropoiesisstimulating agent (ESA): ESA nonusers: Have not used ESAs for 8 weeks prior to screening ESA users: Have used the same ESA for 8 weeks prior to screening. However, in the ND subjects, the dose of darbepoetin alfa or epoetin beta pegol must be stable (administered once every 4 weeks and up to onestep dose change during 8 weeks prior to screening). Hemoglobin (Hgb): Determined at the site using an Hgb analyzer ESA nonusers: &gt;=8.0 g/dL and &lt;11.0 g/dL ESA users: &gt;=9.0 g/dL and &lt;=13.0 g/dL Iron parameters: Ferritin &gt;100 nanograms per millilitres (ng/mL) or transferrin saturation (TSAT) &gt;20% (screening verification only) Gender (screening verification only): Female or male. Females: Not pregnant [demonstrated to be negative for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine or serum], not breastfeeding, and meet at least one of the following: 1. Females of nonchildbearing potential are defined as follows: Premenopausal with at least one of the following and no plans to utilise assisted reproductive techniques (e.g., in vitro fertilisation or donor embryo transfer): History of bilateral tubal ligation or salpingectomy History of hysteroscopic tubal occlusion and postoperatively documented bilateral tubal obstruction History of hysterectomy History of bilateral oophorectomy Postmenopausal defined as: females 60 years of age or older or ; In females &lt;60 years of age, 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases a blood sample with postmenopausal follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] and estradiol concentrations is confirmatory [specified reference ranges]). Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the most effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrolment. 2. Females of childbearing potential must agree to comply with one of the contraception methods listed as requirements in "GSK Listing of Most Effective Contraceptive Methods for Females of Childbearing Potential" from 28 days prior to the first dose of study medication until the completion of the followup visit (for subjects randomized to the GSK1278863 group) or 7 weeks after the last dose of study treatment (for subjects randomized to the Epoetin beta pegol group). Informed consent: Written informed consent, including adherence to the requirements and conditions specified in the consent form and the protocol, must be obtained from each subject as specified in Protocol. Chronic kidney disease (CKD)related criteria Dialysis Cohort 1: Start or plan to initiate dialysis during the study Cohort 2: Plan to stop peritoneal dialysis or start hemodialysis during the study Kidney transplant: Planned livingrelated kidney transplant during the study Anemiarelated criteria Aplasia: History of bonemarrow hypoplasia or pure red cell aplasia Other causes of anemia: pernicious anemia, thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, or myelodysplastic syndromes Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding: Evidence of actively bleeding gastric, duodenal, or esophageal ulcer disease OR clinically significant GI bleeding within 8 weeks prior to screening or during a period from screening to Day 1. Cardiovascular diseaserelated criteria Myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, or transient ischemic attack: Diagnosed within 8 weeks prior to screening or during a period from screening to Day 1. Heart failure: Class IV heart failure, as defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification system QTc (screening verification only): QTc &gt;500 msec or QTc &gt;530 msec in subjects with bundle branch block Note: QT interval corrected using the Bazett's formula (QTcB) will be used, and Electrocardiogram (ECG) can be mechanically or manually read. Other diseaserelated criteria Liver disease (if any of the following occurs): Alanine transaminase (ALT) &gt;2×upper limit of normal (ULN) Bilirubin &gt;1.5×ULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5×ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin is &lt;35%) Current unstable active liver or biliary disease (generally defined by the onset of ascites, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, esophageal/gastric varices, persistent jaundice, or cirrhosis) Note: Stable liver disease (including asymptomatic gallstones, chronic hepatitis B/C, or Gilbert's syndrome) is acceptable if the subject otherwise meets entry criteria.. Malignancy: History of malignancy within 2 years prior to screening, or currently receiving treatment for cancer, (PD subjects only) complex renal cystic &gt;3 centimeters (cm) (II F, III or IV based on the Bosniak classification) Note (ND subjects and PD subjects): The only exception is squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma of the skin that has been definitively treated &gt;=8 weeks before screening. In the opinion of the investigator, Hgb increase to the target range (11.013.0 g/dL) is medically risky. Concomitant medication and other study treatmentrelated criteria Iron: Planned use of intravenous iron during the screening phase or during a period from Day 1 to Week 4 Note: Oral iron is acceptable. However, the same dose regimen must be used throughout the screening phase and from Day 1 to Week 4. Antihyperphosphatemic agents containing iron (e.g., ferric citrate hydrate) are also acceptable only if used for at least 12 weeks prior to screening. However, they must be continued throughout the screening phase from Day 1 to Week 4. Severe allergic reactions: History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions or hypersensitivity to excipients in the investigational product or epoetin beta pegol Drugs and supplements: Use or planned use of any prescription or nonprescription drugs or dietary supplements that are prohibited during the study period (prohibited medications: strong inducers and inhibitor of Cytochrome P450 2C8 [CYP2C8]) Prior investigational product exposure: Use of an investigational agent within 30 days or five half lives of the investigational agent (whichever is longer) Prior treatment with GSK1278863: Any prior treatment with GSK1278863 for a treatment duration of &gt;30 days General healthrelated criteria Other conditions: Any other condition, clinical or laboratory abnormality, or examination finding that the investigator (or subinvestigator) considers would put the subject at unacceptable risk, which may affect study compliance or prevent understanding of the aims or investigational procedures or possible consequences of the study.</criteria>
