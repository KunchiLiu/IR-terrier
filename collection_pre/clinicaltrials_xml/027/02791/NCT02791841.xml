	<brief_summary>The purpose of the present study is to compare the effectiveness of Rhythmic Reading Training (RRT), a computer-assisted intervention method that combines sublexical reading exercises with rhythm processing, and that of an intervention resulting from the combination of two yet validated treatments for DD, namely, Bakker's Visual Hemisphere-Specific Stimulation (VHSS) and the Action Video Game Training (AVG). Finally, the effectiveness of the administration of only AVG is intended to be compared to other treatments. All interventions are administered for 13 hours over 9 days to a group of Italian students with DD aged 8-12.</brief_summary>
