	<brief_summary>The project studies auditory processing after brain damage (in temporal and/or frontal areas) and in migraine. The auditory processes investigated are attention, short-term memory, sound-induced emotions. To characterize auditory deficits after brain damage or in migraine, neuropsychological assessments are combined with neurophysiological markers (Electro-encephalography: EEG, Magneto-encephalography: MEG, Magnetic Resonance Imaging: MRI).</brief_summary>
