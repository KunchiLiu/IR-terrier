	<criteria>Present with mild AD dementia based on the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the Alzheimer's Association (AA) disease diagnostic criteria as determined by a qualified clinician approved by the Sponsor or designee. MiniMental State Examination score of 20 to 26 inclusive at screening visit. Has a florbetapir PET scan consistent with the presence of amyloid pathology at screening. Significant neurological disease affecting the central nervous system (CNS), other than AD, that may affect cognition or ability to complete the study, including but not limited to, other dementias, serious infection of the brain, Parkinson's disease, multiple concussions, or epilepsy or recurrent seizures (except febrile childhood seizures). Ocular pathology that significantly limits ability to reliably evaluate vision or the retina. Use of strong inducers of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) within 30 days before baseline. Sensitivity to florbetapir or ¹⁸FAV1451. Contraindication to MRI or PET or poor venous access for blood draws.</criteria>
