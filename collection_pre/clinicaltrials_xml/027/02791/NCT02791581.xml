	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Injury, Exercise Intolerance and Fatigue After Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Stage I-III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>840 women aged ≥18 years old scheduled to receive Adj-C for Stage I-III breast cancer and a comparison population of 160 women without cancer (1,000 total). Equal numbers of women will be recruited aged &lt; 52 vs. &gt; 52. At baseline, innovative MRI measures of CV function (LV and aorta); measurements of submaximal (6-minute walk) and, on half of the cohort, maximal (peak VO2) exercise capacity; questionnaire data to assess fatigue and behavioral and psychosocial risk factors; and biomarkers will be collected. Measurements will be repeated at 3±1, 12±2 (after the completion of radiation) and 24±2 months after initiation of Adj-C. This study will assess the relevance of pre-existing factors such as age, black/white race, hypertension, smoking (yes/no), diabetes, coronary artery disease, menopause status, CV medications, and physical activity on the study outcomes. Also, this study will assess dynamic change in modifiable CV risk factors (including BMI, blood pressure, serum lipids, serum glucose, physical activity, psychosocial factors, lifestyle behaviors), and the cancer treatment including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and surgery.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria for Women with Stage I III Breast Cancer: Stage IIII female breast cancer (including inflammatory and newly diagnosed recurrent breast cancer) &gt; 18 years old Scheduled to receive chemotherapy Able to hold breath for 10 seconds ECOG 0 2 Exclusion Criteria for Women with Stage IIII Breast Cancer: Those with ferromagnetic cerebral aneurysm clips or other intracranial metal; pacemakers, defibrillators, functioning neurostimulator devices or other implanted noncompatible MRI devices If previously measured, known LVEF &lt;50% Inability to exercise on a treadmill or stationary cycle Symptomatic claustrophobia Unable to provide informed consent Pregnant or breasting feeding. Due to unknown risks and potential harm from the MRI to the unborn fetus a negative serum pregnancy test within 10 days prior to registration is required in women with childbearing potential. For this reason women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence (not having sex), oral contraceptives, intrauterine device (IUD), DeProvera, tubal ligation, or vasectomy of the partner (with confirmed negative sperm counts) in a monogamous relationship (same partner). An acceptable, although less reliable method involves the careful use of condoms and spermicidal foam or gel and/or cervical cap or sponge prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her study physician immediately. The cardiac MRI should be delayed until after childbirth. Inclusion Criteria for Women Free of Cancer for Comparison: Healthy female without known coronary artery disease &gt; 18 years old ECOG = 0 or 1 Able to exercise on a treadmill or stationary cycle BMI &lt;35 No hx. of cancer Never received chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, or had breast surgery if previously measured, LVEF ≥ 50% Exclusion Criteria for Women Free of Cancer for Comparison: Inflammatory conditions such as lupus or inflammatory bowel disease or chronic health conditions consisting of, existing CV risk factors such as: Coronary artery disease or heart failure. Other exclusions include those with ferromagnetic cerebral aneurysm clips or other intracranial metal; pacemakers, defibrillators, functioning neurostimulator devices or other implanted noncompatible MRI devices Symptomatic claustrophobia Unable to provide informed consent Pregnant or breasting feeding.
