	<brief_summary>This pilot trial studies a structured exercise program intervention in improving physical activity in older patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing cancer therapy. Patients with hematologic malignancies are at an increased risk of functional dependence and injury. Structured exercise programs, such as the Otago exercise programme (OEP), may improve balance, strength, and prevent fall-related injury in older patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing cancer therapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the feasibility of implementing a structured exercise program by evaluating recruitment and retention, exercise program adherence, sustainability, adverse events, and implementation challenge. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To calculate preliminary effect sizes of the impact of an exercise program in patients with hematologic malignancy undergoing therapy, as measured by: - Cancer and Aging Research Group (CARG) Geriatric Assessment Tool parameters. - Change in Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). - Number and severity of falls. - Impact of motivation and self-efficacy on adherence. - Hospital readmission rates (if applicable). - Length of inpatient stays (if applicable). - Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) for Health related quality of life (HRQL). - Correlative analysis of peripheral blood biomarkers of aging and inflammation (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A [p16], inflammatory biomarkers, immunosenescence, micro [mi] ribonucleic acid [RNA]). OUTLINE: Patients attend 8 physical therapy visits twice monthly for 4 months or until transplant. Patients also undergo an individualized exercise program at home for 6 months. The program comprises 3 main components: walking over 30 minutes twice a week, strengthening and balance retraining exercise over 30 minutes three times a week. After completion of study, patients are followed up at 6 months.</detailed_description>
