	<brief_summary>This trial is designed to evaluate, in adult participants with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and inadequate glycemic control on sub-maximal metformin mono-therapy (1000 mg/day), the effect of up-titration of metformin plus the addition of sitagliptin compared to up-titration of metformin alone on glycemic control. The primary hypotheses of this study are that up-titration of metformin to 2000 mg/day (1000 mg, twice daily [b.i.d]) plus the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg/day provides greater reduction in hemoglobin A1C (A1C) compared to metformin up-titration alone and that this treatment is safe and well-tolerated.</brief_summary>

A known hypersensitivity or intolerance to any DPP4 inhibitor. A known hypersensitivity or intolerance to metformin, including participants who were previously unable to tolerate metformin at a dose &gt;1000 mg/day or who have evidence of intolerance to the dose of metformin they are currently taking. Has been treated with any of the following agents within 8 weeks (12 weeks for thiazolidinediones) of study participation: 1.

Glucagonlike peptide1 receptor (GLP1R) agonists 5. Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors 6. Bromocriptine (Cycloset™) 7. Colesevelam (Welchol™) 8. Any other AHA with the exception of protocolapproved agents Intends to initiate weight loss medication during the study period Has undergone bariatric surgery within 12 months of Screening visit Has started a weight loss medication or a medication associated with weight changes within the prior 12 weeks A history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, arterial revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack, NYHA functional class IIIIV heart failure, or severe peripheral vascular disease (e.g., claudication with minimal activity, a nonhealing ischemic ulcer, or disease which is likely to require surgery or angioplasty) within 3 months of study participation A history of malignancy ≤5 years prior to study participation (i.e., the diagnosis occurred, or any evidence of residual or recurrent disease occurred, within the past 5 years), except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or in situ cervical cancer. Note: A patient with any history of melanoma, leukemia, lymphoma, or renal cell carcinoma is excluded. Has human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1. with AIDS related complications, or 2. has not been on a stable antiretroviral regimen for &gt;6 months, or 3. has progressive disease, or 4. using agents associated with glucose intolerance such as nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) such as azidothymidine (AZT), didanosine (ddI), and stavudine (d4T). Is on or likely to require treatment for ≥14 consecutive days or repeated courses of pharmacologic doses of corticosteroids. Has undergone a major surgical procedure within 12 weeks prior to signing the informed consent form (ICF) or has major surgery planned during the trial. Currently participating, or has participated, in a study in which the participant received an investigational compound or used an investigational device within the prior 12 weeks of signing informed consent or is not willing to refrain from participating in another study. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, has a positive urine pregnancy test, or is planning to conceive or donate eggs during the study, including 14 days following the last dose of blinded investigational product.
