	<criteria>Histologic or cytologic confirmation of advanced solid tumor. For monotherapy, no prior treatment with a PD1 or PDL1 agent is allowed. For LY3300054 combination therapy, previous immunotherapy is acceptable, if the following criteria are met: Must not have experienced a toxicity that led to permanent discontinuation of prior immunotherapy. Must have completely recovered or recovered to baseline prior to screening from any prior adverse events (AEs) occurring while receiving prior immunotherapy. Must not have experienced a Grade ≥3 immunerelated AE or an immunerelated neurologic or ocular AE of any grade while receiving prior immunotherapy. Must not have required the use of additional immunosuppressive agents other than corticosteroids for the management of an AE, not have experienced recurrence of an AE if rechallenged, and not currently require maintenance doses of &gt;10 milligrams prednisone or equivalent per day. Have at least 1 measurable lesion assessable using standard techniques by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Have adequate organ function. Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale. Have submitted a tumor tissue sample, as follows: For participants entering the Phase 1a dose escalation: have submitted, if available, an archival tumor tissue sample. For participants participating ONLY in the Phase 1b expansion: have submitted tissue sample from either a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion or a recent biopsy, defined by ≤3 years since last documented progression of disease. Have an estimated life expectancy of ≥12 weeks, in the judgment of the investigator. Have a serious concomitant systemic disorder including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active hepatitis B virus (HBV), active hepatitis C virus (HCV), active autoimmune disorder or disease requiring high dose of steroids. Have a bowel obstruction, history or presence of inflammatory enteropathy or extensive intestinal resection or chronic diarrhea. Have evidence of interstitial lung disease that is symptomatic or may interfere with the detection or management of suspected drugrelated pulmonary toxicity or active, noninfectious pneumonitis. Have an active infection requiring systemic therapy. Have moderate or severe cardiovascular disease. Have symptomatic or uncontrolled brain metastases, spinal cord compression, or leptomeningeal disease requiring concurrent treatment. Have received a live vaccine within 30 days before the first dose of study treatment.</criteria>
