	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the potential for induction of photosensitization by P-3074 0.25% finasteride cutaneous solution compared to that of placebo vehicle cutaneous solution and a negative control (0.9% sodium chloride, NaCl)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Photosensitization Study in Androgenetic Alopecia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy male volunteers, drawn from the general population, will be treated with P-3074 solution, placebo vehicle control and 0.9% sodium chloride USP (negative control) by using 6 induction applications on the back area and Ultraviolet A (UVA)/Ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiations during the 3 week induction period, a 10 day rest period, and a challenge phase of a 24-hour patch application, UVA and UVB irradiation followed by evaluation of photosensitization over the subsequent 72 hours.</detailed_description>
