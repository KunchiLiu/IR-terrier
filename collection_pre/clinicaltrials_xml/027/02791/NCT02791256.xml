	<brief_summary>This multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of increasing the dose of peginterferon alfa-2a (Pegasys) in participants with Genotype 1/4/5/6 CHC and an early non-response to a standard course of peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin. The study will consist of screening (4 weeks), treatment (32 weeks), and follow-up (24 weeks).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participants with serologic evidence of chronic hepatitis C infection by an antiHCV antibody test Participants had to have been receiving their first treatment for chronic hepatitis C (i.e. previously naive to any therapy) consisting of peginterferon alfa2a plus ribavirin for 16 weeks (+/ 10 days), without reaching a negative or 2log drop of Serum Hepatitis C Virus Ribonucleic Acid (HCVRNA) at Week 12 of therapy as compared to pretreatment value, and must still be on therapy (no wash out) HCVRNA quantifiable by a test reporting in international units Compensated liver disease (ChildPugh Grade A clinical classification) Participants with cirrhosis or transition to cirrhosis had to have an abdominal ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan without evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and a serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) less than (&lt;)100 nanogram pe milliliter (ng/mL) within 6 months of study entry Negative urine or blood pregnancy test Participants had to be using two forms of effective contraception during treatment and during the 6 months after treatment end Able to participate and to comply with the study restrictions Women with ongoing pregnancy or who are breast feeding and male partners of women who were pregnant Neutrophil count &lt;1,500 cells/cubic millimeter (mm^3) or platelet count &lt;90,000 cells/mm^3 before initiation of the ongoing treatment regimen; or neutrophil count &lt;750 cells/mm^3 or platelet count &lt;50,000 cells/mm^3 at screening while still on therapy with peginterferon alfa2a plus ribavirin Hemoglobin (Hgb) &lt;12 gram per deciliter (g/dL) before initiation of the ongoing treatment regimen; or Hgb &lt;10 g/dL at screening while still on therapy with peginterferon alfa2a plus ribavirin for at least 12 weeks Serum creatinine level greater than (&gt;)1.5 times the upper limit of normal at screening Therapy with any systemic antiviral, antineoplastic or immunomodulatory treatment (including supraphysiologic doses of steroids and radiation) other than the currently failing Pegasys plus ribavirin combination therapy less than or equal to (&lt;=) 6 months prior to the first dose of study drug Positive test for hepatitis A immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody (antiHAV IgM Ab), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antihepatitis B core IgM antibody (antiHBc IgM Ab), antiHuman Immunodeficiency Virus antibody (antiHIV Ab) History or other evidence of a medical condition associated with chronic liver disease other than HCV History of bleeding from esophageal varices or other conditions consistent with decompensated liver disease, severe psychiatric disease (especially depression), severe seizure disorder, thyroid disease, immunologically mediated disease, chronic pulmonary disease, cardiac disease, major organ transplantation or other evidence of severe illness, malignancy Evidence of drug abuse including excessive alcohol consumption</criteria>
