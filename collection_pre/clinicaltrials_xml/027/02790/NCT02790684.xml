	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1, open-label, single-center, non-randomized study to assess the mass balance of a single oral dose of DS-8500a in healthy male subjects, 18 years (y) to 60 y of age, inclusive. The radiolabeled investigational medicinal product will be administered to 12 healthy male subjects in 2 cohorts of 6 subjects each.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Assessing the Mass Balance of a Single Oral Dose of [14C] DS-8500a in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Healthy male subjects between 18 years (y) and 60 y of age, inclusive. Subjects must have a body mass index (BMI) of 19 kg/m2 to 30 kg/m2, inclusive; or, if outside the range, not clinically significant and agreed with Sponsor and primary investigator (PI). Subjects must be in good health as determined at Screening and Day 1 (Checkin) assessed by medical history (Screening only), physical examination, vital signs, hematology, virology (Screening only), and urinalysis. Laboratory results (serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) must not be outside the normal range or if outside the normal range, then the PI considers the value not clinically relevant. Subjects must agree not to participate in any other investigational study until the end of the trial. Subjects must be willing to abstain from grapefruit/grapefruit juice and Seville oranges from 10 d before the first dose of study medication and throughout the study. Subjects must be willing to refrain from consuming food or beverages containing caffeine/xanthine and alcohol starting 24 h prior to Checkin on Day 1. Subjects must be able to understand and willing to comply with all study requirements, and willing to allow the collection of all blood, fecal, and urine specimens. Subjects must give written informed consent to participate in the study prior to Screening. Consent will be documented by the subject's dated signature that will be counter signed and dated by a witness. The appropriate HIPAA authorization forms must be signed and dated by the subject. Male subjects must agree to contraception (condom with spermicide) in addition to having their female partner (if of childbearing potential) use another form of contraception (eg, an intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, oral contraceptive, injectables, or subdermal hormonal implant) from the first dose until 12 wk following the last dose administration. Also, male subjects must not donate sperm for a period of 12 wk following drug administration. Subject must have a history of regular bowel movements (defined in this instance as a bowel movement at least every other d without the need for medication). Subjects must be willing to eat entire meals and snacks provided during the stay at the research facility and understand that the diet will include foods with high fiber content and possibly prune juice. Subjects who have received any prescription or nonprescription (overthecounter [OTC]) systemic medication, topical medication, or herbal supplement (including St. John's Wort [hypericin]) within 14 d prior to dosing. Subjects who participated in a clinical study involving administration of an investigational drug (new chemical entity), or a marketed drug within 30 d or 5 halflives of that investigational drug or marketed drug prior to dosing. Subjects who were administered radiolabeled substances or exposed to significant radiation (eg, serial Xrays or computed tomography (CT) scans, barium meal, occupational exposure etc) within 12mo of dosing. Subjects who have been involved in an occupation that requires monitoring for radiation exposure (eg, Xray technician). Liver function (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], total bilirubin [TBL]) test results range should not be be &gt; upper limit of normal at Screening and during Enrollment on Day 1. Subjects with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (using Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] equation) &lt; 90 mL/min. Subjects with Fridericia's corrected QT interval (QTcF) interval duration &gt; 450 ms, obtained as an average from the 3 ECG recorder's measurements on triplicate Screening ECGs (3 ECGs in close succession at least 1 min apart) taken after at least 10 min of quiet rest in the supine position. Subjects with abnormal waveform morphology on any of the ECGs at the Screening and on Day 1 that would preclude accurate measurement of the time for both ventricular depolarization and repolarization (QT) interval duration. Subject who have participated in a previous DS8500a study within 6mo prior to the screening. Subjects with a history of significant allergic response to any drug except penicillin. Subjects with a history of any serious disorder, including cardiovascular, hematologic, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, connective tissue disease, uncontrolled endocrine/metabolic, oncologic (within the last 5 y), neurologic, and psychiatric diseases, or any disorder that may prevent the successful completion of the study. Subjects who consume more than 28 units of alcohol per wk (one unit of alcohol equals onehalf pint of beer, 4 oz of wine, or 1 oz of spirits) or those subjects who have a significant history of alcoholism or drug/chemical abuse within 2 y prior to Screening. Subjects who have used tobacco products or nicotinecontaining products (including smoking cessation aids, such as gums or patches) within 6mo prior to dosing. Subjects with positive results on tests for drugs of abuse, cotinine, or alcohol at Screening and on Day 1. Subjects who test positive for HBsAg, or antibody to HCV or HIV, at Screening. Subject is employed by the clinic. Subjects who have a familial relationship with another study participant. Subjects who, in the opinion of the PI, should not participate in the study.</criteria>
