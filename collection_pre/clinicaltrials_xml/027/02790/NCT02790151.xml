	<brief_summary>Memory deficits after brain damage are common and there is still a need for evaluated therapy methods. In this study we compare two therapeutic interventions and investigate whether therapy effects can be found on neuropsychological tests and on a test measuring memory in everyday life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Memory Rehabilitation by Means of Working Memory Training in Combination With a Recollection Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the interventiongroup a computerbased working memory training is combined with a recollection training (repitition-lag procedure). The patients in the active control group undergo the standard memory therapy that is normally provided in the rehabilitation centre (with a focus on the acquisition and execution of different memory strategies, e.g. the spaced retrieval method). The patients in both groups are tested on different neuropsychological tests before and after nine hours of therapy. Additionally, a test is conducted that assesses memory in everyday life.</detailed_description>
