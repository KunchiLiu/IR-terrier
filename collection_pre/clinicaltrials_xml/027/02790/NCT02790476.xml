	<brief_summary>In collaboration with the San Diego Medical Examiner's Office and the State of California's controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES), the investigators propose to review opioid poisonings over the past 12 months and will send letters to prescribers in California when at least one of the provider's prescription(s) was filled by a patient who died of an opioid poisoning in San Diego County. The letters will be non-judgmental and factual, explaining that a patient of the provider who was being treated with prescription narcotics died of an opioid poisoning. The letter will also encourage judicious prescribing including use of the CURES system before prescribing. The investigators will evaluate physician prescribing practices over 24 months 12 months pre- and 12 months post-letter using data from the CURES database. The investigators' hypothesis is that letters will make the risk of opioids more cognitively available and that physicians will respond by prescribing opioids more carefully. This will result in fewer deaths due to misuse and more frequent use of the CURES system.</brief_summary>
