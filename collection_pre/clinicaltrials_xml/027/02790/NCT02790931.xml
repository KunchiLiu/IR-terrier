	<brief_summary>The main objective of this trial is to investigate the effects of a personalized intervention of exercises for the ankle-foot complex, supervised by a physical therapist and also via software, in gait velocity of patients with diabetic neuropathy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of a Personalized Intervention in Gait Velocity and Functionality in Diabetic Neuropathic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized controlled trial will be performed with 46 patients with diabetic neuropathy. The participants will be randomly assigned into either a control group (recommended foot care by international consensus with no exercises) or an intervention group which will receive 12-week physical therapy exercises, twice a week, under the supervision of a physiotherapist, and twice a week being remotely supervised by a software at home. Every exercise has its own progression depending on the subjects' execution, increasing in intensity and difficulty. The subjects will be evaluated in 5 different moments. The self-selected walking speed will be investigated with photocells and the incidence of foot ulcers will be registered on a web software during one year in a longitudinal study. Through force platform and infrared cameras, the kinetics and kinematics during gait will allow assessment of joint moments, power during propulsion, and foot and ankle range of motion. The hypothesis is that the personalized exercises for the ankle-foot complex via software will increase the self-selected gait speed, reduce incidence of plantar ulcers and their risk, increase health and functionality of the feet, increase feet strength and ankle isometric torque, maintain temperature of the feet, and produce beneficial biomechanical changes during gait.</detailed_description>
