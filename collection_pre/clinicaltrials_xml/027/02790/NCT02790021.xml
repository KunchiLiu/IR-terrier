	<brief_summary>Rationale: Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is one of the most underestimated complications of breast cancer treatment with a reported incidence of 30% to 40% after axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and 7% after sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Although the axillary treatment regimens are changing with a focus on less aggressive axillary treatment in order to reduce morbidity without compromising survival, BCRL will still remain a relevant problem in the future. Objective: To improve breast cancer survivorship by reducing/eliminating one of the most debilitating upper-body morbidities related to breast cancer treatment: chronic lymphedema of the arm. Study design: A multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT) carried out in the Maastricht University Medical Center, VieCuri Medical Center and Zuyderland Medical Center in the Netherlands. Study population: The study population includes all women over 18 years old who underwent surgical treatment for early stage breast cancer with an SLNB or ALND, or who received axillary radiotherapy, presenting with an early stage lymphedema of the arm (stage 1 and 2a on the ISL classification for lymphedema). Intervention: In this RCT patients are randomized over two arms: the first group will continue standard of care conservative lymphedema therapy, while the second group will undergo lymphaticovenous anastomoses (LVA) by a plastic surgeon. Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameters are the difference in excess limb volume (ELV) after one of both treatments, the effect of treatment on the quality of life and the cost-effectiveness of both treatments. Study-specific procedures: After randomization the follow-up moments will be at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months. A follow-up moment includes an interview and a medical examination. During this examination, the upper limbs will be assessed for sensory, motor, strength and mobility changes. Furthermore, the investigators will measure the volume of the treated and untreated side using the water displacement method and circumference measurement. A lymphoscintigraphy is made at inclusion, after 12 months and after 24 months. Lastly, the subjects will be asked at certain time points to fill in five questionnaires: Lymph-ICF, EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-BR23, EQ-5D-5L and the DASH questionnaire.</brief_summary>
