	<brief_title>Human Umbilical Cord-Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Pneumoconiosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells exhibit the potential to differentiate into mature cells typical of several tissues, which have been confirmed in in vivo and in vitro experiments. To investigate the effects of hUC-MSC treatment for Pneumoconiosis, 10 patients with Pneumoconiosis will be enrolled and receive 4 times of hUC-MSC transplantation.</detailed_description>
