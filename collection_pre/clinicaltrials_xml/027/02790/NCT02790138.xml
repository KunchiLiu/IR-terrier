	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab intravenous (IV) in participants with a proctocolectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis (UC) who have developed chronic or recurrent pouchitis, or require continuous antibiotic treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 4 Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Vedolizumab in the Treatment of Chronic Pouchitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vedolizumab is being tested to treat people who have chronic pouchitis. This study will look at the healing of inflammation of ileal pouch in people who take vedolizumab The study will enroll approximately 200 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups—which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need): - Vedolizumab 300 mg IV - Placebo All participants will receive an intravenous infusion at Weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, 22, and 30 along with concomitant antibiotic treatment with ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily through Week 4. This multicenter trial will be conducted in North America and Europe. The overall time to participate in this study is 34 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, plus a final visit 18 weeks after the last dose of study drug for a safety follow-up assessment. Participants will also participate in a long-term safety follow-up, by phone, at 6 months after the last dose of study drug (Week 56).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. In the opinion of the investigator, the participant is capable of understanding and complying with protocol requirements. 2. The participant or, when applicable, the participant's legally acceptable representative signs and dates a written, informed consent form and any required privacy authorization prior to the initiation of any study procedures. 4. Has a history of ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) for ulcerative colitis (UC) completed at least 1 year prior to the Screening Visit. 5. Has pouchitis that is chronic or recurrent, defined by an modified Pouchitis Disease Activity Index (mPDAI) ≥5 and &gt;2 episodes within 1 year of the Screening Visit or requiring longterm continuous lowdose antibiotic therapy taken daily on an ongoing basis (eg, ciprofloxacin 250500 mg/day or metronidazole 500 mg/day taken for several weeks or months at a time) or frequent pulse antibiotic therapy. 6. Agrees to stop antibiotic therapy on Day 1 of the study and switch to ciprofloxacin through Week 4 of study. (Additional courses of ciprofloxacin will be allowed, as needed, for flares after Week 14.) 7. A male participant who is nonsterilized and sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential agrees to use adequate contraception from signing of informed consent throughout the duration of the study and for 18 weeks after last dose. 8. A female participant of childbearing potential who is sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner agrees to use routinely adequate contraception from signing of informed consent throughout the duration of the study and for 18 weeks after last dose. Gastrointestinal Exclusion Criteria 1. Has Crohn's disease (CD), or CD of the pouch. 2. Has irritable pouch syndrome (IPS). 3. Has cuffitis. 4. Has mechanical complications of the pouch (eg, pouch stricture or pouch fistula). 5. Currently requires or has a planned surgical intervention for UC during the study. Infectious Disease Exclusion Criteria 1. Has evidence of an active infection (eg, sepsis, cytomegalovirus, or listeriosis) during Screening. 2. Has active or latent tuberculosis (TB), regardless of treatment history, as evidenced by any of the following: 1. History of TB. 2. A diagnostic TB test performed during Screening that is positive, as defined by: 1. A positive QuantiFERON test or 2 successive indeterminate QuantiFERON tests OR 2. A tuberculin skin test reaction ≥10 mm (≥5 mm in participants receiving the equivalent of &gt;15 mg/day prednisone). OR Chest Xray within 3 months prior to Week 0, which is suspicious for pulmonary TB, and a positive or 2 successive indeterminate QuantiFERON test within 30 days prior to Screening or during the Screening Period. 3. Has a positive test result for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis C virus (antiHCV), at Screening or a known history of human immunodeficiency virus infection (eg, common variable immunodeficiency, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection, organ transplantation). General Exclusion Criteria 1. Has any prior exposure to vedolizumab, natalizumab, efalizumab, rituximab, etrolizumab, or anti mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule1 (MAdCAM1) therapy. 2. Has a history of hypersensitivity or allergies to vedolizumab or its components. 3. Has allergies to and/or contraindications for ciprofloxacin (including interacting drugs such as tizanidine). 4.

Has received an investigational nonbiologic therapy within 30 or 5 halflives days prior to randomization (which ever is longer). 7. Has received an approved nonbiologic therapy (including 5aminosalicylate [5ASA], corticosteroid, azathioprine, 6mercaptopurine [6MP], etc.) in an investigational protocol within 30 days or 5 half lives prior to randomization (which ever is longer). 8.
