	<brief_summary>The study aims to compare the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of an optimised dosing to a standard dosing regimen of vancomycin in neonates and infants aged ≤ 90 days with late onset bacterial sepsis known or suspected to be caused by Gram-positive microorganisms</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Detailed objectives of the study are: - To compare the efficacy of an optimised vancomycin dosing regimen to a standard vancomycin dosing regimen in patients with late onset, bacterial sepsis, known or suspected to be caused by Gram-positive microorganisms. - To compare the safety of vancomycin (including renal and hearing safety) by allocation group in the intention to treat (ITT) population - To describe the PK parameters according to vancomycin dosing regimen and outcome using population PK modelling in the ITT population - To describe PK/PD in terms of the probability of target attainment (PTA) with different vancomycin dosing regimens in the ITT and per protocol (PP) populations - To describe outcomes and duration of therapy at the end of vancomycin treatment and at the short term follow-up visit by allocation group in the ITT and PP populations - To compare the clinical outcome to the antibacterial susceptibility of infecting organisms - To compare colonisation by resistant microorganisms (e.g. vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)) and Candida spp. by allocation group at baseline, TOC and short-term follow-up - To validate across multiple centres a host biomarker panel to allow improved diagnosis of bacterial sepsis and monitor response to antibacterial therapy</detailed_description>

Participants who have received at least one dose of study vancomycin will be followed up for safety</criteria>
