	<brief_title>Perioperative Use of a Selective COX2 Inhibitor in Patients Undergoing Elective Colorectal Surgery: the Effect on Post-operative Bowel Motility and Post-operative Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-operative ileus is a common surgical complication occurring in with up to 20% of patients, with a significant clinical and economical effect. Many preventative measures have been tested to promote gastrointestinal motility following intestinal surgery have been suggested. The medical intervention in the proposed study includes administration of a selective COX-2 inhibitor, specifically Celecoxib, in the peri-operative period following an elective colon resection. Celecoxib is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic therapeutic effects. The drug is approved for use in by the ministry of health in Israel and in the United states. The study aims to assess the use of this widely used medication for evaluation of the clinical effect on post-operative bowel transit, as well as the drugs' effect on post-operative pain.</detailed_description>
