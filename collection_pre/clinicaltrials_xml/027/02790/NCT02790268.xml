	<detailed_description>Cionni ring fixation of the capsular bag in conjunction with placement of an IOL has been found to be safe and effective compared with other current alternatives, even given the exceptionally high difficulty levels and complexity of these cases, in both adult and pediatric eyes. One limitation of techniques requiring trans-scleral suturing is that the suture cannot always be passed under adequate visualization, and, once the knot is secured, the exact position of the Cionni ring cannot always be accurately localized. Analysis of Cionni ring position with respect to the IOL and iris is important, as faulty placement of the ring or IOL can lead to complications which can threaten vision, especially in children with a high predisposition towards postoperative adverse events. Unfortunately, pupillary dilatation and slit-lamp examination may not always be adequate to assess the Cionni ring or the eyelet position, as it occupies the peripheral section of the capsular bag. UBM has been shown to be accurate and reproducible in examining the haptic position in relation to the sulcus and ciliary body, anterior chamber depth (ACD), vitreous incarceration, focal iris abnormalities, angle anatomy, and relationship of the iris to the lens (straight or tilted). This study aims to provide information on UBM findings following Cionni ring implantation in pediatric eyes for non-traumatic subluxation of the crystalline lens.</detailed_description>
