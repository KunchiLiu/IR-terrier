	<brief_summary>Children with neuromuscular disorders such as cerebral palsy, children with kyphosis and post-traumatic scoliosis have higher infection rates after scoliosis surgery than healthy children who undergo scoliosis surgery. The purpose of our study is to compare the effect of NPWT on infection rates when compared to standard gauze dressing. Participants will be randomized to the "NPWT" or "standard dressing" group. We will compare infection rates between the two groups. We hypothesize participants in the "NPWT" group will have a lower infection rate.</brief_summary>
