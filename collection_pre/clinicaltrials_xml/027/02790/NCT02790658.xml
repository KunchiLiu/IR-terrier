	<brief_title>Metabolomics Approach After Acute Intake of Grumixama Juice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The grumixama is a sweet and little cherry native of the South and Southeast regions of the Atlantic Forest of Brazil rich in phenolic compounds, mainly anthocyanins and ellagitannins. The objective of this study is Investigate the bioavailability of the main flavonoid, their colonic transformation and untargeted metabolites by an metabolomic approach following acute intake of a grumixama juice by humans. Fifteen healthy subjects consumed grumixama juice at single dose, and urine and plasma samples were collected at different time points over 24 h period. The metabolites were analyzed by LC-ESI-MSn, LC-Q-TOF plasma and urine were also analyzed using untargeted metabolomic approach for amino acids and organic acids by GCMS.</detailed_description>
