Clinically significant cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, endocrine disease, diabetes, cancer, autoimmune diseases; a serious infection or major operation within 30 days of enrollment; a history of psychiatric disease or recent history of alcoholism or drug addiction. Currently taking immunosuppressant medications Anticipated major surgery during the study period. Individuals involved in another protocol, or have been treated under one within the last 3 months. Intraarticular therapy in the index knee within the previous 6 months. Surgery to the target knee within 6 months prior to screening. Surgery to other weight bearing joints if it will interfere with knee assessments Prior articular transplant procedures Prior reconstruction surgery to the target knee within 12 months Xray findings of acute fractures Known severe loss of bone density, and/or severe bone or joint deformity in the target knee. Knee pain associated with patellafemoral arthritis or chondromalacia in the target knee. Significant target knee infection or overlying skin disorder/infection within the previous 6 months prior to study enrollment Require cane or other assistive device for walking Symptomatic OA of the hips, spine or ankle if it would interfere with the evaluation of the target knee, History of documented nerve damage in the affected limb, or vascular insufficiency, Condition requiring use of systemic steroids, Coagulation disorder. Patients with unstable knees Temperature above 99.5 F. Elevated liver transaminases Identification as a member of a vulnerable population. BMI greater than 40. History of allergy to local anesthetics Currently taking antirheumatic disease medication (including methotrexate or other antimetabolites) within the 3 months prior to entry in the study.</criteria>
