Willingness to refrain from consuming food or beverages containing caffeine/xanthine and alcohol 24 h prior to Enrollment on Day 1 until the end of the study on Day 31. History or current evidence of clinically significant cardiac, hepatic, renal, pulmonary, endocrine/metabolic, neurologic, infectious, gastrointestinal (ie, any condition which may affect drug absorption), hematologic, or oncologic disease. Laboratory results (serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) outside of the normal range and considered clinically significant in the opinion of the PI. Liver function (AST, ALT, bilirubin) test results must be below the ULN at Screening and during Enrollment on Day 1. A QTcF interval duration &gt; 450 msec at Screening. Participation in a previous DS8500a study, or dosing with itraconazole, within 6 mo prior to the first dose. Known sensitivity to product components of DS8500a and/or itraconazole. Current participation in another investigational study or prior participation in an investigational study within the past 30 d prior to the first dose. Use of any prescription or overthecounter (OTC) medications (systemic or topical), vitamins, or dietary/herbal supplements, including St John's Wort (hypericin), within 14 d prior to the first dose. Consumption of more than 28 units of alcohol per wk (males) or 14 units of alcohol per wk (females), where 1 unit of alcohol equals 1/2 pint of beer, 4 ounces of wine, or 1 ounce of spirits, or significant history of alcoholism or drug/chemical abuse within the last 2 y.
