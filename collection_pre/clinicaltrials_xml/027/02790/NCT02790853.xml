	<detailed_description>Study Visits: While participant is on study, they will have about 4 study visits during an already scheduled, routine clinic visit. Each visit will last about 20-25 minutes total. During each visit, participant will have their mouth examined and imaged and they will have brush and tissue biopsies to check for any cancerous or pre-cancerous lesions. These tests and procedures are described below. Mouth Exam and Imaging: Two (2) different kinds of imaging devices are being used in this study to compare to standard white light exams. One type, PS2.1/PS3, is designed to let researchers look at a wide area of the lining of the mouth (about the size of the top of a soda can) by shining different colors of light into the mouth and taking pictures. The other imaging device is called the high-resolution microendoscope (HRME) and is designed to let researchers look at and take pictures of a very small area of the lining of the mouth but with a high magnification (like a microscope). If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study and they agree, they will have a mouth exam and their mouth will be scanned with both types of imaging devices and pictures of any mouth lesions will be taken. Normal (non-lesion) tissue in participant's mouth may also be imaged. First, participant will have a standard white light mouth exam. During the exam, the study doctor will look for any lesions in participant's mouth and pictures of any found lesions will be taken. After the white light mouth exam, the study doctor will then take pictures of the inside of participant's mouth using the PS2.1/PS3 imaging device. Participant will also have pictures of their mouth taken with the HRME. To do this, a coloring substance called proflavine hemisulfate (a type of fluorescent dye which glows green in the dark) will be "painted" on areas of participant's mouth with a cotton tip to help improve the pictures. Then, a small probe (about the size of a pencil tip) of the HRME will be placed against the lesions and the normal areas inside participant's mouth and light from the end of the HRME probe will be used to take a picture. After the pictures have been taken, participant will rinse their mouth with water. It should take about 5-10 minutes total to have participant's mouth examined and imaged under white light, using the PS2.1/PS3 device, and the HRME. Brush Biopsy and Tissue Biopsies: After all imaging has been completed, participant will have a brush biopsy of their mouth to check if the cells are cancerous and to learn if there have been any changes in the cells between visits. To perform a brush biopsy, a member of the study staff will gently rotate a brush along the surface of the mouth. This test is similar to a "Pap Smear" test used to screen women for cervical cancer. Participant will also have tissue biopsies to check if the tissue is cancerous or pre-cancerous. To collect a tissue biopsy, participant's mouth will be numbed with local anesthesia and a small cutting tool will be used to remove tissue from the lesions. The results of the biopsies will be compared to the images taken with the PS2.1/PS3 and HRME devices to learn if the imaging devices accurately predicted if a lesion was cancerous or pre-cancerous. It should not take more than 15 minutes to complete all biopsies. The mouth exam, imaging, and biopsies will all take place on the same day during a routine clinic visit. Length of Study: Patient's participation on this study will be over after they have completed follow-up. Follow-Up: About 30 days after participant's last clinic visit, their medical records will be checked and/or a member of the study staff may call them to learn if they had any side effects from the imaging devices. If participant is called, this call should last about 5 minutes. This is an investigational study. The HRME and PS2.1/PS3 imaging devices are not FDA approved or commercially available. Their use in this study is considered investigational. Proflavine hemisulfate is FDA approved and commercially available for treating umbilical cord stumps of newborn babies. Proflavine hemisulfate is not FDA approved or commercially available to use as a dye in the mouth. Its use in this study is considered investigational. The study doctor can explain to participant how the imaging devices are designed to work. Up to 600 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
