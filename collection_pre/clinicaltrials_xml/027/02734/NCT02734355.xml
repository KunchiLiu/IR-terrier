	<brief_summary>The objective of the study was to estimate the efficacy of telmisartan and amlodipine combination on the restoration of left atrial mechanical function after atrial fibrillation catheter ablation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Left Atrial Mechanical Function Improvement After Atrial Fibrillation Catheter Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>64 candidates to atrial fibrillation ablation were included in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to telmisartan/amlodipine combination in dose 80/5 mg (group I, n=34) or placebo (group II, n=30) taking daily for up to one week. Echocardiography was performed before the procedure, immediately after it, and after a week of therapy. The six-minute walk test and SF-36 questionnaire results were evaluated a day before the procedure and after a week of the therapy. The left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was invasively measured after transseptal puncture and before left atrial sheath removal.</detailed_description>
