	<brief_summary>The study is a randomized controlled clinical trial. A total 1400 hospitalized patients will be randomized in two groups: 1. group receiving a pharmacist-led standardized medication review (experimental group); and 2. group not receiving the medication review (control group). The patients will be followed up at 30 days after initial hospitalization. Outcome measures include the number of readmissions; patient satisfaction, quality of medical admission prescription and number of consultation after initial hospitalization. Discussion: A randomized controlled trial will provide the highest level of evidence on the impact of pharmacist-led standardized medication review on early hospital readmission for extreme age population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of a Medication Review on Hospital Readmission: (ConcReHosp)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The impact of Medication Reconciliation on the early hospital readmission in the elderly is not clearly demonstrated. Moreover, the impact of medication reconciliation in the pediatric population is poorly studied. In such context, it is important to demonstrate the effectiveness of the medication reconciliation as part of a standardized medication review process, in pediatric and in the elderly, on all cause readmissions in a large randomized control clinical trial. The standardized medication review process includes medication reconciliation, treatment review and medication liaison service. The main objective of this study is to assess the impact of the standardized medication review on the rate of readmissions and/or death at 30 days following initial hospitalization discharge. Methods/design: The study is a randomized controlled clinical trial. A total 1400 hospitalized patients will be randomized in two groups: 1. group receiving a pharmacist-led standardized medication review (experimental group); and 2. group not receiving the medication review (control group). The patients will be followed up at 30 days after initial hospitalization. Outcome measures include the number of readmissions; patient satisfaction, quality of medical admission prescription and number of consultation after initial hospitalization. Discussion: A randomized controlled trial will provide the highest level of evidence on the impact of pharmacist-led standardized medication review.</detailed_description>
