	<brief_summary>Bonestim system for osteoporosis treatment uses surface electrical stimulation of neuromuscular and skeletal tissue by multipad stimulation electrodes for inducing contractions of the spinal column muscles. The primary aim of this clinical study is to determine if the Bonestim therapy can improve bone density. A secondary aim is to determine whether the applied treatment increases postural stability and facilitation of daily life activities. Inducing of contractions of the spinal column muscles in this manner could be new treatment options for the patients with reduced mobility and the patients with serious contraindications for drugs.</brief_summary>
