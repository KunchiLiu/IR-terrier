	<brief_title>PEGI to Improve Shared Decision-Making for Breast Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postmastectomy breast reconstruction is becoming increasingly utilized in breast cancer patients to provide surgical restoration of the breast mounds. The breast reconstruction discussions can be highly complex, as there are many different techniques, timing, and complications that are unique to each procedure. However Â¼ of women report being dissatisfied with some component of their cancer or reconstructive care. Failure of the physician to provide adequate information about treatment options is the most frequent source of cancer patient dissatisfaction and breast reconstruction patients have expressed a need for further information regarding the complex decision to pursue breast reconstruction. In such scenarios of complex medical decision-making, decision support techniques may be an effective solution to information provision and shared decision-making. As a result, the investigators developed a pre-consultation educational group intervention delivered in a group setting for women considering breast reconstruction, with the aims to fill an existing information-gap, promote high-quality decision-making and enhance decision self-efficacy and other decision measures. This study will evaluate the educational group intervention.</detailed_description>
