	<brief_summary>Each patient will be randomized to receive one dose of the test article in one eye and one dose of the reference formulations in the contralateral eye. One eye will be selected as the initial eye for cataract surgery and aqueous humor collection and hence will be dosed and operated on first. Followed by the second eye which will be dosed no early than a week followed by aqueous humor collection as per specified time points and no later than 35 days following the first eye again prior to the cataract surgery.</brief_summary>
