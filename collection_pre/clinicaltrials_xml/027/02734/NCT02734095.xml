	<brief_summary>A prospective, single-center, real-world study on intravascular ultrasound measurements after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting in the treatment of femoropopliteal lesions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Determining Predictors of Restenosis in Femoropopliteal Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intravascular ultrasound is considered important tool in endovascular procedures of coronary territory. Information such as vessel diameter, stent expansion, residual stenosis, helped in better understanding of the disease, treatment and stent behavior. However, as a different anatomical territory with major hemodynamic differences, many of these concepts could not be reproduced in the femoropopliteal segment. The purpose of this study is to correlate data collected by intraoperative intravascular ultrasound after the angioplasty procedure with stent placement in femoropopliteal arterial lesions and patency of this revascularization within 12 months.</detailed_description>
