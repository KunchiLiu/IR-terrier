	<brief_summary>Background: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare neuro-degenerative disease, counted among atypical parkinsonism (AP). Medical treatment and rehabilitation are extremely limited in AP, therefore it would be very useful to find new ways to improve motor and non motor symptoms in PSP. The Brainway Deep Transcranial magnetic stimulation (DTMS) is a new technology of TMS using a particular coil, i.e. H-coil, able to stimulate deeper regions of the brain. Only few studies in literature have evaluated the efficacy of DTMS in Parkinson's Disease and parkinsonism; in particular in PSP patients, a case report showed an improvement in language.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Deep TMS for the Treatment of Patients With Parkinson's Disease and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Materials and Methods: This study was a pilot, randomized, cross-over, double blind trial. It was designed to evaluate the efficacy of Deep TMS in terms of recovery of motor functions, freezing of gait, and cognitive decline in patients with PSP. Nineteen subject underwent 14 session of high frequency DTMS over a 4 weeks period. The target were the left Broca and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.</detailed_description>
