	<brief_title>Accuracy of Freestyle Libre</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: To assess accuracy and reliability of a new-to-market flash glucose monitoring system, the freestyle Libre (Abbott, CA, USA), in patients with type 1 diabetes. Study design: open-label, mono-centre interventional study. Patients will wear freestyle Libre for 14 days in the home setting. There will be no limitations in food intake or in physical activity, but patients will have at least 7 finger-stick/days. Patients will have 2 visits in our clinical center and in these visits we'll compare freestyle Libre values with blood sampling to determine glucose values with YSI, during euglycemia and during glucose excursion and induced hypo-hyperglycemia. Study population: 24 patients will be included in this trial. Every patient will wear device for 14 days at home and during 2 visits at CRC Study endpoints: main endpoint will be the evaluation of freestyle Libre accuracy during real life compared to glucometer values and to YSI glucose values (during 2 visits). A separate analysis will be performed on the accuracy of the freestyle Libre in the hypoglycaemic (defined as a blood glucose value ≤3.9 mmol/L) and hyperglycaemic area (defined as a blood glucose value ≥10.0 mmol/L). Additionally, a separate analysis will be performed to assess device performance and accuracy per day of device life. If patients enrolled in the study use Dexcom G4 (CGM) and wanted to continue to use it, he/she can do so. In this case we can compare the accuracy of Libre even towards Dexcom G4 device.</detailed_description>
