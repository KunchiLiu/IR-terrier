	<brief_summary>Liprotamase consists of 3 soluble, non-porcine digestive enzymes, lipase, protease, and amylase, combined in a fixed ratio. Liprotamase is stable in the stomach and can be formulated without enteric coating for administration either as a capsule or as a dosing solution dissolved in water or juice. The purpose of the present study is to provide efficacy and safety data for a new, soluble formulation of liprotamase, Liprotamase Powder for Oral Solution, in Cystic Fibrosis patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI).</brief_summary>
