	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Dasotraline in Children 6 to 12 Years of Age With Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in a Simulated Classroom Setting.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, efficacy and safety study in children with ADHD in a laboratory classroom setting. The study will be comprised of 3 periods: Screening (up to 35 days) including a 3 - 5 day ADHD medication washout prior to Day -1; Double-blind randomized treatment with either dasotraline (4 mg/day) or placebo for14 days; and End of Study (EOS) Visit (7 days after last dose). Prior to the start of treatment (Day 1) and following the conclusion of the double-blind period (Day 15), subjects will undergo a full-day laboratory classroom evaluation during which approximately 12 to 18 subjects will be assessed. Each laboratory classroom day will include seven 30-minute simulated classroom sessions where trained observers will assess subjects using the Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn, and Pelham (SKAMP) Scale. In addition during each classroom session, a 10-minute math test (Permanent Product Measure of Performance [PERMP]) will be administered to evaluate sustained attention and effort. Seven (± 2) days after the last dose of study drug, subjects will return to the clinic and complete safety assessments.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subject is 6 12 years old, inclusive at screening and randomization. 2. At least one of the subject's parents/legal guardians must give written informed consent, including privacy authorization, prior to study participation. The subject will provide informed assent prior to study participation. 3. Subject meets Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM5) criteria for a primary diagnosis of ADHD (inattentive, hyperactive, or combined presentation) at screening established by a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation that reviews DSM5 criteria and confirmed using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for SchoolAge ChildrenPresent and Lifetime version (KSADSPL) at screening. 4. Subject is currently on a treatment regimen of a methylphenidate formulation within the approved labeled dose range for ADHD for at least 6 weeks prior to Day 7 with the same dose level for at least 1 week immediately prior to Day 7. Note: if any doses of methylphenidate were missed during the week prior to Day7, the subject's eligibility will be discussed with the Medical Monitor. 5. In the opinion of the investigator, methylphenidate well tolerated and clinically effective based on clinical assessment and informant interview, as well as, review of available medical records. Note: The ADHD Rating Scale Version IV Home Version (modified for investigator administration) (ADHDRSIV HV) will be administered at Screening by the investigator to inform clinical evaluation. 6. Subject is male or a nonpregnant, nonlactating female. 7. Subject, if female, must not be pregnant or breastfeeding, and if ≥ 8 years of age must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening. 8. Female subjects of childbearing potential and male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must practice true abstinence (consistent with lifestyle) and must agree to remain abstinent or agree to use an effective and medically acceptable form of birth control, from the time of informed consent/assent to at least 14 days after the last dose of the study drug has been taken. 9. Subject must be in general good health (defined as the absence of any clinically relevant abnormalities as determined by the investigator) based on screening physical and neurological examinations, medical history, and clinical laboratory values (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis). Note: If any of the hematology, chemistry, or urinalysis results are not within the laboratory's reference range, then the subject can be included only if the investigator determines the deviations to be not clinically relevant. 10. Subject is within the 3rd to 97th percentile for gender specific body mass index (BMI)forage from the World Health Organization (WHO) growth charts and weighs at least 21 kg. 11.

Subject and subject's parent/legal guardian must be able to fully comprehend the informed consent/assent forms, understand and be willing and able to comply with all study procedures and visit schedule, and be able to communicate satisfactorily with the investigator and study coordinator. 1. Subject or parent/legal guardian has commitments during the study that would interfere with attending study visits. 2. Subject, on Day 1, has not demonstrated evidence of worsening of ADHD symptoms as measured by ADHDRSIV HV total score ≥ 26 and at least a 30% worsening in ADHDRSIV HV total score since the last assessment and following a minimum 72hour washout from prior methylphenidate treatment. 3. Subject is currently being treated for ADHD with an amphetaminebased product, or has been treated with an amphetaminebased product in the 6 weeks prior to the start of screening. 4. Subject is currently being treated for ADHD with a nonmethylphenidate product, or has been treated with a nonmethylphenidate product in the 6 weeks prior to the start of screening. 5. Subject has failed 2 adequate courses (dose and duration) of stimulant or nonstimulant treatment for ADHD, as judged by the investigator. 6. Subject currently has a diagnosis of asthma that has required daily treatment with bronchodilators or nebulizer treatments in the 30 days prior to screening and/or who may require daily treatments with these agents over the course of the trial. Intermittent use of bronchodilators is not exclusionary. Subjects who have a history of requiring persistent asthma treatment should be discussed with the medical monitor prior to randomization. 7. Subject has any clinically significant unstable medical abnormality, chronic disease, or a history of a clinically significant abnormality of the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory, hepatic, or renal systems, or a disorder or history of a condition (eg, malabsorption, gastrointestinal surgery) that may interfere with drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion. Note: Active medical conditions that are minor or wellcontrolled are not exclusionary if they do not affect risk to the subject or the study results. In cases in which the impact of the condition upon risk to the subject or study results is unclear, the medical monitor should be consulted. Any subject with a known cardiovascular disease or condition (even if controlled) must be discussed with the medical monitor during screening. 8. Subject has a history or presence of abnormal ECGs, which in the investigator's opinion is clinically significant. Screening site ECGs will be centrally overread, and eligibility will be determined by the investigator based on the results of the overread report. 9.

Note: Unavoidable changes in schoolbased interventions that occur during study participation will not be exclusionary, but should be documented by the investigator, to the extent possible. 22. Subject or subject's family anticipates a move outside the geographic range of investigative site during the study period, or plans extended travel inconsistent with the recommended visit interval during study duration. 23. Subject has history of, or current malignancy except for nonmelanomatous skin cancer. 24. Subject has history of positive test for Hepatitis B surface antigen or Hepatitis C antibody. 25.
