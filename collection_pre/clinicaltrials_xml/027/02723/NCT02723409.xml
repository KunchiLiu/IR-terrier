	<brief_title>Trial of Techniques for Umbilical Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a five arm, prospective, randomized, trial. Patients undergoing abdominoplasty or abdominally-based free tissue transfer (TRAM/DIEP flaps) at NYU Medical Center will be randomly assigned to receive one of five conventionally used umbilicoplasty techniques during the course of their surgery: 1. Round procedure 2. "Scarless" round procedure 3. "Inverted u" procedure 4. "Inverted v" procedure, and 5. "Y deepithelialized" procedure As there has not yet been a superiority or inferiority comparison of these five methods, no patient will be receiving substandard care by randomization to one of the five procedures.</detailed_description>
