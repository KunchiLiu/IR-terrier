	<brief_summary>The incidence and prevalence of hypertension is increasing while the controlled rate is extremely low in China. A substantial percentage of participants with uncontrolled hypertension are correctable if potential associated factors are identified and corrected. Therefore, it is clinically relevant to investigate and identify these potential associated factors of uncontrolled hypertension so as to increase controlled rate and reduce hypertension-associated health and economic burdens in the future. Investigators plan to conduct a prospective registry study in a single-center to initially investigate the potential associated factors of uncontrolled hypertension in cardiovascular outpatient department. Furthermore, investigators plan to evaluate the effects of potential associated factors correction on hypertension controlled rate and cardiovascular outcomes.</brief_summary>
