	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 8 weeks of treatment with the combination regimen ABT-493/ABT-530 in comparison to sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for 12 weeks in Hepatitis C Virus Genotype 2 (GT2) infected participants.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Screening central laboratory result indicating HCV GT2 infection without coinfection of any other genotype. Subject has positive antiHCV Ab and plasma HCV RNA viral load greater than or equal to 1000 IU/mL at Screening Visit. Chronic HCV infection defined as one of the following: Positive for antiHCV antibody (Ab) and/or HCV RNA at least 6 months before Screening; or A liver biopsy consistent with chronic HCV infection. Subject must be HCV Directacting antiviral agent (DAA) treatmentna√Øve (i.e., patient has not received a single dose of any approved or investigational DAA). Prior HCV treatment using IFNs with or without ribavirin is acceptable. Previous HCV Interferon (IFN) based treatment must have been completed greater than or equal to 2 months prior to screening. Recent (within 6 months prior to study drug administration) history of drug or alcohol abuse that could preclude adherence to the protocol in the opinion of the investigator. Positive test result at Screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or anti human immunodeficiency virus antibody (HIV Ab). Requirement for and inability to safely discontinue contraindicated medications or supplements at least 2 weeks or 10 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of any study drug. Clinically significant abnormalities, other than HCVinfection, based upon the results of a medical history, physical examination, vital signs, laboratory profile, and a 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that make the subject an unsuitable candidate for this study in the opinion of the investigator, including, but not limited to: Uncontrolled diabetes as defined by a glycated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1C) level &gt; 8.5% at the Screening Visit. Active or suspected malignancy or history of malignancy (other than basal cell skin cancer or cervical carcinoma in situ) in the past 5 years, or any history of HCC. Uncontrolled cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal, hematologic, neurologic, psychiatric, or other medical disease or disorder, which is unrelated to the existing HCV infection. Any cause of liver disease other than chronic HCVinfection, including but not limited to the following: Hemochromatosis, alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency, Wilson's disease, autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, or steatohepatitis considered to be the primary cause of the liver disease rather than concomitant/incidental with HCV infection.</criteria>
