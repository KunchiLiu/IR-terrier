	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of different quantities of lean beef (0.5, 2.5, 5.5 oz/day) on lipids, lipoproteins, and vascular health endpoints in the context of a modified Mediterranean dietary pattern that is representative of foods typically consumed in the United States.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Dose-Response Effects of Lean Beef in a Mediterranean-Style Dietary Pattern on Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) dietary pattern, the USDA Food Pattern, and the American Heart Association (AHA) Diet are all recommended for the reduction of LDL-C and blood pressure, two major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The recommended food-based dietary patterns emphasize consumption of vegetables, fruits and whole grains; include low-fat dairy products, poultry, fish, legumes, non-tropical vegetable oils and nuts; and limit intake of sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages and red meats. The Mediterranean dietary pattern has gained widespread popularity because of an impressive evidence base showing health benefits in the prevention of many chronic diseases including CVD. The Mediterranean Diet Pyramid recommends that red meat be consumed less than 2 servings per week, with an emphasis on lean cuts. However, as the BOLD (Beef in an Optimal Lean Diet) study has demonstrated, lean beef can be included in a heart healthy dietary pattern that achieves both low density lipoprotein and blood pressure-lowering effects. The BOLD study utilized beef consumption levels of 4 or 5.4 ounces of lean beef daily, which is significantly higher than the American average of app. 3 ounces per day. This study will evaluate three levels of beef in the context of a Mediterranean diet, compared to an Average American diet.</detailed_description>
