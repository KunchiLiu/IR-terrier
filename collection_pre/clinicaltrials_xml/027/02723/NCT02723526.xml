	<brief_summary>As prostate cancer progresses, tumor cells dissociate and enter the bloodstream. Considered a "liquid biopsy," these circulating tumor cells (CTC) can show how a patient's cancer evolves and responds to treatments. The purpose of this study is to determine whether sequentially analyzing the expression of tumor markers in circulating tumor cells in newly diagnosed metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer patients can predict the outcome of these patients.</brief_summary>
