	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in conjunction with transcranial ultrasound (TUS) on pain perception and functional limitations in people with osteoarthritis of the knee. The investigators hypothesize that there will be a decrease in pain levels with active stimulation, when compared to sham stimulation.</brief_summary>
