	<brief_summary>The cochlear implant is an electrical hearing aid that restores the perception of surrounding sounds and speech intelligibility in profoundly deaf patients. During surgery, the labyrinthine break necessary for insertion into the cochlea of the implantable part may cause a malfunction of the vestibular system which can induce dizziness, balance and perception (of the gravitational vertical) disorders. Vestibular compensation and new sonic interactions could alter the balance control and the visual and postural spatial orientation perceptions. The usual treatment includes the monitoring of the patient's quality of life, of the vestibular function and of hearing. This study adds an assessment of spatial orientation and of posture.</brief_summary>
