	<brief_title>Quantitative Myocardial Perfusion Reserve by Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is a wide available technique for the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia. However, myocardial first-pass perfusion evaluation has been limited due to the moderate accuracy of the currently available qualitative and semiquantitative methods used to assess myocardial perfusion, and due to the lack of efficient absolute quantitative methods. Some CMR techniques and post-processing mathematical models have been developed for quantitative measurement of myocardial blood flow reserve with perfusion CMR under pharmacological stress. Measurement of these parameters with CMR have been shown to increase the accuracy of CMR in diagnosing myocardial ischemia, but most of these methods present technical challenges and have unreasonably time consuming post-processing. The aim of this study is to validate a full automated post-processing software for first pass perfusion CMR images that results in automated generated quantitative perfusion color maps.</detailed_description>
