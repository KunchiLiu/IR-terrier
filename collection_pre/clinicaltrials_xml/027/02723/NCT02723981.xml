	<brief_summary>Prospective, multi-centre, randomized, open-label, parallel comparisons to evaluate - the incidence of bleedings (COSTA-Bleed) and - the incidence of ischemic and bleeding events (COSTA-Outcome) following a therapy with the abluminal sirolimus coated bio-engineered stent (COMBO stent) in association with short-term single antiplatelet therapy as compared to a guidelines-based strategy in patients with coronary artery disease with an indication for chronic oral anticoagulant therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>COMBO-Stent in Patients on Chronic Anticoagulant Therapy (COSTA) COSTA-Bleed and COSTA-Outcome Trials</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The COSTA trials are investigator-initiated studies aimed at comparing the clinical outcome after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using a COMBO-stent based strategy associated with short-term antiplatelet therapy with a guidelines-based therapy in patients with an indication for chronic oral anticoagulation. The study is organized as a national, multi-centre prospective, randomized trial. The duration of the follow-up is 15 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 18 and older; Willingness to comply with the study protocol; subject or a legally authorized representative must provide written informed consent prior to any study related procedure, in accordance with International Conference on harmonization of Good Clinical Practice (ICHGCP) guidelines and per site requirements. Patients on anticoagulant therapy or treatmentnaive patients with an indication to chronic anticoagulant therapy. Indications to oral anticoagulation may include atrial fibrillation, prosthetic valve disease, peripheral bypass surgery, lung embolism or deep vein thrombosis or any other indication according to the InvestigatorÂ´s opinion. Single or multiple de novo lesion in a native coronary artery, all amenable to treatment with the COMBO stent; Patients who, in the Investigator's opinion, should not be treated with (N)OAC. These may include, for instance: history of BARC 35 bleeding &lt;12 months; patients with a haemorrhagic disorder or bleeding diathesis (e.g. von Willebrand disease, haemophilia A or B or other hereditary bleeding disorder, history of spontaneous intraarticular bleeding, history of prolonged bleeding after surgery/intervention); patients with recent major surgery; history of intraocular, spinal, retroperitoneal, intraarticular or recent gastrointestinal bleeding unless the causative factor has been permanently eliminated or repaired; (reduction in the haemoglobin level of at least 2g/dL, transfusion of at least two units of blood, or symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ) including lifethreatening bleeding episode (symptomatic intracranial bleeding, bleeding with a decrease in the haemoglobin level of at least 5g/dL or bleeding requiring transfusion of at least 4 units of blood or inotropic agents or necessitating surgery); Anaemia (haemoglobin &lt;10g/dL) or thrombocytopenia including heparininduced thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;100E9/L) at screening; Pregnant or nursing patients. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test done within 7 days prior to the index procedure per site standard test; Other medical illness with a life expectancy &lt;2 years (e.g. known malignancy) or known history of substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, heroin etc.) that may cause noncompliance with the protocol or confound the data interpretation or is associated with a limited life expectancy; Patient has received an organ transplant or is on a waiting list for an organ transplant; Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents that does not allow guidelinescompliant therapy and that cannot be adequately premedicated; Previously received murine therapeutic antibodies and exhibited sensitization through the production of Human AntiMurine Antibodies (HAMA); Any significant medical condition which in the Investigator's opinion may interfere with the patient's optimal participation in the study; Current participation in another investigational drug or device study except for noninterventional registries; Patients not willing or able to comply with the protocol requirements or considered unreliable by the Investigator concerning the requirements for follow up during the study and/or compliance with study drug administration; Angiographic exclusion criteria: Vessel diameter &lt;2 und &gt; 5mm; Target lesion with characteristics that make it unsuitable for stent delivery and deployment; Planned use of a stent or another coronary device in the same or another session (target vessel or nontarget vessel), precluding a COMBOonly strategy.</criteria>
