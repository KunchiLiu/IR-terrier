	<criteria>Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol (e.g., completion of the diary cards, return for followup visits, ability to have scheduled contacts to allow evaluation during the study). Or subjects with a caregiver who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol (e.g., completion of the diary cards, availability for followup contacts). Written informed consent obtained from the subject prior to performance of any study specific procedure. Subject who participated in ZOSTER006 or ZOSTER022 studies and received at least one dose of HZ/su vaccine. Additional inclusion criteria for the 1Additional Dose Revaccination and Control groups, ONLY: Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential may be enrolled in this study. Nonchildbearing potential is defined as premenarche, current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or postmenopause. Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in this study, if the subject: has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination and has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (pharmaceutical product or device) at the time of enrolment or planned use during the study period. Previous vaccination against Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) or HZ and/or planned administration during the study of a VZV or HZ vaccine (including an investigational or nonregistered vaccine other than the HZ/su vaccine administered in studies ZOSTER006/022). Chronic administration (defined as ≥ 14 consecutive days in total) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs during the period starting six months prior to Visit Month 0 of study ZOSTER049 or expected administration at any time during the study period. For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day or equivalent. A prednisone dose of &lt; 20 mg/day is allowed. Inhaled, topical and intraarticular corticosteroids are allowed. Administration of longacting immunemodifying drugs (e.g., infliximab, rituximab) within 6 months prior to Visit Month 0 of study ZOSTER049 or expected administration at any time during the study period. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition resulting from disease (e.g., malignancy, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection) or immunosuppressive/cytotoxic therapy (e.g., medications used during cancer chemotherapy, organ transplantation or to treat autoimmune disorders). Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within 3 months prior to Visit Month 0 of study ZOSTER049 or planned administration during the study period. Prolonged use (&gt; 14 consecutive days) of oral and/or parenteral antiviral agents that are active against VZV (acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir, etc. ) and planned to be used during the study period for an indication other than to treat suspected or confirmed HZ or an HZrelated complication (topical use of these antiviral agents is allowed). Important underlying illness that in the opinion of the investigator would be expected to interfere significantly during the study. Additional exclusion criteria for the 1Additional Dose Revaccination and Control groups, only: Subjects who experienced an SAE from first vaccination in the previous ZOSTER006/022 studies to enrolment in study ZOSTER049 that was considered related to study vaccine by either the investigator or the sponsor. Subjects with a new onset of a pIMD or exacerbation of a pIMD from first vaccination in the previous ZOSTER006/022 studies to enrolment in study ZOSTER049. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (pharmaceutical product or device) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned use during the study period. Administration or planned administration of any other immunizations within 30 days before the first study vaccination or scheduled within 30 days after study vaccination. However, licensed nonreplicating vaccines (i.e., inactivated and subunit vaccines, including inactivated and subunit influenza vaccines for seasonal or pandemic flu, with or without adjuvant) may be administered up to 8 days prior to each dose and/or at least 14 days after any dose of study vaccine. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. Additionally, consider allergic reactions to other material or equipment related to study participation (such as materials that may possibly contain latexgloves, syringes, etc.). Please note, the vaccine and vials in this study do not contain latex. Pregnant or lactating female. Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions (if of childbearing potential). Previous episode/history of HZ.</criteria>
