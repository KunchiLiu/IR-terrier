	<brief_summary>As part of a 5-year national effort to reduce teen pregnancy, the University of Rochester is partnering with the City of Rochester Department of Recreation and Youth Services to evaluate the City's replication of the Teen Outreach Program (TOP™) for 11-14 year old youth registered at 11 selected Recreation Centers (RCs). A youth development program with demonstrated efficacy to reduce teen pregnancy, school failure and drop-out rates, TOP™ has never been studied in RCs. Advancing from efficacy to effectiveness, the investigators will also measure program fidelity obtained in RCs.</brief_summary>
