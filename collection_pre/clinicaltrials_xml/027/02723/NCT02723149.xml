	<brief_summary>This study aims to determine if a marijuana (MJ) Approach Avoidance Task (AAT) intervention reduces cannabis use compared to a control condition containing no active components of AAT. Adolescent heavy MJ users (N=40, ages 16-21) will be randomly assigned to MJ-AAT (n=20) or control condition (MJ-Sham, n=20) for three weeks. The MJ-AAT includes six sessions designed to reduce action tendencies to approach marijuana. The MJ-Sham includes six MJ-AAT-sham conditions. Substance use and cognitive assessment will identify changes in MJ use patterns and mechanisms of treatment outcomes. Additionally, using an functional magnetic resonance imaging marijuana cue reactivity task, we will determine differences in neural response in reward regions before and after 3 weeks of either AAT or sham treatment.</brief_summary>
