	<brief_summary>This study plans to learn more about how to measure the way the the body's energy system works in boys with Klinefelter syndrome, including the heart, lungs, muscles, and liver. This is important to know so that investigators understand how hormones and an extra X chromosome relate to diseases such as diabetes, extra weight gain, heart disease and liver diseases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiometabolic Profiles of Boys With Klinefelter Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is the most common chromosomal abnormality in males and is associated with primary gonadal failure in adolescence and a high morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular-related diseases (CVD) in adulthood. Recent studies in children and adolescent boys with KS have found a high prevalence of CVD risk markers, however the underlying mechanisms have not been explored. Our central hypothesis is that pubertal boys with KS have relative testosterone deficiency resulting in abnormal energy metabolism that predisposes them to later CVD, and that exogenous testosterone will modify these abnormalities. In this study, investigators will measure markers of cardiometabolic risk in pubertal boys with KS.</detailed_description>
