	<brief_summary>Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI) is still the leading cause of death in the western world. Early warning (chest pain) signs of an acute MI are often misinterpreted and disregarded. In average it takes between 2-3 hours from the beginning of the chest pain. The damage to the heart in these 2 hours is critical and often irreversible. Thus an early warning test or device is highly warranted. Corsens has developed a noninvasive device using several sensors applied to the chest and a detection system able to recognize the ischemic origin of chest pain. This clinical study is intended for evaluating the safety and efficacy of the Corsens technology while use for myocardial infarction detection</brief_summary>
