	<brief_summary>Investigators are seeking to determine the effects of CBT, anodal tDCS over left DLPFC, and combined CBT+ tDCS on clinical pain and functioning among a sample of patients with fibromyalgia. This study will be the first randomized, double-blind, controlled study of tDCS technology as an adjunctive pain management strategy for fibromyalgia pain. Data from this trial will likely yield information regarding the feasibility and efficacy of tDCS+CBT as a chronic pain-management approach.</brief_summary>
