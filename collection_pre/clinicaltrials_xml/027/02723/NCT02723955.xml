	<brief_summary>GSK3359609 is an anti-Inducible T cell Co-Stimulator (ICOS) receptor agonist antibody intended for the treatment of cancers of different histology. This is a first-time-in-human (FTIH), open-label. multicenter study designed to investigate the safety, pharmacology, and preliminary antitumor activity in subjects with advanced or recurrent solid tumors with the aim to establish recommended dose(s) of GSK3359609 for further exploration as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab or other immune therapies. The study is comprised of two primary parts, each composed of two phases: Part 1: GSK3359609 monotherapy with Part 1A as dose escalation phase and Part 1B as dose expansion phase; Part 2: GSK3359609 combination therapy with Part 2A dose escalation phase and Part 2B dose expansion phase. Each part and phase of the study includes a screening period, a treatment period, and a follow-up period. The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose or the maximum administered dose of GSK3359609 alone or in combination.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Escalation and Expansion Study of GSK3359609 in Subjects With Selected Advanced Solid Tumors (INDUCE-1)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Pembrolizumab</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Capable of giving signed, written informed consent Male or female, age &gt;=18 years (at the time consent is obtained). Histological or cytological documentation of an invasive carcinoma that was diagnosed as locally advanced/metastatic or recurrent and is of one of the following tumor types: bladder; cervical; colorectal (includes appendix); esophagus, squamous cell; head and neck; melanoma; malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM); nonsmallcell lung cancer (NSCLC) and prostate Disease that has progressed after standard therapy for the specific tumor type, or for which standard therapy has proven to be ineffective, intolerable, or is considered inappropriate, or if no further standard therapy exists. Subjects should not have received more than 5 prior lines of therapy for advanced disease including both standards of care and investigational therapies. Archival tumor tissue obtained at anytime from the initial diagnosis to study entry; a fresh tumor biopsy will be required if archival tissue is unavailable. Agree to undergo a pretreatment and on treatment biopsy and have disease amenable to biopsy required in PK/pharmacodynamic dose expansion cohorts. Measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Palpable lesions that are not measurable by radiographic or photographic evaluations may not be utilized as the only measurable lesion. Any measurable lesion biopsied at Screening cannot be followed as a target/index lesion. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 01 Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. Adequate organ function QTcF &lt;450 milliseconds (msec) or QTcF &lt;480 msec for subjects with bundle branch block. The QTcF is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia's formula, machineread or manually overread. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative serum betahuman chorionic gonadotrophin [betahCG] test) in females of reproductive potential), not lactating or if of reproductive potential agrees to follow one of the options listed in protocol from 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication and until 120 days after the last dose of study treatment. Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential must agree to use one of the methods of contraception specified in protocol from time of first dose of study treatment until 120 days after the last dose of study treatment. Exclusion Criteria Prior treatment with the following therapies (from last dose of prior treatment to first dose of GSK3359609): Anticancer therapy within 30 days or 5 half lives of the drug, whichever is shorter. At least 14 days must have elapsed between the last dose of prior anticancer agent and the first dose of study drug is administered. Prior radiation therapy: permissible if at least one nonirradiated measurable lesion is available for assessment according to RECIST version 1.1 or if a solitary measurable lesion was irradiated, objective progression is documented. A wash out of at least two weeks before start of study drug for radiation of any intended use to the extremities for bone metastases and 4 weeks for radiation to the chest, brain, or visceral organs is required. Investigational therapy within 30 days or 5 halflives of the investigational product (whichever is shorter). At least 14 days must have elapsed between the last dose of investigational agent and the first dose of study drug is administered. Prior allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation or other solid organ transplantation. Toxicity from previous anticancer treatment Invasive malignancy or history of invasive malignancy other than disease under study Central nervous system (CNS) metastases, with the following exception: Subjects who have previouslytreated CNS metastases, are asymptomatic, and have no requirement for steroids at least 14 days prior to first dose of study drug. Note: Subjects with carcinomatous meningitis are excluded regardless of clinical stability. Received transfusion of blood products (including platelets or red blood cells) or administration of colony stimulating factors (including granulocyte colonystimulating factor [GCSF], granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor, recombinant erythropoietin) within 14 days prior to the first dose of GSK3359609. Major surgery &lt;=4 weeks before the first dose of study treatment. Subjects must have also fully recovered from any surgery (major or minor) and/or its complications before initiating study treatment. Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment within the last two years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). â€¢ Note: Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment. Concurrent medical condition requiring the use of systemic immunosuppressive medications within 7 days before the first dose of study treatment. Physiologic doses of corticosteroids for treatment of endocrinopathies or steroids with minimal systemic absorption, including topical, inhaled, or intranasal corticosteroids may be continued if the subject is on a stable dose. Active infection requiring systemic therapy, known human immunodeficiency virus infection, or positive test for hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Current active liver or biliary disease (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones, liver metastases, or otherwise stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment). Recent history (within the past 6 months) of acute diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease, intraabdominal abscess, or gastrointestinal obstruction Receipt of any live vaccine within 4 weeks. Recent history of allergen desensitization therapy within 4 weeks of starting study treatment. History of severe hypersensitivity to monoclonal antibodies. History or evidence of cardiac abnormalities History of (current and past) idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonitis (for past pneumonitis exclusion only if steroids were required for treatment),interstitial lung disease, or organizing pneumonia. Note: postradiation changes in the lung related to prior radiotherapy and/or asymptomatic radiationinduced pneumonitis not requiring treatment may be permitted if agreed by the investigator and Medical Monitor. Recent history (within 6 months) of uncontrolled symptomatic ascites or pleural effusions. Any serious and/or unstable preexisting medical, psychiatric disorder, or other condition that could interfere with the subject's safety, obtaining informed consent, or compliance to the study procedures.</criteria>
