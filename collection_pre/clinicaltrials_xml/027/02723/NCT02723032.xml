	<brief_summary>By integrating a miniaturized pulse oximetry sensor into the frame of oxygen delivery glasses which dissimulates the nasal cannula, the investigators hope to optimize and long term oxygen therapy (LTOT) regarding medical and social aspects. The validation of the novel SpO2 sensor is the first step in the concept of personalized, dynamic delivery of oxygen by eyeglasses using a closed-loop system.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation of a Miniature SpO2 Sensor in Healthy Subjects and Patients With Long-term Oxygen Therapy.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives: 1. To determine accuracy of SpO2 measurements by the novel sensor compared to 2 reference pulse oximeters in healthy subjects undergoing a normobaric hypoxic challenge provoking SpO2 desaturation. 2. To determine accuracy of SpO2 measurements by the novel sensor compared to 2 reference pulse oximeters and to arterial blood gas analysis in patients qualifying for LTOT, breathing room air at rest (lying, sitting, standing position) and during exercise (slow walking, 6-MWT, ergometer cycle).</detailed_description>
