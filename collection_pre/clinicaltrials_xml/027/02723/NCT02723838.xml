	<brief_title>Study of Intratumoral REOLYSIN® in Combination With Gemcitabine and Cisplatin as Neoadjuvant Therapy in Muscle-invasive Transitional Cell Carcinoma of the Bladder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reovirus Serotype 3 - Dearing Strain (REOLYSIN®) is a naturally occurring, ubiquitous, non-enveloped human reovirus. Reovirus has been shown to replicate selectively in Ras-transformed cells causing cell lysis. Activating mutations in Ras or mutations in oncogenes signaling through the Ras pathway may occur in as many as 80% of human tumors. The specificity of the reovirus for Ras-transformed cells, coupled with its relatively nonpathogenic nature in humans, makes it an attractive anti-cancer therapy candidate. This is an open-label study of intratumoral REOLYSIN® in combination with standard of care neoadjuvant cisplatin/gemcitabine in patients with histologically and clinically confirmed muscle-invasive bladder cancer (T2-4) with or without pelvic lymph node involvement (N1-2) in Stage III and IV with no distant metastases (M0) and no prior systemic therapy for bladder cancer. Treatment with intratumoral REOLYSIN® and chemotherapy is planned for 3 cycles followed by radical cystectomy or until unacceptable toxicity or another discontinuation criterion is met. Two sequential treatment cohorts will be enrolled. Patients in Cohort 1 will receive intratumoral REOLYSIN® on Cycle 1 Day 1, then 7-14 days later patients will receive intratumoral REOLYSIN® on Cycle 2 Day 1 plus intravenous neoadjuvant chemotherapy for 2 cycles (every 3 weeks) starting from Cycle 2 Day 2 followed by radical cystectomy. Three patients will be enrolled in this cohort. If there is a Dose Limiting Toxicity the cohort will be expanded to an additional 3 patients. Upon completion of Cohort 1, Cohort 2 will be open to enrollment of 3 patients to receive 3 cycles of standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy on Day 1 and Day 8 of each cycle and intratumoral REOLYSIN® on Day 2 of each cycle (every 3 weeks). If there is a Dose Limiting Toxicity the cohort will be expanded to an additional 3 patients. An Expansion Cohort will follow with up to 12 patients to be enrolled following either Cohort 1 or Cohort 2 treatment regimen based on the results of Cohort 1 and Cohort 2.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically and clinically confirmed muscleinvasive bladder cancer (T24) with or without pelvic lymph nodes involvement (N12) in Stage III and IV (M0). ECOG performance status ≤2. Adequate liver function with a bilirubin within normal limits. Transaminases up to 3 x ULN (Grade 1) and alkaline phosphatase may be up to 2.5 x ULN (Grade 1). Adequate bone marrow function, as defined by neutrophils count of ≥1,500/mm3, and platelet count ≥100,000/ mm3. Adequate renal function (serum creatinine ≤1.5 times the ULN). Negative pregnancy test and reliable and appropriate contraceptive method during the study for a woman of childbearing potential. All female patients of childbearing age and all male patients with partners of childbearing age should use a reliable method of contraception, such as the barrier method, throughout the study and for 60 days after last treatment. Informed of the investigational nature of this study and must sign a written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines. Received any prior therapy for invasive bladder cancer including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy or any other systemic anticancer therapy (prior intravesical therapy for noninvasive bladder cancer is acceptable including intravesical BCG and/or mitomycin and interferon). Evidence of lymph nodes or other metastatic disease beyond the pelvis (N3 and/or M1). Preexisting immunosuppressive or connective tissue disorders that require immune suppressive drugs. History of HIV or active hepatitis. Any serious concurrent illness including; but not limited to, unstable angina pectoris, uncompensated congestive cardiac failure; myocardial infarct in the previous 6 months; cardiac arrhythmias or psychiatric illness that would limit compliance with study requirements. Pregnant or lactating. A history of hypersensitivity to gemcitabine and cisplatin or any component of the formulation. A prior malignancy, other than nonmelanoma skin cancer, unless they have completed therapy at least 5 years prior to start of study and have no evidence of recurrent or residual disease. Unwilling or unable to sign informed consent document. In social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.</criteria>
