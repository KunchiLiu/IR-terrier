	<brief_summary>This study will compare the incidence of a two-part composite endpoint consisting of de novo donor specific antibody formation or a designation of "immune activation " on peripheral blood molecular profiling in patients maintained on twice daily, immediate-release tacrolimus versus those maintained on Astagraf XL in the first two years post-transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Compare the Effects of Immediate-release Tacrolimus and Astagraf XL on Donor-Specific Antibody (DSA) Formation and the Development of Immune Activation (IA) in de Novo Kidney Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an exploratory, two year, prospective, randomized, multi-center, open-label trial examining long-term kidney transplant outcomes through the use of an adaptive design and a two-part, composite surrogate endpoint. Specifically, it is designed to compare the effects of twice daily, immediate-release tacrolimus and once daily Astagraf XL on DSA formation and the development of IA in de novo kidney transplant recipients during the first two years following kidney transplantation. Patients will be screened prior to surgery and randomized 1:1 to receive, within 48 hours of transplantation, immediate-release tacrolimus, administered twice daily, or Astagraf XL, as a component of a standard immunosuppression maintenance regimen also consisting of corticosteroids (if given per institutional protocol) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (or Myfortic® equivalent).</detailed_description>

Patient currently taking or maintained on another form of extendedrelease tacrolimus following his/her transplant procedure. Patient who will be maintained on a nontacrolimusbased maintenance immunosuppressive regimen following his/her transplant procedure. Patient currently taking, having taken within 30 days, or who will be maintained on an Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor following his/her transplant procedure. Use of an investigational study drug in the 30 days prior to the transplant procedure. Contraindication or hypersensitivity to drugs or any of their components that constitute the immunosuppression regimen. 6 Ag match or zero mismatch. Receipt of an Blood Group System (A, B, AB, and O) (ABO)incompatible organ. Subject has a positive T or Bcell crossmatch by National Institutes of Health (NIH) antiglobulin lymphocytotoxicity method, if performed. Presence of a positive T or Bcell flow cytometry crossmatch defined by the MFC criteria used by participating Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) labs for their local proficiency testing. Presence of preformed antiHLA DSA as defined by a subject with an MFI approaching 1000 using flow cytometry/Luminexbased, specific antiHLA antibody testing. Receipt of desensitization, antibodyremoval, antiBcell, or antiplasma cell therapy in the 90 days preceding the transplant procedure. Planned initiation (prior to transplant) of desensitization, antibodyremoval, antiBcell, or antiplasma cell therapy within 7 days of the transplant procedure.
