	<brief_summary>Neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CRT), is considered the standard treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer with a positive impact on locoregional control and survival.However, patients with T4 rectal cancer show high risk of local recurrence after conventional treatment. Therefore investigators designed a prospective Phase II study on patients with locally advanced rectal cancer or locally recurrences, to evaluate the efficacy in terms of pathological response and resectability of concomitant boost RT (55 Gy/5 weeks) with concurrent Raltitrexed and Oxaliplatin (Tom-Ox) chemotherapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CRT), is considered the standard treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer with a positive impact on locoregional control and survival. However, patients with T4 rectal cancer show high risk of local recurrence (LR) after conventional treatment. This was a prospective Phase II study on patients with locally advanced rectal cancer or locally recurrences, to evaluate the efficacy in terms of pathological response and resectability of concomitant boost RT (55 Gy/5 weeks) with concurrent Raltitrexed and Oxaliplatin (Tom-Ox) chemotherapy. The primary aim was to assess the pathological complete response rate. Key secondary aim was the resectability. Secondary aims were evaluation of treatment-related acute and late toxicity, local control, disease-free survival and overall survival (OS). The follow-up period of each subjects started after the radiochemotherapy treatment and ended after a maximum of 36 months of observation or until death.</detailed_description>
