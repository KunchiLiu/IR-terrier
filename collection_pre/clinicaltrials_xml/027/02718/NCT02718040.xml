	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Key 1. Seeking correction of bilateral NLFs: severe (i.e., bilateral WSRS = 34) or moderate (i.e., bilateral WSRS = 23) AND bilateral MLs: severe (i.e., WAS = 34) or moderate (i.e., WAS = 23). 2. Subjects of childbearing potential who agree to use medically accepted methods of contraception during the study and for 30 days following study completion. 3. Intent to undergo optimal correction of bilateral NLFs and MLs. Optimal correction is defined as the best possible aesthetic outcome as agreed to by the treating investigator and subject. Key 1. Subject who presents with a severity of wrinkles or folds that require other treatments, e.g. laser treatment, chemical peeling, to achieve optimal correction. 2. Previous facial surgery, including aesthetic facial surgical therapy, liposuction or tattoo, in the treatment area. 3. Previous tissue augmenting therapy or contouring with permanent or nonpermanent filler or fatinjection in the facial area. 4. Previous tissue revitalization treatment with neurotoxin in the facial area within 6 months before treatment. 5. Known/previous allergy or hypersensitivity to any injectable hyaluronic acid (HA) gel. 6. Known/previous allergy or hypersensitivity to local anaesthetics, e.g. lidocaine or other amidetype anaesthetics. 7. Known/previous allergy or hypersensitivity to grampositive bacterial proteins. 8. Any medical condition that, in the opinion of the treating investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for inclusion (e.g. a chronic, relapsing or hereditary disease that may interfere with the outcome of the study). 9. Other condition preventing the subject from entering the study in the treating investigator's opinion, e.g. subjects not likely to avoid other facial cosmetic treatments, subjects anticipated to be unreliable, unavailable or incapable of understanding the study assessments or having unrealistic expectations of the treatment result.</criteria>
