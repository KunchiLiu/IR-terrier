	<brief_summary>Data show that episodes of bleeding may often be observed in critically ill patients with dialysis-dependent acute renal failure (ARF) on renal replacement therapy (RRT). From a clinical perspective, patients with dialysis-dependent ARF and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) may be considered a high risk population in regard to e.g. development of gastrointestinal (GI-) bleeding. In the current prospective subanalysis "SIREN" of the randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial "SUP-ICU" (NCT02467621), the investigators seek to elucidate whether the subpopulation of critically ill patients with dialysis-dependent acute renal failure benefits from prophylactic treatment with a proton-pump-inhibitor such as pantoprazole.</brief_summary>
