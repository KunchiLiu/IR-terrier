	<criteria>1. Informed consent, including liver metastasis biopsy, signed and dated 2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed colorectal cancer, excluding primary tumors of appendiceal origin (participants are eligible to enroll irrespective of Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutation status) 3. Male or female patients who must be postmenopausal for at least 2 years or surgically sterile. 4. Confirmed metastatic colorectal cancer (Stage IV) 5. Presence of nonresectable liver metastasis Accessibility of liver metastasis appropriate for biopsy sampling Adequate coagulation parameters including platelet count ≥100,000/mm3 Absence of concomitant medication which could represent a contraindication for biopsy (e.g., antiplatelet drugs including aspirin, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], and vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants) 6. The participant has received firstline irinotecan or oxaliplatinbased therapy without or in combination with a targeted antibody for metastatic disease and a) Experienced radiographic disease progression during firstline therapy, or b) Experienced radiographic disease progression ≤ 6 months after the last dose of firstline therapy, or c) Discontinued part or all of firstline therapy due to toxicity and experienced radiographic disease progression ≤ 6 months after the last dose of firstline therapy 7. Receipt of no more than 3 prior systemic therapy regimen for metastatic disease 8. Measurable or nonmeasurable disease based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v. 1.1) 9. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 02 10.

Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 15. Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL (can be posttransfusion) 16. International normalized ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 17. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) 18. Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times ULN 19. ALT and AST ≤ 2.5 times ULN 20. Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL 21. Proteinuria ≤ 1+ by urine dipstick OR ≤ 1 g by 24hour urine collection 22. Patients who are able to understand the nature and purpose of the study including possible risks, willing to comply with the requirements, and to provide their written informed consent to participate in the study 1. Concomitant treatment with antiangiogenic therapy before progression of disease 2. Treatment in any other clinical trial within 30 days before screening. 3. Gastric bypass 4. Ileostoma 5. Other anatomical change of the gastrointestinal tract, interfering with gastrointestinal passage, except colostoma or colon bypass 6. Untreated CNS metastases. Participants with treated brain metastases are eligible if they are clinically stable with regard to neurologic function, off steroids after cranial irradiation ending at least 2 weeks prior to randomization, or after surgical resection performed at least 28 days prior to randomization. No evidence of Grade greater than or equal to 1 CNS hemorrhage based on pretreatment Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or intravenous (IV) contrast CT scan 7. Significant traumatic injury or surgery within the past 4 weeks 8. Cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, or subarachnoid hemorrhage within the past 6 months 9. Other malignancies within the past 5 years except for adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, and/or basal cell skin cancer, and/or early endometrial carcinoma 10. Preexisting sensory or motor neuropathy ≥ grade 2 11. History or evidence of CNS disease (e.g., uncontrolled seizures) by neurological examination unless adequately treated with standard medical therapy 12. History or evidence of thrombotic or hemorrhagic disorders, including intracranial hemorrhage 13. Uncontrolled hypertension (i.e., blood pressure &gt; 160/100 mm Hg) 14. Clinically significant cardiovascular disease, including any of the following: Myocardial infarction or unstable angina within the past 6 months New York Heart Association class IIIIV congestive heart failure Poorly controlled cardiac arrhythmia despite medication, except rate controlled atrial fibrillation 15. Peripheral vascular disease ≥ grade 3 (i.e., symptomatic and interfering with activities of daily living requiring repair or revision) 16. Positive for antityphoid IgG/IgM antibodies according to the onsite test on Day 0 17. Hemoptysis within 6 months before randomization 18. Esophageal varices 19. Upper or lower gastrointestinal bleeding within 6 months before randomization 20. Nonhealing wound, incomplete wound healing, bone fracture or any history of gastrointestinal ulcers within three years before inclusion, or positive gastroscopy within 3 months before inclusion 21. Gastrointestinal fistula 22. Thrombolysis therapy within 4 weeks before randomization 23. Presence of any acute or chronic systemic infection 24. Major surgical procedures, or open biopsy within 4 weeks before randomization 25. Chronic concurrent therapy within 2 weeks before and during the initial treatment period (Day 1 to Day 7): Corticosteroids (except steroids for adrenal failure or emesis prophylaxis up to 4 mg daily dose) or immunosuppressive agents Antibiotics Bevacizumab or any other antiangiogenic treatment 26. Known multidrug resistant gramnegative bacteria 27. History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that might affect the interpretation of the study results or render the patient at high risk for treatment complications 28.
