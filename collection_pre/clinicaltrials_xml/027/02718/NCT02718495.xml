	<brief_summary>This trial will consist of two parts: the first part will enroll subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) of any mutation into a single ascending dose (SAD) treatment group. The second part will enroll adult subjects with CF of any mutation into a multiple ascending dose (MAD) treatment group. At least 36 subjects will be enrolled. The SAD treatment group is comprised of at least 3 cohorts where subjects will be randomized to either PTI-428 or placebo while being housed at or close to the clinical site checking in on Day -1 and staying through Day 4. Subjects will return to the clinical site on Day 7 for a final follow-up visit. The Safety Review Committee (SRC) will convene after the completion of each cohort to evaluate safety and other relevant data. The decision on whether to escalate the dose will be made for a completed cohort. Following the conclusion of at least 3 SAD treatment groups and after sufficient review of study data and approval by the SRC, a second set of adult subjects diagnosed with cystic fibrosis will participate in an assigned MAD treatment group. The MAD treatment group is comprised of at least 3 cohorts where subjects will be randomized to either PTI-428 or placebo while being housed at or close to the clinical site checking in on Day -1 and staying through Day 4. Subjects will return to the clinical site daily on Days 5-10 and Day 12 for an outpatient follow up visit. Subjects will return to clinic on Day 14 for the final follow-up visit. Each dose will be administered once daily (QD) for a total of 7 Days. The SRC will convene after the completion of each cohort to evaluate safety and other relevant data. The decision on whether to escalate the dose will be made for a completed cohort.</brief_summary>
