	<brief_summary>The study will evaluate interventions to improve engagement in HIV care following HIV diagnosis through a voluntary counseling and testing program. The specific aims are to (1) determine if a VCT-based intervention of CD4 count testing, alone or in combination with peer counseling, improves linkage to HIV/AIDS care; (2) assess the impact of the intervention on ART initiation. The study will recruit 450 HIV-positive individuals from VCTs and randomize a third to standard counseling and referral, a third to receive CD4 testing at the VCT with results return by phone after 1 weeks, and a third to receive the same CD4 testing combined with peer counseling. These combined investigations will create a comprehensive understanding of obstacles to appropriate HIV/AIDS care and result in new interventions to achieve measurable outcomes in applied settings.</brief_summary>
