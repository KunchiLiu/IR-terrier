	<brief_summary>Has the maternal KIR haplotype an impact in pregnancy, miscarriage and live birth rates per embryo transfer in donor oocytes -ART by paternal and oocyte donor HLA-C?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Maternal and Fetal Compatibility in ART-oocyte Donor Influences Live Birth Rate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The combination of maternal KIR haplotype and parental, donors HLA-C, could predict which couple can benefit for the selection of SET/DET, or donor selection by HLA-C in ART, in order to increase the LBR/cycle since HLA-C1/C1 donors are predicted to be safer and C2/C2 males or oocyte donors may be mor "dangerous" as identified by epidemiological studies</detailed_description>
