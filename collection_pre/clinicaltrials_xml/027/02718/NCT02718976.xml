	<brief_summary>The main objective is to complete a double-blinded randomized controlled crossover trial of lumbar plexus block with the Shamrock technique guided by ultrasound (US)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image fusion vs. the Shamrock technique guided by ultrasound in healthy volunteers. The investigators will assess block procedure-related parameters, anatomical spread of local anesthetic, and motor and sensory effects.</brief_summary>
