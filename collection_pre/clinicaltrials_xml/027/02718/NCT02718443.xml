No medical or social conditions that may interfere with study outcome and followup 1. Treatment in any other clinical trial within 30 days before screening 2. Known positive test results for Hepatitis B surface antigen , hepatitis C virus antibodies, human immunodeficiency virus antibodies 1/2 3. Any other condition or treatment that, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with the study or current drug or substance abuse 4. Inability to understand the protocol requirements, instructions and studyrelated restrictions, the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study 5. Unlikely to comply with the protocol requirements, instructions and studyrelated restrictions; e.g., uncooperative attitude, inability to return for followup visits, and improbability of completing the study 6. Pregnancy or breast feeding 7. Positive for antityphoid IgG/IgM antibodies according to the onsite test on Day 0 8.

Significant traumatic injury or surgery within 4 weeks before randomization 18. Nonhealing wound, incomplete wound healing, bone fracture or any history of gastrointestinal ulcers within three years before inclusion, or positive gastroscopy within 3 months before inclusion 19. Gastrointestinal fistula 20. Thrombolysis therapy within 4 weeks before randomization 21. Presence of any acute or chronic systemic infection 22. Major surgical procedures, or open biopsy within 4 weeks before randomization 23. Chronic concurrent therapy within 2 weeks before and during the treatment period up to Day 35 with: Corticosteroids (except steroids for adrenal failure or emesis prophylaxis up to 4 mg daily dose) or immunosuppressive agents Antibiotics Bevacizumab Any cancer antiangiogenic treatment 24. Chemotherapy from screening until reoperation (Day 35) 25. Known multidrug resistant gramnegative germ 26. History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that might affect the interpretation of the study results or render the patient at high risk for treatment complications 27. Women of childbearing potential 28. Any condition which results in an undue risk for the patient during the study participation according to the investigator</criteria>
