	<brief_title>Importance of the Current Density in TENS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TENS have been used to treatment against pain and reflex modulation. However, the most part of evidence do not show the current density. This parameter has been demonstrated like a important factor in the effect of the current about the outcome measures. This study show the difference between the same subjective sensation "strong but comfortable" in current density and the relation with the effect about H-reflex.</detailed_description>
