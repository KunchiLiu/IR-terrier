	<brief_summary>Oxidative stress and inflammation are cardiovascular risk factors in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing hemodialysis (HD). Nuclear transcription factors play roles in the coordinated expression of genes involved in inflammation, such as nuclear factor Kappa B (NFkB) that increase the cytokines synthesis and Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) that increase the transcription of genes encoding enzymes of phase II detoxifying and antioxidant enzymes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of resistance exercise program on the expression of transcription factors Nrf2 and NF-kB in HD patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Physical Activities on the Expression of Nrf2 and Nf-kb Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study included 44 patients on regular HD program which 25 patients (54.5% women, age 45.7 ± 15.2 years and time on dialysis, 71.2 ± 45.5 months) composed the exercise group and 19 patients (61.5% women, age 42.5 ± 13.5 years and time on dialysis, 70.1 ± 49.9 months) the control group. The exercise program was performed during HD sessions, 3 times a week (36 exercises sessions). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated and processed for expression of Nrf2, NF-kB and NADPH quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Antioxidant enzymes activity (catalase-CAT and glutathione peroxidase-GPx), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and nitric oxide (NO) products were assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).</detailed_description>
