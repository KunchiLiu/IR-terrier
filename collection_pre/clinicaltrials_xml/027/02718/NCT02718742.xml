	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation maintenance therapy works after cisplatin-based chemotherapy and surgery in treating patients with high-risk bladder cancer. Maintenance therapy, such as paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, can help keep cancer from coming back after it has disappeared following initial chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation After Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy and Surgery in Treating Patients With High-Risk Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate in patients with high risk urothelial carcinoma treated with cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by curative intent cystectomy receiving maintenance therapy with paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation (nab-paclitaxel). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate overall survival (OS), time to progression and duration of response in patients treated with cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by curative intent cystectomy receiving maintenance therapy with nab-paclitaxel. II. To evaluate the adverse events associated with use of single agent nab-paclitaxel (AbraxaneÂ®) in patients with high risk urothelial carcinoma receiving maintenance therapy III. To evaluate Health Related Quality of life (HRQoL) as assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Care (EORTC) QLQ-C30. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the presence of circulating tumor cells (CTC) in high risk patients with urothelial carcinoma prior to initiation of maintenance therapy (baseline) and after nab-paclitaxel exposure (at cycles 2, 4). OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>
