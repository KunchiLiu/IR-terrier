	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 3, open-label, international, multi-center, efficacy, and safety study of avelumab in combination with and/or following platinum-based chemotherapy. Eligible patients must have previously untreated, histologically confirmed Stage III-IV epithelial ovarian (EOC), fallopian tube cancer (FTC), or primary peritoneal cancer (PPC) and be candidates for platinum-based chemotherapy. The primary purpose of the study is to demonstrate if avelumab given as single agent in the maintenance setting following frontline chemotherapy or in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel is superior to platinum-based chemotherapy alone followed by observation in this population of newly diagnosed ovarian cancer patients.</brief_summary>
