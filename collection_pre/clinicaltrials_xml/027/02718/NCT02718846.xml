Thus, eliminate the cause of bleeding and administer the drug after ensuring that there are no concerns of rebleeding) A patient with anuria (with urinary output of less than 100 mL/day) A severely dehydrated patient (loss of 10% or more of body weight) A patient with acute pulmonary edema A patient with severe heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or higher) A patient with an adrenal tumor A patient with pheochromocytoma A patient who is hypersensitive to the ingredients of the test and control drugs A patient with a hereditary disease such as galactose intolerance, Lapp lactose deficiency or glucosegalactose malabsorption A woman who is pregnant or breastfeeding A patient who is deemed ineligible for this clinical study by the analyst</criteria>
