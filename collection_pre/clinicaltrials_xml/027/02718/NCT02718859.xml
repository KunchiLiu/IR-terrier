	<brief_title>Combination of Irreversible Electroporation and NK Immunotherapy for Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>By enrolling patients with pancreatic cancer adapted to enrolled criteria, this study will document for the first time the safety and the short and long term efficacy of the combined therapy using irreversible electroporation（IRE）and nature killer（NK） cells for advanced pancreatic cancer. The efficacy will be evaluated according to relief degree,progress free survival(PFS) and overall survival(OS). The safety will be evaluated by statistics of adverse reaction</detailed_description>
