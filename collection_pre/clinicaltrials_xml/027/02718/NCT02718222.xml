	<brief_title>Impact and Performance of Institutionalizing Immediate Post-partum IUD Services</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) has designed and is planning to implement, through its nationally-affiliated Associations of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians, an intervention program on post-partum IUD (PPIUD) services. As part of this Program, FIGO is responsible for information material, training providers, improving facilities, quality of service, and monitoring the program. Independent of the implementation, this study will measure the impact and performance of this intervention in three (Sri Lanka, Nepal and Tanzania) of the six countries participating in the FIGO project entitled: "Institutionalization of immediate post-partum IUD (PPIUD) services as a routine part of antenatal counselling and delivery room services in Sri Lanka, Kenya, India, Tanzania, Nepal and Bangladesh." The FIGO intervention will take place over a nine-month period in Tanzania (nine months in the first group of three hospitals and three months in the second group of three hospitals), and over a fifteen-month period in Nepal and Sri Lanka (fifteen months in the first group of three hospitals and nine months in the second group of three hospitals). Investigators will study both the impact of the intervention on the uptake and subsequent continued use of PPIUD and the extent to which the intervention leads to the institutionalization of postpartum IUD services in the hospitals during and after the FIGO intervention and to what extent the service diffuses to other hospitals or providers. The institutionalization and diffusion of the intervention will be measured by interviewing and following up trained providers, review of hospital records and baseline, during intervention and post-intervention facility surveys.</detailed_description>
