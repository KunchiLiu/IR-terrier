	<brief_summary>The proposed study is a multicenter, open-label phase I trial, conducted in locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer HER2 negative patients and divided into 2 parts: - STEP 1: a dose escalation part (n= up to 30) to evaluate the safety profile and pharmacokinetics and to define the MTD and RP2D to recommend in a phase II. - STEP 2: an expansion cohort part to confirm the safety and tolerability of ribociclib and capecitabine association on a longer follow-up, and to obtain preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity on two expanded cohorts of HR positive and HR negative patients. Up to 14 patients in each cohort, taking into account patients already included in step one at this DL, may be enrolled, for a total of 28 at the RP2D.</brief_summary>

Tumor no overexpressing HER2 (HER2 1+ in IHC, or IHC 2+ and FISH/ CISH negative) in samples from the primary and/or secondary tumor 5. A representative tumor specimen must be available for future research programs. An archival tumor sample may be submitted; however, if one is not available, a newly obtained tumor biopsy specimen must be submitted instead 6.

WHO performance status (ECOG) from 0 to 1 10. Adequate hematological and coagulation function: Hb ≥ 9.0 g/dL, ANC ≥ 1500/mm3 platelets ≥ 100 000/mm3, INR ≤ 1.5 11. Adequate hepatic function: total bilirubin ≤ ULN, or total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 x ULN or direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN in patients with well documented Gilbert's Syndrome, ALAT and ASAT ≤ 2.5 x ULN (regardless of the presence or absence of liver metastasis) 12. Adequate renal function: serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min 13. Adequate ionic balance: potassium, total calcium (corrected for serum albumin), magnesium, sodium and phosphorus within normal limits for the institution or corrected to within normal limits with supplements before first dose of study medication 14. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective contraceptive method while on treatment and for 8 weeks after study drugs discontinuation. Highly effective contraception methods are detailed in section 6.1.1. 15. Patient must be affiliated to a Social Security system 16. Patient information and written informed consent form signed 1. Patient has been pretreated by CDK inhibitor or capecitabine 2. Patient has a DPD deficiency 3. Patient has a known hypersensitivity to to 5FU or to any of the excipients of ribociclib or capecitabine 4. Patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement unless they meet ALL of the following criteria: At least 4 weeks from prior therapy completion (including radiation and/or surgery) to starting the study treatment Clinically stable CNS tumor at the time of screening and not receiving steroids and/or enzymeinducing antiepileptic medications for brain metastases 5. Patient has impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of the study drugs (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel resection) 6. Patient has a known history of HIV infection (testing not mandatory) 7. Clinically significant, uncontrolled heart disease and/or recent events including any of the following: History of acute coronary syndromes (including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass grafting, coronary angioplasty, or stenting) or symptomatic pericarditis within 12 months prior to screening History of documented congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional classification IIIIV) Documented cardiomyopathy Patient has a Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) &lt; 50% as determined by Multiple Gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO) at screening History of any cardiac arrhythmias, e.g., ventricular, supraventricular, nodal arrhythmias, or conduction abnormality within 12 months of screening Congenital long QT syndrome or family history of long QT syndrome Systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt;160 mmHg or &lt;90 mmHg at screening Bradycardia (heart rate &lt;50 at rest), by ECG or pulse, at screening 8. On screening, inability to determine the QTcF interval on the ECG (i.e.: unreadable or not interpretable) or QTcF &gt;450 msec (using Fridericia's correction). All as determined by screening ECG (mean of triplicate ECGs) 9. Patient is currently receiving any of the following medications (see Table 9 for details) and cannot be discontinued 7 days prior to starting study drugs: Known strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4/5, including grapefruit, grapefruits hybrids, pummelos, starfruit, and Seville oranges That have a narrow therapeutic window and are predominantly metabolized through CYP3A4/5 That have a known risk to prolong the QT interval or induce Torsades de Pointes Herbal preparations/medications, dietary supplements 10. Patient is currently receiving or has received: systemic corticosteroids within ≤ 2 weeks prior to starting study drug, or who have not fully recovered from side effects of such treatment. The following uses of corticosteroids are permitted: single doses, topical applications (e.g., for rash), inhaled sprays (e.g., for obstructive airways diseases), eye drops or local injections (e.g., intraarticular) sorivudine or brivudine within 4 weeks prior to starting capecitabine 11. Patients with concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled concurrent medical conditions that would, in the investigator's judgement, cause unacceptable safety risks, contraindicate the participation in the study or compromise compliance with the protocol (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension and/or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, clinically significant pulmonary disease, clinically significant neurological disorder, chronic pancreatitis, chronic active hepatitis, active untreated or uncontrolled fungal, bacterial or viral infections, etc.) 12. Patient is currently receiving warfarin or other coumarinderived anticoagulant for treatment, prophylaxis or otherwise.
