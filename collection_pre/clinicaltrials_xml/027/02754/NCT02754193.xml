	<brief_summary>A multicenter, prospective, controlled, randomized (moderate hypothermia 33°C≤ T°C ≤34°C) during 24 hours ± 1h versus normothermia (37°C ± 0.3 °C), comparative open trial will be conducted on two parallel groups of patients with cardiogenic shock treated with VA-ECMO. The HYPO-ECMO trial will test the hypothesis that moderate hypothermia (temperature between 33°C≤ T°C ≤34°C) associated with VA-ECMO support results in a reduction in 30-day mortality in comparison with the normothermia group (37°C ± 0.3°C).</brief_summary>
