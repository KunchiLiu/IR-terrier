	<brief_summary>Vascular claudication is a common cause of functional limitation. This painful condition is a source overall muscle deconditioning in the peripheral arterial diseased (PAD) patient leading gradually to a state accented inactivity. The characterization of the claudication as it results from a proximal or distal ischemia has never carried out. Investigators will analyze dynamic pedometer parameter throughout walking tests in PAD patients with claudication</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Claudication, Systematic Evaluation of Limp on Treadmill</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients referred for exercise tests on treadmill for the quantification of walking ability will gave a recording of their walking parameters through an instrumented treadmill recording biomechanic parameters (surface electromyography, walking pace; force of the foot/treadmill interface, length of the step.. etc.) Analysis will be performed until walking is stopped due to usual claudication during a constant load 2MPH 10% slope treadmill procedure.</detailed_description>
