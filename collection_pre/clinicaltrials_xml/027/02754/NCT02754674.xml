	<brief_summary>1. Purpose :To compare of femoral tunnel placement, tunnel geometry and clinical outcome using two anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction techniques ; transportal technique with flexible reamer and single bundle outside in technique with remnant preservation. 2. Subjects: anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury 66 patients - Double bundle transportal technique with flexible reamer: 33 - Single bundle outside in technique with remnant preservation: 33</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Femoral Tunnel and Clinical Outcome Using Two Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury patients : Total 66 1. Double bundle transportal technique with flexible reamer: 33 - Advantage: more normal ACL reconstruction than single bundle technique - Disadvantage: to make the two bone tunnel must remove all the residual tissue. 2. Single bundle outside in technique with remnant preservation: 33 - Advantage: good for being synovium and revascularization. Remained proprioception function helps to functional recovery. - Disadvantage: difficult to ensure of visibility and tunnel drilling in the correct position because of remnant tissue.</detailed_description>
