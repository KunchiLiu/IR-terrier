	<brief_title>The Effects of Rhus Coriaria L. on Body Weight</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rhus coriaria L.(Rhus) is a well-known spice widely consumed in the world which has also been utilized extensively for medicinal purposes. The antioxidant components of this plant made it a favorable target for laboratory and animal studies in different conditions such as oxidative stress cytotoxicity, diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Rhus (Somagh) is found in temperate and tropical regions worldwide, often growing in areas of marginal agricultural capacity. Rhus is used as an herbal remedy in traditional medicine because of its assumed analgesic, antidiarrheic, antiseptic, anorexic and antihyperglycemic properties. The fruits of Rhus contain flavonols, phenolic acids, hydrolysable tannins, anthocyans and organic acids such as malice, citric and tartaric acids. Some studies have shown that polyphenols could have beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease and cancer and could be regarded as bioactive compounds with a high potential health-promoting capacity. Phenolic compounds inhibit lipid peroxidation, scavenge the superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical, and enhance the activities of detoxifying enzymes. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of Rhus coriaria L. (Rhus) commonly known as Somagh on body weight.</detailed_description>
