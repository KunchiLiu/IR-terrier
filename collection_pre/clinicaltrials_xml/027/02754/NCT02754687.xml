	<brief_title>Single Dose, Dose-Ranging Study of 11-β Methyl Nortestosterone Dodecylcarbonate (11β-MNTDC) in Healthy Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I multicenter, double-blind, single dose, dose-ranging study, in healthy men followed on an inpatient basis to evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 11β-methyl nortestosterone dodecylcarbonate (11β-MNTDC). This single dose, dose-ranging study of 4 escalating doses will be conducted in two centers. Initially, 12 men will be enrolled in total, 6 men at each center, with a goal of having a minimum of 12 healthy male subjects completing this study (10 active drugs and 2 placebos) both in the fed and fasting states at each dose. Each of the 4 doses of 11β-MNTDC will be administered first fasting and then fed. Each of the doses of 11β-MNTDC will be administered about 28 days apart +/- 14 days with the time interval between the fasting and fed dosing will be approximately 7 days (-2/+9 days) and a 7 to 14 day washout will occur before dose escalation.</detailed_description>
