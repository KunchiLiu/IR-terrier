	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare a motor learning (ML)-based gait-related training intervention to a functional lower limb strength training intervention, with a concurrent evaluation of functional, neural and participation outcomes for children and youth with Cerebral Palsy (CP). This study is a two-group, parallel arm RCT in which twenty-two children with CP in GMFCS Levels I-II will be randomly allocated to a 6-week, 16 session program of: (i) ML based gait training or (ii) lower limb strength training. Outcome assessments occur pre/post/4-months post-intervention.</brief_summary>
