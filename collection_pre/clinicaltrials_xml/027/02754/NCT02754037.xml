	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to evaluate non-invasive imaging techniques for determining liver steatosis (fat), inflammation (abnormal tissue swelling), and fibrosis (abnormal tissue scarring).In addition, the study group will be using other test measures including personal demographics, laboratory blood test results, and imaging measurements to determine the severity of NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), inflammation, and fibrosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-Invasive Evaluation of Liver Steatosis, Inflammation and Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study group proposes to evaluate the role of KBD FDG-PET in the determination of steatohepatitis and in combination with MRI for detection, differentiation and quantitation of liver steatosis, steatohepatitis and fibrosis in correlation to liver biopsy. Patient enrolled in this will already have had their liver biopsy or will be undergoing liver biopsy as a part of their clinical care as determined by their provider and will not be getting biopsies solely to be enrolled in the study. Current treatment options for patients that liver biopsy is being performed are limited to lifestyle changes and vitamin E for patients without diabetes.</detailed_description>
