	<brief_title>Evaluating Newly Approved Drugs for Multidrug-resistant TB</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase III, randomized, controlled, open-label, non-inferiority, multi-country trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of new combination regimens for MDR-TB treatment. Regimens examined combine newly approved drugs bedaquiline and/or delamanid with existing drugs known to be active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (linezolid, clofazimine, moxifloxacin or levofloxacin, and pyrazinamide). The study will enroll in parallel across 5 experimental and 1 standard-of-care control arms. Randomization will be outcome adapted using Bayesian interim analysis of efficacy endpoints. Experimental regimens will contain bedaquiline and/or delamanid and up to 4 companion drugs. Control-arm treatment may contain one of the following (bedaquiline or delamanid) and companion drugs, constructed and delivered according to local standard of care and consistent with WHO guidelines. Trial participation in all arms will be for 104 weeks post randomization. In the experimental arms, treatment will be for 39 weeks (participants in the experimental arms will be allowed up to 47 weeks to complete the 39-week treatment course) and post-treatment follow up for up to 65 additional weeks. In the control arm, treatment will be delivered according to local standard of care (in consistence with WHO guidance); duration will be variable, for approximately 86 weeks. Non-inferiority will be established for any experimental arm if the lower bound of the one-sided 97.5% confidence interval around the difference in favorable outcome between the control and experimental arms is greater than or equal to -12%.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A patient will be eligible for randomization if s/he: 1. Has documented pulmonary tuberculosis due to strains of M. tuberculosis resistant to rifampin (RIF) and susceptible to fluoroquinolones, diagnosed by validated rapid molecular test; 2. Is ≥ 15 years of age; 3. Is willing to use effective contraception: premenopausal women or women whose last menstrual period was within the preceding year, who have not been sterilized must agree to use two methods of contraception (e.g., a hormonal method and a barrier method) unless their partner has had a vasectomy; men who have not had a vasectomy must agree to use condoms; 4. Provides informed consent for study participation; additionally a legal representative of patients considered minor per local laws should also provide consent; 5. Lives in a dwelling that can be located by study staff and expects to remain in the area for the duration of the study. A patient will not be eligible for randomization if s/he: 1. Has known allergies or hypersensitivity to any of the investigational drugs; 2. Is known to be pregnant or is unwilling or unable to stop breastfeeding an infant; 3. Is unable to comply with treatment or followup schedule; 4. Any condition (social or medical) which, in the opinion of the site principal investigator, would make study participant unsafe; 5. Has had exposure in the past five years, or resistance to, bedaquiline, delamanid, linezolid, or clofazimine; exposure to other antiTB drugs is not a reason for exclusion. 6. Has one or more of the following: Hemoglobin ≤ 7.9 g/dL; Uncorrectable electrolytes disorders: Calcium &lt; 7.0 mg/dL; Potassium &lt; 3.0 or ≥6.0 mEq/L; Magnesium &lt; 0.9 mEq/L; Serum creatinine &gt; 3 x ULN; Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 3 x ULN; Total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x ULN if accompanied by AST or ALT &gt; ULN or total bilirubin ≥ 2 x ULN when other liver function results are in the normal range; Albumin &lt; 2.8 g/dL; Grade 4 result on any of the specified laboratory tests as defined by the MSF Severity Scale. 7. Has cardiac risk factors defined as: A confirmed QTc interval of greater than or equal to 450 ms. Retesting to reassess eligibility will be allowed once using an unscheduled visit during the screening phase; Evidence of ventricular preexcitation (e.g., Wolff Parkinson White syndrome); Electrocardiographic evidence of complete or clinically significant incomplete left bundle branch block or right bundle branch block; Evidence of second or third degree heart block; Bradycardia as defined by sinus rate less than 50 bpm; Personal or family history of Long QT Syndrome; Personal history of arrhythmic cardiac disease, with the exception of sinus arrhythmia; Personal history of syncope (i.e. cardiac syncope not including syncope due to vasovagal or epileptic causes). 8. Is currently taking part in another trial of a medicinal product; 9. Is taking any medication that is contraindicated with the medicines in the trial regimen which cannot be stopped (with or without replacement) or requires a washout period longer than 2 weeks.</criteria>
