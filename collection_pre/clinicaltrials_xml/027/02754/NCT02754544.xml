	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if using a larger than the standard mapping grid currently used at MD Anderson during brain tumor surgery or a high-definition grid for electrocorticogram (ECoG) brain mapping can help better identify which areas of the brain are active during specific limb movement and speech. In this study, the result of two types of ECoG mapping grids will be analyzed. ECoG mapping will take place during participant's scheduled surgery. Before the procedure, participant will be assigned one of the two types of mapping grids. The mapping grid will be placed directly on the surface of participant's brain during surgery. Participant will not be able to feel this. The grids contain electrodes attached to a computer to record brain activity. A wireless digital glove will be used with the high-definition grid. The glove records hand movements, while the grids shows the areas of the brain that are active during the hand movements.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Before surgery: - Participant will have 2 standard pre-surgical brain mapping procedures: functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). For the fMRI, participant will lie inside of a long scanner and be asked to perform several simple tasks. The scan will show areas of the brain that are active during specific tasks. During the TMS procedure, a magnetic coil is moved over certain areas of participant's head to stimulate the parts of the brain that cause muscles in participant's arms and legs to move. This will help the doctor learn which specific parts of participant's brain control participant's limbs. - Participant will be trained to use the wireless digital glove that will be used in the ECoG mapping during participant's surgery. - Participant will be assigned one of the three types of high definition mapping grids (PMT, AdTech or CorTec grid) to be used during participant's surgery. During surgery: - The mapping grid will be placed on the surface of participant's brain. - When the grid is in place, the anesthesiologist will wake participant up and participant will be asked to wear the special glove and perform hand movements. This should take about 20 minutes. - The neurosurgeon will perform standard tests (direct electrical stimulation mapping) to learn which parts of the brain near the tumor control the arms and legs. These areas of the brain will be stimulated with a small-dose electrical current to see which limbs will move. - After this procedure, the anesthesiologist will put participant back to sleep. The results of the ECoG mapping will be used for research purposes only. They will not be used to make decisions about participant's surgery. The collected data will be de-identified and will be transferred to neural engineering laboratory of Dr. Ince located at the University of Houston for detailed computer based analysis. One (1) day after surgery, participant will have a neurological exam (tests to check the functioning of participant's nerves, including tests of participant's balance and reflexes). Length of Study: Participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits. Follow-up Visits: At 1 and 3 months after participant's surgery, participant will come back to the clinic for standard follow-up visits. At each visit, participant will have a complete physical and neurological exam. This is an investigational study. The fMRI, TMS procedure, and direct electrical stimulation are FDA-approved procedures. Both PMT and AdTech mapping grids are FDA-approved and commercially available. ECoG mapping utilizing the PMT grids during brain tumor surgery is FDA-approved and currently used at MD Anderson. The AdTech grid is FDA-approved and was previously used in MD Anderson. Up to 20 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
