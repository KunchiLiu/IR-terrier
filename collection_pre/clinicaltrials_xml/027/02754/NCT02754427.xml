	<brief_summary>Breast cancer treatment often results in long-term arm morbidity. A prospective surveillance model with arm assessment pre-surgery followed by ongoing surveillance and targeted physiotherapy treatment after breast cancer surgery may improve early detection and management of arm morbidity. This study aims to determine the effect of prospective surveillance to target physiotherapy on the prevalence of arm morbidity in the surveillance group compared to control group at 12-months after breast cancer surgery.</brief_summary>
