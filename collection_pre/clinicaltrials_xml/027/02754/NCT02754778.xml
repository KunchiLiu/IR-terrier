	<brief_title>Influence of Conditional Workout Postpartum on Arterial Stiffness Among Women With Status After Preeclampsia, Superimposed Preeclampsia or HELLP-syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death among women in Europe and in the USA. Its costs amount annually more than 196 billions Euro in Europe. The federal state of Saxony-Anhalt occupies leading position in mortality in myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease in Germany. Up to 8 percent of all pregnant women develop a severe pregnancy-associated hypertension, like preeclampsia, superimposed preeclampsia or HELLP-syndrome. These women have an increased lifetime risk for cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases. The consecutive increasing arterial stiffness because of endothelial dysfunction is a determining factor in etiology of pregnancy-associated hypertension and results in increased cardiovascular risk. Aortal pulse wave velocity is used as Goldstandard for measuring arterial stiffness. Pregnant women suffering from a severe pregnancy-associated hypertension present higher levels in arterial stiffness measured by pulse wave velocity than healthy pregnant women. Pathological changes of the vascular systems persistent from 6 month until 10 years after delivery and give an explanatory approach for an increased cardiovascular longterm risk at these patients. Numerous medical associations like American Heart Association aim at reducing especially cardiovascular longterm risk in women with status after preeclampsia, superimposed preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome. Pregnancy-independent studies in patients with coronary heart disease and analysis in women with metabolic syndrome show a reduction of arterial stiffness by regular conditional workout. Scientific problem of this pilot study: If a reduction in arterial stiffness in women from a risk group - during a 6-month-ongoing intensive regular conditional workout within a midwife-supported teamwork and under inclusion of dietary interventions - achieved?</detailed_description>
