	<brief_summary>This is a platelet transfusion study. The purpose of this study is to measure the life span and quality of platelets preserved in an additive solution and stored in a refrigerator. Participants will give platelets by apheresis. Platelets will be stored for 3 -20 days. A small portion of the subject's own stored platelets will be tagged with a radioactive isotope and infused back into the participant. This will enable us to track how many transfused platelets survive after storage in the refrigerator.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cold Apheresis Platelets in Isoplate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A double hyperconcentrated apheresis platelet unit will be collected from a healthy adult volunteer subject using the Trima Accel® Automated Blood Collection System. Concurrent plasma will be collected. After collection the unit will be split into two equal portions and will be re-suspended in 65% Isoplate (a platelet additive solution) and 35% plasma while the other half will be suspended in plasma. Both units will achieve a final platelet concentration of ~1500 x 103 platelets/μL. Both units will be stored, without agitation, at 4°C. The plasma suspended unit (control) will be stored for 3 days, the maximum platelet storage time allowed for refrigerated platelets by the FDA. The Isoplate/plasma unit (test) will be stored for up to 20 days. On Day 3 the subject will receive an Indium 111 (In-111) radiolabeled aliquot of their control plasma 4°C stored platelets. Follow-up samples from the subject will be collected approximately 2 hours post-infusion and on Days 1 (2X), 2, 3, 4, and 5 to calculate recovery and survival of the subject's 3 day stored platelets. On Day 1 the sample draws will be 2 - 10 hours apart. The Isoplate 4°C stored platelets will initially be stored for 10 days. The subject will receive an infusion of In-111 aliquot of their 4°C Isoplate stored platelets. Follow-up samples, as above, will be collected to calculate platelet recovery and survival of the test unit. These studies will allow comparison of the 3 and 10 day stored platelets. Indium will be used to label both control and test platelets because the other available isotope, chromium, is not taken up by refrigerated platelets. The In-111 administered on Day 3 will be largely undetectable by Day 10 and therefore re-use of the same isotope to measure both control and test cold stored platelets is valid. Additionally, the investigator will collect a pre-infusion radioactivity sample to account for any residual In-111, and adjust the calculations accordingly. Each subject's Isoplate platelet recovery and survival will be considered acceptable if they are ≤20% less than the subject's corresponding 3-day stored sample measurements. Acceptance criteria are met for a given storage time if samples from all subjects in that group meet acceptability threshold. So long as acceptance criteria are met with 5 split paired units stored for 10 days the investigator will progressively increase the storage period in two day increments until acceptance criteria are no longer met (i.e., when at least one subject has &gt;20% reduction in either recovery or survival compared to the same subject's 3-day 4°C plasma stored platelets). The investigator will evaluate 12, 14, 16, 18 and 20 day storage so long as test platelets for all 5 subjects in the group demonstrate ≤20% reduction in recovery and survival as compared to their own 3-day plasma 4°C stored platelets. Once the first storage period that fails to meet acceptance criteria is identified, the investigator will fall back by one day to evaluate the mid storage period between that which met and that which failed criteria. If that mid-storage period fails, then the investigator will evaluate the prior storage period again with 5 additional samples, continuing to step back down until a group meets acceptance criteria for all 10 subjects. Thus, once the maximum acceptable storage time has been determined, a total of 10 subjects satisfying acceptance criteria will have platelet viability data collected at that storage time. In addition to radiolabeled platelet recovery and survival measurements, various in vitro assays will be performed at the end of each storage condition (3 day and extended stored; i.e. 10 to 20 day).</detailed_description>
