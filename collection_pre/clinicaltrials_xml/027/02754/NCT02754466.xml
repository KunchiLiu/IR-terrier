	<brief_title>Oral Health and Its Relation to Development and Well-being of Schoolchildren Before and After Restorative Treatments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schoolchildren, aged 6-8 years old, from the six public schools of a deprived suburban area of Bras√≠lia, Brazil will be recruited. In the stage 1 of the study, an epidemiological survey of the oral health status and an anthropometric evaluation of the children will be performed. Potential patient for study's stage 2 will be recruited. Quality of life surveys, patterns of oral hygiene and socio-demographic data will be collected. Children with restorative treatment needs will be included in the study's stage 2. In this second stage, primary molars with deep dentin lesions will be treated according to two techniques for selective excavation of carious dentin: subjective criteria or using an objective criteria (polymer burs). For both groups restorations will be performed using a high-viscosity glass-ionomer. In shallow and medium depth dentin lesions, carious dentin will be excavated using hand instruments only (ART approach) and restored using two materials: a high-viscosity glass-ionomer or a combination of a self-etch adhesive and a bulk fill composite. All children will be followed up (study's stage 3) to assess efficacy of the restorative interventions and impact of the restorative treatment on children's quality of life and development.</detailed_description>
