	<brief_summary>The NCTT is a prospective, multicenter, observational research network for subjects with chronic spinal cord and/or chronic traumatic brain injury.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The National Center for Testing Treatments in Chronic Spinal Cord and Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current treatment for Spinal Cord Injury and Traumatic Brain Injury focuses on stabilizing the patient and preventing secondary injury with the aim of maximizing the best chance of recovery. Most patients will show varying amounts of recovery, but, when the injury is severe, that recovery is only partial. Enrollment in the NCTT will allow for classification and characterization of injury, function, co-morbidities, secondary issues/problems, research interests and will serve as a conduit for enrollment into interventional studies. The goal of NCTT is bridge the gap between the deficit of research on post-acute therapies for TBI and SCI's and chronic treatment for those living with these conditions.</detailed_description>
