	<brief_summary>This study compare the intubation success rate between video laryngoscope and rigid video stylet in cervical spine surgery patients. Half of patients will receive endotracheal intubation by video laryngscope, other half of patients will receive endotracheal intubation by rigid video laryngoscope.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intubation Success Rate_Rigid Video Stylet Vs Video Laryngoscope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Video laryngoscope and lightwand are widely used at endotracheal intubation in cervical spine patients. Video laryngoscope is useful because of identification of anatomic structure around the oral cavity and vocal cord. Rigid video stylet resemble lightwand, but it has a video at the end of stylet. So rigid video stylet is useful at confirmation of vocal cord.</detailed_description>
