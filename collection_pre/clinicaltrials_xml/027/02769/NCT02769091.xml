The patient has received oral antibiotics within the last 4 weeks prior to randomization (day 1). The patient has received treatment within the last 30 days with any drugs known to induce or inhibit endogenous hepatic drug metabolism (eg, barbiturates, phenothiazines, cimetidine, carbamazepine) or anticoagulant therapy (eg, heparin, warfarin, acenocoumarol).
