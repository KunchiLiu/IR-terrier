	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine in situ the bacterial viability, thickness and bacterial diversity of a biofilm formed on different substrates in comparison to a naturally tooth-formed oral biofilm. In addition, it will be evaluated whether the restraint of oral hygiene measures may influence the development of the PL-Biofilm.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- To calculate an a priori sample size, the following statistical criteria were established: an effect size of 0.35, an alpha error of 0.05 and a statistical power of 87%. Assuming these criteria and using the repeated measures ANOVA test, a sample size of 15 subjects was required. - Bacterial viability and thickness will be analyse by Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope and Live/Dead BackLight staining solution. - Bacterial diversity will be analyse by Pyrosequencing the 16S DNAr gene.</detailed_description>
