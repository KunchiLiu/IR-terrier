	<brief_title>Assessing the Effect of Neglected Tropical Diseases on Plasmodium Falciparum Transmission in an Area of Co-endemicity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The project is divided in three different work packages that cover the life cycle of P. falciparum : 1. In Work Package 1 (WP1) the investigators will assess whether S. haematobium infection increases the human reservoir of P. falciparum by increasing the carriage rate and incidence of P. falciparum gametocytaemia as well as by increasing the proportion and incidence of subject with sub-microscopic P. falciparum infection. The investigators will also determine whether this increase in gametocyte carriage is a consequence of an impairment of the immune response of helminth infected subjects to P. falciparum. 2. In Work Package 2 (WP2) the investigators will determine whether the transmission of the sexual forms of P. falciparum from the human host to mosquito is increased in S. haematobium infected subjects compared to uninfected controls. Moreover the investigators will study whether the immunological changes induced in S. haematobium infected subjects lead to a decrease of the transmission reducing activity of IgG specific to Pfs48/45 and Pfs230 (both capable of blocking/impairing further development of P. falciparum in the mosquito gut). 3. Finally in Work Package 3 (WP3) the investigators will assess whether S. haematobium infection affects the transmission of P. falciparum from the mosquito to the human host. This effect will be determined indirectly by assessing whether S. haematobium infected subjects are more attractive to mosquitoes.</detailed_description>
