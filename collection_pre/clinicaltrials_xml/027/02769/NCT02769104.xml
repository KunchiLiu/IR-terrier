	<brief_title>Aromatase Inhibitors Plus Chemotherapy vs Chemotherapy as Neoadjuvant Treatment in Postmenopausal HR(+) Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The endocrine therapy has been used more and more in neoadjuvant treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. But it still a question if neoadjuvant endocrine therapy can be used combined with chemotherapy. There have been several small-sample studies concerning about this item and also got some results that support the suppose that endocrine therapy combined with chemotherapy could rise the effect of neoadjuvant treatment. This study is to investigate the effect of aromatase inhibitors (AI) plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment in postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.</detailed_description>
