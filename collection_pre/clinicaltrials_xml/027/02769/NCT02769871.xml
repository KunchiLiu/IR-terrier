	<brief_title>Effect of Stroke Neuro-images on Smoking Cessation in Patients With New Stroke.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators hypothesize that showing actual images of a patient's stroke to the participant on either brain CT or MRI will be a similarly easy to understand quantification of damage done to the participant's body. Given the link between smoking and stroke risk, the investigators believe that providing this imaging in addition to standard smoking cessation education may improve rates of smoking cessation after stroke. If this proves true, addition of a patient's neuroimaging to standard post-stroke smoking cessation education would be an easy method to improve smoking cessation rates in stroke patients, at minimal cost.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age ≥18 Active smoker, as defined: at least 100 cigarettes in their entire life, must have smoked cigarette at least once in 4 days prior to onset of stroke Primary ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke identified on neuroimaging (MRI DWI/ADC or CT of brain) Onset of stroke symptoms within 30 days to time of recruitment Capacity to comprehend counseling data: Each participant will be given a cognitive screening test to assess the ability to comprehend and accurately answer the medical history questionnaire (MMSE). If the participant fails this test (score &lt; 23), they will be excluded. Patients discharged home or short term rehab with expectation of returning home within the study period Patients whose stroke deficits clinically prevent them from reasonably being physically able to continue to smoke, such as bilateral upper extremity paresis, tracheostomy, GCS ≥9 Patients with sensory aphasia that impairs comprehension Subarachnoid hemorrhage Transient ischemic attack Other cause of cerebral ischemia or hemorrhage not defined as primary ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke (i.e. hemorrhagic metastases) Patients whose stroke symptoms started &gt;30 days from time of enrollment Patients discharged to acute rehab, long term acute care hospital or hospice who are unlikely to have access to cigarettes Patients unable to complete cognitive screening test for whom an appropriate proxy does not exist Patients who do not speak fluent English (given that the study largely revolves around oral education on smoking cessation, clear communication between participant and coordinator must be possible)</criteria>
