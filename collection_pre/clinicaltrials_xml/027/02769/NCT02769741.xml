	<detailed_description>This trial will utilize a randomized, two-period crossover design to examine the effects of cashew consumption on LDL-C and other aspects of the fasting lipoprotein lipid profile in healthy, moderately hyper-cholesterolemic individuals consuming a typical "American diet." Two arms consisting of two 28-day controlled-feeding treatment periods will allow for an isocaloric comparison of a diet with or without cashews.</detailed_description>
