	<brief_summary>This pilot and feasibility study is focusing on patients presenting with suspected malignancies of the lung and pleura who are considered to be good surgical candidates. The primary end-point of the study is to determine the sensitivity of OTL uptake and expression in identifying those lung and pleural nodules when excited by an imaging probe. There will be a single dose of 0.025 mg/kg for intravenous injection over approximately 60 minutes, two to three hours, prior to surgery.</brief_summary>
