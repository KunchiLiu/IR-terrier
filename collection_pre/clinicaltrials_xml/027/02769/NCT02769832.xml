	<brief_title>Nab-Paclitaxel With Gemcitabine for Relapsed Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed as a second-line therapy for patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed small cell lung cancer. Eligible patients will receive Nab-Paclitaxel (Abraxane), 100 mg/m2, IV over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle followed by Gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2, IV over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. Subjects can continue receiving Nab-Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal from the study. Tumor measurements will be done every 2 cycles.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility criteria 1. Age ≥18 years old, both male and female 2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed SCLC 3. ECOG performance status 02 4. Patients must have at least one measurable lesion as defined per RECIST 1.1 5. Progression during or after prior first line chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. Prior targeted therapy or immunotherapy is allowed 6. Before study therapy, a minimum of 28 days must have elapsed since any prior chemotherapy and 2 weeks from the last dose of prior targeted or immunotherapy. 7. Prior definitive XRT is allowed if it has been 2 weeks since the end of definitive XRT. For palliative XRT, protocolspecified treatment can begin after 3 days of completion of XRT. Lesions within the XRT field can only be used as target lesions if definite progression has been demonstrated since the completion of radiation. 8. Adequate major organ function including the following: Hematologic function: WBC ≥ 3,500/mm3 or absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1800 /mm3, platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3, and Hgb ≥ 9.0 gm/dl. Hepatic function: bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN, AST and ALT levels ≤ 2.5 x ULN. If liver metastases are present, then AST and ALT ≤ 5 x ULN. Renal function: serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN. 9. Patients must be willing and able to sign informed consent for themselves 10. If female: childbearing potential either terminated by surgery, radiation, or menopause, or attenuated by use of an approved contraceptive method (intrauterine device [IUD], birth control pills, or barrier device) during and for 6 months after trial. If male, use of an approved contraceptive method during the study and 6 months afterwards. Females with childbearing potential must have a urine negative hCG test within 7 days prior to the study therapy. Females of childbearing potential (defined as a sexually mature woman who (1) has not undergone hysterectomy [the surgical removal of the uterus] or bilateral oophorectomy [the surgical removal of both ovaries] or (2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months [i.e., has had menses at any time during the preceding 24 consecutive months]) must: Either commit to true abstinence* from heterosexual contact (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis), or agree to use, and be able to comply with, effective contraception without interruption, 28 days prior to starting IP therapy (including dose interruptions), and while on study medication or for a longer period if required by local regulations following the last dose of IP; and Have a negative serum pregnancy test (β hCG) result at screening and agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the course of the study, as per clinical judgement of the investigator, and after the end of study therapy. This applies even if the subject practices true abstinence* from heterosexual contact. 11. Male subjects must practice true abstinence* or agree to use a condom during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while participating in the study, during dose interruptions and for 6 months following IP discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy. True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. [Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception]. Exclusion criteria 1. Any of the following because this study involves an agent that has known genotoxic, mutagenic, and teratogenic effects: Pregnant women Nursing women Men or women of childbearing potential, who are unwilling to employ adequate contraception as determined by treating physician, while on this study and for 6 months after the end of treatment with the study drugs. 2. History of the following within the prior 6 months: a myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina pectoris, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IIIIV heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, clinically significant cardiac dysrhythmia or clinically significant ECG abnormality, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, or seizure disorder 3. Serious concurrent infection or nonmalignant illness that is uncontrolled or whose control may be jeopardized by complication of study therapy 4. Other malignancy within the past 3 years other than adequately treated non melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix 5. Psychiatric disorder which might preclude compliance 6. Any surgery other than minor biopsy in the prior two week 7. Evidence of active/symptomatic brain metastasis. If treated and asymptomatic while off steroid for at least 3 days can be eligible for the study. Patients with leptomeningeal cancer are not eligible even if controlled 8. Preexisting peripheral neuropathy &gt; Grade 1 (using CTCAE v 4.3 criteria) 9. Received any prior treatment with any taxane (docetaxel or paclitaxel) 10. History of allergy or hypersensitivity to albuminbound paclitaxel, or gemcitabine.</criteria>
