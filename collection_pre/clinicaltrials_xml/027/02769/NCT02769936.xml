	<brief_summary>Impairments in plasticity and working memory in schizophrenia have been hypothesized to reflect dysfunction at the N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR). However, the specific mechanisms through which the NMDAR is involved in working memory versus plasticity differ. Towards gaining a deeper understanding of how NMDAR signaling relates to individual cognitive functions in healthy adults and patients with schizophrenia, the investigators used a single dose of d-cycloserine (DCS) as an experimental probe to examine the effects of enhancing NMDAR signaling on plasticity versus working memory in healthy adults and individuals with schizophrenia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background: Cognitive impairments in schizophrenia, such as deficits in plasticity and working memory, have been hypothesized to reflect dysfunction at the N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR). However, given that divergent properties of the NMDAR underlie its roles in plasticity versus working memory and that various aspects of NMDAR function are abnormal in schizophrenia, examining the effects of DCS in both healthy and patient populations is crucial. Methods: The investigators used a single dose of the partial NMDAR agonist, d-cycloserine (DCS) to probe the effects of enhancing NMDAR signaling on working memory and plasticity. Working memory was assessed using a spatial n-back task. Plasticity was assessed using two learning tasks, the weather prediction task and information integration task, and an EEG paradigm that assesses changes in visual evoked potential amplitude following high frequency visual stimulation. Sixty-five healthy adults and forty-five schizophrenia patients were randomized to receive 100 mg acute DCS (healthy adult n = 32; schizophrenia n = 24) or placebo (healthy adult n = 33; schizophrenia n = 21).</detailed_description>
