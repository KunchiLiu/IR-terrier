	<brief_title>Bone Ultrasound to Access Forearm Fracture Healing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators will recruit 60 pediatric and adult patients with complete radius and/or ulna fractures and obtain ultrasound data from the fractured bones and the contralateral intact bone (as control) at each clinical visit. Ultrasound will be compared to radiographs. Completion of this aim will validate the concept and correlate clinical healing with ultrasound findings. For the ultrasound method, investigators will use ultrasound energy to produce a secondary mechanical vibration in bone that can be used to characterize the integrity of the bone. (This is in contrast with conventional sonography where ultrasound echoes are used to image the tissue.) The proposed method is based on the use of Ultrasound Radiation Force (URF) to excite the bone. URF is a "pushing" force exerted by ultrasound on an object. This force can be static, transient (pulse), or harmonic. Harmonic URF can be generated by modulating the amplitude of the ultrasound beam at a desired frequency. This force initiates bone vibration, where the frequency and amplitude of such vibrations depend on bone geometry and elastic properties. Hence, any fracture (or fracture repair) will alter the vibration pattern, thus enabling us to monitor fracture and fracture healing by analyzing such patterns.</detailed_description>
