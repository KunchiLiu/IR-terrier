	<brief_summary>This program will seek to implement a quality improvement program to improve the care of Veterans with TIA or minor stroke at 6 Veteran Health Administration Hospitals. The investigators will evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the quality improvement program.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim 1. To develop a quality improvement program to improve the care of Veterans with TIA or minor stroke that can be deployed nationwide. The program will include multiple components: a TIA/minor stroke telehealth disease management protocol that will enroll Veterans at the time of presentation and follow them for 90-days after their index TIA/minor stroke event; a staff training program to review the components of guideline-concordant TIA/minor stroke care; templates for use by nursing and pharmacy staff; and a reporting system that is based on validated electronic quality measures (eCQMs) that will allow staff to monitor the time-sensitive processes of care and outcomes of their population of Veterans with TIA or minor stroke. Lessons learned at the individual sites engaged in the quality improvement program will be shared across sites by use of a web-based platform and a virtual collaborative. Aim 2. To evaluate the effectiveness of the Aim 1 QI intervention program for Veterans with TIA or minor stroke against usual care. Teams at the 6 intervention sites will be given the quality improvement program components. The primary effectiveness outcome is the proportion of Veterans who received all of the guideline-concordant processes of care for which they are eligible referred to as the "defect-free" care rate. The secondary effectiveness outcome is the 90-day recurrent vascular event rate. Aim 3. To evaluate the implementation of the QI intervention program across the 6 participating sites. The implementation outcomes will be: the proportion of eligible Veterans who are enrolled in telehealth; participating clinician satisfaction with the quality improvement program; participant assessment of the quality improvement program components including the eCQM and the web-based platform in terms of usability, complexity, and relative advantage; and the adaptability of the program over the course of the study. Aim 4. To evaluate CFIR constructs and contextual factors associated with successful and suboptimal implementation of this new program for Veterans with an acute medical problem requiring timely care. Secondary Aim To evaluate the sustainability of the program. Sustainability will be evaluated over a one-year period that begins immediately after the one-year active implementation period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>This program will seek VA hospitals that are selfdesignated as either a VHA Primary Stroke Center or a Limited Hours Stroke Facility or Supporting Stroke Center. That have &gt;25 stroke/TIA patients per year and are willing to participate. Eligibility for staff interviews is based on involvement in the QI intervention and willingness to participate.
