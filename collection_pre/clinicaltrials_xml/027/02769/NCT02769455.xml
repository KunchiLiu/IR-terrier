	<brief_summary>Front-Of-Pack (FOP) nutrition labelling, providing simplified information on nutritional content at a glance, in order to help consumer make informed choices, has been identified as of major interest by public health specialists of many countries. French health authorities are currently considering the endorsement of a FOP nutrition label, but no specific format has yet been determined. A more simplified FOP nutrition label has been put forward in France, the 5-Colour Nutrition Label (5-CNL). Recent data suggests that the 5-CNL FOP label is well perceived and understood by consumers. The introduction of a FOP nutrition labelling system has been identified as challenging in certain population groups, due to their lower level of nutrition knowledge and unhealthier diets. The aim of the investigators is to evaluate the impact of FOP nutrition labels on the nutritional quality of the shopping cart in an online experimental supermarket in various nutritionally at-risk populations. Two FOP systems will be tested to a control situation without FOP labelling: the Reference Intakes (RI), currently in use by some manufacturers and present in a portion of food products sold in France, and the 5-Colour Nutrition Label (5-CNL). Three 3 arm parallel arm randomized trials are designed, each targeting a specific population. The methodology and interventions are identical across trials. Trials will be conducted in: 1) Working adults between 30-50 years old with low income, 2) Students and 3) Older subjects with identified chronic diseases. The intervention consists in the application of FOP nutrition labels on all food products, either the RI label, currently in use in some products in France, and the 5-CNL label. A control situation with no FOP will also be used. Participants will be asked to perform a shopping session in an experimental online supermarket, in one of the three experimental conditions described. The main outcome will be the overall nutritional quality of the shopping cart, assessed using the mean Food Standards Agency Nutrient profiling system score of the items in the shopping cart.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Front-Of-Pack (FOP) nutrition labelling, providing simplified information on nutritional content at a glance, in order to help consumer make informed choices, has been identified as of major interest by public health specialists of many countries. Modelling studies suggested that adoption of effective nutrition labelling would be cost-effective and provide health benefits. French health authorities are currently considering the endorsement of a FOP nutrition label, but no specific format has yet been determined. A more simplified FOP nutrition label has been put forward in France, the 5-Colour Nutrition Label (5-CNL). Recent data suggests that the 5-CNL FOP label is well perceived and understood by consumers. Moreover, a recent randomized trial, based on an online experimental supermarket, showed that the 5-CNL displayed the highest difference in nutritional quality compared to the control situation. The introduction of a FOP nutrition labelling system has been identified as challenging in certain population groups, due to their lower level of nutrition knowledge and unhealthier diets. Subjects with lower levels of income, or the young appear as a key target in which the impact of FOP nutrition labels has been poorly explored. Moreover, the impact of such a label on subjects suffering from a chronic condition for which dietary modifications are part of the treatment should be carefully considered, in order to avoid potential undesirable effects of the label in these populations. The aim of the investigators is to evaluate the impact of FOP nutrition labels on the nutritional quality of the shopping cart in an online experimental supermarket in various nutritionally at-risk populations. Two FOP systems will be tested to a control situation without FOP labelling: the Reference Intakes (RI), currently in use by some manufacturers and present in a portion of food products sold in France, and the 5-Colour Nutrition Label (5-CNL).
