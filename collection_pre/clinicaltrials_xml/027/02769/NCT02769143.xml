	<brief_summary>Women in the postmenopausal period suffer hormonal changes that contribute to a number of negative factors to health, such as reduced bone mineral density and loss of muscle mass, which contribute to the increased incidence of falls and consequent risk of fractures. Among the possibilities to alleviate these symptoms are mainly drug treatment and the systematic practice of physical exercise. Exercise stands out for not offering adverse effects. One form of exercise that has been recently investigated is the whole body vibration, another form of exercise well accepted by the population is the Pilates method. Taking into account the lack of literature on the benefits of vibration training; and also the Pilates method on bone mineral density, muscle strength, flexibility, postural balance, fear of falling and the quality of life of postmenopausal women, explains the importance of this work.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Whole Body Vibration and Pilates on Bone Mineral Density in Postmenopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women in the postmenopausal period suffer hormonal changes that contribute to a number of negative factors to health, such as reduced bone mineral density and loss of muscle mass, which contribute to the increased incidence of falls and consequent risk of fractures. Among the possibilities to alleviate these symptoms are mainly drug treatment and the systematic and regular physical exercise. However, drug treatment primarily involves hormone replacement therapy, which is associated with increased risk of heart disease, stroke and breast cancer. Thus, exercise stands out for not offering adverse effects, however, when it comes to bone metabolism, it is not yet clear what type of exercise is the most effective for women in the postmenopausal period. One form of physical exercise that has recently been investigated is the whole-body vibration (WBV), characterized by individual placement on a vibrating plate capable of transmitting vertical acceleration for the musculoskeletal system, however, the intensity (frequency and magnitude) ideal to allow increased bone metabolism has not been established and remain controversial. Other forms of exercise have been recommended for postmenopausal women, such as those of muscular endurance. Exercises involving strength training, using weight can contribute to the improvement of bone mineral density of women in the postmenopausal period. Another form of exercise that also offers endurance is the Pilates method. However, the effects of this technique on bone mineral density, has not been investigated, despite having shown potential contribution on the variables pain, functional capacity and quality of life in postmenopausal women. This study is justified because there are still shortages of literature and evidence about the benefits of vibration training; and also Pilates, on bone mineral density in postmenopausal women. There are also still little information about how much vibration training can influence muscle strength, flexibility, postural balance, fear of falling and the population's quality of life in question.</detailed_description>
