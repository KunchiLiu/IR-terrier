	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK) of TAK-071 when administered as single rising dose (SRD) and multiple rising dose (MRD) orally in healthy participants and participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild Alzheimer disease (AD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of TAK-071 in Healthy Participants and Participants With Mild Cognitive Impairment/Mild Alzheimer Disease and Relative Bioavailability (BA) and Food Effect of TAK-071 in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TAK-071 is being tested to find a safe and well-tolerated dose in healthy participants (non-Japanese and Japanese) and participants with MCI or mild AD (non-Japanese). The study will enroll approximately 174 participants. The study consists of 4 parts: Single-rising dose (SRD) part (Cohorts 1-6, and 18-21), multiple-rising dose (MRD) part (Cohorts 7-15), Cohort 16 with 2-way crossover design, and Cohort 17 relative bioavailability and food effect 3 period crossover design. Cohorts 1-12 and 18-19, will have 8 randomized participants, with 6 receiving TAK-071, and 2 receiving matching placebo. Cohorts 20-21 will have 12 randomized participants with 3 receiving TAK-071 placebo+donepezil placebo, 3 receiving TAK-071 placebo+donepezil, and 6 receiving TAK-071+donepezil.Cohorts 13-15, will have 6 randomized participants, with 5 receiving TAK-071, and 1 receiving matching placebo. Selected cohorts (Cohorts 10 to 12) will be pretreated for 3 weeks with daily oral doses of donepezil (5 mg QD), followed by continued daily oral donepezil dosing during the TAK-071 treatment period. The planned initial dose of TAK-071 for Cohort 1 is 1 mg and subsequent dose levels to be determined by emerging safety, tolerability, and PK data in preceding cohorts. Participants in each cohort will be randomized to receive treatment with TAK-071 or matching placebo using drug-in-capsule (DIC) in the morning following a minimum fast of 8 hours. In Cohort 16, participants will be assigned to 1 of 2 possible treatment sequences (AB or BA), with Treatment A being TAK-071 and Treatment B being matching placebo. In Cohort 17, 12 participants will be assigned to 1 of 3 treatment sequences (ABC, BCA, or CAB) with treatment A being Fasted State and Capsule Formulation, Treatment B being Fasted State and Tablet Formulation, and Treatment being C Fed State and Tablet Formulation (10 mg tablet formulation). In Cohort 20-21, participants will be administered as a single dose of TAK-071 or placebo on Day 1, and a single dose of donepezil or placebo approximately 24 hours later on Day 2.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Man or woman who weighs at least 50 kg and has a body mass index (BMI) from 18.0 to 30.0 kg/m^2, inclusive, at Screening. 2. For Cohorts 13 to 15 only: Firstgeneration Japanese, defined as having been born in Japan of Japanese parents and Japanese grandparents and living no more than 10 years outside of Japan, with no significant change in lifestyle, including diet, while living outside of Japan. 3. Cohort 16 only: Participants with a documented previous diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild Alzheimer disease (AD), with a Mini Mental State Examination score of 20 to 30, inclusive, and no biomarker data to contradict this diagnosis. Retrospectively, participants will have met a diagnosis of probable AD based on the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria or MCI diagnosis based on criteria such as subjective cognitive complaint, evidence of impairment in 1 or more cognitive domain, preservation of functions, and absence of dementia. Participants must be receiving ongoing donepezil therapy (10 mg) for a minimum of 30 days. 1. Has clinically significant (Cohorts 1 to 15 and 17 to 21) or uncontrolled (Cohort 16) neurologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, metabolic, gastrointestinal (GI), urologic, immunologic, endocrine, or psychiatric disease or other abnormality (other than the disease being studied), which may impact the ability of the participant to participate or potentially confound the study results. 2. Has a history of type 1 diabetes (Cohorts 1 to 21) or type 2 diabetes (Cohorts 1 to 15, 17 to 21) or hemoglobin A1c &gt;6.5% at Screening. Note: participants with controlled (hemoglobin A1c &lt;7.0% at Screening) type 2 diabetes in Cohort 16 may participate in the study. 3. Has a risk of suicide or suicidal ideation with intent and plan according to the investigator's clinical judgment (affirmative answer to questions 4 and 5 of the ideation section of the ColumbiaSuicide Severity Rating Scale) or has made a suicide attempt in the previous 6 months. 4. Cohort 16 only: Any significant neurologic disease (other than suspected incipient or mild AD), such as Parkinson disease, stroke, transient ischemic attack, multiinfarct dementia, Huntington disease, head trauma with clinically significant cognitive sequelae, or chronic central nervous system infection. 5. Has current or recent (within 6 months) GI disease that would be expected to influence the absorption of drugs (ie, a history of malabsorption, any surgical intervention known to impact absorption [eg, bariatric surgery or bowel resection], esophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease, erosive esophagitis, or frequent [more than once per week] occurrence of heartburn).</criteria>
