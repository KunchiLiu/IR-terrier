	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this project is to Compare new msCS and standard DSC-PWI methods in GBM patients undergoing post-operative MRI for monitoring of tumor progression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Advanced Perfusion MRI of Treatment Response and Progression in Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators will compare the novel to the standard DSC-PWI methods in twenty five GBM patients to determine whether novel method improves image quality in tumor regions. We will also compare accuracy of pseudoprogression (PsP) vs. early progressive disease (ePD) determinations by the two techniques. If successful, the project will culminate in a novel imaging method sequence optimized to monitor progression and guide treatment decisions in post-operative GBM patients.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Glioblastoma</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Histology: Glioblastoma (grade 4 astrocytoma) Standardofcare, postgd T1w image changes suggestive or consistent with of progression. Standardofcare MRI included conventional DSCPWI without unexpected technical difficulties. Methylation status of tumor available in medical record. Able to provide written informed consent. Contraindications either to 3T MRI (e.g. certain metallic and electronic implants, claustrophobia) or IV gadolinium contrast (allergy, pregnancy, breastfeeding, renal insufficiency). Screening for these contraindications will be based on history only (as it is for all routine outpatient clinical MRI at UWHC). Significant physical or mental disease which would preclude successful compliance and participation in the study or, in the opinion of the principal investigator, or coinvestigator, constitute a hazard, such that enrollment in the study would not be in the patient's best interest. Special subjects such as minors, mentally disabled persons, or prisoners.</criteria>
