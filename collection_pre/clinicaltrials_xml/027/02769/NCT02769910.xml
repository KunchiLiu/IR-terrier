	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to investigate the effect of capsaicin-induced neurogenic inflammation with three different intensities on itch subsequently induced by histamine and cowhage. The hypothesis is that capsaicin-induced pre-established neurogenic inflammation significantly increases susceptibility to itch provocations with cowhage and histamine.</brief_summary>
