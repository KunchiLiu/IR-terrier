	<brief_summary>Treatment efficacy of osimertinib will be assessed in patients with lung cancer harboring activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations (cohort 1) and those harboring T790M (cohort 2) which were detected from circulating tumor DNA</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Osimertinib in First and Second Line Treatment of NSCLC Harboring EGFR Mutations From Circulating Tumor DNA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase II, open-label, single centre study of AZD9291 administered orally in patients with advanced lung cancer with activating mutations of EGFR gene with or without T790M which were detected from circulating tumor DNA. EGFR-TKI naïve patients with activating EGFR mutation will be enrolled in cohort 1. Patients with acquired resistance to prior EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) due to T790M mutation is going to be enrolled in cohort 2.</detailed_description>

Male patients should be willing to use barrier contraception. 11. Patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow up. 12. At least one lesion, not previously irradiated, that can be accurately measured at baseline as ≥ 10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must have short axis ≥ 15 mm) with computed tomography (CT) &lt; Cohort 2 &gt; 1. Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures 2. Patients (male/female) must be &gt; 18 years of age. 3. Locally advanced or metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer, not amenable to curative surgery or radiotherapy with or without pathologic diagnosis 4. Progression after prior exposure to gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib or dacomitinib. Multiple lines of prior cytotoxic chemotherapy are permitted and there is no specified order of treatment. 5. Patients must fulfil one of the following: 5.1) Activating EGFR mutation (G719X, exon 19 deletion, L858R, L861Q) from tumor tissue or cytology or circulating tumor DNA 5.2) Must have experienced clinical benefit from prior EGFRTKI, according to the Jackman criteria (Jackman 2010) followed by systemic objective progression (RECIST) while on continuous treatment with EGFRTKI 6. T790M mutation detected from circulating tumor DNA either by PANA mutyper® or Cobas® EGFR mutation test. 7. World Health Organization (WHO) performance status 02. 8. Patients must have a life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks. 9. Females should be using adequate contraceptive measures, should not be breast feeding and must have a negative pregnancy test prior to start of dosing if of childbearing potential or must have evidence of nonchildbearing potential by fulfilling one of the following criteria at screening: Postmenopausal defined as aged more than 50 years and amenorrheic for at least 12 months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments Women under 50 years old would be consider postmenopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and with LH and FSH levels in the postmenopausal range for the institution Documentation of irreversible surgical sterilisation by hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy but not tubal ligation 10. Male patients should be willing to use barrier contraception. 11. Patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow up. 12.

Patients currently receiving (or unable to stop use prior to receiving the first dose of study treatment) medications or herbal supplements known to be potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (at least 1 week prior) and potent inducers of CYP3A4 (at least 3 week prior) (Appendix A). All patients must try to avoid concomitant use of any medications, herbal supplements and/or ingestion of foods with known inducer/inhibitory effects on CYP3A4. 4. Any unresolved toxicities from prior therapy greater than Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 1 at the time of starting study treatment with the exception of alopecia and grade 2, prior platinumtherapy related neuropathy. 5. Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including uncontrolled hypertension and active bleeding diatheses, which in the investigator's opinion makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial or which would jeopardise compliance with the protocol, or active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Screening for chronic conditions is not required. 6. Patients with symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases who are neurologically unstable 7.

Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of resting ECG (e.g., complete left bundle branch block, third degree heart block, second degree heart block) 3. Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic events such as heart failure, hypokalemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in first degree relatives or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval 10. Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases, inability to swallow the formulated product or previous significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption of AZD9291 11. History of hypersensitivity to AZD9291 (or drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to AZD9291) or any excipients of these agents 12. Males and females of reproductive potential who are not using an effective method of birth control and females who are pregnant or breastfeeding or have a positive (urine or serum) pregnancy test prior to study entry 13.
