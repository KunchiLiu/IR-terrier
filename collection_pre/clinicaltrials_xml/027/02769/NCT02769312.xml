	<brief_summary>The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate initial feasibility and efficacy of Theta Burst Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TBS) as an adjunct treatment for Veterans with PTSD. Primary outcomes measures include a feasibility of TBS procedures, with secondary outcome measures focusing on changes in PTSD symptom severity and quality of life and social/occupation functioning.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate the feasibility of theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TBS) as an adjunct treatment for Veterans with PTSD. This project will result in development of methods needed to conduct an adequately powered, randomized controlled study of TBS for PTSD, which will assess the relationship between change in symptoms and quality of life. It will also lay the foundation for subsequent rehabilitation studies combining neuromodulation and psychotherapy in the longer term. TBS has several advantages compared to standard repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), including its ability to deliver large numbers of stimulation pulses in a shorter time period, and a stimulation pattern that may specifically affect key brain regions involved in PTSD. The significance of this research is the development of a novel, non-invasive brain stimulation approach for PTSD recovery. This project will provide the foundation for the development of methods needed to conduct an adequately powered, randomized controlled study of TBS for PTSD to ultimately develop brain stimulation techniques that can be combined with evidence-based psychotherapy, to develop a more powerful, individualized rehabilitation option for Veterans with PTSD.</detailed_description>
