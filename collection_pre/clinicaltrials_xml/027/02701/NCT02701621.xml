	<brief_title>Aquatic Therapy Versus Land-Based Therapy for the Treatment of Balance Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Balance dysfunction (BD) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is a disabling sign leading to falls which have a negative impact on the quality of life. It is known that aquatic therapy could be useful to train balance given its physical features and for reducing patients' fear of falls. Many studies have evaluated the efficacy of land-based physiotherapy in treatment of BD, but few studies have investigated the efficacy of aquatic therapy on balance and none of those assessed clinical measurements in a clinically, relevant follow-up period. Objective: The aim of study was to compare the effectiveness of a specific aquatic therapy program on balance with a land-based physical-treatment in patients with PD and to evaluate the long-term effects in a 6-month follow-up period. Methods: Thirty-four patients with PD in medium-stage of disease were randomized into two groups: 17 underwent Multidisciplinary-Intensive-Rehabilitation-Treatment (MIRT) and 17 underwent MIRT associated with aquatic therapy protocol (MIRT-AT). Investigators assessed the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) II-III, and Timed Up Go test (TUG) in both groups at admission, discharge and after a 6-months follow-up period.</detailed_description>
