	<brief_summary>- Prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center study - A total of 220 subjects with long femoropopliteal lesions will be included according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. - Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 manner into long stenting group versus short stenting group. and treated with Zilver PTX for long femoropopliteal lesions - Patients will be followed clinically for 1 year after the procedure. - Image study follow-up (Duplex US or CT angiography) will be performed at 1 year.</brief_summary>
