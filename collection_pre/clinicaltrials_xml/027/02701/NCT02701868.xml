	<brief_summary>Although breast milk is recommended exclusively until 6 months of age, two-thirds of infants in the U.S. are fed infant formula. Despite an almost identical energy density between infant formula and breast milk, formula fed infants experience greater weight gain in the first year of life. The investigators propose that unintentional overfeeding, of nearly one additional day of calories per week, due to the "over-scooping" of powdered formula contributes significantly to this phenomenon and potentially to the early development of childhood obesity, a significant public health problem.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In the proposed study the investigators will assess the literacy and understanding of individuals to follow commercially available infant formula instructions. The investigators will collaborate with the LA CaTS Health Literacy Core to improve the reading and comprehension of the manufacturer package instruction, and will solicit the input of caregivers and key stakeholders to inform the development of educational intervention around infant feeding. Following modification of infant formula preparation instructions, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial that will test the efficacy of the modified instructions on infant overfeeding in comparison with the manufacturer package instructions. One hundred and fifty participants will be asked to complete one study visit during which they will be asked to measure various serving sizes of infant formula following either the manufacturer package instructions or the modified instructions.</detailed_description>
