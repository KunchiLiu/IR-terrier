	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial to determine if using FloTrac/EV1000 system in neurosurgical patients undergoing craniotomies for aneurysm repair or tumor resection complicated by cerebral edema, or complex spinal surgery including multi-level scoliosis correction, is a more effective way of monitoring fluid.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Goal-Directed Intraoperative Fluid Management Using FloTracÂ© Monitoring in High-Risk Neurosurgical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize that the ability to assess volume status and fluid responsiveness with information gained from Edwards FloTrac/EV1000 system coupled with a goal-directed therapy fluid management algorithm can make a difference in patient outcomes. Our specific aims are: - Demonstrate goal-directed therapy (GDT) in fluid management improves peri-operative fluid balance - Demonstrate GDT improves pulmonary function and organ oxygenation - Demonstrate GDT reduces necessary therapeutic interventions in the peri- operative period - Demonstrate GDT reduces hypotensive episodes in the peri-operative period Outcomes We will study the consequences of goal-directed fluid therapy that employs use of dynamic indicators seen on FloTrac/EV1000 system by measuring the following: - Pulmonary status - Time to extubation - Alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient of oxygen - Requirements for supplemental oxygen - Organ oxygenation - Serum lactate - Arterial blood gas values (pH, HCO3, CO2, O2) - Length of stay (LOS) - In hospital, defined as time from operation start to eligibility for discharge from hospital according to surgeon in accordance with pre-define criteria - In ICU/PACU, defined as time from operation end to eligibility for discharge from intensive care according to attending intensivist in accordance with pre- define criteria - Fluid Balance - Inputs and outputs (I/Os) of all measurable fluids (i.e. blood, crystalloid, colloid) in peri-operative period, through and including duration of intensive care or the next 24-48 hours after completion of surgery - Drugs administered for fluid management (i.e. mannitol, vasopressors) - Pre-operative and post-operative body weights and twice-daily weights via bed weights - Hypotension - Number, duration and severity (i.e. minimum blood pressure) of hypotensive episode, defined as MAP &lt;65</detailed_description>
