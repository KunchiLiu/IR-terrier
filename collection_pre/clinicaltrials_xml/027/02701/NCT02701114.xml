	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate pain control of continuous adductor canal blocks placed proximally versus distally within the canal. The investigators hypothesize that there will be similar pain control between both groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proximal Versus Distal Adductor Canal Blocks for Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a non-inferiority trial designed to determine whether placement of a continuous block within the adductor canal has a substantial impact on pain following total knee arthroplasty. Our primary outcome to determine this difference will be opioid consumption within the first day following surgery. Secondary outcomes will include: pain scores, quadriceps strength, and distance ambulated during physical therapy.</detailed_description>
