	<brief_summary>Dry eye symptoms can occur after LASIK surgery. They generally get better with time but in some patients, they can persist. The investigators believe that in some individuals, dry eye symptoms after LASIK persist because the nerves in the cornea become hypersensitive. The investigators wish to study if a medication, called pregabalin, can protect corneal nerves at the time of LASIK surgery and decrease the frequency and severity of dry eye symptoms 6 months after surgery. This medication has been used in a similar way to reduce the frequency of uncomfortable sensations after other surgeries (knee, abdomen) but has never been studied in LASIK surgery.</brief_summary>
