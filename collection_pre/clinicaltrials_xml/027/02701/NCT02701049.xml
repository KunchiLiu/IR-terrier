	<brief_summary>This trial is the final phase of a three phase PCORI-funded study to develop and test patient-centered approaches to collect sexual orientation and gender identity (SO/GI) information in the ED. From the results of Phase 1 qualitative interviews and national quantitative survey and Phase 2 Delphi rounds with the Stakeholder Advisory Board, we have determined two methods of collection favored by patients and providers to implement in the trial. The first method, nurse verbal collection, is in alignment with Partners recommended clinical practice and is therefore a quality improvement (QI) evaluation. The second method, non-verbal registrar form collection with nurse verbal confirmation, is a research intervention to evaluate and compare a new patient-centered approach to SO/GI collection. To compare the patient-centeredness of the two different approaches, satisfaction surveys will be administered to ED patients and staff members involved in collection. In summary, the study design (1) evaluates recommended current practice (QI), (2) evaluates a quality improvement project to increase recommended current practice, and (3) evaluates a new method of collecting SO/GI (research intervention).</brief_summary>
