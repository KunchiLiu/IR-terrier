	<brief_title>Evaluation of the SEM Scanner 200 for the Detection of Early Pressure Ulcers: A Multi-Site Longitudinal Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Demonstrate that the SEM Scanner can detect early pressure ulcers in patients before pressure ulcers are diagnosed through clinical judgment ("diagnose pressure ulcers before clinical judgment"). Determine the average number of days between detection of early pressure ulcers using the SEM Scanner and diagnosis of pressure ulcers through clinical judgment ("time to detection").</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Greater or equal to 55 years of age 2. At risk of developing a pressure ulcer at time of enrollment as defined by one or more of the following: 1. PU Risk Score Braden &lt; 15; Waterlow ≥ 10; or Norton ≤ 18 2. Poor mobility; e.g., Braden mobility subscore ≤ 2; Waterlow mobility subscore &gt; 2; Norton mobility subscore ≤ 2; or poor mobility according to clinical judgment (chair or bedbound) 3. Poor nutrition; e.g., Braden nutrition subscore ≤ 2; Waterlow nutrition subscore &gt; 2; or poor nutrition according to clinical judgment 4. Medical procedure (e.g. surgery, xray, etc.) involving immobility and inability to change position lasting 4 hours or longer 3. Evaluable by the study team for a minimum of 6 consecutive days upon enrollment 4. Willing and able to provide informed consent (or by proxy) 1. Unhealed (including newly diagnosed) pressure ulcer at any anatomical site at the time of enrollment 2. Broken skin at the sacrum and both heels that prevents collection of SEM Scanner readings from all three anatomical locations; possible assessment at only one or two locations is not grounds for exclusion 3. Moisture lesion or incontinence associated dermatitis at the sacrum 4. Physical, structural, or other limitations preventing assessments required in this study (e.g., suspected or actual injury preventing turning) 5. Presence of any condition(s) or injury(ies) which compromises the subject's ability to complete this study 6. Per clinical decision of the study Investigator, diminished decisionmaking capacity which might impact compliance or completion with study procedures 7. Patient modesty concerns on the part of the subject (or their proxy) that might impact collection of SEM Scanner readings at the anatomical location (heels and sacrum) to be assessed</criteria>
