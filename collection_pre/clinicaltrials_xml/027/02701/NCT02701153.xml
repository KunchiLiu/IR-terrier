	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies the side effects of hypofractionated radiation therapy in treating patients with soft tissue sarcomas that have come back before surgery. Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses of radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more tumor cells and have fewer side effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Recurrent Soft Tissue Sarcomas Before Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJCETIVES: I. Grade &gt;= 2 radiation morbidity (subcutaneous tissue fibrosis, joint stiffness, or edema) at 2 years. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate local control, regional control, distant metastasis, progression free survival, and overall survival. II. Evaluate the functional outcomes as assessed using the musculoskeletal tumor rating scale (MSTS) and the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS). III. Collect germ-line deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and nucleic acids from cancer patients to further investigate the association and identify new germ-line mutations that impact cancer predisposition. IV. Investigate the role of germ-line mutations in predicting cancer outcome and response to therapy. OUTLINE: Patients undergo hypofractionated radiation therapy on Monday-Friday for 5 days. Beginning 2-12 weeks after completion of radiation therapy, patients undergo surgery. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 months and then every 6 months for 5 years.</detailed_description>
