	<brief_summary>The primary aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of the procedure in terms of event-free survival between patients receiving cyclosporine (CsA) plus either alemtuzumab (CAMPATH-1H ) or methotrexate (MTX) after matched related donor allo-reduced intensity conditioning. Secondary aims were: 1. To compare the incidence of infections and transplant-related mortality between the two arms; 2. to compare the incidence of acute and chronic GVHD 3. to evaluate hematologic and immunologic reconstitution and evolution of chimerism and residual disease. Patients were randomly assigned to received cyclosporine plus alemtuzumab or cyclosporine plus MTX and were stratified according to diagnosis: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia or Low grade- non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. All patients received the same reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) scheme based on fludarabine 150mg/m2 (30 mg/m2/day everyday from -8 to -4) plus melphalan 140mg/m2 (70 mg/m2/day everyday from -3 to -2). Regarding the GVHD prophylaxis, patients in group 1 (n=17) received CsA 1 mg/kg intravenously starting on day -7 and 2/mg/Kg from day -1 plus alemtuzumab administered at a dose of 20 mg IV on -8 to -4 whereas in group 2 (n=23) pts received CsA at same doses as group 1 plus MTX given at a dose of 15 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 and 10 mg/m2 on days 3, 6 and 11, followed by folinic acid rescue (15 mg in +1 and 10 mg in +3, +6 and +11 intravenously every 6 hours for 4 doses starting 24 hours after each dose of MTX). Acute and chronic GVHD were similarly graded by established criteria [20, 21]. In patients receiving alemtuzumab, CsA was suspended by day +130. They also received donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) at a dose of 1 x 107 cluster of differentiation 3 / kg on day +180 in case of active disease, persistence of minimal residual disease detected by flow cytometry or mixed chimerism and no GVHD. In case mixed chimerism, donor lymphocyte infusion was performed if patient hematopoiesis progressively increased. In patients receiving CsA + MTX, CsA was suspended by day +180. These patients received DLI only in situations specified above. The statistical analysis has been designed to identify a 20% difference in terms of disease-free survival (based on the increased incidence of relapse in patients receiving T-cell depletion).</brief_summary>
