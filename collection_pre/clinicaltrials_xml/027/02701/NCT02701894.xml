	<brief_summary>With the emerging worldwide epidemic of type 2 diabetes, dietary recommendations to improve diabetes management have been emphasized in the scientific community. Particular attention has been drawn to various benefits of replacing saturated fatty acids with unsaturated fatty acids. Alpha-linolenic acid, the only omega-3 fatty acid that is from plant sources, has been suggested by animal and cell studies to play a beneficial role in regulating blood glucose levels. However, human studies have been more inconsistent with their findings. The focus of this project is to investigate the evidence in the context of ALA and blood glucose parameters in participants with type 2 diabetes by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.</brief_summary>
