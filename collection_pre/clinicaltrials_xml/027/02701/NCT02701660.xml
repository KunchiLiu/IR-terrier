	<brief_summary>Electronic dispensers for polypharmacy are used in home care to assist patients with their medication management and to improve adherence. Opioid dependent patients with substitution therapy often exhibit multiple risk factors for non-adherence. The increase of both the age and associated comorbidities in this population demand for innovative solutions to optimize medication management. The investigators developed a novel medication supply model with an automated electronic medication dispenser to simultaneously assist opioid dependent patients with their medication and objectively monitor their adherence. This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility of the new supply model.</brief_summary>
