	<brief_title>Effect of Rebound Exercise in Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The exercise involved jumping on the mini trampoline with feet slightly apart. Participants stood on the mid portion of the trampoline bed and made repeated up-and-down bouncy movements. Each foot strike equals one step or bounce. With each landing, the mat of the trampoline underwent deformation and the springs released the energy stored in them such that the participant was made to bounce off the mat. Exercise was administered for between 10 - 15 minutes after which a 5-minute period of rest was allowed. A heart rate monitor was used to guide the intensity of the exercise in the moderate range. Each participant accumulated between 20 and 30 minutes of rebound exercise (bouncing on a mini trampoline) per session, administered three times per week for 12 weeks. All data were captured at baseline and at the end of the 12-week intervention period.</detailed_description>
