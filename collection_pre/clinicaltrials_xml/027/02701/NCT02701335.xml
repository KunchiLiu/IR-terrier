	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis (OA) of the hand is a major cause of pain and functional limitation, central sensitization of pain can be one of the causes: this hypothesis opens avenues for research in the modulation of pain pathways. The peripherally directed therapies may modulate pain perception bilaterally. This hypothesis opens avenues for future research in the modulation of pain pathways, perhaps offering targets to optimize peripheral manual and physical therapies for pain management in hand OA. Several studies have reported the outcomes of multimodal approach to central sensitization evaluated by generalized pressure pain hypersensitivity in patients with carpometacarpal (CMC) OA. Neurodynamic techniques are a form of manual therapy directed to the neural structures through positioning and movement of multiple joints. Recent technologies have facilitated the use of robots as tools to assist patients in the rehabilitation process thus maximizing patient outcomes. These robotic tools assist the patient with carrying out exercise protocols, optimal for the activity of the control group.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Osteoarthritis of the dominant hand. To be included in the study, the subjects need to have a history of repetitive use of their dominant hand (eg, exfactory worker) and a diagnosis of hand OA in the dominant hand, according on radiographic findings. If they score greater than 6 points on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) or more than 30 points in the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Patients with a medical history of carpal tunnel syndrome, surgical interventions to the hand, DeQuervain's tenosynovitis, or with degenerative or nondegenerative neurological conditions in which pain perception is altered will be excluded. None of the individuals in this study will have received prior interventions for hand OA.</criteria>
