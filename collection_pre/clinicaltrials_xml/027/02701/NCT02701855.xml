	<brief_summary>This study aims to determine the relationships between retina micro-vascular remodeling and cognitive function in hypertensive patients. The study plans to enrol 160 patients (100 patients with mild cognitive impairment -MCI- and 60 without MCI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Retina Microvascular Remodeling and Cognitive Function In Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our project stands on physiopathological and cognitive angles, and is mainly based on the major role of large and small arteries elasticity on cognitive aging. It will benefit from the recent innovative accurate and non invasive techniques such as MRI for central large arteries and adaptative optics for retina arterioles imaging. Study population is the following: - 60 patients with hypertension and no MCI, - 50 patients with hypertension and stable MCI, without dementia - 50 patients with hypertension and progressive MCI, without dementia Every patients will perform a medical interview and examination, an MRI (brain + aorta), adaptative optics imaging, a cognitive tests and a blood test. Primary outcome is to determine the relationships between retina micro-vascular remodeling and cognitive function in this population.</detailed_description>
