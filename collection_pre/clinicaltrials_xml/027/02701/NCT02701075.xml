	<brief_summary>The FDA-approved MC5-A Scrambler Therapy (MC5-A ST) is an electroanalgesia device that interferes with pain signal transmission by using nerve fibers as a passive means to convey a message of normality (sans pain) to the central nervous system. While preliminary research has demonstrated its efficacy in treating chronic neuropathic pain secondary to cancer and failed back surgery syndrome, its effectiveness in treating chronic neuropathic pain secondary to traumatic musculoskeletal injuries like those experienced in combat has not been investigated. The purpose of this prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled, study is to determine if the MC5-A ST is efficacious in altering the biological, psychological, and social components of the chronic neuropathic pain experience in military Service Members (SMs) with traumatic musculoskeletal extremity injuries.</brief_summary>
