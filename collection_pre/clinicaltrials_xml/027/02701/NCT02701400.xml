	<brief_summary>This randomized clinical trial studies how well tremelimumab and durvalumab with or without radiation therapy works in treating patients with small cell lung cancer that has returned after a period of improvement. Monoclonal antibodies, such as tremelimumab and durvalumab, may limit the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread by enhancing immune function. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving tremelimumab and durvalumab together with radiation therapy may lead to improved clinical benefit.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tremelimumab and Durvalumab With or Without Radiation Therapy in Patients With Relapsed Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the efficacy (progression free survival [PFS] and objective response rate [ORR]) of combined immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy as treatment for relapsed small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the impact of antigen priming using radiation therapy (XRT) on the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. II. To determine immune related objective response rate. III. To estimate overall survival measured as time from randomization to death from any cause. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To characterize tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)/programmed cell death 1 (PD1) expression in paired tumor biopsies at baseline, end of cycle 2 and at the time of progression. II. To determine dynamic changes in cell free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA) and the immunophenotype of peripheral blood repertoire of circulating lymphocytes using multiparameter flow cytometry. III. To determine changes in circulating cytokine mediators of inflammation and immunity using Luminex assay. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive tremelimumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive durvalumab IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving disease control may restart treatment upon evidence of progressive disease, with or without confirmation. ARM II: Patients undergo radiation therapy daily for 5 days over 1 week or for 3 fractions every other day for 1 week and then receive the same treatment as in Arm I. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.</detailed_description>

this will not apply to subjects with confirmed Gilbert's syndrome (persistent or recurrent hyperbilirubinemia that is predominantly unconjugated in the absence of hemolysis or hepatic pathology), who will be allowed only in consultation with their physician Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) ≤ 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal unless liver metastases are present, in which case it must be ≤ 5 x ULN Serum creatinine clearance (CL) &gt;

2 prior lines of therapy (nota bene [NB]: retreatment with a platinumbased doublet for sensitive relapse counts as another line therapy; however substitution of cisplatin with carboplatin or vice versa due to toxicity does not count as a separate regimen) Negative serum pregnancy test within 48 hours before starting study treatment in women with childbearing potential Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca staff and/or staff at the study site) Previous enrollment or randomization in the present study Treatment with an investigational product during the last 2 weeks Any previous treatment with a PD1 or PDL1 inhibitor, including durvalumab or an anticytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated protein 4 (CTLA4), including tremelimumab Receipt of the last dose of anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, endocrine therapy, targeted therapy, biologic therapy, tumor embolization, monoclonal antibodies, other investigational agent) ≤ 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug (≤ 7 days or four halflives, whichever is longer, prior to the first dose of study drug for subjects who have received prior tyrosine kinase inhibitors [TKIs] [e.g., erlotinib, gefitinib and crizotinib] and within 6 weeks for nitrosourea or mitomycin C) Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) ≥ 470 ms calculated from 3 electrocardiograms (ECGs) using Fredericia's Correction Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 28 days before the first dose of durvalumab or tremelimumab, with the exceptions of intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids at physiological doses, which are not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone, or an equivalent corticosteroid Any unresolved toxicity (&gt;
