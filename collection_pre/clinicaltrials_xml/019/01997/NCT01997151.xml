	<brief_summary>This program of research tested the effectiveness of an iPad delivered multiple behavior intervention grounded in the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change for pregnant women. It was hypothesized that the intervention would reduce the number of health behavior risks reported by pregnant women in the treatment group. The target behaviors of the intervention are smoking cessation and relapse prevention, stress management, and fruit and vegetable consumption.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Promoting Health During Pregnancy: A Multiple Behavior Computer Tailored Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Promoting health behaviors during pregnancy has tremendous public health significance. Poor health behaviors are associated with pregnancy complications, birth outcomes, and the health of the child. They influence infant birthweight, premature birth, and infant mortality rates, all of which continue to be public health concerns, reflected in the goals of Healthy People 2020. Pregnant women, particularly those from under-served populations, often have a multitude of health behavior risks that threaten positive pregnancy and birth outcomes, as well as the future health of mother and baby. Pregnancy offers a window of opportunity for behavioral intervention. The immediate health risk for the baby motivates most pregnant women to at least consider changing their behavior. Furthermore, the regular and continual medical care that most pregnant women receive allows optimal access for intervention. The circumstance of pregnancy can be used as a teachable moment to better the future health of women and children. The primary goals of this study were to complete and enhance the development of an iPad delivered intervention and to assess the efficacy in a randomized clinical trial involving pregnant women from three federally-funded community health centers that treat under-served populations. Using interactive technology, users complete onscreen assessments and receive individually tailored feedback messages on key behavior change strategies identified by the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change and matched to their stage of readiness for each behavior. Supplemental intervention components were created including printed feedback reports, a multiple behavior stage-based manual, and Spanish versions of all intervention materials. This intervention offers a cost-effective, science based, and easily deliverable solution to improve multiple health behaviors, and overall health and well-being, of populations of pregnant women.</detailed_description>
