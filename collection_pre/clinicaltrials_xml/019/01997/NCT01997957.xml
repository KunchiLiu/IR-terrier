	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most commonly malignant tumors around the world and causes death of about 600000~1000000 people each year. Since 1990s, hepatic carcinoma has become the second carcinoma killer in China. Surgical resection or liver transplantation is the only method possibly able to cure hepatic carcinoma. However, due to multiple tumors or poor hepatic function reserve in cirrhosis, surgical treatment is suitable for only a small portion of patients (11.9%-30.1%). Therefore, in clinical practice, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or transarterial embolization (TAE) is a preferential and standard treatment of unresectable advanced hepatic carcinoma and has notable advantages in controlling local tumors of the liver. Hepatic arterial infusion of oxaliplatin after TACE can significantly increase the local doses of chemotherapeutic agents in the liver, kill micrometastases and residual foci after embolization and demonstrate outstanding efficacy for treating concomitant portal and hepatic vein tumor thrombi. S-1 is a chemotherapeutic agent with convenient use and definite efficacy and, when used concomitantly with TACE, theoretically can not only effectively control intrahepatic foci but also prevent and control extrahepatic metastatic foci. However, this hasn't been verified in clinical application. This study is intended to investigate efficacy and safety of the combination treatment so as to provide a more effective and safety way for treating patients with advanced hepatic carcinoma (Barcelona stage-C patients with concomitant portal vein tumor thrombi or extrahepatic metastasis).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Signing the informed consent form; Diagnosed with HCC Patients with hepatic cirrhosis must comply with AASLD (American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases) diagnostic criteria: Typical radiological examination (ultrasonography, CT or MRI) manifestations: dynamic enhanced examination shows arterialphase rapid heterogeneous enhancement and reduced venousphase or delayedphase rapid enhancement of space occupation in liver; If the diameter of space occupation in liver is ≥2cm, the diagnosis can be established if any of radiological examinations shows the above HCC characteristics; If the diameter of space occupation in liver is 12cm, the diagnosis can be established only when two radiological examinations show the above HCC characteristics; If the diameter of space occupation in liver is≤1cm, histopathological examination is needed for establishing the diagnosis. Histopathological examination is needed for establishing the diagnosis for patients without hepatic cirrhosis. Stage Barcelona C Grade A or B ChildPugh score ECOG PS score is 01 At least one measurable focus in liver according to (M) RECIST 1.0 criteria Male or female, age&gt;18 Can orally take drugs Anticipated survival≥12 weeks Pregnancy test of women at childbearing ages must be negative within the 7 days before treatment Male or female patients included must take effective contraceptive measures during the study period and within 4 weeks after completion of the study Within the 7 days before inclusion, bone marrow, liver and kidney functions must satisfy the following requirements: Hemoglobin≥ 90 g/L Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1,500/mm3 Platelet count≥ 80x109/L Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 5 times the upper normal limit (UNL) Total bilirubin &lt; 3UNL Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 4UNL Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 UNL Amylase and lipase &lt; 2 UNL INR&lt;2.3 or PPT&lt; 1.5 UNL (Patients who are accepting Warfarin or heparin anticoagulant therapy may be included if no evidence is available proving the above indicators are abnormal, but intense monitoring must be exercised. Tests shall be carried out at least once per week until stable INR.)
