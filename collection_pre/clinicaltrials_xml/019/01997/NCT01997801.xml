	<brief_title>Ketamine in Robot-assisted Thyroidectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Robot-assisted endoscopic thyroidectomy has been popularized due to cosmetic advantages. Despite small incisions, robot thyroidectomy did not offer satisfactory reduction in postoperative pain compared to open thyroidectomy. Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker and takes some attractive advantages in terms of pain control. When low dose ketamine is perioperatively administrated, opioid sparing effect during postoperative period is reported in various surgical procedures such as spine, thoracic, and gynecologic surgery. Ketamine's beneficial effect on postoperative pain has not been investigated in patients undergoing robot thyroidectomy. The investigators hypothesized that perioperative ketamine administration can reduce acute postoperative pain after robot thyroidectomy and the incidence of chronic pain hypoesthesia on anterior chest at 3 months after surgery.</detailed_description>
