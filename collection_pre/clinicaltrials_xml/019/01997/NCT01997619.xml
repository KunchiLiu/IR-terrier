	<brief_summary>Complex ventral hernia repair is a significant surgical challenge with high frequencies of both wound complications and recurrence. The Ventral Hernia Working Group (VHWG) described in 2010 recommendations regarding grading and technique of repair, which we have followed since November 2011.The purpose of the this study was to evaluate our results after biologic mesh repair of complex hernias.</brief_summary>
