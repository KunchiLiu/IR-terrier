	<brief_summary>This is a phase I study of intrapleural AdV-tk therapy in patients with malignant pleural effusion (MPE). The primary objective is to test the safety of intrapleural AdV-tk therapy. Secondary objectives are to evaluate clinical efficacy and biologic activity</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intrapleural AdV-tk Therapy in Patients With Malignant Pleural Effusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this open-label, dose escalation clinical trial is to investigate if the administration of AdV-tk to patients with MPE followed by valacyclovir and chemotherapy is safe, can be effectively delivered without disturbing standard therapy, and will have anti-tumor activity in patients with solid tumors. The first and second dose levels have been completed, and the study is currently expanded to enroll more patients to dose level 2 with Celecoxib. Patients will receive one injection of AdV-tk through a pleural catheter on day 0. The prodrug, valacyclovir, will be administered orally at a fixed dose for 14 days after each AdV-tk injection. Celecoxib will be administered starting 3 days before AdV-tk and continuing for 2 days after AdV-tk administration. Chemotherapy may begin at any time after completion of valacyclovir. Choice of chemotherapy depends on the treating oncologist.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have MPE (defined as positive pleural fluid cytology). Eligible patients include NSCLC, small cell lung cancer, malignant mesothelioma (MM), breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Diagnosis must be made prior to AdVtk injection. For patients with MM, histologic proof is needed, but positive pleural fluid cytology is not required. Patients must have an indication for placement of pleural catheter Patients must be 18 years of age or older Performance status must be ECOG 01 Acute toxic effects from any prior radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or prior surgical procedures must have resolved to NCI CTCAE v 4.0 grade ≤ 1 Baseline pulmonary function tests must be FEV1 ≥1 liter or 40% of predicted value (may be postdrainage and/or bronchodilator) Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and ALT, AST and alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2 x ULN Serum creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dl and calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 30 ml/min Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL, ANC &gt; 1000/mm3 and platelets &gt; 100,000/mm3 Serum albumin level ≥ 2.5 g/dL Patients must give study specific informed consent prior to enrollment Patients may not be on systemic corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg prednisone per day) or other systemic immunosuppressive drugs Patient is not known to be HIV+ Patient is not pregnant or breastfeeding.
