	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate if the study vaccine, m-IPV2 HD (vaccine that only contains polio serotype 2 in high dose), is as safe as the standard IPV Imovax (that contains the 3 serotypes of polio). This safety evaluation will be done in young adults. If the study vaccine appears to be safe, it will be tested at a later stage in the target group (infants and children) to evaluate the immunogenicity of the vaccine. After all, the purpose is to use the study vaccine in the future to protect young children against Polio serotype 2. Disease with Polio type 2 indeed recently re-appeared, so vaccination of young children to come to a complete eradication of Polio is needed. The standard use of Imovax to protect against Polio serotype 2 would be too expensive. Therefore, a monovalent Polio vaccine containing only serotype 2 (= the vaccine that will be evaluated in this study), has been developed. The duration of the study will be approximately 6 months. 120 subjects between 18 and 45 years of age will participate in Belgium. During the study there will be 2 groups of subjects. Subjects will be assigned by chance to one of these groups. One group will receive one single injection of the study vaccine m-IPV2 HD (which contains only serotype 2), the other group will receive one single injection of the standard polio vaccine IPV, Imovax (which contains the 3 serotypes). After this vaccination, there will be a follow-up period of 6 months. Subjects will be asked to come to the study centre one more time for the second visit (on Day 8, which is 7 days after the first visit). They will also receive 2 follow-up phone calls for approximately one month and 6 months after vaccination.</brief_summary>
