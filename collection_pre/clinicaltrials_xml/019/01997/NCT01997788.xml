	<brief_title>The Intrathecal Morphine for Nephrectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The open nephrectomy is the treatment of choice for live donor kidney transplantation and renal cell carcinoma. The incision for the nephrectomy causes severe postoperative pain. A single dose of intrathecal morphine(ITM) has been used for the postoperative pain of prostatectomy, transurethral resection of the prostate and hepatectomy. The effect of ITM for open nephrectomy has not been studied. Therefore, this prospective, randomized study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single 50 mcg dose of ITM added to intravenous patient controlled analgesia(IV-PCA), comparing to IV-PCA alone.</detailed_description>
