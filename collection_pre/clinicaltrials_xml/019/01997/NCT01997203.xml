	<detailed_description>Fifty patients study group administered vit D were compared with 50 patients control group without vit D. The results showed a significant elevation in vit D levels during the time period, and significant reduction on HCV RNA from the 12th wk to reach zero level in 24th wk. Interleukin 6 (IL-6), visfatin and hyaluronic acid levels were reduced significantly to reach normal values. These concentrations reduction by the effect of vit D on HCV indicated the reduction in inflammation, infection and liver cirrhosis and nearly amelioration HCV.</detailed_description>
