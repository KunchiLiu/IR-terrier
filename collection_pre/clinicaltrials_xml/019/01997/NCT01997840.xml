	<criteria>Must have a documented diagnosis of multiple myeloma and have relapsedandrefractory disease. Patients must have received at least 2 lines of prior therapies. Patients must have relapsed after having achieved at least stable disease (SD) for at least one cycle of treatment to at least one prior regimen and then developed progressive disease (PD). Patients must also have documented evidence of PD during or within 60 days (measured from the end of the last cycle) of completing treatment with the last antimyeloma drug regimen used just prior to study entry (refractory disease) Must have undergone prior treatment with at least 2 cycles of lenalidomide and at least 2 cycles of a proteasome inhibitor (either in separate regimens or within the same regimen) Must not be a candidate for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), has declined the option of ASCT, or has relapsed after prior ASCT Must have measurable levels of myeloma paraprotein in serum (≥ 0.5 g/dL) or urine (≥ 0.2 g/24 hours) Must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0, 1, or 2 Females of child bearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL within 10 14 days prior to, and again within 24 hours of starting pomalidomide and must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before she starts taking pomalidomide. FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing. Men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with a FCBP even if they have had a vasectomy. All patients must be counseled at a minimum of every 28 days about pregnancy precautions and risks of fetal exposure. Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable Birth Control Methods,and Education and Counseling Guidance must be followed per protocol Must be able to take acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (81 or 325 mg) daily as prophylactic anticoagulation. Patients intolerant to ASA may use low molecular weight heparin. Lovenox is recommended. Coumadin will be allowed provided the patient is fully anticoagulated, with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2 to 3 Pregnant or lactating females Prior therapy with HDAC inhibitor Any of the following laboratory abnormalities: ANC &lt; 1,000/µL Platelet count &lt; 75,000/ µL for patients in whom &lt; 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells are plasma cells; and &lt; 50,000/ µL for patients in whom ≥ 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells are plasma cells Hemoglobin &lt; 8g/dL (&lt;4.9 mmol/L; prior red blood cell [RBC] transfusion is permitted) Creatine clearance &lt; 45mL/min according to CockcroftGault formula. If creatine clearance calculated from the 24hour urine sample is ≥ 45 mL/min, patient will qualify for the study Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)/ alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 3.0 × ULN Serum total bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dL Prior history of malignancies, other than MM, unless the patient has been free of the disease for ≥ 3 years. Exceptions include the following: Basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin Carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast Incidental histologic finding of prostate cancer (TNM stage of T1a or T1b) Corrected QT interval using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) value &gt; 480 msec at screening; family or personal history of long QTc syndrome or ventricular arrhythmias including ventricular bigeminy; previous history of druginduced QTc prolongation or the need for treatment with medications known or suspected of producing prolonged QTc intervals on electrocardiogram (ECG) Positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection Hypersensitivity to thalidomide, lenalidomide, or dexamethasone (such as Steven Johnson Syndrome). Hypersensitivity, such as rash, that can be medically managed is allowable Peripheral neuropathy ≥ Grade 2 despite supportive therapy Radiotherapy or systemic therapy (standard or an investigational or biologic anticancer agent) within 14 days of initiation of study drug treatment Current enrollment in another clinical trial involving treatment and/or is receiving an investigational agent for any reason Inability or unwillingness to comply with birth control requirements or regional REMS/RevAid programs</criteria>
