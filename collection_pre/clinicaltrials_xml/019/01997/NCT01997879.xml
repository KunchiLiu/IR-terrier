	<criteria>Healthy adult male or female subjects at least 18 years of age. Within 25% of their ideal weights. Medically healthy subjects with clinically insignificant screening results (laboratory profiles, medical histories, ECGs, physical exam) as determined by the Investigator. Nontobacco/nicotine using subjects (minimum of 3 months nontobacco/nicotine use prior to first dose). Subjects with two normal (nondiseased) eyes, defined as nonclinically significant in the opinion of the investigator. Intraocular pressure between 14 and 20 mm Hg (inclusive) in each eye at Screening/Qualification. Bestcorrected visual acuity (BCVA) in each eye of 20/40 or better. Willing and able to provide written informed consent prior to any study related procedures and to comply with all study requirements. Chronic or acute ophthalmic disease including glaucoma, macular degeneration, clinically significant cataract (primary or secondary). Previous cataract surgery. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation (benzalkonium chloride, etc.), or to topical anesthetics. Previous glaucoma intraocular surgery or glaucoma laser procedures. Refractive surgery (e.g., radial keratotomy, PRK, LASIK, etc.). Ocular trauma within the past six months, or ocular surgery or laser treatment within the past three months (e.g., laser treatment for glaucoma or retina). Evidence of ocular infection, inflammation, cystoid macular edema, clinically significant blepharitis or conjunctivitis at (Screening/ Qualification), or a history of herpes simplex keratitis. Ocular medication of any kind within 30 days of Screening/ Qualification Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry of either eye. Central corneal thickness greater than 600 Âµm. Cannot demonstrate proper delivery of the eye drop. Blood donations or blood loss, within the past 3 months, that would put the patient at risk with the multiple blood samples required in the present study. Clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory tests at screening. Clinically significant systemic disease (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes, myasthenia gravis, hepatic, renal, cardiovascular or endocrine disorders) which might interfere with the study. Participation in any investigational study within the past 30 days prior to screening. Changes of systemic medication that could have a substantial effect on IOP within 30 days prior to screening, or anticipated during the study. Due to status of preclinical safety program, women of childbearing potential who are pregnant, nursing, planning a pregnancy, or not using a physiciansupervised form of birth control for at least the last two months. An adult woman is considered to be of childbearing potential unless she is one year postmenopausal or three months postsurgical sterilization. All females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test result at the screening examination and must not intend to become pregnant during the study.</criteria>
