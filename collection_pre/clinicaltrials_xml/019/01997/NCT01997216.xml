	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to compare binocular high contrast, high illumination (HC/HI) visual acuity at near (40 centimeters) of new multifocal contact lenses against AIR OPTIX® AQUA MULTIFOCAL contact lenses when worn for 9 hours.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Each participant was randomized to a specific sequence of lens wear, during which each lens type was worn bilaterally for 9 hours to compare performance characteristics.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Sign written Informed Consent document. Have spectacles that provide acceptable vision and be willing to wear them if unable to wear the study lenses. Be presbyopic with a spectacle add ≥ 0.50 diopter. Currently wearing soft contact lenses at least 5 days a week. Other protocolspecified inclusion criteria may apply Eye injury or surgery within 12 weeks of enrollment in this trial. Preexisting ocular irritation that would preclude contact lens fitting. Currently enrolled in any clinical trial. Evidence of systemic or ocular abnormality, infection, or disease which is likely to affect successful wear of contact lenses (for at least 9 hours) or use of their accessory solutions as determined by the Investigator. Any use of medications for which contact lens wear could be contraindicated as determined by the Investigator. Binocular visual acuity worse than 20/25. Corrected by monovision. Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
