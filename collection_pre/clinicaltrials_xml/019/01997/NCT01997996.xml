	<brief_summary>Transvaginal meshes (TVM) are indicated for the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) where surgical intervention is necessary. Due to a potential risk of de novo dyspareunia, TVM are mainly used in postmenopausal women and in case of recurrent POP. PROLIFT+M (Trademark) is based on a highly flexible material which is partially absorbable. We suggest that PROLIFT+M has less impact on the vita sexualis than conventional TVM and could also be used for the treatment of younger and/or sexually active women. This study observes women who are routinely treated with PROLIFT+M with regard to their sexual function before and after the surgery. The hypothesis is that there is no worsening in vita sexualis with PROLIFT+M.</brief_summary>
