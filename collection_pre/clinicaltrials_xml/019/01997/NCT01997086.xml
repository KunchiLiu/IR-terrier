	<brief_title>Percutaneous Transforaminal Endoscopic Discectomy vs Microendoscopic Discectomy for Treatment of Lumbar Disc Herniation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is a common pathological process leading to spinal surgery. Open discectomy used to be a widespread procedure for surgical treatment for symptomatic LDH. Currently, with rapid progress of endoscopic techniques, several minimal invasive endoscopic surgeries have been developed to perform discectomy. Percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy (PTED) and microendoscopic discectomy (MED) are two widely used minimal invasive surgical procedures, the effectiveness of which has been proved to be comparable to conventional open discectomy. As difference in operative approaches and iatrogenic injury, the clinical outcome might be dramatically different from each other. In this study, a single center randomized controlled trial will be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of two minimal invasive endoscopic discectomy, PTED and MED, for the treatment of symptomatic LDH. We will conduct the study at the 3rd affiliated hospitals of Sun Yat-Sen University. Two groups of patients will be investigated; 1) patients diagnosed with lumbar disc herniation undergoing PTED, and 2) patients diagnosed with lumbar disc herniation undergoing MED. The primary endpoints of the study will be changes in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) as measured at pre- and post-operation, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and annually thereafter. Secondary outcomes include Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the SF-36 Health Survey, as well as post-operative radiological assessment. Treatment effect is defined as the difference in the mean change from baseline between the two groups. Lumbar intervertebral disc tissue would be obtained during surgery for histological analysis, in order to evaluate disc degeneration and find out risk factors of it. On the basis of the results of this trial we will, for the first time, have scientific evidence as to the relative effectiveness of PTED versus MED for minimal invasive surgical treatment for symptomatic lumbar disc herniation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Duration of symptoms: 6 or more weeks. Treatments tried: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medical therapy and physical therapy. Surgical screening: Persistent radicular pain provoked by moderate exercise, sitting, increased abdominal pressure, decreased mobility, straight leg raising. Tests: MRI, CT or CTM to confirm diagnosis and level(s). Previous lumbar spine surgery. Not a surgical candidate for any of these reasons: Overall health which makes spinal surgery too lifethreatening to be an appropriate alternative, dramatic improvement with conservative care, or inability (for any reason) to undergo surgery within 6 months. Possible pregnancy. Active malignancy: A patient with a history of any invasive malignancy (except nonmelanoma skin cancer) is ineligible unless he or she has been treated with a curative intent AND there has been no clinical signs or symptoms of the malignancy for at least 5 years. Current fracture, infection, and/or deformity (greater than 15 degrees of lumbar scoliosis, using Cobb measure technique) of the spine. Age less than 18 years. Cauda Equina Syndrome or progressive neurological deficit (usually requiring urgent surgery). Unavailability for followup (planning to move, no telephone, etc.) or inability to complete data surveys. Symptoms less than 6 weeks. Patient currently enrolled in any experimental "spine related" study. Lumbar disc herniation sequestrating to proximal spinal canal. Two or more level lumbar disc herniation.</criteria>
