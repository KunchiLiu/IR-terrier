	<brief_title>Accuracy of Pulse CO-Oximetry Technology in Characterizing Noninvasive SpHb</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aim of this study is to collect data to characterize Masimo's noninvasive Rainbow SpHb technology during surgeries. The purpose is to compare Masimo Rainbow technology to arterial blood samples taken during surgery. Hemoglobin concentrations in the arterial blood samples will be measured using standard blood analyzers on site and/or the sponsor's laboratory.</detailed_description>
