	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if resveratrol supplementation preserves beta cell function and insulin sensitivity in post-partum women following a first diagnosis of gestational diabetes. We hypothesize that daily supplementation with resveratrol will preserve beta cell function and insulin sensitivity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Can Resveratrol Improve Insulin Sensitivity and Preserve Beta Cell Function Following Gestational Diabetes?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our primary aim is to perform a randomized controlled trial of resveratrol for the improvement of insulin sensitivity and the preservation of beta cell function in post-partum women following a first diagnosis of gestational diabetes. Our long-term goal is to test resveratrol for the secondary prevention of gestational diabetes and type 2 diabetes. We have developed six conditions that should be satisfied by the study to justify project expansion. Therefore, we will be testing hypotheses and computing estimates for the following six outcomes: (1) recruitment numbers, (2) adherence to study treatment, (3) adherence to study visits, (4) insulin sensitivity measured at 12 months post-partum, (5) beta cell function measured at 12 months post-partum, and (6) adverse events. The study is a single-site, parallel, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The study population consists of women recruited during pregnancy who had a confirmed first diagnosis of gestational diabetes, who do not have either diabetes or pre-diabetes when re-tested 3 months post-partum, and who have stopped breastfeeding by 9 months post-partum. They study intervention is resveratrol (or identical placebo) twice daily for a total of 12 weeks from 9 months to 12 months post-partum. Our planned sample size is 112 women based on the hypothesis testing and estimation considerations for the six above-mentioned outcomes.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult women (18 years of age or older) 3 months postpartum with a recent history of first diagnosis of gestational diabetes. Willingness to provide informed consent 3 months postpartum. Abnormal glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes recorded at 3 months postpartum. Breastfeeding beyond 9 months postpartum. Intention to consume resveratrol open label. Intention to drink red wine (more than 4 glasses per week) or eat foods high in resveratrol (grapes, grape juice, peanuts, peanut products). Unwillingness to use two approved types of contraception until one year postpartum and unwillingness to undergo pregnancy test at randomization. Twin pregnancy. Consuming medications with a risk of interaction with resveratrol. Liver disease. Unlikely to be able to comply with study followup as judged by social (e.g. transient, not permanent residents, etc.) or geographical considerations.</criteria>
