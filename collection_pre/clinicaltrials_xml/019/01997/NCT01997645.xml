	<brief_summary>Perianal fistula is a chronic phase of anorectal infection that occurs predominantly in the third and fourth decade of life. According to Parks classification fistulas have been divided into intersphincteric, transsphincteric, suprasphincteric and extrasphincteric. Simple fistulotomy can be performed with satisfactory outcomes in low fistula tracts but in high (transsphincteric) fistulas it may affect anal continence seriously. Therefore sphincter preserving procedures should be preferred in these cases. Rectal advancement mucosal flap (RAF) is one of the methods used in surgical fistula eradication with high success rate in cryptoglandular fistulas. However, this technique is technically demanding and results can be expert depended with wide spread of healing rates (24-100%) in individual studies as referred in recent systematic review. Ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract (LIFT) has been presented in 2007 as a simple sphincter preserving technique. The success rate varies between 40-95% with low overall incontinence rate (6%). The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of the LIFT and RAF procedure for treatment of high perianal fistulas.</brief_summary>
