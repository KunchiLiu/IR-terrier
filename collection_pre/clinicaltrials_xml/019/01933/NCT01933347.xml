	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the disease control rate (DCR) of gefitinib as third-line retreatment in stage IIIB/IV NSCLC with EGFR 19del/L858R positive mutation patients who had benefited from first-line gefitinib treatment with EGFR 19del/L858R positive mutation and tumor progression after the second-line chemotherapy</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Primary Study Objective: To evaluate the disease control rate (DCR) of gefitinib as third-line retreatment in stage IIIB/IV NSCLC with EGFR 19del/L858R positive mutation patients who had benefited from first-line gefitinib treatment with EGFR 19del/L858R positive mutation and tumor progression after the second-line chemotherapy - Secondary Study Objectives: To evaluate objective response rate (ORR), progressive-free survival (PFS), overall survival(OS) and quality of life (QoL) of gefitinib as third-line retreatment in NSCLC patients To evaluate the safety of gefitinib as third-line treatment in NSCLC patients - Exploratory analyses: To dynamically monitor EGFR mutation status and explore the relationship with clinical outcome</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. The subject or legal guardian could understand and sign informed consent form. 2. Male or female aged 18 years or older; 3. Subjects were diagnosed with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC before starting the first dose of gefitinib thirdline treatment; 4. EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R substitution mutation confirmed; 5. ECOG performance status 02; 6. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks or longer; 7. Has at least one measureable lesion by RECIST 1.1; 8. NSCLC of enrolled subjects previously progressed after firstline gefitinib treatment (PFS ≥ 6 months) and progressed again after secondline chemotherapy (not limited for chemotherapy regimen, ≥ 4 cycles of chemotherapy). Investigator considers adopting thirdline gefitinib retreatment; 9. Criteria for laboratory examinations: Total bilirubin (TB) ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal Aspartate aminotransferase(AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2 times upper limit of normal; for subjects with hepatic metastasis, AST,ALT≤ 5 times upper limit of normal Creatinine clearance≥45ml/min 1. Known severe hypersensitivity to gefitinib or any ingredients of the product; 2. Patients with prior exposure to agents directed at the EGFR axis except gefitinib (e.g. erlotinib, cetuximab, trastuzumab) ; 3. Preexisting interstitial lung disease or pulmonary fibrosis evidenced by CT scan at baseline; 4. Neutrophil count &lt;1.0×109/L or platelet count &lt;50×109/L; 5. Severe infection, uncontrolled systemic disease (e.g cardiopulmonary insufficiency, fatal arrhythmias, hepatitis, etc); 6. Pregnancy or breastfeeding; 7. Women of childbearing age refuse to take adequate contraception measures during gefitinib treatment 8. Subjects with other malignant tumors combined; 9. Known or suspected brain metastases or spinal cord compression, unless treated with surgery and/or radiation and stable without steroid treatment for at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study medication; 10. Subjects are unable to take medications orally or have digestive malabsorption; 11. Investigators consider subjects should not be involved in the study.</criteria>
