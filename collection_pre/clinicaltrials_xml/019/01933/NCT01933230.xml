	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if cooling the neck of patients with ICH decreases brain temperature. In addition, the investigators will determine if the device improves the delivery of oxygen to the brain. A third goal is to determine if cooling the neck lowers intracranial pressure (which is often times high in patients after ICH).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Cooling for Patients With Excel Cryo Cooling System in Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a non-randomized device efficacy trial. Patients with &gt;20cc Supratentorial ICH and an invasive brain temperature monitor (either Licox or Temperature sensing intracranial pressure device) will be enrolled after consent. The Excel Cryo Cooling System collar will be placed around neck in up to 20 patients for two hours. The goal is to determine the effectiveness of this device in cooling the brain. The collar is a standard neck collar used for patients after neck surgery with a modification that allows for the placement of a cooling pack in the collar that delivers the cold. During the study and for two hours after, the investigators will collect data concerning the brain temperature, body temperature, brain oxygen level and pressure both in the head and in the blood (blood pressure). The investigators will also collect demographic information about you (i.e. age, gender, medical risk factors) and information regarding your current disease process.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with brain injury in the Neurological ICU. 2. Consent from the patient or surrogate decision maker. 3. Warfarin induced intracerebral hemorrhages only after correction of INR to &lt;1.4. 1. Cerebellar hemorrhages. 2. Moribund state where the physician team doesn't believe the patient will survive. 3. Patients who are being cared for with the intent of making them comfortable. DNRCC (by Ohio law). 4. Known history of a blood dyscrasia such as CLL or essential thrombocytosis that could affect inflammation. 5. Known significant carotid artery stenosis (known &gt;50% stenosis by history or incidental hospital imaging). This will not be specifically tested. Patients found to have significant stenosis later in the hospital stay will have their data interpreted separately as well as in the total group.</criteria>
