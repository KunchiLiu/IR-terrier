	<criteria>1. Diagnosis of systemic sclerosis−related (SSc) confirmed by the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria of systemic sclerosis (Masi 1980); duration of diagnosis less than (&lt;) 7 years 2. Diagnosis of SScILD based on an highresolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan 3. Screening forced vital capacity (FVC) greater than equal to (&gt;=) 50 percent (%) of the predicted value, and screening carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) &gt;=40% of the predicted value 4. At study entry, the participant either was not taking SScILD medication or was taking cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate 1. Clinically significant pulmonary hypertension 2. Known underlying liver disease 3. Clinical evidence of significant aspiration or uncontrolled gastroesophageal reflux 4. History of clinically significant asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 5. Active infection 6. Diagnosis of another connective tissue disorder 7. Evidence of a malignancy that is likely to result in significant disability or require significant medical or surgical intervention 8. History of unstable or deteriorating cardiac or pulmonary disease (other than SScILD) 9. Pregnancy or lactation 10. Creatinine clearance &lt;40 milliliters per minute (mL/min) 11. Prior use of pirfenidone 12. Unsuitable for enrollment or unlikely to comply with study requirements</criteria>
