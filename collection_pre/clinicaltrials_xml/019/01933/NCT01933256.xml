	<brief_summary>HIP2B is being developed for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of repeat doses of HIP2B in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The study will also assess whether islet β-cell number and function will increase over time in response to repeat HIP2B injections.</brief_summary>
