	<brief_summary>A phase I trial is being conducted in patients with inoperable locally advanced NSCLC to treat with a combination of Conventional Fractionated Radiotherapy (CFRT) on the mediastinal lymph nodes and Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR)on the primary tumor with concurrent chemotherapy. It is hypothesized that this will lead to an increase of local control and overall survival</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined CFRT and SABR in Stage II and III NSCLC With Peripheral Tumors Smaller Than 5 cm.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In locally advanced NSCLC local control has been poor, but with SABR remarkable high local control rates with low toxicity have been reported. Currently stage III and inoperable II NSCLC patients have been treated with IMRT and concurrent chemotherapy at out institute. In this study we will explore the combination of SABR and CFRT with concurrent chemotherapy</detailed_description>
