	<brief_summary>Insomnia is recognized as the most prevalent and "costly" sleep disorders and is associated with considerable morbidity including significantly reduced quality of life, impaired work performance, and increased risk for major depressive disorder.1-4 Insomnia is a key symptom of the menopausal transition. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) yields equivalent short-term efficacy and superior long-term durability to pharmacological treatment of insomnia. The efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia comorbid with menopause will be tested.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1: Determine the efficacy of multi-component CBT-I compared to a wait-list control group on self report and laboratory-based polysomnographic (PSG) sleep parameters. We hypothesize that multicomponent CBT-I will increase sleep efficiency, reduce the frequency of awakenings, reduce wake after sleep onset, and increase sleep bout duration compared to the control group evaluated using polysomnographic (PSG) and self-report measures of sleep. Specific Aim 2a: Test the efficacy of a brief two week single component sleep restriction therapy (SRT) to a wait-list control group on PSG and self-report sleep measures (sleep efficiency, frequency of awakenings, wake after sleep onset, and sleep bout duration). We hypothesize that brief SRT will be efficacious compared to the control condition in women with menopausal-related insomnia. Specific Aim 2b: Test the comparability (non-inferiority analysis) of SRT to CBT-I. We hypothesize that SRT will produce comparable efficacy in terms of the PSG and self-report measures of sleep compared to CBT-I (primary endpoints: sleep efficiency, frequency of awakenings, wake after sleep onset, and sleep bout duration). Specific Aim 3: Determine if CBT-I and SRT improves specific aspects of daytime functioning in patients with menopausal-related insomnia. We hypothesize that patients treated with CBT-I or SRT will have greater improvements in depressive symptomatology, quality of life, sleepiness and fatigue compared with a wait list control group.</detailed_description>
