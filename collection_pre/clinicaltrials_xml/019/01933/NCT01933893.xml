	<brief_summary>Pipelle was found to increase pregnancy and implantation rates in women undergoing IVF treatment in general, and in particular in repeated implantation failure (RIF). However, there is virtually no data regarding the optimal timing for the pipelle. The current study aims to compare between follicular and luteal pipelle on pregnancy rate in RIF patients.</brief_summary>
