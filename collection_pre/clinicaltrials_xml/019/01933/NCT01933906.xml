	<brief_summary>In this phase I pilot study, it is planned to investigate the feasibility and safety of adding an interferon therapy to an preexisting imatinib treatment in patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukaemia. The participating patients have already reached a response during their imatinib therapy (CCyR) but have still a detectable disease (no molecular response MR 4.5 or better).</brief_summary>
