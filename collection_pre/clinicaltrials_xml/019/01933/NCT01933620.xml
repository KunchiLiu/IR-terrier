	<brief_summary>Background: - The intestines, mouth, and skin all contain billions of bacteria and some fungi. Every person s body contains microorganisms like these. They normally do not make people sick. Researchers are interested in how these microorganisms change when a person is hospitalized. They want to find out if changes take place because of the hospitalization (such as treatments used or changes in medical condition) or because of a person s biology (such as their immune system). Objectives: - To understand which microorganisms are most likely to spread through hospitals and what affects that spread. Eligibility: - People over 2 years of age who are going to be inpatients at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (NIHCC) for at least 1 week. Design: - Clinicians will take samples from participants up to once a day for as long as they are hospitalized at NIHCC. &lt;TAB&gt;- Blood will be taken from a needle in the arm. This will be done only once, unless the participant gets a certain infection. - Swabs will be taken with a cotton swab, from the rectal area, groin, throat, and armpit, and possibly other areas. - Participants may give a stool sample or be asked to spit into a cup. - Clinicians will collect some information from participants medical records. They may request some samples of tissue that are left over from procedures already scheduled at NIHCC. - After participants leave the NIHCC, samples may be taken when they return for follow-up visits from their hospitalization, for up to 2 years. They will not have to return as a follow-up for this study only.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Human Microbiome in Clinical Center Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this protocol is to explore changes to microbial communities during the course of hospital care, and to determine the extent to which these alterations affect whether hospitalized patients become colonized with nosocomial bacteria. The study enables collection of clinical specimens and associated medical data to evaluate the natural history, epidemiology, and genomics of patients who are expected to be hospitalized for at least seven days. Biological specimens including stool, sputum, and swabs will be taken from Clinical Center inpatients at least 2 years of age as frequently as daily through discharge, and at follow-up visits for up to 2 years from the date of enrollment. To understand the dynamics of the fecal and other microbiota of hospitalized patients, this protocol will assess the full complement of the microbial-host-environmental contributions including: (1) microbial genome and community; (2) patient s genotype, underlying medical condition, medical treatment; and (3) hospital practices and environment.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: Individuals must meet the following inclusion criteria to participate in the study: Be inpatients in the NIH CC with an expected hospitalization of at least 48 hours beyond the date of referral. Be 2 years of age or older Allow storage of tissue samples for future analyses. Allow genetic testing of body fluids, and tissue specimens. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: A patient will not be eligible if he/she has any condition which, in the investigator s opinion, places the patient at undue risk by participating in the study.</criteria>
