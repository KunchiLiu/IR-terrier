	<brief_summary>Neuromuscular blocking drugs (NMBDs) provide anesthesiologists with powerful intraoperative tools, but their use carries the potential risk of serious postoperative complications. NMBD-induced muscle weakness that lingers into the postoperative period, known as postoperative residual curarization (PORC), is present in as many as 40% of all patients that receive neuromuscular blocking agents. The Post Anesthesia Care Unit will be introducing monitoring as part of standard of care. This study will collect data about patients who receive NMBDs and examine the impact of monitoring on incidences of PORC. Our study is designed to test the following hypotheses: Hypothesis 1: The initiation of quantitative TOF monitoring as part of the standard PACU entry evaluation will change practitioner behavior in a manner that decreases the incidence of PORC in surgical patients at VUMC. Hypothesis 2: The initiation of the routine TOF monitoring program will decrease the incidence of short- and long-term postoperative complications at VUMC.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neuromuscular blocking drugs (NMBDs) provide anesthesiologists with powerful intraoperative tools, but their use carries the potential risk of serious postoperative complications. NMBD-induced muscle weakness that lingers into the postoperative period, known as postoperative residual curarization (PORC), is present in as many as 40% of all patients that receive neuromuscular blocking agents. Physiological data suggest that PORC impairs normal respiratory function, and compelling evidence suggests PORC impairs clinical recovery in the immediate postoperative period and prolongs PACU length of stay. However, despite the widespread use of NMBDs and the frequent occurrence of PORC, limitations in the literature prevent an understanding of their full impact on clinical outcomes. This study will collect data about patients who receive NMBDs and examine the impact of monitoring on incidences of PORC. The incidence of PORC and postoperative complications after the introduction of monitoring in the PACU will be determined by measuring TOF ratios and tracking the postoperative outcomes in the surgical patients over time.</detailed_description>
