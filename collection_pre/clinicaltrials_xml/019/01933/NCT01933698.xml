	<brief_title>Bioequivalence of Two Commercial Amoxicillin Suspensions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Under fasting condition, 25 volunteers (13 males and 12 females) were included in this randomized, open-label, two-period crossover (1-week washout interval) bioequivalence study. Blood samples were collected at pre-dose (0h) and 0.5, 1, 1.33, 1.66, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours after drug ingestion. Pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, Tmax, T1/2, Area-under-curve0-12h and Area-under-curve0-inf) were calculated from plasma concentrations for both formulations in each subject.</detailed_description>
