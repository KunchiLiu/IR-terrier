	<brief_summary>The elderly population has increased significantly in the last years. The number of falls has also increased due to the decrease of balance. The Kinesio Taping (KT) is a method with the aim to improve muscle physiology, proprioception, coordination and balance. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of KT on postural balance in the elderly. We evaluated 62 elderly with a mean age of 67.98±5.321, female, submitted to the protocol for the application of KT in gastrocnemius muscles of the midfoot and a placebo tape (3M Micropore) in the control group. The application of the tapes was bilateral. Half of the participants (n=31) received KT in the lower limbs, while the control group (n=31) was applied placebo tape. To analysis of posture and balance, we used a force plate to record stabilometric signals. Both groups were evaluated post-application and 48 hours after application of the tape. The variables used were total displacement in centimeters (cm), amplitude AP (anterior-posterior) and ML (medial-lateral) in centimeters, area (cm²) and speed AP and ML in centimeters for seconds. The experimental protocol was performed in standing posture and the subjects were instructed to stand with feet apart, eyes open to look at the fixed point 1.5 m from force plate in a horizontal direction. It was requested that the elderly maintain the position for a time of 40 seconds to collect data The data were collected immediately post application of tapes and after 48 hours. The data was tabulated, descriptive statistics were calculated. Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism 4.0 software (Prism, Chicago, IL). The Kolmogorov Smirnov test was used to verify the data distribution. Differences between the means were evaluated using the Student T test for the normally distributed data, and using the Mann-Whitney test for the data not normally distributed. Significance levels were set at p&lt;0.05.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Kinesio Taping Effect on Postural Balance in Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Kinesio Taping Group (KTG) was composed of 31 participants that received the application of KT (K-Taping®) on the gastrocnemius muscle and the muscles of the midfoot. The placebo tape group (PTG) was composed of 31 participants that received the application of a placebo tape (3M Micropore®) on the same muscles of both limbs. The order of application of KT tape and placebo was conducted randomly among the elderly. Before the tape applying the site was cleaned with 70% ethanol for better fixation of the tape and for both groups were determined the application technique in "I" shaped. This technique consist in placing two tapes that format. The first tape was placed along the length of the plantar aponeurosis fixed point in the middle third of the medial gastrocnemius muscle to the metatarsal phalangeal joint. The second tape was also applied in "I" shaped without fixed point was placed around the midfoot arch in the direction of tension lines to assist with the metatarsal arch support.</detailed_description>
