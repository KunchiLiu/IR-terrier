	<brief_summary>Water-aided insertion of the colonoscope has been repeatedly proven to beneficial in terms of lower discomfort and need for sedation during colonoscopy. Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) undergo repeated colonoscopy in course of their disease. According to our preliminary experience, water immersion could be beneficial while scoping these patients. As far as the investigators know, water-aided colonoscopy has never been studied in this indication. Results of our trial might support use of water-aided colonoscopy in common practice and decrease associated discomfort in IBD patients.</brief_summary>
