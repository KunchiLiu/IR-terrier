	<brief_summary>The purpose of this prospective, open-label clinical trial is to evaluate the immunogenicity of self-administered (SA) live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) in comparison with healthcare worker administered (HCWA) LAIV and to evaluate the feasibility of group self-administration of LAIV.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy males or healthy, nonpregnant females 1849 years of age Department of Defense beneficiary including active duty members Able to speak and understand English, and provide written informed consent Known hypersensitivity to eggs, eggproteins, gentamicin, gelatin, or arginine or lifethreatening reactions to previous influenza vaccination Prior receipt of the 20122013 seasonal influenza vaccine for 20122013 season or prior receipt of the 20132014 seasonal influenza vaccine for 20132014 season Known clinical diagnosis of reactive airway disease, wheezing, or asthma (excluding exerciseinduced asthma) Reported febrile upper respiratory illness (oral or tympanic temperature greater than 100°F or a subjective fever) at the time of or within the 24 hours prior to immunization Known to be pregnant, possibly pregnant or breastfeeding Known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, chronic active hepatitis B infection, or chronic hepatitis C infection History of GuillainBarre Syndrome Household member known to be immunocompromised (either a known disease or disorder such as HIV, or other acquired or congenital immunodeficiency disorder, or taking systemic steroids (any dose) or high daily dose inhaled steroids, tumor necrosis factoralpha inhibitors, or monoclonal antibodies used to treat autoimmune disease) Receipt of medications with activity against influenza A and/or B (ex: Tamiflu®, Relenza®, amantadine, or rimantadine) within 48 hours prior to vaccine administration Use of any oral or intravenous systemic steroids (any dose) or any daily dose inhaled steroids At the time of enrollment, any person who is trained to administer intranasal vaccines or who has been involved in any recurring role associated with the administration of intranasal vaccines to others in the clinic or military treatment facility (MTF) Prior participation in this research study Any acute or chronic medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would render vaccination unsafe, interfere with the evaluation of responses, or render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol. These conditions may include, but are not limited to: history of significant renal impairment (dialysis and treatment for kidney disease, including diabetic and hypertensive kidney disease); poorly controlled diabetes mellitus or patients with diabetes mellitus on insulin (subjects with wellcontrolled diabetes mellitus on oral agents may enroll as long there has been no dosage increase within the past 6 months); cardiac insufficiency, if heart failure is present; an arteriosclerotic event during the 6 months prior to enrollment (e.g., history of myocardial infarction, stroke, recanalization of femoral arteries, or transient ischemic attack). If the individual received a live virus vaccine (e.g., Varicella, MeaslesMumpsRubella, Yellow Fever, Smallpox) in the past 4 weeks, they should wait 28 days before receiving LAIV. There is no reason to defer vaccination if the individual was vaccinated with an inactivated vaccine or if they have recently received blood or other antibodycontaining blood products.</criteria>
