	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of what causes urinary urgency in women by asking about different symptoms and measuring biomarker levels in their urine. Understanding the underlying causes of urinary urgency will allow us to develop treatment options to better take care of women with urinary urgency.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical and Biochemical Evidence of Neurogenic Inflammation in Women With Urinary Urgency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose to test the hypothesis that urinary urgency in women is caused by neurogenic inflammation that is manifested clinically as neuropathic pain and associated with the expression of neuroinflammatory biomarkers in the urine.</detailed_description>
