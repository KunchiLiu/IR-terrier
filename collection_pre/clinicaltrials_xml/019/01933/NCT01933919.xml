	<brief_summary>The objective in 1st phase of this randomized study is to evaluate the efficacy of SME3110 compared to placebo on change in total score of Japanese version of the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale 10-item for children from baseline to the last observation visit in pediatric/adolescent Obsessive Compulsive Disorder subjects in short-term (10 weeks) in double blind period. The safety of SME3110 compared to placebo is also evaluated. The objective in 2nd phase of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of SME3110 in pediatric/adolescent Obsessive Compulsive Disorder subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 3 Study of SME3110 in Pediatric/Adolescent Subjects With Obsessive Compulsive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The 1st phase will be conducted in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind manner to evaluate the efficacy of SME3110 on change from baseline to the last observation visit in Japanese version of the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale 10-item total score. Eligible patients will be allocated in SME3110 group or placebo group with 1:1 ratio using the experience of fluvoxamine treatment and age as the stratification factor (dynamic allocation). The 1st phase consists of 5 periods; screening period of 1-2 weeks, forced titration dose period of 2 weeks, dose adjustment period of 4 weeks, maintained dose period of 4 weeks, and tapering dose period of 0-4 weeks. The 2nd phase will be conducted in an open-label manner in patients who completed the 1st phase to evaluate long-term safety of SME3110. The 2nd phase consists of 3 periods; forced titration dose period of 2 week, flexible dose period of 50 weeks, and tapering dose period of 0-4 weeks. After the last dose of study drug (including tapering dose period) or the early termination visit, subjects will be followed up to 30 days.</detailed_description>
