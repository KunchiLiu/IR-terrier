	<brief_summary>This study is designed to investigate whether topical application of a cromolyn sodium solution is able to decrease the facial redness seen in patients with papulopustular rosacea. Previous work in the lab of Dr. Di Nardo on mice has suggested that cromolyn may be able to have this effect. The study will enroll a total of 10 patients. 5 will randomly be assigned to receive the cromolyn sodium solution, and the other 5 will be randomly assigned to receive the placebo solution. All participants will be instructed to apply their assigned solution twice daily to their face. Patients will return to the clinic 3, 6, and 8 weeks after the distribution of the solutions to measure the efficacy of their assigned solution.</brief_summary>
