	<brief_summary>Overweight/obesity is associated with sub-fertility. The investigators will assess if regular exercise training prior to assisted fertilization will improve pregnancy rate in overweight/obese women referred to assisted fertilization. It is expected that training will be successful in increasing pregnancy rate</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improved Fertility After Exercise in Overweight/Obese Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity is associated with several diseases, as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some types of cancer, this is of great concern for the public health. Also, of more immediate importance for these women; obesity is associated with increased risks of sub-fertility. The overall aim of the current project is to expand the knowledge about effective interventions to prevent the increasing prevalence of obesity-associated sub-fertility in population. One cause of the increased referral rate for in-vitro fertilization is the growing prevalence of overweight and obesity. Currently, about 700 couples are annually referred for in-vitro fertilization at St.Olav's Hospital. In this interdisciplinary trial, involving physiotherapists, exercise physiologists, gynecologists, and basic researchers, the effects of regular high intensity exercise training on fertility in sub-fertile overweight and obese women will be investigated.</detailed_description>
