	<brief_summary>Despite of the widespread use, and extensive studies, the optimal route of administration of misoprostol before surgical abortion remains to be defined. Following administration of 400 mcg vaginally as per clinical guidelines, the time for optimal priming seems to be 3 hours, but the longer the interval the greater the risk or bleeding and expulsion of the uterine contents before the surgical evacuation. Sublingual administration seems to give adequate plasma concentration and cervical priming faster than oral or vaginal administration. This may allow a shorter waiting time with maintained efficacy, less side effects and logistic advantages.</brief_summary>
