	<brief_summary>Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) represent the most common and earliest organ dysfunction in acute pancreatitis, presenting as dyspnea and intractable hypoxemia, with secondary bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on radiograph. And mechanical ventilation (MV) is the essential intervention to improve oxygenation. When to initiate MV remains uncertain. In this study, we aim to compare the effect of early MV and conventional MV, and we hypothesize that early MV may be a better treatment option.</brief_summary>
