	<brief_title>Assessment of Efficacy of CR8020 and CR6261, Monoclonal Antibodies, Against Influenza Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase IIa proof-of-concept study, designed to evaluate the effect of CR8020, CR6261, or placebo in hospitalized patients with influenza A infection that are receiving standard of care. Up to 262 participants will be randomized to receive 30 mg/kg of CR8020, 30 mg/kg of CR6261, or placebo. The study duration will be approximately 117 days for each participant. Prior to enrollment, participants will be screened to assess their eligibility. Eligible participants will be randomized to CR8020, CR6261, or placebo and study drug will be administered on Day 1. Participants will be followed up for 115 days in 9 visits on Days 2 to 8, Day 29, and Day 116 (end of study). After hospital discharge, the remaining follow-up visits will be performed as outpatient visits.</detailed_description>
