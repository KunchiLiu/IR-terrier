	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of transcranial stimulation for upper limb training of patients with sequelae from an intracranial hemorrhage. Patients receive five days of upper limb occupational therapy training in combination with real or sham stimulation. Patients complete the Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test before, after and 7 days later. The intervention takes place at patients' home address.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim: To investigate the effect of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for upper limb training of individuals with sequelae from intracranial hemorrhage. Design: Triple-blinded randomised controlled trial Study population: Patients with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) of non-traumatic aetiology. Between 6 months and five years from injury. Intervention: Group 1 receive five days of upper limb occupational therapy in combination with anodal stimulation Group 2 receive five days of upper limb occupational therapy in combination with sham stimulation The intervention takes place at patients' home address. Assessment tool: Patients complete the Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test at baseline, post-intervention and at 7 days follow-up.</detailed_description>
