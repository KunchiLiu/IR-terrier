	<brief_title>Vitamin D Supplementation and TB</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this randomized trial, the investigators will enroll 200 adults with active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB; among whom 40 have HIV co-infections) at the time of TB diagnosis in S India. The intervention will include daily vitamin D supplementation in 3 treatment arms (600, 2000, and 4000 IU vitamin D), compared to placebo, for 12 months. The investigators' primary objectives are to assess how vitamin D supplementation affects immunity (immunological markers, immune competence) and serum vitamin D levels. Secondary outcomes include TB treatment outcomes (successful sputum smear conversion, relapse) in all patients, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease progression among a subset of patients with HIV co-infection.</detailed_description>
