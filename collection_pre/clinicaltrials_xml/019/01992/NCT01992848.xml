	<brief_summary>Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of mortality in the UK with an estimated 80,000 fatalities in 2010. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is associated with atherosclerotic plaque burden and cardiovascular mortality. Mechanisms underlying isolated CAC have not been as yet been fully explained. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), known to act as regulators of gene expression, have also emerged as powerful biomarkers in the diagnosis and prognosis of cardiovascular disorders and may be used in the detection of CAC. We aim to investigate the potential for a "microRNA-signature" in patients with CAC by performing a prospective, case-controlled study to identify pathways associated with CAC in humans. Previous research has demonstrated an inverse relationship between CAC and bone mineral density (BMD), suggesting that these processes may be linked. In a further substudy we plan to define the relationship between CAC and BMD as well as a number of markers of bone metabolism.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients will be prospectively enrolled whilst attending for elective coronary CT (computed tomography) angiography including a coronary calcium score, at the Royal Surrey County Hospital. Data regarding demographic and clinical characteristics of patients will be collected. Peripheral venous blood sampling will take place on this occasion. Coronary artery calcification scores will be estimated by a Radiologist using default software. Patients eligible for the bone metabolism substudy will be required to attend the University of Surrey for peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (pQCT) of bone mineral composition of the radius. In the intervening period we will ask them to complete a 4-day food diary and wear a UV dosimeter, the latter to assess typical UV exposure, for one week.</detailed_description>
