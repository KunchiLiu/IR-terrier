	<brief_summary>The aims of the study are to: - explore whether platelet reactivity in patients treated wih novel platelet inhibitors is associated with clinical outcome - investigate whether a therapeutic window exist for novel platelet inhibitors - investigate the incidence of adverse events under treatment with novel platelet inhibitors in the real life clinical scenario - investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms, inflammation, platelet reactivity and clinical outcome - investigate synergistic effects between aspirin and novel platelet inhibitors</brief_summary>
