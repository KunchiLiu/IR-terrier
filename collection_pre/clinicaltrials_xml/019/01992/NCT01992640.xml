	<brief_summary>During laparoscopic surgery, muscle relaxants are often administrated in order to ensure acceptable surgical conditions. These drugs bind to receptors in the neuromuscular junction. The degree of muscle relaxation is monitored by use of an acceleromyography and at the end of surgery another drug - Neostigmine- is given to reverse the muscle relaxation. However,there may still be a blockade of up to 70% of the receptors. This partial muscle relaxation may result in muscle weakness, reduced balance and prolonged hospitalization. This study will describe changes in balance and subjective muscle weakness after laparoscopic surgery. The primary hypothesis is that sway area is increased 30 min after extubation compared to the preoperative value.</brief_summary>
