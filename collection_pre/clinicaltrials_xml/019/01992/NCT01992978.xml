	<brief_summary>Surgical resection is the most effective treatment of primary and secondary liver tumors. Technical innovations have mainly focused on minimizing bleeding during transection of the hepatic parenchyma because excessive hemorrhage and the need for blood transfusion are associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality. Recently,radiofrequency-assisted（RFA）hepatectomy has developed rapidly and gained widespread acceptance for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinomas（HCC），but its influence on the prognosis of HCC patients，especially for those with cirrhosis，is still controversial. Therefore, we design this prospective clinical trial to explore the effect of RFA hepatectomy versus the conventional hepatectomy on the outcomes of perioperative period and prognosis of HCC patients with cirrhosis.</brief_summary>
