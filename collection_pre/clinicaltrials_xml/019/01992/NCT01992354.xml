	<brief_summary>The PET/MR device components and accessories are under development in order to optimize, validate and improve the design including improving the quality of images. The purpose of this study is: - Aim 1: Perform iterative evaluations of the device (including features and components) to optimize device performance and assess feasibility of new features; - Aim 2: Perform activities in support of design validation as needed for regulatory submission; - Aim 3: Evaluate device complaints and analyze potential causes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development of an Integrated PET/MR System, Accessories and Components</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a non-randomized, non-statistically powered, single-site, prospective study designed to gather imaging data for design optimization, regulatory submission and future product development of an investigational hybrid PET/MRI scanner. Subjects will undergo a clinically indicated PET/CT exam subsequent to tracer administration. Once clinical imaging is complete, subjects will be transported to the PET/MR scanner at the GE Facility for additional imaging. No additional pharmaceuticals or ionizing radiation will be utilized as part of this study.</detailed_description>
