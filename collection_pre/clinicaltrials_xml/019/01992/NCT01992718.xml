	<brief_summary>To improve the clinical care of women with pelvic pain and abnormal uterine bleeding due to benign uterine conditions including leiomyomas (uterine fibroids) and adenomyosis by evaluating the accuracy of radiology diagnostic exams (MRI(magnetic resonance imaging), ultrasound and ultrasound with elastography).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>What Are we Missing? Diagnosing Uterine Adenomyosis Using Ultrasound Elastography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently benign conditions of the uterus are frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. This project will help determine which diagnostic radiology exams are most helpful to the clinician in providing accurate diagnosis. In addition, this study will evaluate which exam (MRI vs. Ultrasound) patients prefer over another exam.</detailed_description>
