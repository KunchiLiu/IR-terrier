	<brief_summary>This study hopes to determine if thromboelastography-derived functional fibrinogen (TEG-FF) levels on cardiopulmary bypass during cardiac surgery can provide information on coagulation status sooner, allowing for anticipation of post-bypass bleeding and transfusion requirements</brief_summary>
