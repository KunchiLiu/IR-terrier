	<brief_summary>This study examines the use of cryoablation as an alternative to surgery in the treatment of early stage invasive breast cancer. The hypothesis is that cryoablation will complete ablation and destroy the tumor in a selected population of women who may otherwise be adequately treated with surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cryoablation of Small Breast Tumors in Early Stage Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PURPOSE: To determine the rate of successful tumor ablation in patients treated with cryoablation and endocrine therapy in a subset of patients with early stage breast cancer. OUTLINE: 1. Core Biopsy (Pre-Registration) 2. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Pre-Registration) 3. Tumor Cryoablation 4. Core Biopsy (Post-Cryoablation) 5. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Post-Cryoablation) 6. Postoperative Follow-up 7. Evaluation of outcomes</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age ≥ 50 2. Unifocal primary invasive breast carcinoma diagnosed by core needle biopsy 3. Maximum tumor size ≤1.5 cm in its greatest diameter 4. Ultrasound visible lesion(s) 5. Clinically node negative, hormone receptor positive (+). HER2 negative (), with &lt;25% intraductal component in the aggregate. 6. Unilateral or bilateral disease meeting study criteria 7. Physical and emotional ability to undergo baseline and followup breast MRIs and serial breast cosmesis analysis 8. Patient agrees to receive a 5 year minimum course of endocrine therapy following cryoablation for control of systemic disease 1. Prior treatment (e.g., open surgical biopsy, lumpectomy) of index cancer 2. Ductal carcinoma insitu with microinvasions (T1mic) 3. Multifocal or multicentric invasive breast carcinoma 4. Prior or planned neoadjuvant systemic therapy for breast cancer 5. Tumor with ≥25% IDC components</criteria>
