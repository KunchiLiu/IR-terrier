	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel when given alone and in combination with AMG 386 to determine whether AMG 386 alters the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AMG 386 Drug-Drug Interaction Study With Paclitaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible subjects enrolled in the study will begin receiving paclitaxel on a three weeks on / one week off schedule at study day 1 and weekly AMG 386 beginning at study day 8. The pharmacokinetic portion of the study occurs during the first two study cycles with intensive PK collections on study weeks 1, 6 and 8. Once the pharmacokinetic assessment period is completed, continued combination therapy with AMG 386 and paclitaxel or single-agent AMG 386 will be administered at the investigator's discretion until progression, unacceptable toxicity develops, or study withdrawal.</detailed_description>
