	<brief_title>Clinical Trial for High Intensity Laser Therapy (HILT) for Elbow Epicondylosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The diagnosed patients with epicondylosis will be treated with HILTERAPIA HIRO 3.O for a total of four sessions during the entire duration of the treatment protocol. Parameters to be evaluated are tenderness, pain upon active resistive motion and DASH scores. After every treatment session of HILTERAPIA HIRO 3.O, these said parameters will be recorded initially on the first treatment, one week after the initial treatment, two weeks after the initial treatment and four weeks after the initial treatment. Patient is advised to follow-up on the 6th and 12 month post initial HILTERAPIA HIRO 3.O treatment for the reevaluation of the parameters. Tenderness is described as pain upon palpation and is further categorized into, 0= no tenderness, 1 = mild tenderness, 2 = tenderness evident on facial expression and 3 = patient screams upon palpation. Pain is also noted upon active resistive motion of extension/flexion, supination/pronation. Classification includes; 0 = no pain and 1 = mild pain with full power, 2 = severe pain with full power, and 3 = muscle weakness with pain. And for functional scoring will be using the DASH which is a multidimensional disease specific, brief, self-administered measure of symptoms and functional status among subjects with upper limb disorders. The DASH consists of a 30-item questionnaire with 5 response options for each item with a scale ranging from 0, which indicates "least disability," to 100, which indicates "most disability." A change in 12.7 DASH score points is considered to represent clinically significant functional improvement.</detailed_description>
