	<brief_summary>In this study we tried to elucidate the factors associated with the development of a rapid cycling course in bipolar disorder patients, in a prospective and longitudinal design, and the role of antidepressants. The identification of risk factors is extremely relevant from the clinical point of view. We hypothesized that rapid cycling bipolar disorder is associated with more chronicity, poor outcome, and more antidepressant prescription.</brief_summary>
