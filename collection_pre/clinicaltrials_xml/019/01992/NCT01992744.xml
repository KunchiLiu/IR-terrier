	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the correlation between varying levels of neuropeptides and birth outcomes. Neuropeptides are substances (proteins) produced in the body in very small amounts but without which the nervous system cannot function properly, and which might have a role in the health of a newborn. As part of this study, we are collecting blood samples from pregnant women. Neuropeptides and hormones can be measured in blood. This study will involve three blood draws from the participants arm. Demographic information will also be requested, and participants will be asked to complete questionnaires about their mood and personal experiences at each visit. Our hypothesis is that participants with lower levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) will be at increased risk for poor birth outcomes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective, non-randomized trial will evaluate peripheral serum blood levels of BDNF in participants recruited from previously identified University of Pennsylvania obstetrics and gynecological (OB/GYN) clinics. A total of 100 pregnant subjects will be recruited consecutively and evaluated in the first and third trimester of their pregnancy as well as within a month after delivery. The entire project will take one year.</detailed_description>
