	<brief_summary>This is a single-centre, placebo-controlled, randomised, double-blind study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single ascending doses (SAD) and multiple ascending doses (MAD) of ASLAN003 in healthy subjects</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1, Randomised Double Blinded Placebo Controlled Study of ASLAN003</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-centre, placebo-controlled, randomised, double-blind study involving SAD and MAD of ASLAN003 in healthy subjects. The study is divided into two parts: - Part A: SAD cohorts and 1 cohort to assess food effect of ASLAN003 PK. - Part B: MAD cohorts with one cohort being of healthy elderly subjects. There will be a sentinel pair of subjects for each of SAD Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 who will be dosed first and then the same dose will be given to the rest of the subjects in the respective cohorts. In addition, 8 subjects will receive ASLAN003 under both fed and fasted conditions</detailed_description>

One unit is equivalent to a half pint (220 mL) of beer or 1 (25 mL) measure of spirits or 1 glass (125 mL) of wine;</criteria>
