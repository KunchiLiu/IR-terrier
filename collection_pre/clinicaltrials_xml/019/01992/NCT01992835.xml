	<brief_summary>After an allergen challenge, the allergic inflammatory response disappears spontaneously. The initiation of the resolution of the inflammatory response is now recognized as a dynamic process, involving active biochemical programs that enable inflamed tissues to return to homeostasis. Recent data established key roles of different specific lipid mediators in the endogenous counter-regulation of inflammation and activation of resolution. Only little is known about kinetics of these specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators during acute allergic inflammation. Therefore, the primary propose of our study is to characterize the temporal evolution of cellular inflammation and specific lipid mediators after allergen challenge.</brief_summary>
