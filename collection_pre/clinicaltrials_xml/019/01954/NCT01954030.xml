	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of the study are to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Carboxyamidotriazole Orotate (CTO) when combined with standard dosing of bevacizumab among patients with recurrent malignant glioma (WHO grade III or IV) that have previously failed bevacizumab (Phase 1); to determine the activity of CTO alone in bevacizumab-failure WHO grade IV malignant glioma patients (Phase 2, Arm 1); to determine the activity of CTO plus bevacizumab in bevacizumab-failure WHO grade IV malignant glioma patients (Phase 2, Arm 2). This study was terminated early due to funding issues. At the time of termination, the study was still in Phase 1 and no MTD for the combination of CTO and bevacizumab had been determined for this population. Phase 2 will not proceed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1/2 CTO + Bevacizumab for Recurrent Glioma Post-Bevacizumab Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Phase 1 of the study, we will conduct a dose-escalation study of the combination of CTO with the standard dosing of bevacizumab among patients with recurrent malignant glioma (WHO Grade III or IV) that have previously failed bevacizumab. All patients will have also received standard treatment with radiation therapy and temozolomide prior to enrollment on study. The Phase 2 portion of this study will investigate two novel treatment regimens sequentially. Each regimen will include 25 patients with recurrent WHO grade IV malignant glioma who have been treated in the past with standard radiation therapy, temozolomide, and bevacizumab. All patients must have failed therapy while on bevacizumab. Subjects in the first treatment regimen will receive CTO alone and subjects in the second treatment regimen will receive the combination of CTO and bevacizumab together. Note: This study was terminated early due to funding issues. At the time of termination, the study was still in Phase 1 and no MTD for the combination of CTO and bevacizumab had been determined for this population. Phase 2 will not proceed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Phase 1 portion: Patients must have recurrent histologically confirmed diagnosis of World Health Organization (WHO) grade III or IV malignant glioma with no more than 3 prior progressions Phase 2 portion: Patients must have recurrent histologically confirmed diagnosis of WHO grade IV malignant glioma (glioblastoma or gliosarcoma) with no more than 3 prior progressions. Must have had a least 1 prior progression on a bevacizumabcontaining regimen Age greater than or equal to 18 years Karnofsky ≥ 70% Bidimensionally measurable disease, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging based on The Revised Assessment in NeuroOncology (RANO) criteria Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1000 cells/µl, Platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/µl (without transfusion within 14 days before enrollment) Adequate renal function as indicated by the following: Serum creatinine &lt; 1.25 times upper limit of normal (ULN) or calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min; Urine dipstick for proteinuria &lt; 2+ unless a 24hour urine protein &lt;1 g of protein is demonstrated Prothrombin time (PT) ≤ 1.5 x ULN and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤ 1.5 x ULN within 14 days prior to first study treatment for patients not receiving anticoagulation. The use of fulldose oral or parenteral anticoagulants is permitted as long as the PT or aPTT is within therapeutic limits (according to the medical standard of the enrolling institution) and the patient has been on a stable dose of anticoagulants for at least two weeks prior to the first study treatment. For patients on corticosteroids, they must be on a stable dose for 7 days prior to anticipated start of study drug, and the dose should not be escalated over entry dose level, if clinically possible Signed informed consent approved by the Institutional Review Board No evidence of &gt; grade 1 active central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage on the baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan Female patients must not be pregnant or breastfeeding. Female patients of childbearing potential (defined as &lt; 2 years after last menstruation or not surgically sterile) must use a highly effective contraceptive method (allowed methods of birth control, [i.e. with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year] are implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, intrauterine device (IUD) (only hormonal), sexual abstinence or vasectomized partner) during the trial and for a period of &gt; 6 months following the last administration of trial drug(s). Female patients with an intact uterus (unless amenorrhea for the last 24 months) must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 48 hours prior to first study treatment. Fertile male patients must agree to use a highly effective contraceptive method (allowed methods of birth control [i.e. with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year] include a female partner using implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, IUDs [only hormonal], sexual abstinence or prior vasectomy) during the trial and for a period of &gt; 6 months following the last administration of trial drugs. Pregnancy or breastfeeding Comedication that may interfere with study results, for example, immunosuppressive agents other than corticosteroids Active infection requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics within 7 days before enrollment Prior, unrelated malignancy requiring current active treatment with the exception of cervical carcinoma in situ and adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin Taking cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inducers and moderate or strong inhibitors (Note: Corticosteroids are allowed, as long as patients have been on a stable dose for 7 days prior to anticipated start of study drug, and the dose should not be escalated over entry dose level, if clinically possible) Less than 12 weeks from radiation therapy, unless progressive disease outside of the radiation field or progression on 2 consecutive scans or histopathologic confirmation Treated with immunotherapeutic agents or vaccines within 4 weeks before enrollment, unless the patient has recovered from the expected toxic effects of such therapy Treated with alkylating agents within 4 weeks before enrollment or treated with daily or metronomic chemotherapy within 1 week before enrollment, unless the patient has recovered from the expected toxic effects of such therapy Prior chemotherapy (nonalkylating agents) within 2 weeks before enrollment, unless the patient has recovered from the expected toxic effects of such therapy Current, recent (within 4 weeks of the first infusion of this study) use of an experimental drug, unless the patient has recovered from the expected toxic effects of study therapy Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) InhibitorSpecific Exclusion Criteria are: Inadequately controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg) within 28 days of first study treatment Prior history of hypertensive crisis, hypertensive encephalopathy, reverse posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) Prior history of gastrointestinal perforation or abscess Clinically significant (active) cardiovascular disease, for example cerebrovascular accidents ≤ 6 months prior to study enrollment, myocardial infarction ≤ 6 months prior to study enrollment, unstable angina, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade 2 or greater congestive heart failure (CHF), or serious cardiac arrhythmia uncontrolled by medication or potentially interfering with protocol treatment History or evidence upon physical/neurological examination of central nervous system disease (for example, seizures) unrelated to cancer unless adequately controlled by medication or potentially interfering with protocol treatment Significant vascular disease (for example, aortic aneurysm requiring surgical repair or recent arterial thrombosis) within 6 months prior to start of study treatment History of pulmonary hemorrhage/hemoptysis ≥ grade 2 (defined as ≥ 2.5 mL bright red blood per episode) within 1 month of first study treatment History or evidence of inherited bleeding diathesis or significant coagulopathy at risk of bleeding (in the absence of therapeutic anticoagulation) Current or recent (within 10 days of study enrollment) use of aspirin (&gt; 325 mg/day), clopidogrel (&gt; 75 mg/day) or equivalent.
