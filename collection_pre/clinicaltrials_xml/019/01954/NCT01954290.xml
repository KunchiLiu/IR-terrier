	<brief_summary>Stroke remains the fourth leading cause of death in the United States (second worldwide) and a leading cause of long-term disability, resulting in total direct and indirect costs of approximately $73.7 billion annually. The failure of novel therapies in clinical trials demonstrates that the complex neural response to stroke must be targeted at multiple levels to improve patient outcomes. Despite significant improvements in stroke treatment and management, 1 year survival rate among stroke patients aged 65 years or more is around 25%, and 5- year survival rate amounts to approximately 50%. The highest chances of death are within 30 days of stroke. Mortality increases due to worsening brain dysfunction, elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), and other comorbid conditions. Treatments aimed at reducing post-stroke cytotoxic edema may reduce the risk for development of malignant stroke and mortality. Current treatments such as osmo-therapy and hemicraniectomy have substantial limitations, and mortality remains high, despite these measures outcomes remain unsatisfactory. There is a great need for alternative medical approaches which are safe, predictable, and help to ameliorate post stroke edema.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Previous work has demonstrated the pathophysiological role of arginine-vasopressin (AVP) in ischemic stroke. The mechanism of action of AVP is by 3 receptor subtypes: V1a, V1b and V2 expressed in brain, pituitary gland, myocardium, vasculature and kidneys. The role of the vasopressin receptors V1a and or V2 subtype in cerebral edema formation after ischemic stroke remains controversial. The V1a receptor antagonism causes platelet inhibition, aquaporin-4 up regulation; reduce infarct size and vasodilation. V1 antagonists has also been shown to prevent ischemia-induced cerebral edema development, suggesting that the V1 vasopressin receptor is important in water regulation in brain cells. Another study indicated that the vasopressin receptor V1 is involved in the pathogenesis of secondary brain damage after focal cerebral ischemia. Recently, few studies have demonstrated that a V2 receptor antagonist (OPC-31260), may be one of the effective drugs for the early treatment of cytotoxic edema and brain injury. Treatment of OPC-31260 ameliorated cerebral neurological deficit in transgenic (GET-1) mice after water intoxication. Treatment of OPC-31260 also significantly abolished water accumulation and down regulated Aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) expression level in GET-1 mice after water intoxication. The intensity of AQP-4 staining was almost comparable with that of the controls without water intoxication. It was also shown that OPC-31260 at doses of 10 to 30 mg/kg produced a dose-dependent inhibition of subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced cerebral edema formation, accompanied by an increase in urinary volume and decrease in urine osmolality without a significant alteration of urine electrolytes. OPC-31260 is also effective in treating water retention diseases, such as hyponatremia caused by inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, congestive heart failure, and liver cirrhosis. V2 receptor antagonism will also help in abolishing water accumulation, decreased Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) in astrocytes and most importantly causes renal tubule-selective diuretic effect called aquaresis (electrolyte sparing diuresis), which may have additional benefit in the reduction of cerebral edema. This combined approach of V1a and V2 AVP receptor antagonism will lead to attenuation of ischemia related cerebral edema and infarct volume by modulating ischemia-evoked AQP-4 expression. This effect should help behavior and mortality which in turn will improve outcome in stroke patients. The purpose of this project is to test the effect of the mixed V1a and V2 receptor blockade on ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke outcome. In summary, the investigators are using the approach of mixed vasopressin antagonism on post stroke edema, infarct volume and outcome. This research will lead to a greater understanding of the roles and interactions of the different AVP receptors and pathophysiology of post stroke cytotoxic edema. New information on the effects of mixed blockade of V1a and V2 receptors on the prevention of cytotoxic edema post stroke will be revealed.</detailed_description>
