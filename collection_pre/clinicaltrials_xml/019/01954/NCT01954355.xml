	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this trial is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of LDE225 given in combination with standard doses of paclitaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors. In addition, the preliminary anti-tumor activity of this combination will be assessed, in particular in ovarian cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LDE225 and Paclitaxel in Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, open label phase I dose-escalation trial of LDE225 administered once daily (OD) with Paclitaxel administered weekly for three weeks (days 1, 8, 15) in 28-day cycles in adult patients with advanced solid tumors that have progressed despite standard therapy. The trial will consist of three parts. In Part A (dose escalation following a standard 3+3 design), patients with previously treated advanced solid tumors will receive escalating doses of LDE225 in combination with standard Paclitaxel doses, to define the MTD and the RP2D of LED225 OD that can be given in combination with standard doses of Paclitaxel. Once the MTD and RP2D is established in 6 patients, then part B will start. Part B and C are expansion cohorts in patients with advanced platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (6 patients each) to further evaluate the safety of the combination and to assess for any preliminary antitumor activity. In Part B, any prior taxane therapy must have been administered on a 3-week schedule. In Part C, prior taxane therapy must have been administered on weekly schedule and has to be followed by a wash-out period of at least 6 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient must give written informed consent before registration. For Part A: Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced solid tumors that have progressed despite standard therapy. No more than two prior lines of chemotherapy for advanced disease. For Part B: Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced ovarian cancer. Prior chemotherapy must have contained a platinum and a taxane at some point. Any prior taxane therapy must have been administered on a 3week schedule. A maximum of 2 prior chemotherapy lines for advanced disease will be permitted. Patients must be refractory (PD during chemotherapy) or resistant (PD within 6 months of completing chemotherapy) to their last platinumcontaining chemotherapy regimen. For Part C: Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced ovarian cancer. Prior chemotherapy must have contained a platinum and a taxane at some point. Prior taxane therapy must have been administered on weekly schedule and must be followed by a washout period of at least 6 months. A maximum of 2 prior chemotherapy lines for advanced disease will be permitted. Patients must be refractory (PD during chemotherapy) or resistant (PD within 6 months of completing chemotherapy) to their last platinumcontaining chemotherapy regimen. For Parts B and C, patients must have measurable disease according to RECIST v1.1 Radiological evaluations to be performed within 4 weeks before registration.
