	<brief_summary>A study of ACT-462206 to evaluate the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic of ascending single doses of ACT-462206, a novel dual orexin receptor antagonist in healthy male subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single-ascending Dose Study to Investigate the Tolerability, Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of ACT-462206</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each dose level will be investigated in a new group of eight healthy male subjects (six on active drug and two on placebo). Each subject will participate in one treatment period, with the exception of subjects in the crossover part (i.e., almorexant reference group at the fourth dose level), who will participate in two treatment periods. At this dose level subjects on active drug (six) will receive in one treatment period ACT-462206 and in the other 400 mg of almorexant; subjects on placebo (two) will receive the corresponding placebos (double-dummy).</detailed_description>
