	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of GSK Biologicals' HZ/su vaccine when its first dose is co-administered with the FLU-D-QIV vaccine in adults aged 50 years or older compared to administration of vaccines separately.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol (e.g. completion of the diary cards, return for followup visits). A male or female aged 50 years or older, at the time of the first vaccination with the study vaccine(s). Written informed consent obtained from the subject. Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential may be enrolled in the study. Nonchildbearing potential is defined as premenarche, current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or postmenopause. Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject: has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccines within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 consecutive days) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose (for corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day, or equivalent). A prednisone dose of &lt; 20 mg/day is allowed. Inhaled, topical and intraarticular corticosteroids are allowed. Administration or planned administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within the period starting 30 days before the first dose of study vaccine(s) (HZ/su and/or FLUDQIV vaccines) and ending 30 days after the last dose of HZ/su vaccine. Administration of an influenza vaccine during the six months preceding entry into the study or planned administration up to the last blood sampling with the exception of the FLUDQIV vaccine given during this study. Administration of longacting immunemodifying drugs (e.g. infliximab) within six months prior to the first vaccine dose or expected administration at any time during the study period. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational vaccine/product (pharmaceutical product or device). Previous vaccination against VZV or HZ and/or planned administration during the study of a VZV or HZ vaccine (including an investigational or nonregistered vaccine) other than the study vaccine. History of HZ. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition resulting from disease (e.g., malignancy, HIV infection) or immunosuppressive/cytotoxic therapy (e.g., medications used during cancer chemotherapy, organ transplantation or to treat autoimmune disorders). History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccines. History of Guillain Barré syndrome. Hypersensitivity to latex. Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment. Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C /99.5°F for oral, axillary or tympanic route, or ≥ 38.0°C /100.4°F on rectal route. The preferred route for recording temperature in this study will be oral. Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever may, be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period. Pregnant or lactating female. Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions before 2 months after the last dose of study vaccine. Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from participating in the study. Any condition which, in the judgment of the investigator would make intramuscular injection unsafe.</criteria>
