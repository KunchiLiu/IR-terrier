	<brief_summary>This study aims to demonstrate the histological differences in the connective tissue surrounding laser-treated abutments and untreated abutments in humans. Working hypothesis: There are differences in the adhesion of collagen fibres around implant abutments with laser-produced microgrooves and standard abutments.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patients will receive both abutment systems. The assignment of the abutments to each of the implants will be made randomly using SPSS 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Il, United States) software.</detailed_description>
