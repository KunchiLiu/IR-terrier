	<brief_summary>This study investigates the efficacy of a proprietary probiotic formulation comprising 6 strains of bacteria in reducing inflammation and gingivitis in pediatric patients between 11 and 18 years old undergoing orthodontics treatment. Patients will be recruited based on a prior diagnosis of mild to moderate gingivitis by gingival index score. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either the probiotic treatment or a placebo, both in the form of a dissolving lozenge; for which the placebo is exactly the same shape, texture, taste, and composition as the probiotic treatment, but does not contain the active probiotic ingredients. The lozenges are to be taken orally at a certain prescribed regimen for 28 days. Participants will be assessed for gingivitis scores, gum bleeding scores, plaque scores, overall periodontal health, and for precarious areas at baseline, 14, and 28 days. They will also be assessed for the same measures at day 56, following a 28-day wash-out phase. Plaque and saliva samples will be collected at all timepoints for in vitro analyses of changes in microbial pathogens and/or inflammatory cytokines.</brief_summary>
