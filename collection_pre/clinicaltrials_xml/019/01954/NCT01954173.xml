	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well modern, conformal radiation therapy after surgery works in treating patients with high-risk bladder cancer. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjuvant Radiation for High Risk Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the feasibility of adjuvant radiation in the management of high-risk disease. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Prospectively evaluate patterns of failure in high-risk bladder cancer patients after cystectomy and aggressive adjuvant therapy. II. Define surgical and histopathologic parameters predictive of local and distant outcomes (e.g. grade, lymphovascular space invasion [LVSI], extent of resection/lymph node dissection [LND]). III. Assess quality of life (QoL) outcomes after this treatment using a standardized questionnaires (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General [FACT-G], FACT-Bladder Cancer [BL], Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite [EPIC] Bowel and Urinary). OUTLINE: Within 24 weeks of surgical resection, patients undergo 3D conformal radiation therapy once daily 5 days per week for 28 fractions. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3-5 years, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pathologic diagnosis of urothelial or squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder Patients must have undergone cystectomy (total cystectomy, radical cystectomy +/ pelvic lymph node dissection) with no evidence of macroscopic residual disease Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)/Zubrod performance status of 02 Patients treated with simple cystectomy with macroscopically negative margins are eligible for this study Clinical Tstage (prior to systemic therapy, if applicable) ≥ T3a and/or positive lymph nodes by transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/computed tomography (CT)/positron emission tomography (PET)CT or pathologic Tstage ≥ T3a and/or positive lymph nodes Patients with metastatic disease outside of the pelvis Prior invasive malignancy (except nonmelanomatous skin cancer) unless disease free for a minimum of 3 years Prior radiation therapy to the pelvis Patients with active inflammatory bowel disease Severe acute comorbidity, defined as follows: Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization in the last 3 months Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of registration Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy at the time of registration Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) based upon current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition; note, however, that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing is not required for entry into this protocol; the need to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the treatment involved in this protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive; protocolspecific requirements may also exclude immunocompromised patients</criteria>
