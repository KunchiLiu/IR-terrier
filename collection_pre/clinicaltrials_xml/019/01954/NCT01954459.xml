	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the effect of wearing a small warming patch, the InsuPatch, at the site of the continuous glucose monitor (CGM), also called a sensor. Specifically, we will be looking to see if using the InsuPatch (IP) improves the accuracy of the continuous glucose monitor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Warming up to Sensors: Does Site Warming Improve Continuous Glucose Monitor Performance?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypotheses: 1. Warming of the skin and subcutaneous tissue with the InsuPatch device will improve the accuracy of a CGM as compared to a CGM used alone when both are calibrated with a standard laboratory quality glucose measuring reference standard. 2. Warming of the skin and subcutaneous tissue with the InsuPatch device will reduce the lag time of the CGM, as compared to a CGM used alone when both are calibrated with a standard laboratory quality glucose measuring reference standard. 3. The combination of the InsuPatch device and a CGM will be well-tolerated and not cause skin irritation.</detailed_description>

The presence of any of the following diseases: a. Current use of systemic corticosteroids (within the last week) b. Other major illness that in the judgment of the investigator might interfere with the completion of the protocol i. Adequately treated thyroid disease and celiac disease do not exclude subjects from enrollment 3. Inpatient psychiatric treatment in the past 6 months for either the subject or the subject's primary care giver (i.e., parent or guardian) 4. Current or past use of a continuous glucose sensor is not an exclusion criterion. 5. Active skin condition that would affect sensor placement 6.
