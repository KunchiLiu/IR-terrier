	<brief_summary>Study Part I is a single-ascending dose study. Healthy male subjects to be included in the study and randomized in 6 dose groups, Groups A-F (8 subjects per group). Of the 8 subjects per group, 6 subjects receive the investigational drug and 2 subjects receive matching placebo. Study Part II is a 3-period, crossover, single dose study. Nine healthy male subjects to be enrolled in one group (Group G). Each subject to receive 2 different formulations of the prodrug and one formulation of the active drug in a randomized sequence.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single-ascending Oral Dose Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of ACT-281959 / ACT-246475 in Healthy Male Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Part I is a prospective, single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-ascending dose, Phase 1 study. Approximately 48 healthy male subjects to be included in the study and randomized in 6 dose groups, Groups A-F (8 subjects per group). Of the 8 subjects per group, 6 subjects are to receive the investigational drug and 2 subjects to receive matching placebo. Study Part II is a prospective, single-center, open-label, randomized, 3-period, crossover, single dose, Phase 1 study. Nine healthy male subjects to be enrolled in one group, Group G. Each subject to receive 2 different formulations of the prodrug and one formulation of the active drug in a randomized sequence.</detailed_description>

Ability to communicate well with the investigator in the local language, and to understand and comply with the requirements of the study. Known allergic reactions or hypersensitivity to any excipient of the drug formulation(s).

Previous history of fainting, collapse, orthostatic hypotension, or vasovagal reactions. Family or personal history of bleeding (e.g., stroke, major trauma, or surgical intervention), or bleeding disorders (e.g., thrombocytopenia, clotting disturbances, intracranial vascular diseases, peptic ulcers), or reasonable suspicion of vascular malformations. Platelet count ˂ 120x10^9/L at screening. Veins unsuitable for intravenous puncture on either arm (e.g., veins that were difficult to locate, access, or puncture, veins with a tendency to rupture during or after puncture). Treatment with another investigational drug within 3 months prior to screening or participation in more than four investigational drug studies within 1 year prior to screening.

Previous treatment with any prescribed or overthecounter medications (including herbal medicines such as St. Johnʼs Wort) especially acetyl salicylic acid, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory, or any anticoagulant medication (e.g., heparin, warfarin), within 2 weeks prior to (the first) administration of study drug. Loss of 250 mL or more of blood within 3 months prior to screening. Positive results from the hepatitis serology, except for vaccinated subjects or subjects with past but resolved hepatitis, at screening. Positive results from the human immunodeficiency virus serology at screening.
