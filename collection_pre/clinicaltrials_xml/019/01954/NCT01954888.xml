	<brief_summary>The first purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the stellate ganglion block realized with two different approaches (blind and ultrasound-guided) in patients with a diagnosis of complex regional pain syndrome. The second purpose of this study is to determine the safest approach and to compare the safety profiles of the two approaches.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of the Ultrasound-guided Approach on the Efficiency and Safety of the Stellate Ganglion Block in Chronic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate whether the ultrasound guided approach is more effective than the blind technique in producing a greater than 1.5 degree Celsius rise in ipsilateral arm temperature after a stellate ganglion block. Blocks will both be performed with 10 mL of xylocaine/bupivacaine. Secondary outcomes will be the impact of the approach (blind vs ultrasound) on pain reduction, horner syndrome, side effects (hoarseness, dysphagia, pharyngeal discomfort) and complications (blood aspiration, intravascular injection).</detailed_description>
