	<brief_summary>The main aim of this study is to test a new, non-medication computer-based potential treatment for bipolar disorder in children and adolescents. In the study, children and adolescents with bipolar disorder will come to our lab at Bradley Hospital 2-times per week for 8-weeks to "play" a custom computer "game" designed to retrain the brain--to build a skill that my work has shown is impaired in children/adolescents with bipolar disorder. Before and after this 8-week trial, children will have a special magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. This is a test of feasibility--meaning we want to see if the 8-week trial results in brain changes. If it does, we will conduct a second study to see if it improves how bipolar children function--i.e., if it helps their illness.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Retrain Your Brain in Children/Adolescents With Bipolar Disorder: A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prior studies have shown that "computer assisted cognitive remediation"--meaning using computer "games" to build up a skill that has been shown to be impaired in a specific disorder--can result in improvement in psychiatric illnesses--including schizophrenia. This will be the first National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)-funded study to use this "retrain your brain" approach in children and adolescents with bipolar disorder. During this study, we are seeking 40 children and adolescents with bipolar disorder to: - come to our lab at Bradley Hospital in East Providence R.I. twice per week (each lasting 1 hour) to "play" a special computer game for a total of 8 weeks - to have a special MRI before and after this 8-week trial to see if our "game" improves brain activity - it does NOT matter if your child is already on medications--they can continue during this study - all children/adolescents with bipolar disorder are welcome--as long as they do NOT have implanted metal (no braces, no cochlear implants, etc) because of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) safety. This is a test of feasibility--meaning we want to see if the 8-week trial results in brain changes. If it does, we will conduct a second study to see if it improves how bipolar children function--i.e., if it helps their illness.</detailed_description>
