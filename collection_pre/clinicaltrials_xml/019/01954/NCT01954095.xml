	<brief_title>The Impact of Vaginal and IM Progestins on the Cervix</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17-OHPC) has recently been shown to reduce the rate of recurrent preterm birth while intravaginal progesterone has been shown to reduce the rate of preterm birth in women with short cervix. While these interventions have reduced the rate of preterm birth, the mechanisms of action of these medications are unknown. The objective of this study is to collect and analyze blood and cervicovaginal fluids from pregnant women receiving these medications or other interventions such as cerclage, pessary, NSAIDs, and combinations thereof. The goal of the analyses is to assess the impact of these interventions on the cervical proteome, cervical cytokines and cervical structure and to identify potential biomarkers of response and non-response thus providing insights into the mechanisms of action of these drugs.</detailed_description>
