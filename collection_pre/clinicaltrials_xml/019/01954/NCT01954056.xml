	<brief_summary>This trial will evaluate the effects of a 7-day course of hydrocortisone therapy on short-term morbidity, cardiovascular function, long-term neurodevelopment, and mortality in critically ill, term and late preterm infants diagnosed with cardiovascular insufficiency as defined by a need for inotrope therapy in the first 72 hours of age.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hydrocortisone for Term Hypotension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular insufficiency is common and potentially life-threatening in critically ill term and late preterm newborns admitted to the newborn intensive care unit (NICU) in the first few days of age. This study proposes to conduct a multicenter, randomized, masked, placebo-controlled trial within the Neonatal Research Network (NRN). This trial will evaluate the effects of a 7-day course of hydrocortisone therapy on short-term morbidity, cardiovascular function, long-term neurodevelopment, and mortality in critically ill, term and late preterm infants diagnosed with cardiovascular insufficiency as defined by a need for inotrope therapy in the first 72 hours of age.</detailed_description>
