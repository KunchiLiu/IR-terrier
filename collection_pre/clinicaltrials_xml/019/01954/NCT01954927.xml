	<brief_summary>This is a phase II double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating the effect of gabapentin when added to standard pain management for patients with sickle cell disease experiencing acute pain crisis in the ambulatory care setting. Sickle cell pain is different for every patient. Some patients get complete relief from routine pain medicines, and others need more time or more doses of pain medicines before the pain goes away completely. It is known that humans have many types of pain, including something called neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain in other conditions (such as diabetes) has been treated successfully with a medicine called gabapentin. The investigators in this study suspect that some sickle cell pain is a combination of pain types. They would like to see if adding gabapentin to the usual pain medicines makes pain go away faster or more completely. Primary Objective: - To assess the analgesic efficacy of gabapentin vs. placebo for pain during vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) in participants with sickle cell disease (SCD). A response to study drug will be defined by a decrease in pain score of ≥ 33% between presentation to the acute care setting and assessment at 3 hours post administration of study drug. Secondary Objective: - To compare the total morphine equivalent dose (mg/kg) used to control pain during VOC between presentation to the acute care setting and assessment at 3 hours post administration of study drug in the gabapentin vs. placebo groups.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Upon participant enrollment, study staff will randomize the participant to one of 2 possible treatment arms: a single dose of gabapentin or a single dose of placebo. Morphine or other opioid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs will be available to both groups as needed for pain and will be administered according to the current standard of care for pain in VOC from the Department of Hematology at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH). Randomization will be performed in the SJCRH pharmacy by a pharmacist. The randomization will be stratified by three age categories (1-3 years of age, 4-6 years, and 7 years or older) for which distinct pain assessment tools are applied and for 2 pain score categories at assessment at presentation (4-6 and 7-10, respectively). A block randomization with block sizes varying randomly between 4 and 6 will be used in each stratum. Pain scores will be obtained at presentation to the acute care setting and 3 hours (± 15 minutes) post administration of study drug. Participants who were discharged will be contacted by study staff between 24 and 72 hours following administration of study drug to see if there have been any side effects. Patients who were admitted after administration of the study drug will be monitored through hospital record to determine if any unexpected events occurred. After this follow up, participation in the study is complete.</detailed_description>
