	<brief_title>The ERA Test as a Diagnostic Guide for Personalized Embryo Transfer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project seeks to investigate differences in implantation (IR), pregnancy (PR), ongoing pregnancy (OP) rates and delivery among women undergoing transfer at the blastocyst stage in their first IVF/ICSI cycle comparing the normal practice of same-cycle embryo transfer in a fresh cycle (ET) versus deferred embryo transfer (DET) versus personalized embryo transfer (pET) after endometrial receptivity analysis (ERA). A total of 546 infertile women under 38 years old undergoing her first IVF/ICSI cycle with elective blastocyst transfer are randomized in this prospective, multicenter, open label and controlled trial. Patients are allocated through computer-generated randomization into one of the three groups: Fresh embryo transfer (ET), Deferred embryo transfer (DET) or personalized embryo transfer (pET) after identification of the personalized window of implantation using the ERA test.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Patients indicated to undergo a cycle of IVF/ICSI with their own oocytes. 2. Age ≤ 37 years 3. BMI: 18.5 to 30 4. Normal ovarian reserve (AFC ≥ 8; FSH &lt; 8) 5. The most appropriate stimulation protocol will be decided by their doctor. 6. Blastocyst transfer (on day 5 or 6) 7. Blastocyst vitrification with open protocols (Cryotop, Cryoleaf, or Cryolock) or closed protocols (Cryotip or CBSStraw.) 8. Any pathology affecting the endometrial cavity such as polyps/submucosal myomas, intramural myomas &gt; 4 cm, or hydrosalpinx affecting the endometrial cavity must be previously operated. 1. Patients with repeated miscarriages (&gt; 2 previous biochemical pregnancies or &gt; 2 spontaneous miscarriages) 2. Patients with a severe male factor (spermatozoa &lt; 2 million/ml) 3. Patients with implantation failure (&gt;3 failed cycles with good quality embryos)</criteria>
