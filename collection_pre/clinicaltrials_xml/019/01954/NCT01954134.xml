	<brief_summary>In clinical practise patients with negative radioiodine scan with positive tyhroglobulin is considered as radioiodine resistant or in another words in the process of dedifferentiation. The aim of the present study was to search a simple blood test that could lead to early identification of patients with dedifferentiation. In this respect, we investigate whether the serum level of anti-p53 antibody has the diagnostic value in the follow-up of patients with high levels of thyroglobulin (tg) and negative I-131 scan.</brief_summary>
