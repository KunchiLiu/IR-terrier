	<brief_summary>Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a common way to assess glycemic control in diabetes management. Multiple times of blood glucose measurements by fingerstick in the same day are of tough challenge to it. The changes and variations of glucose excursion in senior diabetics with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)involve a safety issue besides glycated hemoglobin (GHb) value. The goal of this study is to explore modified SMBG protocols for precisely monitoring and predicting glycemic excursion, variability in senior type 2 diabetics with CAD.</brief_summary>
