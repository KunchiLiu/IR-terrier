	<brief_title>Biomarkers and Perfusion - Training-Induced Changes After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This biomarker-driven study uses an observational design to examine a subgroup of patients in the randomized, controlled trial "Physical Fitness Training in Subacute Stroke" (PHYS-STROKE). In PHYS-STROKE, 215 patients with subacute stroke (hemorrhagic and ischemic) receive either 4-weeks of physical training (aerobic training, 5 times a week, for 50 minutes) or 4-weeks of relaxation sessions (5 times a week, for 50 minutes). A convenience sample of 100 of these patients with ischemic stroke will be included in BAPTISe and will receive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and blood tests before and after the PHYS-STROKE intervention. Imaging scans will address parameters of cerebral perfusion and vessel size imaging. Blood tests will determine several parameters such as immunity, inflammation (including neopterin, MMP-9), metabolism (including ApoCIII, oxidized LDL, HOMA-index, uric acid, CK-MB, cystatin c, and leptin), cytokines (osteopontin, adiponectin), and endothelial function (SDF1-alpha, ADMA, sICAM, sVCAM, E-selectin, P-selectin). Additionally, we will assess the association between functional outcomes (co-primary outcome measures of PHYS-STROKE) and biomarkers including imaging results.</detailed_description>
