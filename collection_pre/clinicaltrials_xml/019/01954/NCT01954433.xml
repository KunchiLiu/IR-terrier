	<brief_summary>This study compares costs and effectiveness / utility of three common orthopedic surgeries in shoulder and hand from the perspective of the Swiss health system and the clinic. The cost of health care is continuously rising, making economic considerations part of the decision process, in particular for the allocation of available resources. However, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility studies of interventions in the upper extremities are rare. The purpose of this study is to gain more information and to provide a basis for the decision process.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Costs and Consequences of Three Common Orthopedic Procedures on the Upper Extremity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among various recognized methods used to assess the benefits and value of medical services, cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and cost-utility analysis (CUA) are taking an increasingly important role. Over recent years, economic evaluations gained interest in orthopedics, suggesting the inclusion of economic factors in addition to traditional outcome measures in the evaluation of surgical interventions. This is a prospective mono-center observational study involving three independent patient groups (Total shoulder prosthesis for arthritis (TSA), Arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff tears (RCR), Trapeziectomy for Trapeziometacarpal Osteoarthritis (TMC OA)) of 150 patients each. Before-and-after comparisons will be made: Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility data collected post-operatively up to one (TMC OA) and two years (TSA and RCR) will be compared with those collected up to one year pre-operatively. Eligible patients unwilling to receive surgery will be followed-up for one and two years, respectively, to allow for a parallel comparison group.</detailed_description>
