	<criteria>1. Neonates with birth weights between 2000500g for Part A and 1500500g for Part B 2. Ability to start treatment within four days after birth. 3. Gestational age between 23 and 32 weeks at birth 4. Obtaining of informed consent from the subject's mother after full understanding of the study purpose and procedures. 5. Parents who agree to allow the Principal Investigator and his/her staff to follow the procedures and assessments required by the protocol 1. Infants with, or at high probability for, early onset sepsis (positive blood cultures or with clinical/histological chorioamnionitis with the expectation of empirical antimicrobial therapy for â‰¥5 days) 2. Infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) 3. Congenital or chromosomal anomalies 4. Congenital or acquired gastrointestinal pathology that preclude feeds soon after birth (e.g. cleft lip is not an exclusion criterion, but a duodenal atresia is) 5. Infants in extremis to whom no further intensive care is offered by attending neonatologist (e.g., infant being provided only hospice/comfort care) 6. Other conditions of the infant which, in the opinion of the attending neonatologist, preclude participation 7. Positive maternal HIV status 8. Participation in another interventional clinical trial For Part A of the study, the following additional exclusion criterion will apply: 9. Small for gestational age neonates, i.e. neonates that weigh less that the 10th percentile for their gestational age according to the Estimated Fetal Weight Percentile Chart</criteria>
