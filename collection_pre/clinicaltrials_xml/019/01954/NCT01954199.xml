	<brief_title>The Effectiveness of Neurodynamic Techniques in Patients With Nerve-Related Leg Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nerve-related leg pain (NRLP) although less prevalent than low back pain itself, is associated with higher economic and social burden, and has been considered a predictor of chronicity and disability among subjects with low back pain. Numerous approaches are proposed for its management; however, evidence regarding the best therapeutic approach is lacking. Neurodynamic techniques are proposed to be effective to manage NRLP. Thus, this study aims to verify, through a randomized controlled trial, the effectiveness of a two-week program of neurodynamic techniques on pain and disability in individuals with NRLP.</detailed_description>
