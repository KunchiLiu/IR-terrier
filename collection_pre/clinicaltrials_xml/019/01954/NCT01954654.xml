	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Accelerated Intervention With Compression Sleeve in Mild and Moderate Breast Cancer-related Lymphedema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Use of a custom-made compression sleeve is an initial treatment of mild and moderate arm lymphedema secondary to primary breast cancer treatment. The compression sleeve improves the flow of lymph fluid out of the arm, reduces the swelling, and prevents progression of the lymphedema in the future. Early intervention is recommended though early is not well-defined in literature. The purpose of this study is to evaluate reduction of excess limb volume and changes in arm disability and clinical symptoms in accelerated treatment with compression sleeve compared to standard treatment.</detailed_description>
