	<brief_title>When and How to Administer Oxytocin for Active Management of Third Stage of Labour</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our objective is to determine the most efficient route and timing of oxytocin administration by measuring the duration of third stage of labour, quantitative blood during the first hour after delivery and comparing haemoglobin and haematocrit changes and the need for additional interventions in patients who had either a spontaneous labour or received labour augmentation with oxytocin.</detailed_description>
