	<brief_summary>This study aims to characterize Usher patients in order to correlate this data with genetic information. Tasks: - Standardization and improvement of Usher syndrome diagnosis: refine and elaborate special tests of visual and otological function in association with genotype that enable to determine the most significant markers for Usher disease progression and therapeutic effect. - Perform genotype and phenotype correlations in Usher syndrome patients - Develop and maintain database for phenotypically and genotypically well-characterized patient cohorts, suitable for future therapeutic trials</brief_summary>
