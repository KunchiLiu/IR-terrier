	<brief_summary>Succinylcholine is commonly used for neuromuscular relaxation for short procedures such as rigid bronchoscopy. A more modern alternative is the application of low-dose rocuronium, reversed by low-dose sugammadex. The investigators compare the intubating conditions, incidence of postoperative myalgia (POM), as well as patient satisfaction for these two muscle relaxants.</brief_summary>
