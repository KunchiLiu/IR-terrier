	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to compare the red blood cell (RBC) and plasma concentrations of folate in subjects treated with drospirenone (DRSP)/ethinyl estradiol (EE) plus levomefolate calcium (L-5-MTHF) at 24 weeks with respect to basal determination. Increased intake of folic acid (synthetic form of the naturally occurring B-vitamin) before and in the first few weeks of pregnancy has been shown to reduce certain types of birth defects. This is important for women who may become pregnant following discontinuation of oral contraception. Information about any side effects that may occur will also be collected.</brief_summary>
