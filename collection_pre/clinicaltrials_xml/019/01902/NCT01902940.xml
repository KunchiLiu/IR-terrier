	<brief_summary>So far, only limited data is available regarding the natural course in Congenital Cataract Facial Dysmorphism Neuropathy Syndrome (CCFDN) and sporadic and hereditary inclusion body myopathies (IBM). Several criteria and outcome measures have led to contradicting results. The investigators want to retrospectively assess the natural course of the disease in CCFDN and IBM patients according to the data recorded during clinical routine visits.</brief_summary>
