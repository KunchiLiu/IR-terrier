	<brief_summary>Traumatic injury in rural America is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, and the challenges of a rural trauma system can put patients at unique risk. Prolonged transport times to a trauma center, stopping for care at referring hospitals, and longer exposure to care-associated factors distinguish rural patients from their urban counterparts. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a significant risk in rural patients, increasing hospital stay, healthcare costs, and even mortality in the critically injured. The investigators propose a pilot study to test the hypothesis that a single dose of oral chlorhexidine gluconate (antiseptic) for trauma patients in the prehospital environment will decrease subsequent development of early VAP. Chlorhexidine is currently a standard therapy in intensive care units to prevent airway colonization and subsequent development of VAP. Demonstrating safety and effectiveness of prehospital infection control practices could significantly improve outcomes of traumatic injury in rural America.</brief_summary>
