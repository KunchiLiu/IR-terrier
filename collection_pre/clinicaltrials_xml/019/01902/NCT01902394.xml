	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if substituting whole grains for refined grains in the diets of healthy adults over a period of 6 weeks alters the composition of the bacteria in the gut, and has beneficial effects on immune function, digestive health, cardiovascular health, regulation of body weight and composition, and vitamin K status. The investigators hypothesize that whole grain consumption over a period of 6 weeks will alter the gut microflora toward a more beneficial bacterial profile, improve the immune response while reducing oxidative stress and inflammatory markers, have favorable effects on factors influencing the regulation of body weight and composition,increase bacterial vitamin K synthesis, and beneficially effect surrogate markers of cholesterol synthesis/absorption, vitamin D concentrations, and whole genome DNA methylation patterns. In statin users it is hypothesized that, consumption of whole grains will alter statin pharmacokinetics by decreasing rate of statin absorption, resulting in more sustained plasma concentrations.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized parallel-arm trial using a six-week dietary intervention following a 2 week run-in period. Healthy volunteers will be randomized to two groups (n=40/group), and consume either a diet rich in whole grains or a diet rich in refined grains provided at estimated energy requirements for 6 weeks. Outcomes will be measured during the run-in period and at week 6 of the intervention. To control for variation in microbiota an additional 10 volunteers will serve as "negative controls" and not undergo any diet intervention.</detailed_description>

Food allergies or aversions or other issues with foods that would preclude use of study diets, including gluten, milk, nuts, or eggs. Individuals identified during screening as having barriers expected to deter compliance with dietary requirements (e.g., stated dislike of study foods, inadequate resources to store and reheat meals, inability to adhere to food pickup schedule). Alcohol consumption &gt;2 drinks per day. Not willing to abstain from alcohol consumption during the study. Smoking or using nicotine containing products in the last 6 months.
