	<brief_title>Added Value of Local Clonidine for Spine Postoperative Pain Control, in Addition to Bupivacaine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients candidates to posterior spine surgery (Micro-discectomy, Lumbar laminectomy with or without fusion, cervical laminectomy) are asked to participate to this prospective study. After verification of inclusion and exclusion criteria, patients consenting to enter the study are randomly assigned to one of the following subgroups: 1-Pre-incisional wound infiltration with 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.25%. 2- Pre-incisional wound infiltration with 150 Î¼g of clonidine with 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.25%. Demographic parameters, co-morbidities and other pre and per operative medical data are noted. In the post-operative period, patients received a standardized post-operative analgesic protocol (NSAI and paracetamol). Patients are asked to fill their pain diary using Visual Analog Scale (VAS) from day 0 till day 8 after surgery. Morphine rescue consumption is noted. Finally, the percentage of global subjective patient satisfaction regarding the post-operative wound pain is noted from 0 to 100.</detailed_description>
