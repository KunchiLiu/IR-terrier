	<brief_summary>Research Protocol Abstract: This is a phase II controlled trial (RCT) of a "storytelling" intervention compared to no treatment among surrogates who have participated in a decision to limit life-sustaining treatment in the ICU for an incapacitated loved one. Subjects will be sequentially assigned to "storytelling" (a facilitated elicitation of the experience 2-4 weeks after bereavement) or no treatment with follow up "monitoring of well-being". Subjects will receive print bereavement brochures at 1 week, and undergo telephone symptom assessment at 2-weeks, 3-months, and 6-months after bereavement.</brief_summary>
