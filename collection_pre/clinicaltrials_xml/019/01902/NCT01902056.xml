	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effect on soft tissue thickness of placing either a single or double layer of acellular dermal matrix simultaneous with dental implant placement. The hypothesis is that 2 layers of acellular dermal matrix will produce thicker tissues that one layer.</brief_summary>
