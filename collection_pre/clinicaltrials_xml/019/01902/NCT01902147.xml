	<brief_summary>Recovery following general anesthesia and surgery is a complex issue confounded by the type of surgery, surgical care, inflammation, different anesthetic drugs and techniques, patient co-morbidities, and differing patient and clinician perceptions of what constitutes good recovery. In this observational study, quality of recovery and patient satisfaction will be measured using the Postoperative Quality Recovery Scale (PQRS). This tool includes six domains of recovery: physiological, nociceptive (pain and nausea), emotive (anxiety and depression), functional recovery (return of activities of daily living), self-assessed recovery, and cognitive recovery.</brief_summary>
