Patients not having any exclusion criteria will undergo bone marrow examination and liver biopsy at the baseline. 60 patients of decompensated cirrhosis will be randomised into two limbs- limb A (30 patients) will receive G-CSF and erythropoietin while those on limb B (30 patients) will receive G-CSF alone. The drugs will be given for 2 months and patient will be followed for 1 year. G-CSF will be given at a dose of 5 Âµg/kg s/c at days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and then every 3rd day till day 60 (total 22 doses).
