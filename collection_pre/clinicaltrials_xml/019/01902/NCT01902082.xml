	<brief_summary>Currently, there is no proven effective pharmacologic treatment available for patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to be effective in treating several inflammatory diseases. The main purpose of this study is to assess the safety of allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells in patients with ARDS.</brief_summary>
