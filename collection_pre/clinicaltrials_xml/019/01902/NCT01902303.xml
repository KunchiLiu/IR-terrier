	<brief_title>Evaluation of Cold Sore Treatments on Ultra Violet (UV) Induced Cold Sores</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a multi-center, randomized, evaluator and subject-blind, placebo controlled study design The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of the test articles to block the development of a cold sore lesion from progressing beyond the prodromal stage following a UV-induced process. The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was to determine if a recurrent oral herpes episode initiated with prodromal symptoms was aborted before progressing to a lesion (vesicle) via assessing lesion stages by a trained evaluator. The secondary efficacy endpoints included: a) subject self-assessments and b) test article weights and diaries to track treatment compliance.</detailed_description>
