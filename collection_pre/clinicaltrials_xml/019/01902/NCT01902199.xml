	<brief_summary>A randomized control trial evaluating a novel smoking cessation intervention in individuals at a an inpatient clinic for clients with addiction and concurrent disorders. The intervention is based on cognitive bias modification, where participants are explicitly or implicitly trained to make avoidance movements by pushing a joystick in response to pictures of smoking, and as a result altering their cognitive biases towards smoking and tobacco dependence. Hypothesis: Participation in the experimental (tobacco-avoidance) condition will induce reduction of smoking, assessed as lower levels of carbon monoxide measured at baseline and 12 week follow-up.</brief_summary>
