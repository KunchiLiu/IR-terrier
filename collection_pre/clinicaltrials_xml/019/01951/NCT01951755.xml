	<criteria>Histological or cytological documented diagnosis diagnosis of inoperable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic (Stage IIIB or IV) NSCLC. Patients must have evidence of disease but measurable disease is not mandatory. 18 years of age or older. ECOG Performance Status of 02. Life expectancy at least 12 weeks. Patients with advanced stage IIIB/ IV NSCLC who have received at least one course of standard systemic chemotherapy or radiation therapy or who are in the investigator's opinion not medically suitable for chemotherapy or radiotherapy. No more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens are permissible. Patients must have recovered from any toxic effects and at least 34 weeks must have elapsed from the last dose and prior to registration (14 days for vinorelbine or other vinca alkaloids or gemcitabine). Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, have fully recovered from surgery in less than 4 weeks may also be considered for the study. Patients must have recovered (CTC ≤ 1) from acute toxicities of any previous therapy. Granulocyte count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L and platelet count &gt; 100 x 109/L. Serum bilirubin must be ≤ 1.5 upper limit of normal (ULN). AST and/or ALT ≤ 2 x ULN (or ≤ 5 x ULN if clearly attributable to liver metastasis. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 ULN or creatinine clearance ≥ 60 ml/min. Able to comply with study and followup procedures. For all females of childbearing potential a negative pregnancy test must be obtained within 72 hours before starting therapy. Patients with reproductive potential must use effective contraception. Written (signed) Informed Consent to participate in the study. Any unstable systemic disease (including active infection, grade 4 hypertension, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, hepatic, renal or metabolic disease). Prior therapy with systemic antitumour therapy with HER1/EGFR inhibitors (as small molecule or monoclonal antibody therapy). Any other malignancies within 5 years (except for adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix or basal or squamous cell skin cancer). Patients are excluded if they have brain metastasis or spinal cord compression that is newly diagnosed and/ or has not yet been definitively treated with surgery and/ or radiation; previously diagnosed and treated CNS metastases or spinal cord compression with evidence of stable disease (clinically stable imaging) for at least 2 months is permitted. Any significant ophthalmologic abnormality, especially severe dry eye syndrome, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, Sjogren syndrome, severe exposure keratitis or any other disorder likely to increase the risk of corneal epithelial lesions. The use of contact lenses is not recommended during the study. The decision to continue to wear contact lenses should be discussed with the patient's treating Oncologist and the ophthalmologist. Patients who cannot take oral medication, who require intravenous alimentation, have had prior surgical procedures affecting absorption, or have active peptic ulcer disease.
