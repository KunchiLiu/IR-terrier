	<brief_title>Denosumab in Combination With Chemotherapy as First-line Treatment of Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a global phase 2 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study in subjects with Stage IV untreated NSCLC with or without bone metastasis. Eligible subjects are to receive 4 to 6 cycles of a standard of care platinum-doublet chemotherapy regimen. Approximately 216 subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive denosumab or matching placebo with the first investigational product dose coinciding with subject's first cycle of chemotherapy and continuing until the primary analysis, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, death, or lost to follow-up. Subjects will be offered open label denosumab if study results show a positive benefit:risk profile, or be followed long-term, for up to 2 years. All subjects are to receive daily dietary supplements of at least 500 mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D.</detailed_description>
