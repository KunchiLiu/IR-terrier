	<brief_title>A Clinical Study in Three-arm of Lurbinectedin (PM01183) Alone or in Combination With Gemcitabine and a Control Arm With Docetaxel as Second Line Treatment in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized-controlled, three-arm, phase II study of lurbinectedin (PM01183) alone or in combination with gemcitabine and a control arm with docetaxel as second-line treatment in unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)patients to evaluate the antitumor activity as progression-free survival at four months (PFS4) of PM01183 alone or in combination with gemcitabine as using single agent docetaxel as a reference in the control arm as current standard of care and to analyze overall survival (OS), overall survival rate at 1-year (OS12), duration of response (DR), antitumor activity, as response rate (RR), safety and efficacy profiles of PM01183 alone and in combination with gemcitabine, to be preliminary compared with docetaxel, patients' quality of life (QoL), pharmacokinetics (PK) of PM01183, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD)correlation and pharmacogenomics (PGx)to explore potential correlations between clinical outcomes and molecular parameters found in tumor and blood samples</detailed_description>
