	<brief_summary>There is a need for more effective and better-tolerated hepatitis B vaccines for low responder high-risk populations including patients with renal impairment and/or diabetes mellitus and those aged over 40 years. Several approaches are available to enhance the potency of hepatitis B virus vaccines including use of the more highly immunogenic antigens, replacing alum with potentially more effective adjuvants, and increasing the dose of vaccine antigen. A combination of these strategies is being tested in this study to identify the most promising candidate approaches to take forward into advanced clinical development</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Adjuvanted Prophylactic Hepatitis B Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adjuvants are a critical ingredient in most vaccines and act by boosting the immune response to the target protein (e.g. hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)). Despite considerable research, aluminium hydroxide or phosphate compounds (collectively referred to as "alum") remain the dominant adjuvants used in human hepatitis B virus vaccines. There is thus an unmet need for new HBV vaccine adjuvants, in particular, for adjuvants capable of boosting cell-mediated immunity (this is a particular type of immune response where killer T cells are activated that are then able to attack and destroy the infection) as alum, although good at stimulating antibodies is very poor at stimulating cell-mediated immunity. Alum, whilst generally accepted as safe, can be associated with significant local vaccine reactions and this is another reason why newer better-tolerated vaccine adjuvants would be beneficial. This study will compare a range of experimental adjuvant formulations to identify those that provide the safest and most effective enhancement of T- and B-cell immunity against hepatitis B</detailed_description>
