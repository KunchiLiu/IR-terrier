	<criteria>1, Body mass index between 19 and 30 kg/m2 and weight at least 50 kg and no more than 100 kg. 2, Volunteers must be willing to use a condom, unless their partners are postmenopausal, surgically sterile, or using an effective hormonal method of contraception or intrauterine coil. 3. In addition, volunteers must agree to continue to take similar contraceptive precautions until 4 months after the last dose of AZD9291. 1. Any clinically relevant abnormalities in physical examination, vital signs, hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis or ECG at baseline in the opinion of the Investigator. 2. Volunteers who have received live or liveattenuated vaccine in the 2 weeks prior to dosing. 3. History of severe allergy/hypersensitivity or or ongoing allergy/hypersensitivity, as judged by the Investigator, or history of hypersensitivity to AZD9291, its excipients, or drugs with a similar chemical structure or class.</criteria>
