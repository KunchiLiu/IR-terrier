	<brief_title>Observational Evaluation of Infective Risk in Myelodysplastic Syndrome Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The scarcity and the inadequacy of data make impossible the writing of evidence-based recommendations for prevention and management of infections in myelodysplastic syndrome. The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence and the spectrum of the infections of MDS patients. Will be also evaluated potential risk factors. This study could help the definition of the optimal management of MDS patients in terms of prophylaxis of the infective complications and in terms of the correct administration of growth factors.</detailed_description>
