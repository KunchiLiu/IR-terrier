	<brief_title>Yoga for Aromatase Inhibitor-associated Joint Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study uses a single-arm design. All study participants will be assigned to an intervention condition in which they participate in group Iyengar yoga classes for 90 minutes twice per week for 12 weeks (total of 24 classes). Study outcomes are assessed: 1) following recruitment but prior to the first yoga class; and 2) within two weeks post-intervention (follow-up). Additionally, a brief assessment of pain will be conducted four weeks and eight weeks after the start of yoga classes.</detailed_description>
