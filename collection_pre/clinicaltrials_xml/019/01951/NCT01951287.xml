	<brief_summary>Blood sugar and insulin levels after a meal may be altered by the food and beverages a person consumes. Keeping a healthy blood sugar level may help prevent and manage type 2 diabetes and related diseases. This study will look at how drinking different common beverages (milk, low-fat milk, nonfat milk, orange juice, coffee, and water) with a meal changes blood sugar and insulin levels.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Fluid Milk on Post-meal Glycemia and Insulinemia in Overwt/Obese Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The broad aim of the proposed research is to evaluate the effects of consuming milk and non-milk beverages with a breakfast meal on postprandial glucose and insulin responses in overweight and obese adults with varying levels of glucose tolerance (normal, pre-diabetic, type 2 diabetes). The investigators expect the consumption of fluid milk with breakfast to decrease the postprandial glucose response relative to other non-milk beverages (orange juice and sweetened coffee). Furthermore, the investigators expect that there will be no difference in the postprandial glucose or insulin response between varieties of fluid milk (skim, low-fat, and whole).</detailed_description>
