	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study in healthy people is to evaluate safety, toleration and time course of plasma concentration of single oral doses of PF-06372865. The pharmacodynamic activity of PF-06372865 will also be assessed. The effect of food on PK and the PK of PF-06372865 administered as a tablet formulation may also be investigated. Pharmacodynamic interaction between PF-06372865 and lorazepam will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
