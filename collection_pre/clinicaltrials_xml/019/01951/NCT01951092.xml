	<brief_summary>Despite advances in antiretroviral treatment (ART) over the past 10 years, the incidence of HIV in the United States remains stagnant with over 50,000 new cases annually. HIV-infected individuals inconsistently engaged with care are less likely to receive ART which is associated with correspondingly adverse clinical outcomes in the long term and increased risk of transmission. Mobile health (mHealth) strategies including cell phone and text messaging have shown success in the developing world for medication adherence, yet mHealth interventions have not been developed to improve retention in HIV care. This strategy needs to be tested to demonstrate feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effectiveness in supporting HIV treatment adherence in Rhode Island. The Miriam Hospital Immunology Center is an urban HIV-clinic that provides comprehensive primary and specialty care for over 1400 HIV-infected patients. It is the largest HIV clinic in Rhode Island with patients also referred from eastern Connecticut and southern Massachusetts. In 2010, there were 165 new patients in clinic, 70 of whom were diagnosed within 1 year of entering care. In this environment, we propose a pilot study with the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To pilot a bidirectional mHealth intervention among individuals at high risk of loss to follow-up, including those with a recent HIV diagnosis or those re-engaging in HIV care. HIV-infected persons (n=30) with a recent diagnosis or re-engaging in care at the Immunology Center at TMH will be recruited to participate in a bidirectional mHealth intervention that delivers automated, regularly scheduled appointment and medication adherence reminders in an individualized format, and also allows individuals to request motivational enhancement and problem-solving support to address barriers to care. Specific Aim 2: To assess the impact and acceptability of the pilot intervention through qualitative interviews. All participants will also be invited to complete individual in-depth interviews which will assess acceptability and effectiveness of the pilot mHealth intervention, such as content and frequency of automatic messages, for retention and medication adherence for HIV-infected individuals in RI. The results of this study will provide preliminary data to inform an R21 or R34 application to determine efficacy of an mHealth intervention among HIV-infected persons at high-risk for loss to follow-up.</brief_summary>
