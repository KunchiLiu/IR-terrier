	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center phase II randomized controlled study to assess the efficacy of Pemetrexed/cisplatin with or without Bevacizumab on patients with brain metastasis from non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) harboring EGFR wild type by intracranial PFS(iPFS),also PFS ,DCR and OS.The side effect is evaluated as well.</brief_summary>

Appraisable disease, the presence of at least three lesions if longest diameter &lt;10 mm by brain MRI 4. Adult patients (≥ 18 years and ≤75 years). ECOG Performance Status 0 or 1 Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.,Haemoglobin ³ 10.0 g/dl, Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ³1.5 x 109/L, platelets ³ 100 x 109/L. Total bilirubin £ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). ALT and AST &lt; 2.5 x ULN in the absence of liver metastases, or &lt; 5 x ULN in case of liver metastases.
