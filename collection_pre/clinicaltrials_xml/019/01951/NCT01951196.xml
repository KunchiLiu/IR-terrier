	<brief_summary>A new study have shown that high nighttime blood pressure (BP) and/or non-dipping (lack of fall in blood pressure during nighttime) is a strong predictor for the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality in patients with hypertension. Three factors seem to affect the night time blood pressure: chronic kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or the way ambulatory blood pressure is monitored. The aim of this study is to analyse the importance of these three factors on nighttime bloodpressure. Hypothesis: Central 24 hour blood pressure monitoring provides another measure of daily fluctuations in blood pressure than peripheral 24 hour blood pressure monitoring, because measurement is painless and does not interfere with activities during the daytime or night-time sleep In chronic kidney disease and OSA the decrease in nocturnal BP is lower than in healthy subjects. In chronic kidney disease the decrease in the nocturnal BP is inversely correlated to the severity of OSA, the severity of kidney disease, and blood pressure during daytime.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>150 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD III-IV) and 75 healthy subject is examined with both central and peripheral 24 hours blood pressure monitoring, 1 night home polygraphy to determine whether the subject has obstructive sleep apnea, and if so the degree (AHI), blood- and urine samples to determine levels of u-AQP2 og u-ENaCÉ£, PRC, p-AngII, p-Aldosterone, p-Avp og p-Endothelin.</detailed_description>
