	<brief_summary>Olfactory identification deficits occur in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), are associated with disease severity, predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD and are associated with healthy elderly subjects developing MCI. Odor (olfactory) identification deficits may reflect degeneration of cholinergic inputs to the olfactory bulb and other olfactory brain regions. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (ACheI) like donepezil show modest effects in improving cognition but can be associated with adverse effects and increased burden and costs because of the need for prolonged, often lifelong, treatment. Converging findings on odor identification test performance (UPSIT, scratch and sniff 40-item test) from four pilot studies, including two of our own, suggest that acute change in the UPSIT in response to an anticholinergic challenge (atropine nasal spray), incremental change over 8 weeks, and even the baseline UPSIT score by itself, may predict cognitive improvement with ACheI treatment in MCI and AD. If change in odor identification deficits can help to identify which patients should receive ACheI treatment, this simple inexpensive approach will advance the goal of improving personalized treatment, improve selection and monitoring of patients for ACheI treatment, reduce needless ACheI exposure with risk of side effects, and decrease health care costs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Olfactory Deficits and Donepezil Treatment in Cognitively Impaired Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this clinical trial, the investigators will evaluate, treat and follow two broad samples of adult patients at New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University Medical Center. Study 1 will include 70 patients with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Study 2 will include 100 patients with probable Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Recruitment will be from clinics and/or advertisements. In the protocol, all 170 patients will receive baseline memory and olfactory assessments and are treated with donepezil. Patients will be followed for a total of 1 year. During this time, patients will be monitored closely by the study physician and will receive memory and olfactory assessments at weeks 0, 8, 26, and 52. In addition, an olfactory challenge test will be done at baseline. This project will be of value in the selection of patients with MCI and AD for treatment based on the evaluation of olfaction tests to predict response to donepezil. Since mild cognitive impairment is widespread and Alzheimer's disease represents a major public health problem, this study has considerable public purpose and significance.</detailed_description>

Medications with anticholinergic effects that have been shown to adversely impact cognition will not be permitted. Benzodiazepines in lorazepam equivalents less than or equal to 2 mg daily and narcotics will also not be permitted.

Mental Retardation Cystic Fibrosis Clinical stroke with residual neurological deficits. MRI findings of cerebrovascular disease (small infarcts, lacunes, periventricular disease) in the absence of clinical stroke with residual neurological deficits will not lead to exclusion. Patients receiving cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) or memantine will be excluded. Patients already receiving one of these medications at screening who undergo a 2week washout before starting all study procedures will not be excluded. Acute, severe, unstable medical illness. For cancer, patients with active illness or metastases will be excluded, but past history of successfully treated cancer will not lead to exclusion.

Exclusion criteria for atropine nasal spray: presence of nasal deformity or disease that makes it difficult to administer the nasal spray reliably. A patient who cannot complete the atropine nasal spray procedure can still participate in the rest of the study.
