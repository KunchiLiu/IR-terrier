	<brief_summary>pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of GX-G3 after single subcutaneous administration in healthy male subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study GX-G3 in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MTD will be determined by DLT occurrence and frequency, and severity and charactoristic of adverse event, vital sign, physical examination, ECG, Laboratory test, chest-X-ray will be examined for safety evaluation. The second purpose is to evaluate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and immunogenecity will be evaluated to investigate antibody production.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subjects may be entered in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria: 1. Are capable of understanding and complying with the requirements of the study and have voluntarily signed the informed consent form (ICF); 2. Healthy male volunteers aged 2045 years; 3. Have a body weight of 6090 kg (inclusive), have a body mass index (BMI) equal to or greater than 19 and less than 27 kg/m2; 4. Are eligible for the study based on screening data (Subjects may participate if Investigator considered eligible after looking at other screening data); Subjects presenting with any of the following will not be entered in to the study: 1.

Have the longest length of spleen &gt; 16 cm measured by abdomen ultrasonography ; 5. Have MSSBP ≥ 140 mmHg or ≤ 90 mmHg and/or MSDBP ≥ 95 mmHg or ≤ 50 mmHg; (BP must be measured after resting for at least 3 minutes) 6. Have clinically significant arrhythmia by EKG/ECG; 7. Are positive for HBV, HCV, HIV; 8. Have a history of allergy/hypersensitivity or ongoing allergy/hypersensitivity to any drug, as judged by the investigator; 9. Have had any blood donation/ blood loss greater than 400 ml within 8 weeks prior to dosing; 10. Have participated in another clinical trial with investigational drugs within 8 weeks of screening period; 11. Any other conditions that are considered inappropriate or unsafe for subjects by the Investigator; 12. Are considered ineligible by the investigator due to physical findings or laboratory values at the screening assessments; 13. Have a history of GCSF treatment;</criteria>
