	<brief_summary>This randomized clinical trial studies standard GVHD prophylaxis with tacrolimus and methotrexate compared to tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and a reduced-dose methotrexate in patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant. Both mycophenolate mofetil and reduced-dose methotrexate, in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor, have been shown to be safe and effective in GVHD prevention with less toxicity than standard dose methotrexate. It is not yet known, however, whether this combination of mycophenolate mofetil and reduced-dose methotrexate with tacrolimus is more effective than tacrolimus and standard dose methotrexate in preventing GVHD.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design This is a prospective randomized trial to determine the effectiveness of different doses of GVHD prophylaxis on mucositis, engraftment and aGVHD. Study consists of two study groups of 50 subjects each. Group A will receive Tac and MTX (15 mg/m2 day +1, 10 mg/m2 day +3, +6, +11). Group B will receive Tac, Mini-dose MTX (5 mg/m2 on day +1, +3, +6) and MMF.</detailed_description>
