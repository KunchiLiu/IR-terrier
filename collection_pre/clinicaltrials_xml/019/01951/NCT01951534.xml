The primary aim of this study is: "Is the intervention trial feasible?" The purpose is to develop a feasible web-based decisional aid (DA) for a larger scale trial. Thus it is important that this trial provide evidence of feasibility. The investigators will define feasibility as the rate of study acceptance and participation. The secondary aim of this study is: " Is the BRDA acceptable and used?" The team will evaluate BRDA acceptability, use, difficulty with internet use, and what factors predict uptake and use. The investigators anticipate that, due to interest in the topic, the majority of women will access the website. An additional secondary aim of this study is: "What is the impact of BRDA on BR knowledge, attitudes about BR, decisional conflict, preparedness and completeness of preparation, anxiety, and discussion with oncologist?" The purpose is to calculate effect sizes for a larger randomized trial.</brief_summary>
