	<brief_title>Feasibility and Preliminary Efficacy of Hatha Yoga in Head and Neck Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of aggressive treatment for head and neck cancer (HNC) particularly combined modality treatment regimens has resulted in an increase in survival. Unfortunately, this improvement has come with a marked increase in acute and late-effects. Acute HNC treatment-related toxicities have been clearly and extensively documented; however, data pertaining to adverse late-effects, those most likely to impact the survivor's long term symptom burden, functionality, and overall quality of life (QOL), are limited. This pilot study will be conducted to examine the feasibility of tailored Hatha Yoga as a therapeutic modality to address MSI in patients who have survived HNC.</detailed_description>
