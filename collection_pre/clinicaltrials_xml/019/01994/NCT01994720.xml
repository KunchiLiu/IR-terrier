	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to compare the effect of 90-day treatment with ticagrelor (180 mg [two 90 mg tablets] loading dose on Day 1 followed by 90 mg twice daily maintenance dose for the remainder of the study) vs acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)-aspirin (300 mg [three 100 mg tablets] loading dose on Day 1 followed by 100 mg once daily maintenance dose for the remainder of the study) for the prevention of major vascular events (composite of stroke, myocardial infarction [MI], and death) in patients with acute ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Men or women equal or elder 40 years of age Either acute ischaemic stroke or highrisk TIA as defined here and randomisation occurring within 24 hours after onset of symptoms Key Planned use of antithrombotic therapy in addition to study medication including antiplatelets (eg, open label ASA, GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, prasugrel, dipyridamole, ozagrel, cilostazol) and anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, oral thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors, bivalirudin, hirudin, argatroban, unfractionated and low molecular weight heparins). Any history of atrial fibrillation, ventricular aneurysm or suspicion of cardioembolic pathology for TIA or stroke. Planned carotid, cerebrovascular, or coronary revascularisation that requires halting study medication within 7 days of randomisation. Receipt of any intravenous or intraarterial thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomisation History of previous symptomatic nontraumatic intracerebral bleed at any time (asymptomatic microbleeds do not qualify), gastrointestinal (GI) bleed within the past 6 months, or major surgery within 30 days.</criteria>
