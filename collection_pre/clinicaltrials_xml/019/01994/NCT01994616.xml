	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation of the Use of Intralesional Cryotherapy for Treatment of Keloid and Hypertrophic Scars</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intralesional (IL) cryotherapy is a novel treatment for keloids and hypertrophic scars, in which the scar is frozen from inside. Published results are promising, however only Caucasian patient populations have been studied. This prospective evaluation studies the effectiveness of IL cryotherapy in treating keloids and hypertrophic scars in a large population of mixed Fitzpatrick skin types. All patients with keloid or hypertrophic scars meeting inclusion criteria were treated with a liquid nitrogen based device called Cryoshape Scar quality and possible recurrence are assessed pre- and postsurgery (3, 6 and 12 months) with objective devices determine scar color, scar elasticity, scar volume and patient's skin type. In addition, scars are evaluated using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale.</detailed_description>
