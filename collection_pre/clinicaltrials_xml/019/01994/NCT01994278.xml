	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to observe whether a brushless cleaning device can be equally as effective in removing plaque from the teeth as a soft toothbrush. The goal is to give people an alternative to bristle brush cleaning if they find they are brushing too hard. The hypothesis is that it is possible to maintain healthy teeth and gingiva by using brushless methods in conjunction with flossing.</brief_summary>
