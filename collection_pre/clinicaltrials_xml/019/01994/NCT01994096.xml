	<brief_summary>Intensive care unit (ICU) patients are especially at risk for invasive candidiasis due to the presence of risk factors. It is known that in critically ill patients, alterations in function of various organs and body systems can influence the pharmacokinetics and hence the plasma concentration of a drug. A study of caspofungin in ICU patients has found a high inter- and intra-individual variability in caspofungin concentration. Factors that caused subtherapeutic caspofungin plasma concentrations were body weight &gt; 75 kg and hypoalbuminemia. Furthermore, an efficacy study showed a lower response rate for caspofungin among patients with a higher disease severity score. As a result of the altered pharmacokinetics, under- or over-exposure of caspofungin can occur in critically ill patients and an adjusted dosage might be necessary in these patients.</brief_summary>
