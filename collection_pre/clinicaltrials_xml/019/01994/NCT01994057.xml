	<brief_summary>For patients of advanced NSCLC (non small cell lung cancer) , Individualized cancer therapy has been widely accepted since the success of crizotinib administration based on EML4-ALK fusion gene detection and gefitinib and erlotinib administration based on EGFR-TKIs sensitive mutations.From clinical points of view ,individual differences often occur between different patients, leading diverse effect in ADR and drug effect.Meanwhile ,the drug effect and adverse drug reaction was significantly influenced by the pharmacokinetic factors and pharmacodynamic factors.In this research ,we try to establish a more sensitive method to detect sensitive mutations in plasma and discover the correlation between somatic and germline mutations , trough concentration and EGFR-TKI drug effect, the association between ADME-associated SNP ,trough concentration and EGFR-TKI adverse effect .Furthermore, in vivo and in vitro research is also crucial for rational explanation for these clinical phenomenon.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Retrospective Pharmacogenomics Research of EGFR-TKIs,Gefitinib and Erlotinib, in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer(NSCLC)Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ADME-associated SNPs included are CYP3A4,CYP3A4,CYP1A1,CYP2D6, ABCB1,ABCG2 and so on .The somatic mutations included are EGFR ,K-RAS ,ALK and so on</detailed_description>
