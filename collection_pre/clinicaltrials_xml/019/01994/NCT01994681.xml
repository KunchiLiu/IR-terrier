	<brief_summary>Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) in human breath are captured and analyzed by the Spectrosense EVA system, which is combination of a gas chromatography (GC) and software algorithm. The objective is to obtain a set or sets of VOC bio-markers that will provide the best discrimination between Pancreatic Cancer sick population and healthy population. The gold standard for identifying sick/healthy population is biopsy proven Pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
