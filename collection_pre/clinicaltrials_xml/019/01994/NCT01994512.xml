	<brief_summary>A national randomized multicentre trial (RCT) where decompression is compared with decompression with simultaneous fusion in 245 patients with spinal stenosis on one or two adjacent lumbar levels with or without degenerative olisthesis. The material is stratified for the existence of degenerative olisthesis &gt;3mm. Monitoring is performed with clinical results from patient surveys after 2 and five years, and with radiological follow-up (MRI, CT and plain X-ray) and an objective function test (6 min walking test) after 2 years. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in results between the two interventions.</brief_summary>
