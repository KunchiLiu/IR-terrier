	<brief_summary>The objective of this research is to determine the effects of anti-VEGF drugs (bevacizumab, ranibizumab or aflibercept) on aqueous humor dynamics (AHD) in patients with retinal vascular disease. The underlying hypothesis is that anti-VEGF drugs increase intraocular pressure (IOP) by increasing aqueous inflow, decreasing uveoscleral outflow or both. The specific aim is to evaluate the changes produced in AHD after 3 monthly injections of anti VEGF agents.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Intravitreal injection of different anti-VEGF agents such as bevacizumab (Avastinï¿½, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA) ranibizumab (Lucentisï¿½; Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA) and aflibercept (Eyleaï¿½, Regeneron, Tarrytown, NY, USA) has been a widely common practice for treatment of choroidal neovascularization and retinal vascular diseases [1]. Several ocular and systemic adverse events have been reported with the use of anti-VEGF agents [7]. Elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) is a serious ocular adverse event that may be associated with intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents. IOP elevation with anti-VEGF injection may have variable presentation ranging from acute transient post injection elevation to the development of persistent IOP elevation that mandates pressure lowering therapy[8]. Patients with previously existing glaucoma may have a higher rate of persistent IOP elevation associated with intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents. Good et al, reported the rate of persistent IOP elevation after intravitreal anti-VEGF tobe 33% in glaucoma patients versus 3.1% in eyes without previous diagnosis ofglaucoma [9]. Tseng et al, reported 25 eyes with sustained elevation of IOP after serial intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents (mean = 20injections). All the 25 eyes were normotensive prior to the study and 23 of them were not previously diagnosed with glaucoma[10]. Multicenter clinical trials that studied the intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents, such as MARINA and ANCHOR for ranibizumab, VISION for pegaptanib and PACORES for bevacizumab, did not show sustained IOP elevation with the intravitreal injection of the study agents [12-15]. However, a subgroup analysis of the data of MARINA and ANCHOR trials showed at least 6 mm Hg increase of IOP from baseline in 2.1% of eyes in MARINA trial and 3.6% of eyes in ANCHOR trial [16]. A retrospective chart review of 207 patients over a 6-months follow up period after serial intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF reported an IOP elevation greater than 5 mm Hg in 2 consecutive visits compared to baseline in 11.6% of the treated eyes versus 5.3% in control eyes [17]. The pathophysiology of the reported IOP elevation associated with intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF is unknown. Anti-VEGF compounds might increase aqueous humor inflow by the breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier or reduce uveoscleral outflow by the ciliary body vasculature. These potential changes could translate into elevated IOP and glaucoma.</detailed_description>
