	<brief_summary>Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who have elevated serum phosphate (P) levels have significantly higher mortality rates compared to those with normal P. In patients receiving conventional dialysis regimens, serum P may be lowered through dietary intervention and use of P binders, though these have potentially important side effects and may adversely impact quality of life. Whether lowering P, and / or targeting specific P levels improve survival and clinical outcomes is unknown. Despite this uncertainty, over 90% of patients with ESRD receive P lowering therapy and guidelines for the care of patients with ESRD are increasingly calling for more aggressive phosphate lowering. This intensive P lowering results in extra medications (and their associated side-effects), and higher health care costs. We are uncertain whether the intensification of P control results in measurable benefits to patients with ESRD. The overall goal of this pilot trial is to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial of intensive vs liberalized phosphate control among hemodialysis recipients.</brief_summary>
