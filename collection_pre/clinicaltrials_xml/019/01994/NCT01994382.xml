	<brief_summary>This study will identify the highest dose, and assess the safety, of cerdulatinib (PRT062070) that may be given in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or non-hodgkin lymphoma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1/2A Dose Escalation Study in CLL, SLL or NHL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, Phase 1/2a, multi dose, multi-center trial of orally administered cerdulatinib assessing safety, tolerability and PK parameters conducted in 2 phases: - Phase 1: Dose-escalation portion, during which 52 patients enrolled to receive a single-agent cerdulatinib at their assigned dose level starting at 15 mg QD, administered in increasing doses until the MTD/MAD is identified. - Phase 2a: Consisting of 6 planned cohorts of 40 patients by cancer type. Five cohorts will receive single agent cerdulatinib at a starting dose of 35 mg BID for 28 days escalated to 40 mg BID in the absence of a Grade 3 or higher toxicity. Cohort 2 receives cerdulatinib plus rituximab IV at 375 mg/m2.</detailed_description>
