	<brief_summary>The current standard short-course treatment for pulmonary TB requires 6 months to complete. This long duration of treatment increases the likelihood of side effects while decreasing patients' adherence to anti-TB drugs. Linezolid showed considerable efficacy against refractory multidrug-resistant TB. Considering the marked anti-TB effects of linezolid as well as the possible adverse effects of its long-term use, it is rational to use linezolid instead of ethambutol for the first 4 weeks of treatment for drug-susceptible pulmonary TB. Through randomized controlled trial, the investigators will evaluate the hypothesis that the use of linezolid instead of ethambutol will increase the sputum culture conversion rate by 15% after 2 months of treatment. Patients with TB without resistance to rifampicin will be randomized to the following three arms at a 1:1:1 ratio: Arma 1 (control arm), Arm 2 (linezolid for 2 weeks instead of ethambutol), Arm 3 (linezolid for 4 weeks instead of ethambutol)Primary outcome will be sputum culture conversion rate after 2 months of treatment (liquid media).</brief_summary>
