	<brief_summary>Cognitive and functional decline observed in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients are related to thrombotic and/or cardioembolic events. Use of warfarin for the prevention of stroke in AF patients, despite effective, remains beyond desired levels because of interactions with food and fluctuations in blood levels. Because of a more stable anticoagulation state, Dabigatran may offer better protection against thrombotic phenomenon and, consequently, mitigate the process of cognitive and functional compromise.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cognitive Impairment Related to Atrial Fibrillation Prevention Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a prospective parallel study including two hundred atrial fibrillation patients &gt; 65 years old and scoring CHADS2VASc &gt; 1. Patients will be randomized to receive Warfarin (INR between 2 and 3) or Dabigatran (150 mg twice daily) for two years. After one year and at the end of the study, individuals will be evaluated regarding cognitive endpoints following the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Canadian Stroke Network Vascular Cognitive Impairment Harmonization Standards (Hachinski et al. Stroke 2006;37:2220-2241). The investigators will use the 60 minutes evaluation protocol complemented by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).</detailed_description>
