	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is evaluate whether it is safe or not to use various combination of antibiotics (ampicillin, metronidazole, clindamycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, gentamicin) in treating infants with complicated intra-abdominal infections</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antibiotic Safety (SCAMP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The most commonly used antibiotics in infants with complicated intra-abdominal infections are not labeled for use in this population because safety and efficacy data are lacking. This study will provide the safety information required for labeling. In addition, the pharmacokinetics(PK) and effectiveness data will also be collected during this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Informed consent obtained from parent(s) or legal guardian(s) (Groups 15) 2. ≤33 weeks gestation at birth (Groups 13, 5) 3. ≥34 weeks gestation at birth (Groups 4 and 5) 4. PNA &lt;121 days (Groups 15) 5. Sufficient venous access to permit administration of study drug (intravenous [IV]) (Groups 15) 6. Presenting physical, radiological, and/or bacteriological findings of a complicated intraabdominal infection within 48 hours prior to randomization/first study drug dose (Groups 14)**. Complicated intraabdominal infections include secondary peritonitis, NEC grade II or higher by Bell's criteria, Hirschsprung's disease with perforation, spontaneous intestinal perforation, meconium ileus with perforation, bowel obstruction with perforation, gastroschisis with necrosis and/or perforation, omphalocele with necrosis and/or perforation, neonatal appendicitis, intestinal pneumatosis or portal venous gas, free peritoneal air on abdominal radiographic examination, or abdominal abscess. 7. Suspected or confirmed infection for which the study drug may provide therapeutic benefit and planned CSF collection per standard of care (Group 5). Exclusion Criteria* 1. History of anaphylaxis in response to study drugs (Groups 15) 2. Serum creatinine &gt;2 mg/dL within 48 hours on measurement prior to and closest to randomization /first study drug dose (Groups 1 5)** 3. Known ALT &gt;250 U/L or AST &gt;500 U/L on measurement closest to the time of randomization or first study drug dose (Groups 15)** 4. Any condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, precludes participation because it could affect participant safety (Groups 15) Do not apply for Group 5 participants receiving drug per standard of care Criteria must be satisfied by randomization (randomized Groups 13) or first study drug dose (nonrandomized Groups 13, Group 4 and Group 5), whichever comes first.</criteria>
