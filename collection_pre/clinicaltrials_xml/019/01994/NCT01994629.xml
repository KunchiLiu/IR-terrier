In good health as determined by the outcome of medical history, physical examination and clinical judgment of the investigator. 1. Previous confirmed or suspected disease caused by N. meningitidis. 2. Previously exposed to clinically proven meningococcal disease or clinical bacterial meningitis without further microbiologic characterization, i.e. possible meningococcal disease. 3. Previously immunized with a meningococcal vaccine or vaccine containing meningococcal antigen(s) (licensed or investigational). 4. Received within 90 days prior to enrollment or were expected to receive during the study period any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine). 5.

Major congenital defect or a serious chronic disease. 7. History of any anaphylaxis, severe vaccine reactions, or allergy to any vaccine components including diphtheria toxoid (CRM197) or tetanus toxoid (TT) and latex. 8. Required chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the study vaccination. (For corticosteroids, this means prednisone, or equivalent, ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day. Inhaled and topical steroids were allowed). 9. Receipt of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within six months prior to study vaccination or who had administration planned during the study period. 10. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination. 11. Any bleeding disorder which was considered as a contraindication to intramuscular injection. 12. Moderate or severe acute infection and/or fever (defined as temperature ≥ 38°C) within 3 days prior to enrollment. 13. Systemic antibiotic treatment within 7 days prior to enrollment.</criteria>
