	<detailed_description>This registry is designed to assess the clinically relevant benefits of balloon angioplasty and stenting in superficial femoral and popliteal artery, using rapid exchange technology</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients with symptomatic one or two legs ischemia, requiring treatment of SFA or popliteal artery Rutherford classification 25 Single lesion with recoiling/dissection/restenosis after balloon angioplasty or de novo lesions with stenosis or occlusion, Target vessel reference diameter ≥4mm and ≤7mm (by visual estimate) At least one patent (less than 50% stenosis) tibioperoneal runoff vessel confirmed by baseline angiography Patient is suitable candidate for femoralpopliteal artery bypass surgery Female of childbearing potential. Previous bypass surgery In stent restenosis as a target lesion Scheduled staged procedure of multiple lesions within the ipsilateral iliac or popliteal arteries within 30 days after index procedure. Coexisting aneurysmal disease of the abdominal aorta, iliac or popliteal arteries Acute thrombophlebitis or deep venous thrombosis Hemodynamic instability Untreated inflow disease of the ipsilateral pelvic arteries (more than 50 percent stenosis or occlusion), Significant gastrointestinal bleeding or any coagulopathy that would contraindicate the use of antiplatelet therapy Known intolerance to study medications, contrast agents or nitinol.</criteria>
