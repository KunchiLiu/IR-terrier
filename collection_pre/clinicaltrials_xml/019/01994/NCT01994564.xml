	<brief_summary>Glaucoma is a progressive disease resulting in loss of retinal nerve cells and their axons (retinal nerve fibers). Retinal nerve fibers are ordered in a special manner when they enter the optic nerve. Hence, damage to the retinal nerve fibers by glaucoma results in visual field defects at certain locations. Furthermore, the retinal nerve fiber layers from different receptors for different colors are ordered in a special manner as well. Thus, it is possible that glaucomatous damage causes color vision dysfunction (dyschromatopsia). At the moment there is disagreement whether dyschromatopsia occurs at early- to mid-stage or only in end-stage glaucoma. By testing color vision in glaucoma patients the prevalence of dyschromatopsia in glaucoma and in different stages of the disease will be investigated.</brief_summary>
