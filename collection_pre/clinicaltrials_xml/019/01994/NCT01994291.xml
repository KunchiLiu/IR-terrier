	<brief_summary>The study hypothesis under test is that administration of the CCR2/5 antagonist has the potential to be as effective as the current treatment options for subjects with diabetic macular edema. The current treatment option for these subjects is an injection directly into the eye, while this CCR2/5 antagonist would be an oral drug which has the potential to be just as effective. This CCR2/5 antagonist also has a broader anti-inflammatory potential and might be able to provide an alternative mechanism to treat Diabetic Macular Edema.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2, Multi-Center Study To Compare The Efficacy And Safety Of A Chemokine CCR2/5 Receptor Antagonist With Ranibizumab In Adults With Diabetic Macular Edema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study recruitment was stopped on April 9, 2015. This decision was taken for business reasons due to changes in the prioritization of the drug development portfolio. This decision was not as a result of any evolving safety, efficacy issue or changes in the risk:benefit assessment of this product or regulatory interactions.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with Diabetes Mellitus (Type 1 or Type 2) Showing Diabetic Macular Edema in the Eye Reduced visual acuity resulting from retinal thickening Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential â‰¥18 years and male subjects greater than or equal to 18 years. A subject is of childbearing potential if, in the opinion of the investigator, he/she is biologically capable of having children and is sexually active. Female subjects who are not of childbearing potential must meet at least one of the following criteria: Have undergone a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy; Have medically confirmed ovarian failure; or Achieved postmenopausal status, defined as: cessation of regular menses for at least 12 consecutive months with no alternative pathological or physiological cause; and have a serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level within the laboratory's reference range for postmenopausal females. Severe Impaired Renal Function Any intraocular condition or previous surgery in either eye that would likely require medical or surgical intervention during the study duration or if allowed to progress untreated for the 16 weeks of study duration, would likely contribute to a reduction in visual acuity.</criteria>
