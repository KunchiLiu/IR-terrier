	<brief_title>Comparison of HT Concomitant With RT vs RT Alone in Patients With a Detectable PSA After Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study the effectiveness of the association of a short duration hormonal therapy by degarelix (Firmagon ®) and radiotherapy, with radiotherapy alone on survival without events in the treatment of detectable PSA after radical prostatectomy. 122 patients should be included over a period of 2 years. Patients will be treated according to the following scheme: - Arm A (61 patients) : Pelvic Radiotherapy: 46 Gy and prostate only boost up to 66 Gy - Arm B (61 patients) : Arm A + hormonal therapy by degarelix during 6 months</detailed_description>
