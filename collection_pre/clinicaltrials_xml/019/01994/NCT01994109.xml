	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of MYOBLOC in the treatment of Sialorrhea (drooling), which can be a symptom of many disease conditions. MYOBLOC will be injected directly into the salivary glands. MYOBLOC has been shown in previous trials to safely decrease saliva production, thereby demonstrating its potential as a safe and effective treatment for troublesome sialorrhea.</brief_summary>
