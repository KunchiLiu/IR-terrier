	<brief_summary>Myofascial pains are frequently found during the clinical examination of the patients presenting a painful chronic syndrome of the pelvis or the perineum. If the physiopathology of this component of the pain characterized by triggerpoints found in the clinical examination, remains uncertain; its coverage contributes to the improvement of the global pain of the patient. The physiotherapy can be useful but when it is not useful, we proposed injections of triggerpoints by local anesthetics. The injections of botulinum toxin on these triggerpoints have a legitimacy (action on the muscular cramp and action on the afferent fibers) but are they superior to the injections of local anesthetics of triggerpoints? The literature remains poor on the subject, justifying this randomized double-blind protocol comparing the efficacy of the botulinum toxin associated with a local anesthetic versus local anesthetic alone with a main criterion of evaluation in 2 months and a monthly follow-up as long as the patient remains improved and maximum in 6 months.</brief_summary>
