This objective will not involve any data analysis. Objective 1.2: At post assessment, students enrolled in the study will qualitatively provide information about the usability and usefulness for the prevention and cessation sites. Objective 2.1: Investigate frequency of use of and exposure to APPSPIRE modules via an objective measure of general use. Objective 2.2: Investigate how feasible the program will be. Feasibility will be operationalized for this objective. Objective 2.3: Obtain a maintained use of APPSPIRE with high completeness and extent of completion.

	<detailed_description>Nonsmokers: The study has 3 parts. Part 1 is an initial visit with a research team member. If you agree to take part in this study, at the initial visit you will learn details about the study, you may be asked to participate in an audio-taped focus group, and have a chance to ask the research staff questions. If you participate in the focus group, you are agreeing to be audio-taped during the focus group session to ensure all of your opinions are accurately recorded. There will be no identifying information recorded. The audio-tape files will be held by the research team in a locked file cabinet and/or on an MD Anderson password-protected hard drive for five years after the study ends. During the visit, you will complete an initial survey. The survey asks about health-related attitudes and behaviors. You will be given a new smoking cessation and prevention app to use on your smart phone at your convenience. The entire visit should last about 1 hour. Part 2 will be a telephone survey. You will receive a telephone call from research staff 1 month after you receive the app. During this call, you will be asked to answer some of the survey questions from the first survey. You will also be asked questions about how you liked the app, how easy it was to use, and how helpful it was to you. This call should last about 1 hour. You will receive a phone call reminder before each follow-up telephone call with the date and time of the call. Part 3 will be another telephone survey. You will receive a telephone call from research staff 4 months after you receive the app. During this call, you will be asked to answer some of the survey questions from the first survey. You will also be asked questions about how you liked the app, how easy it was to use, and how helpful it was to you. This call should last about 1 hour. You will receive a phone call reminder before each follow-up telephone call with the date and time of the call. All data will be saved in a password protected folder on the MD Anderson server. Only the research team will have access to the data during data analysis. Length of Study: You may be on the study for up to 5 months. Your participation in this study will be over after you complete the last phone call. This is an investigational study. The use of the phone app to help prevent smoking is investigational. Up to 38 people will take part in this study. Up to 15 participants will take part in the "non-smokers" part of this study. All of them will be enrolled at Houston Community College.
