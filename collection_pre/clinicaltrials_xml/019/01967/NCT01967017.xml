	<brief_summary>Despite the high efficacy of intrauterine devices (IUDs), some women choose not to receive IUDs secondary to the pain associated with insertion. Nulliparous women may be especially susceptible to procedure-related pain from IUD insertion. This study will investigate the difference in perceived pain from IUD insertion, comparing local anesthesia to a placebo, among women who have not had a vaginal delivery before. The investigators anticipate that among women who have not had a previous vaginal delivery, the pain associated with IUD insertion will be significantly decreased after administration of local anesthesia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study will investigate the difference in perceived pain from IUD insertion, comparing paracervical block with lidocaine to a placebo (bacteriostatic saline) block, among nulliparous and "functionally nulliparous" women. The investigators plan a double-masked, placebo controlled, randomized clinical trial. The investigators anticipate that among patients who have not had a previous vaginal delivery, the pain associated with IUD insertion will be significantly decreased after administration of a 15 mL 1% lidocaine paracervical block compared to patients who receive 15 mL of bacteriostatic saline (placebo).</detailed_description>
