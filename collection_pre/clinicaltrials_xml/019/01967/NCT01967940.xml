	<brief_summary>Part 1 consists of 2 cohorts, starting with a sentinel cohort, in which 10 participants will be enrolled to receive open-label tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) in addition to their current failing antiretroviral (ARV) regimen. This cohort will then be followed by a randomized, double-blind, cohort to compare the addition of TAF or placebo-to-match TAF in HIV-1 positive adults who are failing their current ARV regimen. This randomized cohort will consist of approximately 90 participants. In Part 2, all participants who complete Part 1 of the study will discontinue their failing ARV regimen and TAF or placebo-to-match TAF for a 14-day washout period. Following the washout period, all participants who received TAF in Part 1 and have a &gt; 0.5 log10 decline in HIV-1 RNA will receive elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide single-tablet regimen (E/C/F/TAF STR) plus atazanavir (ATV) once daily for 48 weeks. Participants who received TAF who have a ≤ 0.5 log10 decline in HIV-1 RNA will be discontinued from the study and will not be eligible to continue into Part 2 of the study. All participants who received placebo in Part 1 will be eligible to participate in Part 2 regardless of their viral load change.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, which must be obtained prior to initiation of study procedures Currently taking a failing ARV regimen Screening or historical genotype report showing either 1 to 3 thymidineanalogue mutations (TAMs) and/or K65R, as well as M184V/I Plasma HIV1 RNA ≥ 500 copies/mL but ≤ 100,000 copies/mL at screening Normal ECG Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 50 mL/min according to the CockcroftGault formula for creatinine clearance Alanine aminotransferase (AST)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 5 × the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL, or normal direct bilirubin Adequate hematologic function Serum amylase ≤ 5 × ULN Females may enter the study if it is confirmed that she is: Not pregnant or nursing Of nonchildbearing potential (ie, have had a hysterectomy, both ovaries removed, medically documented ovarian failure, or are postmenopausal women &gt; 54 years of age with cessation [for ≥ 12 months] of previously occurring menses), or Of childbearing potential and agrees to utilize highly effective contraception methods or be nonheterosexually active or practice sexual abstinence from screening throughout the duration of study treatment and for 30 days following study drug dosing Females who utilize hormonal contraceptive as one of their birth control methods must have used the same method for at least three months prior to study dosing. Males must agree to utilize a highly effective method of contraception during heterosexual intercourse or be nonheterosexually active, or practice sexual abstinence from first dose throughout the study period and for 30 days following the last study drug dose. Males must agree to refrain from sperm donation from first dose until at least 30 days after the last study drug dose. Key A new AIDSdefining condition diagnosed within the 30 days prior to screening Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive Hepatitis C antibody positive (Subjects with positive HCV antibody and without detectable HCV RNA are permitted to enroll) History of integrase inhibitor use Screening or historical genotype reports shows Q151M or T69ins or more than 3 TAMs. Screening or historical genotype report shows resistance to integrase inhibitors Individuals experiencing decompensated cirrhosis Current alcohol or substance use History of malignancy within the past 5 years (prior to screening) or ongoing malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), basal cell carcinoma, or resected, noninvasive cutaneous squamous carcinoma. Individuals with cutaneous KS are eligible, but must not have received any systemic therapy for KS within 30 days of Part 1, Day 1 and must not be anticipated to require systemic therapy during the study. Active, serious infections (other than HIV1 infection) requiring parenteral antibiotic or antifungal therapy within 30 days prior to Part 1, Day 1 Any other clinical condition or prior therapy that would make the individual unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with dosing requirements Participation in any other clinical trial (including observational trials) without prior approval from the sponsor is prohibited while participating in this trial Receiving ongoing therapy with any disallowed medications, including any drugs not to be used with elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide or known allergies to the excipients of E/C/F/TAF STR Note: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
