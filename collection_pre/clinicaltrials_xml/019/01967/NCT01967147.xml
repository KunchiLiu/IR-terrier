	<brief_title>Clinical Outcomes Following Treatment With Systane® Balance in Dry Eye Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consisted of 4 visits conducted during 3 sequential phases: the Run-in Phase (which included a screening visit and run-in period), Treatment Phase I and Treatment Phase II. In Phase I, subjects were randomized to either Systane® Balance or Saline and dosed 4 times a day for 35 days. In Phase II (Day 35-90) subjects continued to dose with their assigned product on an as-needed basis.</detailed_description>
