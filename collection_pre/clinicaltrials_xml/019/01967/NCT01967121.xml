	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine if the application of ice, control group, or a muscle stimulation program from the CompexÂ® series can help reduce or eliminate delayed muscle soreness from performing leg extension and flexion. Individuals will complete a health history questionnaire to determine if they qualify for this study. We will measure your leg girth with a measuring tape and take a pain measurement of your hamstrings by using a spring to press down on your leg. Individuals will then warm-up on a bike without resistance for 5 minutes followed by 10 regular leg extension and flexion exercises. Individuals will then perform 6 sets of 10 leg extension and flexion exercises on a biodex machine (similar to leg curl machines in the gym). Individuals will perform each set to the maximum effort of their capables. After each set of 10 individuals will have a 2 minute rest. We will ask you to rank your leg soreness on a scale from 1-10. Individuals will then be assigned to a modality of either ice, control group or compex. Individuals will perform the modality (ice, control, compex) we assign you to until you are no longer sore. Over the next five days individuals will return to measure their level of soreness, leg girth and pain pressure. This study will examine the following hypotheses: H1: There will be no difference in pressure pain threshold after using the Compex compared to other groups. H2: There will be no difference in perceived soreness after using the Compex compared to other groups. H3: There will be no difference in muscular strength after using the Compex compared to other groups. H4: There will be no difference in active range of motion after using the Compex compared to other groups.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The studied population will be composed of 45 physically active college students between the ages of 1830 years old. Inclusionary criteria will be participation in a physical activity as defined by the ACSM, which can be a mixture of moderate (i.e., sufficient to raise the heart rate and begin to sweat) and vigorous (i.e., breathing hard and fast with a rapidly rising heart rate) intensity aerobic activity and muscle strengthening (i.e., weights lifted to the point where anther repetition cannot be completed without help) activities two or more time per week (ACSM, 2011.) Exclusionary criteria will be surgery within the last six months requiring immobilization for more than four weeks, discomfort performing intense physical activity, diseases like muscular dystrophy that predispose muscular damage beyond reasonable levels resulting from physical activity, and current injury of the knees or hips.</criteria>
