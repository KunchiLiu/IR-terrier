	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is to find a marker expression that the investigators can use to trace symptom progression and develop a more efficient therapy to enhance ARDS patient survival rate and better post-ICU life quality.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarker of Lung Injury in ARDS Patients Receiving ECMO Support</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will first identify acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients receiving ECMO support in ICU at National Taiwan University Hospital, and then collect blood, urine and bronchioalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples at different time points: before setting up ECMO, 2, 6, 12, 24, 72 hours,5 and 14 days after ECMO installment, time to wean ECMO and the day removing ECMO and leaving ICU. From the samples, the free radicals, cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18,tumor necrosis factor-α, transforming growth factor-β), and inflammasome- related markers, immune cell responses and other biochemical markers would be measured. The novel biomarkers to predict the outcome of the patient will be identified.</detailed_description>
