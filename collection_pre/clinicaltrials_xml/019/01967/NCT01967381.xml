	<brief_summary>The research proposed in this application will determine the initial efficacy, safety and tolerability of a novel drug combination, oxazepam (Serax®) and naltrexone (Revia®), as a pharmacotherapy for methamphetamine (Desoxyn®) dependence. A rigorous, inpatient human laboratory study will be conducted. The proposed study is innovative and important because it will provide the impetus for the conduct of double blind, placebo-controlled trials to further demonstrate the efficacy of combined oxazepam and naltrexone for managing methamphetamine dependence.</brief_summary>
