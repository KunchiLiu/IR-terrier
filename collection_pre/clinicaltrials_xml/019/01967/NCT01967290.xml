	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine the impact of vibratory feedback on the quality and intensity of a common motor rehabilitation task of the upper-arm (hand-to-mouth) in stroke patients. For that purpose the investigators use the SWORD system that combines 3D motion quantification wearable sensors and a vibratory module. The investigators hypothesize that vibratory stimuli during a motor rehabilitation task increase significantly the number of correct movements performed per unit of time. The design of the study is a cross-over randomized clinical trial. With the SWORD system in place each patient will perform the hand-to-mouth task twice (with vibratory feedback and without it), the order being random. The number of correct movements and other motor outcomes will be assessed continuously under both conditions.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>More than 18 years old at stroke onset, with no superior age limit; Medical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke; First ever stroke; Previously independent, defined as having a modified Rankin scale (mRS) of 01; Clinical and CT or MRI compatible with a medial cerebral artery ischemic lesion; Confirmed motor deficit on the upper limb but not plegia (able to actively extend wrist, thumb, and at least 2 other digits &gt;10Â°), defined as a score between 0 and 2 on items 5a or 5b of the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale; Inpatients, within no more than 4 weeks after stroke onset; Medically stable, no intravenous medication and already able to sit for more than one hour comfortably; Favourable opinion of the attending stroke physician; Patient and caregiver understand the purpose of the study and provided written informed consent. No detectable motor deficits at baseline assessment by the neurologist; Severe aphasia; Dementia (any stage); Other cognitive or psychiatric comorbidity that impairs communication or compliance with the tasks; Severe respiratory or cardiac condition incompatible with more than one minute of continuous mild exercise (e.g. combing hair) in a sitting position; Pain that limits upper limb movement either on the normal or affected side; Upper limb amputation or severe deformity either on the normal or affected side; Fixed articular limitations of upper limb either on the normal or affected side; Enrollment in other trial in the previous 3 months.</criteria>
