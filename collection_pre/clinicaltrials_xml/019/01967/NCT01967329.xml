	<brief_title>CANHelp Working Group Treatment Trials</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The CANHelp Working Group is a collaborative team that links University of Alberta researchers with Canadian northern community leaders and health officials in a collaborative effort to investigate H. pylori infection with the goal of finding solutions to community concerns about health risks. The research program uses a community-driven research approach in northern communities to characterize the burden of disease from H. pylori infection and exchange knowledge with community members and decision makers to identify ways to reduce health risks from this infection. For the participating communities, the treatment trials aim to: 1. Estimate the effectiveness of alternate H. pylori treatment regimens to identify optimal regimens for the local setting 2. Identify factors external to the treatment regimen that influence short- and long-term treatment success</detailed_description>
