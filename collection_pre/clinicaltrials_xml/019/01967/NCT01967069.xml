	<criteria>Subjects must present with a clinical diagnosis of stable (at least 3 months) plaquetype psoriasis. Subjects with psoriasis involving 10 to 20% BSA, not including the face, scalp, groin, axillae and other intertriginous areas. Subjects must have an IGA grade of 3 (moderate) at the Baseline Visit Current diagnosis of unstable forms of psoriasis including guttate, erythrodermic, exfoliative or pustular psoriasis Other inflammatory skin disease that may confound the evaluation of the plaque psoriasis (e.g., atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, tinea corporis). Presence of pigmentation, extensive scarring, or pigmented lesions or sunburn which could interfere with the rating of efficacy parameters. History of psoriasis unresponsive to topical treatments. History of organ transplant requiring immunosuppression, HIV, or other immunocompromised state. Use within 180 days prior to Baseline Visit of biologic treatment for psoriasis (e.g., infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept, ustekinumab, or alefacept). Have received treatment for any type of cancer within 5 years of the Baseline Visit except skin cancer and cervical cancer (in situ) are allowed within 1 year of the Baseline Visit. Use within 60 days prior to the Baseline Visit of: 1) immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., tacrolimus, pimecrolimus), 2) systemic antipsoriatic treatment (e.g., methotrexate, cyclosporine, hydroxyurea) or 3) oral retinoids (e.g., acitretin, isotretinoin). Use within 30 days prior to the Baseline Visit of: 1) systemic steroids, 2) PUVA therapy, 3) systemic antiinflammatory agents (e.g., mycophenolate mofetil, sulfasalazine, 6thioguanine), or 4) UVB therapy. Inhaled, intraocular, and intranasal steroids are allowed. Use within 14 days prior to the Baseline Visit of: 1) topical antipsoriatic drugs (e.g., salicylic acid, anthralin, coal tar, calcipotriene), 2) topical retinoids (e.g., tazarotene, tretinoin) or 3) topical corticosteroids. Require use of beta blockers, lithium, ACE inhibitors, and/or NSAIDs (indomethacin, ibuprofen, aspirin, naproxen) with a medical history that these medications affect the subject's psoriasis, except if the subject has been using the medication routinely during the 180 days prior to the Baseline Visit, these medications are allowed.</criteria>
