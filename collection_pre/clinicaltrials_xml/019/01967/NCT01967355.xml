	<brief_summary>Preeclampsia is a disease which occurs in about 6-8% of all pregnancies and is the main cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The cause of preeclampsia is still not clear and the only therapy is preterm caesarean section. In severe preeclampsia an accumulation of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins occurs. Therefore, lipid apheresis is performed as lipid-removing therapy for treatment of preeclampsia in order to prolong pregnancy and provide the fetus more time for maturation. In this individual treatment patients with early preeclampsia (&lt;= 32 weeks of gestation) will be offered a H.E.L.P.-apheresis to postpone caesarean section and therefore prolong pregnancy.</brief_summary>
