	<detailed_description>A randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of methotrexate for the prevention of postmolar gestational trophoblastic disease among patients with high-risk hydatidiform mole. Women who will undergo suction curettage for complete hydatidiform mole at the Philippine General Hospital, who are at risk for developing postmolar gestational trophoblastic disease will be included in the study. Patients will receive either a single course of methotrexate or vitamin B complex (Benutrex) within fourteen days from molar evacuation. Patients' serum beta HCG will be monitored 1 week after molar evacuation and then every 2 weeks until the titers become normal for three consecutive determinations, then monthly for 6 months (every 2 months for the next 6 months).</detailed_description>
