	<brief_title>ACTHAR for Acute Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients With Inadequate Response to Methotrexate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard treatment for rheumatoid arthritis is using disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs such as methotrexate to control joint pain and swelling. Often times rheumatoid arthritis patients experience inadequate response to methotrexate with acute or persistent joint pain and swelling. In these patients, alternative or additional immunosuppressive therapy is needed to induce disease remission. In the present clinical trial, ACTHAR is being studied to induce disease remission on rheumatoid arthritis patients who have inadequate response to methotrexate therapy.</detailed_description>
