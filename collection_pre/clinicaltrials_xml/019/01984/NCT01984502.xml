	<brief_summary>The feasibility of reducing fractions in early-stage laryngeal cancer has not previously been prospectively studied, and we will therefore conduct a careful phase I bio-equivalent dose fraction reduction study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients enrolled at each dose level will undergo routine evaluations to identify potential toxicities as well functional voice analyses. Adequate waiting periods will be used to ensure that fraction reduction does not proceed prior to observing toxicity. The purpose of the study will be either to determine the maximal fraction reduction possible until a dose is reached where a dose-limiting toxicity occurs. The initial dose and fractionation will be 50 Gy in 15 fractions with the goal to reduce number of fractions to a dose of 42.5 Gy in 5 fractions. The rationale for using 5 fractions is that it is tolerated in centrally located lung tumors at a dose of 50 Gy in 5 fractions, and thus, is likely to be tolerated in large calliber airways.</detailed_description>
