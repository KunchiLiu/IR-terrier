	<brief_summary>Hip VISION (Pilot Study) is a Prospective Observational Cohort Study to evaluate the incidence of overall and cause-specific mortality among consecutive patients aged ≥ 18 years presenting with hip fracture to the Juravinski Hospital of the Hamilton Health Sciences. This pilot study will assess the feasibility of a larger prospective international cohort study. After eligibility has been confirmed and informed consent has been obtained, participants will be registered in the study. Troponin level, complete blood counts and serum creatinine level will be collected at day 1 through day 10 post admission. CAM instrument will be employed at admission and once daily post admission day 1 through day 10. FIM Instrument will be administered within 72 hours of admission to establish pre-fracture functional independence and disability. Patients will be contacted by research personnel by telephone 30 days after study registration.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patients aged ≥ 18 years with hip fractures (i.e. fractures involving the subcapital, femoral neck, or intertrochanteric regions), treated either operatively or nonoperatively 2. Mechanism of injury consistent with either: 1. A fall from a standing height or; 2. Another mechanism of injury which, in the clinical judgment of an orthopedic surgeon, would impart the same or less traumatic energy as a fall from a standing height 1. Patients with fractures isolated to the proximal femoral shaft, with no involvement of the intertrochanteric, femoral neck, or subcapital region 2. Patients with hip fractures resulting from high energy mechanisms, such as motor vehicle accidents or falls from a substantial height 3. Patient who refuse 30day or 6month follow up 4. Patients who refuse to consent either by themselves or through a substitute decisionmaker (for patients unable to consent, we will use a deferred consent process, as described below).</criteria>
