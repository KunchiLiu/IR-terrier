	<brief_summary>Obesity is a growing epidemic throughout the world and is followed by increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes that accounts for 90-95% of all cases of diabetes. Weight loss is a major objective, although difficult to achieve with medical treatments. Many recent studies demonstrated that bariatric surgery has the potency to achieve marked and sustained weight loss, and is also associated with a significant improvement in control of type 2 diabetes. The principal aim of this study is to compare two types of bariatric procedures, the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). The study hypothesis is that these procedures have equal efficacy with regard to resolution of type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
