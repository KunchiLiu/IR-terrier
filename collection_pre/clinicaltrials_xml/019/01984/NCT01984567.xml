	<brief_summary>Background of the study: We now know that plant sterols can oxidize, which results in the formation of oxyphytosterols. Animal studies have suggested that oxyphytosterols are atherogenic components, however this relation has not yet been studied in humans. In our previous study (METC 09-3-088) we have shown in healthy volunteers that serum oxyphytosterol concentrations are linked to oxidative stress status (i.e. we were able to identify high and low sterol oxidizers). From the literature is known that especially type II diabetics and IGT subjects are characterized by increased oxidative stress markers and reduced antioxidant capacity. For this reason we also want to evaluate the oxyphytosterol concentrations in this population. Moreover, we know propose to evaluate the effect of antioxidant supplementation, i.e. vitamin E or lipoic acid, on serum oxyphytosterol concentrations in type II diabetic patients. If possible to lower oxyphytosterol concentrations in these populations this is obviously beneficial in case oxyphytosterols turn out to be atherogenic. The major objective of the present study is to examine the effect of consuming vitamin E (804 mg) or lipoic acid (600 mg) for 4 weeks on fasting oxyphytosterol concentrations in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
