	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a course of injections containing Poly-ICLC in patients with advanced solid tumors that can be easily and safely reached with a needle. Poly-ICLC is a compound that has been used to help the body in its fight against cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Solid Tumors With Intratumoral Hiltonol® (Poly-ICLC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize that this therapeutic in-situ autovaccination strategy is comprised of three immunomodulatory steps. The first is the innate immune local tumor killing induced by intratumoral Hiltonol (via NK, TNF, etc). A very close second step is optimal Th1-weighted priming through the in-situ combination of the poly-ICLC danger signal with the tumor antigens released in step 1 and further processed and cross-presented by poly-ICLC activated mDC, etc. The repeated administration of the Hiltonol danger signal IT in the context of the patient's own tumor antigens and in a way that mimics a natural viral infection may be critical to this step. Once the system is optimally primed, the third step is targeting and maintenance of the immune response and its facilitation at remote tumor sites with IM poly-ICLC through chemokine release, inflammasome activation and other costimulatory factors.</detailed_description>
