	<brief_summary>This study aims at determine if Progressive Heavy Load Exercises (PHLE) as treatment for patients diagnosed with Rotator Cuff Tendinopathy is superior to "Standard Low-Load Exercises" (LLE).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rotator Cuff Tendinopathy Exercise Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial will be performed as a multicenter randomised controlled trail, including 110 patients diagnosed with Rotator Cuff Tendinopathy from four orthopaedic shoulder clinics in secondary sector in Denmark. The PHLE intervention will consist of progressive strengthening exercises performed with heavy load dumbbells, targeting the rotator cuff in a 12 weeks home-exercise program with six control visits at a physiotherapy department at the hospitals. The LLE exercise program consists of the same exercises as the PHLE, but performed with low load dumbbells. "Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire" is used as the primary outcome and is measured 12 weeks post baseline. 12 months post baseline a secondary follow-up will be performed primarily measuring the number of patients referred to an operation. Patients will be randomised to either PHLE or LLE regime by blocks according to whether they have been referred to corticosteroid injection by their orthopaedic shoulder specialist. *April 2015: (We originally expected to be able to include 260 patients in order to analyze our data according to the sub-groups of exercise group +/- Corticosteroid injection, but inclusion rate has been much lower then expected, and due to time restraints we only expect to include 110 patients) Primary investigator and patients will be blinded towards group assignment.</detailed_description>
