	<brief_summary>This study is a prospective open phase-I study to investigate the safety and tolerability for administration of repeated doses of ALECSAT. Each patient will be followed up to 24 weeks from the initial blood donation to the last visit. However, the actual treatment starts on day 26, when the first single dose of ALECSAT is administered. The following administrations are given with 3 weeks intervals, i.e. at week 7 and 10. The patients are attending Kirurgisk afdeling K, Bispebjerg Hospital, and are followed by close examinations during the study period and at regular visits after completing the study as advised by the patient's responsible physician.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study is a prospective open phase-I study to investigate the safety and tolerability for administration of repeated doses of ALECSAT. Each patient will be followed up to 24 weeks from the initial blood donation to the last visit. However, the actual treatment starts on day 26, when the first single dose of ALECSAT is administered. The following administrations are given with 3 weeks intervals, i.e. at week 7 and 10. The patients are attending Kirurgisk afdeling K, Bispebjerg Hospital, and are followed by close examinations during the study period and at regular visits after completing the study as advised by the patient's responsible physician. The selected group of patients suffers from locally advanced pancreatic cancer and have been treated with first line treatment regimens (e.g. surgery, radiotherapy, and/or Folfirinox) and are followed at Kirurgisk afdeling K, Bispebjerg Hospital. The subjects will be recruited consecutively and included to the study if they fulfil the inclusion criteria and do not meet any of the exclusion criteria. Potential candidates will receive oral information by the Investigator subsequent to the written patient information. The potential candidate must have the opportunity to consider the given information and to further ask the Investigator questions before finally deciding to participate. When the patient decides to take part in the study he/she will be required to sign the declaration of consent.</detailed_description>
