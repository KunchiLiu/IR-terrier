	<brief_summary>This multicenter, randomized, open-label study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of atezolizumab as monotherapy or in combination with bevacizumab versus sunitinib in participants with histologically confirmed, previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma who have not received prior systemic therapy either in the adjuvant or metastatic setting.</brief_summary>
