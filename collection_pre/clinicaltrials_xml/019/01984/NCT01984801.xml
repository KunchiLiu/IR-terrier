	<brief_summary>The proposed indication for GSK1940029 is topical treatment of acne, the early clinical plan will evaluate the irritation potential of GSK1940029 (Study SCD117225 - 3 Part study); and safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of GSK1940029 (Study SCD117226 - 2 Part study), after topical administration on healthy subjects and acne patients. Study SCD117225 will be a randomized, single-blind, three part study, to evaluate the primary irritation potential (Part 1), cumulative irritation potential (Part 2) of two concentrations of GSK1940029 gel applied to the intact skin of healthy subjects, and the facial irritation potential of one or two concentrations of GSK1940029 applied to the face of acne patients (Part3). In Part 1 and Part 2 the following 6 treatments will be applied using individual patches: (A) 200 milligrams (mg) of 0.3% GSK1940029 gel, (B) 200 mg of 1% GSK1940029 gel, (C) 200 mg of 0.3%/1% vehicle gel only (vehicle control), (D) 200 microliters (µL) of sterile distilled water (negative irritant control), (E) 200 µL of - 0.5% sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) in sterile distilled water for Part 1/0.1% SLS in sterile distilled water for Part 2 (positive irritant control), and (F) Patch only (patch control). Each treatment will be randomized to one of six designated locations on either upper arm or other locations, such as the lower or upper back, within each subject. The same treatment will be reapplied to the same location on subsequent days. Each treatment will be applied daily for 2 days in Part 1, and daily for 21 days in Part 2. In Part 3, each patient will apply a thin coat of one or two concentration of GSK1940029 gel or vehicle to acne affected facial/neck skin by hand, once daily for 28 days. Parts within Study SCD117225 and Study SCD117226 will have interdependencies. No significant primary irritation signal in Study SCD117225 Part 1 would allow initiation of Study SCD117226 Part 1 (single dose application). Once safety, tolerability and exposure information are determined in Study SCD117226 Part 1, Part 2 of Study SCD117225 may be initiated along with Part 2 (14-day repeat dose application). No significant cumulative irritation signal (study SCD117225 Part 2) in combination with adequate 14-day safety (study SCD117226 Part 2) would allow initiation of Part 3 of Study SCD117225.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Acne Vulgaris</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring for Parts 1 and 2 only. Moderate/Moderate to Severe acne patients, otherwise healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring for Part 3 only. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy [for this definition, "documented" refers to the outcome of the investigator's/designee's review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records]; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 milli international units (MIU)/millilitres (mL) and estradiol &lt;40 picograms (pg)/mL (&lt;147 picomoles [pmol]/liter [L]) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will not be allowed. Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use one of the contraception methods. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until after study followup visit. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;=1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%). Based on single or averaged assessments, QT duration corrected for heart rate (QTc) &lt;450 msec; or QTc &lt;480 msec in subjects with bundle branch block. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 months of screening Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome for all study Parts and asymptomatic gallstones for Parts 1 and 2 only). Subjects with a history of gall stones, asymptomatic gallstones or cholecystectomy will be excluded. A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen. A positive test for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) antibody. History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: an average weekly intake of &gt;14 standard drinks. One standard drink is equivalent to 10 grams (g) of alcohol: 285 mL of beer, 100 mL of wine or 30 mL of 40% alcohol by volume distilled spirits. History of or current meibomian gland dysfunction or dry eye disease History or presence of significant skin disorder (such as but not limited to severe (extensive) atopic dermatitis, severe eczema, psoriasis or skin cancer) that would in any way confound interpretation of the study results, or subjects who present with damaged skin including sunburn, moles, uneven skin tones, scar tissue, tattoos, body piercings, sunburn, branding or other disfiguration on or near the intended site of application which could interfere with the grading.
