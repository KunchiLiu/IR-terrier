	<brief_summary>The study is divided into 3 parts (A, B, C). Part A is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period cross-over rechallenge of atorvastatin 20 mg. Part B is a 24-week double-blind, double-dummy comparison of evolocumab and ezetimibe. Part C is a 2-year open-label evolocumab extension. The primary hypothesis is that evolocumab will be well tolerated and will result in greater reduction of LDL-C than ezetimibe, defined by the mean percent change from baseline at Weeks 22 and 24 of Part B and percent change from baseline at Week 24 of Part B, in statin-intolerant hypercholesterolemic subjects.</brief_summary>
