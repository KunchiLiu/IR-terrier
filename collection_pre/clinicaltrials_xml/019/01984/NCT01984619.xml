	<brief_title>Prospective Study Evaluating the Treatment of Hyperdynamic Forehead Wrinkles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Male or Females 1865 years of age. Forehead wrinkle(s) rating of at least 2 in animation on the 5point Wrinkle Scale (5WS) which upon physical manipulation of the skin demonstrates a reduction in wrinkle severity. Subject has at least a 2 point difference between resting and dynamic forehead wrinkle scores using the 5WS. Glabellar wrinkle score of "1" or higher in animation on the 5point Glabella Scale (5GS). Fitzpatrick Skin Type I, II, III, or IV. Subject has consented and agreed to participate in all study procedures and visits for the study's duration. Subject is in good general health, free of any disease state, or physical condition that might impair evaluation of forehead and/or glabellar wrinkle rating or which, in the Investigator's opinion, exposes the subject to an unacceptable risk by study participation. Subject has a clotting disorder or coagulopathy that requires use of an anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet therapy (e.g., warfarin, clopidigrel, etc.) Subject has used medication or supplements affecting clotting cascade (e.g., aspirin, fish oil, etc.), or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, e.g., ibuprofen and naproxen) within seven (7) days prior to administration of the device. Subject has had prior surgery that alters the subcutaneous anatomy of the target treatment sites. Subject has undergone another surgical cosmetic procedure or botulinum toxin injection at or above the level of the zygoma (cheekbones) within the past six (6) months prior to administration of the device. Subject has a resting wrinkle score of "3" or higher on the 5WS. Subjects who actively elevate forehead at rest. Subject has been treated with fillers in the temple or forehead area in the time intervals specified prior to the start of their participation in the study. Subject has any of the following: 1. Dermatochalasis with &lt;1mm lid margin when looking straight ahead. 2. Excessive skin laxity. 3. Asymmetry in the upper face. 4. History of facial nerve palsy. 5. Eyebrow or eyelid ptosis. 6. History of neuromuscular disorder. 7. Chronic dry eye symptoms. 8. Allergy or intolerance to local anesthetic agents (e.g., Lidocaine). 9. Use of narcotic medication for a chronic pain condition. 10. Any other clinically significant, in the opinion of the Investigator, local skin condition (e.g., skin infection) at target treatment site that may interfere or be a safety concern. 11. Any physical or psychiatric condition that in the Investigator's opinion would prevent adequate study participation. 12. Chronic medical condition that in the Investigator's opinion would affect study participation (such as uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes, hepatitis, HIV, etc.). 13. Diagnosis of: Cryoglobinemia Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria Cold Uticaria Raynaud's Disease Open and/or infected wounds Existing neuromuscular disease 14. Fitzpatrick Skin Type V or IV 15. Subject is currently enrolled in an investigational drug, biologic or device study that could affect the safety or effectiveness of the iovera° treatment. 16. Subject is known to be noncompliant or is unlikely to comply with the requirements of the study protocol in the opinion of the Investigator.</criteria>
