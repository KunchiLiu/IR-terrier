	<brief_summary>Cardiac catheterization is the most important test for the evaluation of cardiac patients. Since the beginning of the cardiac catheterization procedure, we have used the femoral artery puncture as a gateway for those procedures. Recently it is used more often the path for the radial. Using this approach has gained many followers worldwide and has been used almost routinely in our country but has not gained popularity because many interventional cardiologists argue that the transradial procedure is much more time-consuming and difficult. Research question: Are there differences in the total procedure time path between radial and femoral vascular to perform cardiac catheterizations?. This research focuses on the search for information to determine whether there are significant differences when the variables under study. This research is justified by the need to evaluate the two techniques in use and the lack of studies evaluating and comparing the radial arterial access in comparison with femoral access route which is widely used in all services hemodynamics national and international. The lack of research on the subject has made the use of the transradial procedure routinely not being done, because they have the idea that it is much more time-consuming and technically more difficult than the procedure performed by the femoral approach, hence Hemodynamics specialists, not everyone wants to start implementing the systematic use of the radial approach for cardiac catheterization studies.The main objective of this project is to determine the non-inferiority in terms of total procedure time path between radial and femoral vascular to perform cardiac catheterizations. Secondary objectives: the difference in time of puncture, duration of the procedure and recovery. Incidence of vascular complications and techniques between radial and femoral, presence of complications at 8 days of follow-up. Our aims to check through the results, if the difference in each of the variables favoring either of the two techniques and to determine the non-inferiority of one technique over the other in terms of ease and effectiveness of both procedures. The type of study is a controlled clinical trial open, randomized, non-inferiority. The study population will consist of patients who have been told the diagnostic cardiac catheterization, they are sent to the General Clinic Northern institution.</brief_summary>
