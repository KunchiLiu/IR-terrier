	<brief_title>CONVERGE - Epi/Endo Ablation For Treatment of Persistent Atrial Fibrillation(AF)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this randomized pivotal study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the AtriCure EPi-Sense®-AF Guided Coagulation System with VisiTrax® for the treatment of symptomatic persistent Atrial Fibrillation (AF) patients, refractory or intolerant to at least one Class I or Class III anti-arrhythmic drug (AAD). 153 subjects from up to 27 US and 3 OUS sites. Randomized 2:1. The primary efficacy endpoint is success or failure to be AF/AT/AFL free absent class I and III AADs except for a previously failed or intolerant class I or III AAD with no increase in dosage following the 3-month blanking period through the 12-month post procedure follow-up visit. The primary safety endpoint is the incidence of major adverse events (MAEs) listed in the protocol for subjects undergoing the convergent procedure for the procedural to 30-day post procedure time period.</detailed_description>
