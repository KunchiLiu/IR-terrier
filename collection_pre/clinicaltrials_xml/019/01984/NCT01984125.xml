	<brief_summary>Although most US adolescents visit their primary care doctor, their immunization rates are low. Primary care practices from two networks, one in upstate New York as well as a national network of pediatric clinics were surveyed to ask what they thought was the best strategy to increase immunization rates. Point-of-care prompts (either by an electronic health record message or by a nurse) when an adolescent patient comes in for any type of visit and is due for a vaccine was chosen. This study will determine if these prompts will increase immunization rates after a 12-month intervention period.</brief_summary>
