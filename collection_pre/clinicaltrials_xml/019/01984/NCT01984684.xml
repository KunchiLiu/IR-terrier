Women who are pregnant or lactating. Any chronic or underlying skin condition at the site of infection that may complicate the assessment of response, including infection involving a prosthetic joint, human or animal bite, osteomyelitis, decubitus ulcer, diabetic foot ulcer, septic arthritis, mediastinitis, necrotizing fasciitis, anaerobic cellulitis, or synergistic necrotizing cellulitis, myositis, tendinitis, endocarditis, sustained shock, gangrene or gas gangrene; burns covering ≥10% of body surface area; severely compromised immune system, severely impaired arterial blood supply to an extremity with an ABSSSI, deep vein thrombosis or superficial thrombophlebitis, and requiring either an amputation or multiple debridement procedures. Any underlying disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, could interfere with the subject's ability to participate in the study including severe cardiac disease, known history of liver disease, endstage renal disease, malignancy, psychiatric disorder, ongoing treatment for seizures or untreated history of seizures, or life expectancy of &lt; 3 months.</criteria>
