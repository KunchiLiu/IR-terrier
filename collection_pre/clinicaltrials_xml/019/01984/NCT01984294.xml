	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the antiviral efficacy of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) fixed-dose combination (FDC) plus ribavirin (RBV) or LDV/SOF plus GS-9669 in treatment-naive or treatment-experienced participants with chronic genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. A total of 90 participants are planned to be enrolled in the study for 8 weeks of treatment, approximately 60 having had prior treatment with a regimen containing pegylated interferon (PEG) and RBV for ≥ 12 weeks. Randomization will be stratified by treatment-naive versus treatment-experienced and by HCV genotype (1a versus 1b).</brief_summary>
