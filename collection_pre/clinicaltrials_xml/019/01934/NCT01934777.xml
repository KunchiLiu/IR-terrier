	<brief_summary>The purpose of this interventional study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), Vitamin E and Choline in children or adolescents with well-characterized and liver biopsy confirmed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Tolerance of Treatment With DHA, Choline and Vitamin E in Children With Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sixty children or adolescents (4-16 years) with liver biopsy proven NAFLD will be enrolled. They will be randomized to treatment with DHA, VIT E and Choline (n=30)or an identical placebo (n=30) given orally for a period of 12 months. All patients will be included in a lifestyle intervention program consisting of a diet tailored on the individual requirements and physical exercise. Patients will undergo a medical evaluation every three months during the 12-month study period. Liver biopsy will be performed at baseline and at 12 months. Anthropometric analysis, laboratory tests, including liver enzymes and lipids will be repeated at 3-month intervals during the 12-months study duration. Ultrasonography of the liver will be repeated after six months at the end of the study period.</detailed_description>
