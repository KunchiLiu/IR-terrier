	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: • To determine the safety and tolerability of single and multiple ascending oral doses of CHR-5154 in healthy volunteers. Secondary Objectives: - To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of CHR-5154 and its metabolite CHR-5426. - To compare the pharmacokinetic profile of CHR-5154 and CHR-5426 after a single dose of CHR-5154 in the fed and fasted state.</brief_summary>
