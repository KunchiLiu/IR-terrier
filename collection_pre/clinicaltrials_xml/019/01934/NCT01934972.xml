	<brief_summary>Individuals with bipolar suffer from problems in basic cognitive skills such as memory and concentration. Unfortunately, there are no current treatments that have been shown to improve cognitive skills among individuals with bipolar disorder. Computerized cognitive remediation (CR) is a treatment that has been shown to improve cognitive skills among individuals with serious mental illnesses other than bipolar disorder, such as schizophrenia. This treatment involves completing a series of activities on a computer that have been shown to improve cognitive skills. D-cycloserine (DCS) is an antibiotic traditionally used in the treatment of tuberculosis. Recent studies have suggested that this drug may also improve individuals' ability to learn. Thus, the goal of our study is to examine whether receipt of d-cycloserine increases the benefit that individuals receive from participation in cognitive remediation. To test this hypothesis, approximately forty subjects will be randomized to one of two study arms: [i] CR + DCS or [ii] CR + placebo. We will examine whether d-cycloserine increases the benefit that individuals with bipolar disorder receive from participation in cognitive remediation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Trial of Cognitive Remediation and D-cycloserine for Individuals With Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals with bipolar disorder suffer from a broad array of cognitive deficits that may hinder their ability to achieve successful community functioning. Consequently, greater attention has recently been directed toward the development of strategies to ameliorate these cognitive deficits. One strategy which has been shown to be successful in this endeavor is cognitive remediation (CR). This intervention, which is recognized as a "best practice" in the treatment of serious mental illness, is typically comprised of a series of repeated exercises delivered by a clinician or via a computer that are designed to improve performance in cognitive functioning. Yet, despite the promise of cognitive remediation, the benefit of this intervention among individuals with bipolar disorder has yet to be investigated. Recently, studies have demonstrated that d-cycloserine (DCS), an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) agonist, may facilitate the learning process for emotional and non-emotional information in both humans and animals. These results raise the possibility that DCS may increase the benefits associated with the receipt of cognitive remediation among individuals with bipolar disorder. To date, we are unaware of any study which has examined whether concurrent receipt of DCS may increase the benefits produced by cognitive remediation among individuals with a severe mental illness. Thus, we propose to complete an exploratory investigation of augmenting cognitive remediation with DCS among individuals with bipolar disorder. Approximately forty subjects will be randomized to one of two study arms: [i] CR + DCS; or [ii] CR + placebo. The primary outcome of interest will be changes in cognitive functioning before and after receipt of the cognitive remediation intervention. Secondary outcomes of interest will be changes in symptomatology, social and vocational functioning, and performance of tasks of everyday living.</detailed_description>
