	<brief_summary>This clinical trial will study the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics of single doses of MK-8892 in participants with PAH. The primary objective is to estimate the measured peak effect of the highest acutely tolerated (HAT) single oral dose of MK-8892 on pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR).</brief_summary>
