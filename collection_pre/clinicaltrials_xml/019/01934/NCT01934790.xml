	<brief_summary>Eligible subjects must have completed 6 doses of treatment of radium-223 dichloride and experienced no radium-223 dichloride-related SAEs (serious adverse events) or CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) Grade 3 or 4 adverse event during or after the initial course of radium-223 dichloride that led to the discontinuation of treatment. 40 Subjects will be enrolled and will receive up to 6 doses of radium-223 dichloride 50 kBq/kg IV every 4 weeks. The subject will be evaluated for AEs (adverse events) and laboratory tests at each visit every 4 weeks, prior to receiving radium-223 dichloride. After the end of treatment visit the subjects will enter the active follow up period. Related AEs and SAEs and Lab tests will be evaluated at each visit every 4 weeks for the first 12 weeks, then every 12 weeks for up to 2 years after the last dose of radium-223 dichloride. After the 2 years of active follow-up, subjects will enter the long-term follow-up period and will be followed via telephone follow-up at 6-month intervals for late toxicities and survival up to 7 years after the last dose of radium-223 dichloride or until death. Joint safety reviews will regularly take place to oversee safety of the subjects conducted at regular intervals. An interim analysis of the safety data will be conducted during the study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate at any given point in time during disease history CRPC (castrationresistant prostate cancer) with clinical or radiologically confirmed bone progression Treatment with 6 injections of radium223 dichloride 50 kBq/kg and no evidence of progression to bone (according to Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 [PCWG2] criteria) during the first course of treatment Signed written informed consent prior to participating in any study related procedures. Willing and able to comply with the protocol, including followup visits and examinations History of a radium223 dichloriderelated serious adverse event (SAE) or CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 adverse event (AE) during or after the initial course of radium223 dichloride treatment that led to the discontinuation of treatment Less than 30 days from the last dose administered in the initial course of radium223 dichloride treatment Visceral metastases 1 cm or greater in largest diameter and / or requiring local or systemic therapeutic intervention, as assessed by abdominal and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) / computed tomography (CT) scan and / or chest Xray within 30 days of the start of treatment Lymphadenopathy with lymph nodes exceeding 6 cm in shortaxis diameter and / or requiring local or systemic therapeutic intervention. Enlarged lymph nodes of any size if the lymphadenopathy is thought to be a contributor to concurrent hydronephrosis. Current central nervous system (CNS) metastases Chronic conditions associated with nonmalignant abnormal bone growth (e.g., confirmed Paget's disease of bone) Treatment with chemotherapy after the initial course of radium223 dichloride treatment Prior hemibody external radiotherapy Prior systemic radiotherapy with strontium89, samarium153, rhenium186, or rhenium188 Any other serious illness or medical conditions Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis History of documented bone marrow dysplasia Unmanageable fecal incontinence Imminent or established spinal cord compression based on clinical findings and / or MRI that has not yet been treated Other malignancy treated within the last 3 years (except nonmelanoma skin cancer or lowgrade superficial bladder cancer)</criteria>
