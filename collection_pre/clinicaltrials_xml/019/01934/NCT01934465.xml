	<brief_summary>Investigators propose to assess, retrospectively and prospectively the safety and tolerability profile (number of participants with adverse events) of standard chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic agent bevacizumab (Avastin) as first line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer. All treatment schedules that are going to be assessed are considered by the international guidelines as standard therapy for patients with advanced or metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In addition investigators propose to assess the compliance of patients to treatment and the efficacy of treatment. That means percentage of objective responses, duration of response, progression free survival and estimation of overall survival</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Signed informed consent prior to initiation of any trialspecific procedure or treatment Ability to comply with the protocol Histologically or cytologically (sample to be obtained by biopsy or bronchoscopy) confirmed nonsquamous NSCLC (locally recurrent or metastatic) per investigator assessment At least 1 unidimensionally measurable lesion meeting RECIST criteria No prior first line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer Age ≥18 years ECOG performance status ≤2 Adequate haematological, renal and hepatic function Urine protein &lt;2+ (dipstick) International normalized ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤ 1.5 x ULN within 7 days prior to randomization, unless there is prophylactic use of anticoagulation Patients with asymptomatic treated brain metastases are eligible for trial participation. Patients must complete treatment for brain metastases (radiotherapy with or without surgery, or stereotactic radiosurgery), including steroids, at least 28 days prior to randomization. Treatment with anticonvulsants at the time of randomization (i.e. ≥ 28 days) is allowed as long as the anticonvulsant is at a stable dose) Female patients must not be pregnant or breastfeeding. Female patients of childbearing potential (defined as &gt;2 years after last menstruation or surgically sterile) must use a highly effective contraceptive method (allowed methods of birth control, i.e. with a failure rate of less than 1% per year, are implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, intrauterine device [IUD; only hormonspirals], sexual abstinence or vasectomized partner) during the trial and for a period of at least 6 months following the last administration of trial drug(s).Female patients with an intact uterus (unless amenorrhoeic for the last 24 months) must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to randomization into the trial Fertile male patients must agree to use a highly effective contraceptive method (allowed methods of birth control, i.e. with a failure rate of less than 1% per year, include a female partner using implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, IUDs [only hormonspirals], sexual abstinence or prior vasectomy) during the trial and for a period of at least 6 months following the last administration of trial drug(s) Mixed, nonsmall cell and small cell tumors or mixed adenosquamous carcinomas with a predominant squamous component History of hemoptysis ≥ grade 2 (defined as bright red blood of at least 2.5 mL) within 3 months prior to randomization Surgery (including open biopsy), significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to randomization, or anticipation of the need for major surgery during trial treatment Minor surgery, including insertion of an indwelling catheter, within 24 hours prior to the first bevacizumab infusion Evidence of tumor invading or abutting a major blood vessel (e.g., pulmonary artery or superior vena cava) on imaging Radiotherapy to any site for any reason within 28 days prior to randomization. Palliative radiotherapy to bone lesions within 14 days prior to randomization is allowed Current or recent (within 10 days prior to first dose of bevacizumab) use of aspirin (&gt; 325 mg/day), clopidogrel (&gt; 75 mg/day), or current or recent (within 10 days prior to first dose of bevacizumab) use of fulldose (i.e. therapeutic dose) oral or parenteral anticoagulants or thrombolytic agent for therapeutic purposes. Prophylactic use of anticoagulants is allowed. History or evidence of inherited bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy with a risk of bleeding Active gastrointestinal bleeding Inadequately controlled hypertension (blood pressure: systolic &gt; 150 mmHg and/or diastolic &gt; 100 mmHg) within 28 days prior to randomization or history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy Clinically significant (i.e. active) cardiovascular disease (e.g. cerebrovascular accident [CVA] or myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to randomization, unstable angina, congestive heart failure [CHF] New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class ≥ II, or serious cardiac arrhythmia), that is uncontrolled by medication or may interfere with administration of trial treatment Nonhealing wound, active peptic ulcer or untreated bone fracture History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation or intra abdominal abscess within 6 months prior to randomization. Treatment with any other investigational agent within 28 days prior to randomization. Patients in the followup phase of 1stline trials who fulfill all eligibility criteria may be enrolled in this trial if the 1stline protocol allows bevacizumabbased treatment in the followup phase Known hypersensitivity to bevacizumab or any of its excipients, or any of the SOC agents foreseen Malignancy other than NSCLC within 5 years prior to randomization, except for adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, basal or squamous cell skin cancer, localized prostate cancer treated with curative intent, and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) treated surgically with curative intent Evidence of any other disease, neurologic or metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding or laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational or SOC drug used in this study or puts the patient at higher risk for treatmentrelated complications</criteria>
