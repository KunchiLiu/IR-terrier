	<brief_summary>Sedation for endoscopy is a service more than a necessity. Therefore it should be patient driven. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) undergoes life long endoscopic control. Therefore, satisfaction with the procedure experience is paramount for patients with IBD. Investigators wish to study the feasibility and the effect on patient experience of two drugs. Propofol administered by endoscopy nurses (NAPS) and conventional therapy with a combination of fentanyl and midazolam. Investigators hypothesize that patients sedated with propofol has a better procedure experience, that a well performed sedation equals a better experience and that NAPS is as feasible as fentanyl with midazolam sedation.</brief_summary>
