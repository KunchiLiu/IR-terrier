	<brief_summary>Individuals with cognitive impairments after stroke sustain significant disability in their daily tasks, and account for a significant proportion of stroke-related healthcare costs. The proposed study examines a novel intervention, strategy training, that shows promise for helping individuals with stroke-related cognitive impairments reduce disability in daily tasks, which may lead to reductions in healthcare costs. We predict that strategy training will result in significantly greater independence 6 months after stroke compared to an attention control intervention, and that strategy training may reduce cognitive impairments.</brief_summary>
