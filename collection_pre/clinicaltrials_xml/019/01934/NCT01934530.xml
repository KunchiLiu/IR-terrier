	<brief_summary>This randomized controlled clinical pilot trial compared the efficacy of two soft tissue grafting methods for correcting esthetic discrepancies associated with non-molar implants in the maxilla. Specifically, it was explored whether defects treated with connective tissue grafts (SCTG) differed in their outcomes from defects treated with acellular dermal matrix allografts (ADM).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Control Trial Testing Connective Tissue Grafts vs. Allograft on Dental Implants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirteen patients who presented with implants displaying recession, thin biotype, concavity defects or a combination thereof associated with single crowned dental implants participated in this randomized control trial. The control group (N=7) received SCTG and the test group (N=6) received ADM, both under coronally positioned flaps. Data were collected before surgery, and 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after the surgery. Outcome measures included soft tissue, hard tissue, and esthetics parameters and psychosocial data.</detailed_description>
