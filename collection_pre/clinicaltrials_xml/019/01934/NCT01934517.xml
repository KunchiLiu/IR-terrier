	<brief_title>Validity of Digital Models Obtained With iTero® and Lava Digital® in Comparison With Plaster Models.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the validity, reliability and reproducibility of the dental measurements obtained on the digital models with iTero® in comparison with those obtained on the plaster models (gold standard) and on the digital models with Lava Digital®. The secondary objective is to compare two different impression materials (i.e. alginate and polyvinylsiloxane (PVS)) and determine whether the impression material used affects the accuracy of the measurements. Statistical analysis: - Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) will be used to evaluate the intra- and inter-operator reliability of the measurements for each method, i.e. the plaster models and the digital models. - A paired t-test will be used to determine the validity of the digital measurements with iTero®, and to compare the impression materials (alginate and PVS). - A Bland-Altman plot will also be used to compare the two digital methods (Lava Digital® et iTero®) with the plaster models. - Dahlberg coefficient will be used to evaluate the technical error associated with the measurements that will be made.</detailed_description>
