	<brief_title>AMES Treatment of the Proximal Arm in Chronic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study seeks to determine whether 30 treatments with AMES, to the proximal affected arm of subjects with chronic stroke, will improve subjects' proximal arm active range-of-motion. We hypothesize that the combination of assisted movement, torque biofeedback, and muscle vibration will reduce impairment (i.e., increase strength and range-of-motion; decrease inappropriate patterns of muscle contraction) and, thereby, lead to more accurate reaching with the proximal arm.</detailed_description>
