	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: Patients who are addicted to opioids or alcohol will have reduced substance use, health care utilization if they have immediate and convenient access to pharmacotherapy and addiction counselling. Summary: This randomized trial will compare two different interventions for 124 alcohol and opioid-addicted patients admitted to either Women's Own Detox (WOD) at the University Health Network or the Withdrawal Management Service (WMS) at Saint Michael's Hospital (SMH. The Delayed Intervention group will receive a card with contact information for the St. Michael's Hospital and Women's College Hospital addiction medicine services. The Rapid Intervention group will be seen by an addiction physician from one of these services, within a day or two of their admission to the WOD or the SMH WMS. The addiction physician will prescribe buprenorphine or anti-alcohol medications, and the physician, nurse and/or therapist will provide ongoing counseling, follow-up and shared care with the family physician. Outcomes (measured at 6 and 12 months) include treatment retention, health care utilization and cost, medications prescribed, and alcohol and opioid use.</brief_summary>
