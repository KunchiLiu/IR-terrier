	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term antibody persistence from 6, 7, 8, 9 to 10 years post-administration of MenACWY-TT conjugate vaccine as compared to Mencevax ACWY when given to healthy subjects 11 to 55 years of age. In addition, the safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of MenACWY-TT vaccine administered to all eligible subjects 10 years after the primary vaccination will be evaluated. All Filipino subjects who received the primary vaccination in the primary vaccination study 107386 (NCT00356369) will be invited to enrol in the long-term follow up and booster phase. No new subjects will be enrolled.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All subjects must satisfy the following criteria at study entry to the persistence phase: Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. Or /and subjects' parent(s)/Legally Acceptable Representative(s) [LAR(s)] who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. A male or female between and including 17 and 66 years of age at the time of entry into the present study. Has completed the vaccination phase of the vaccination study MENACWYTT015. In alignment with local laws and regulations, written informed consent obtained from parents/LAR(s) of the subject and written informed assent obtained from the subject if the subject is less than 18 years of age, or written informed consent obtained from the subject if the subject has achieved the 18th birthday. The subjects ≥18 years of age at the time of enrollment will sign the informed consent form, even if the parent/ LAR previously signed the ICF before the subject reached the legal age of consent. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and historydirected physical examination before entering into the study. All subjects must satisfy the following additional criteria prior to entry of the booster phase: Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential may be enrolled in the study. Nonchildbearing potential is defined as premenarche, current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or postmenopause. Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject: has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series. Child in care. Previous vaccination with meningococcal polysaccharide or conjugate vaccine outside of study MENACWYTT015. History of meningococcal disease due to serogroup A, C, W135 or Y. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, based on medical history and physical examination. Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness. Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse. Additional exclusion criteria for booster phase at Month 120 study entry (to be checked at Month 120) for all subjects Use of any investigational or nonregistered product other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the booster dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the followup period. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the booster vaccine dose. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed. Administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol in the period starting 30 days before the booster dose of study vaccine or planned administration within 30 days after vaccination (with the day of vaccination considered Day 0), with the exception of a licensed inactivated influenza vaccine. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the booster vaccination or planned administration during the followup period. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational vaccine/product. Previous vaccination with tetanus toxoids within the last month. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccines. History of any neurological disorders or seizures, including GuillainBarré syndrome (GBS). History of a simple, single febrile seizure is permitted. Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrollment. Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C for oral, axillary or tympanic route, or ≥ 38.0°C for rectal route. The preferred route for recording temperature in this study will be oral. Subjects with a minor illness without fever may, be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator. Pregnant or lactating female. Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions.</criteria>
