	<brief_title>Intraprocedural Determination of Myocardial Vitality Using 2 Different Imaging Methods</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each patient with typical angina pectoris symptoms will get echocardiographic examination during the inclusion phase. If motion disorder of regional left ventricular myocardial wall is detected, patient will get coronary angiography (not study related, caused of typical angina pectoris symptoms and high probability of CHD). If coronary stenosis related to motion disorder is available, patient will be randomized in two groups during coronary angiography. - First Group: Patient will get echocardiographic examination during coronary angiography. 2D-Strain Analysis will be performed based on data of this echocardiographic examination. Only when vitality in the contraction impaired segments will be established based on 2D-Strain Analysis, PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) will be performed. - Second Group: Coronary angiography by patient will be canceled. Patients will get viability assessment using MRI(Magnetic resonance imaging) within the next 7 days. When vitality will be established with MRI, patient will get PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention). In addition, as part of a feasibility analysis, the possibility of a consolidation of data of coronary angiography with the ultrasound images will be researched by first group of patients. The aim is to simplify the visualization of the intraprocedural vitality detection. For this purpose, a position sensor based on electromagnetic fields (EMT) will be used during coronary angiography.</detailed_description>
