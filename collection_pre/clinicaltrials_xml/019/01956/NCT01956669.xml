	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good or bad, pazopanib (GW786034), National Service Center (NSC) # 737754, has on children, adolescents and young adults between 12 months and less than or equal to 18 years of age with relapsed or refractory rhabdomyosarcoma, non rhabdomyosarcomatous soft tissue sarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma (measurable and/or evaluable), or hepatoblastoma. This is a two-stage open label phase II trial of pazopanib in children, adolescents and young adults with recurrent or refractory solid tumors. Eligible subjects will receive pazopanib daily as an oral tablet (450 mg/m^2/dose) or as a powder for suspension (225 mg/m^2/dose) in 28 day cycles. The maximum dose to be administered daily for tablets is 800 mg and for suspension 400 mg. Subjects will be closely monitored with clinical and laboratory observations for side effects. Response to treatment will be evaluated using appropriate imaging studies. In the absence of severe toxicity or progressive disease, subjects may continue receiving pazopanib.</brief_summary>

Patients must have radiographically measurable disease (with the exception of neuroblastoma), Measurable disease is defined as the presence of at least one lesion on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan that can be accurately measured with the longest diameter a minimum of 10 mm in at least one dimension (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm). Patients with neuroblastoma who do not have measurable disease but have iodine131 metaiodobenzylguanidine positive (MIBG+) evaluable disease are eligible. Patients must have a Lansky or Karnofsky performance status score of &gt;= 50, corresponding to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) categories 0, 1 or 2. Use Karnofsky for subjects &gt;= 16 years of age and Lansky for subjects &lt;= 16 years of age. Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to entering this study. Patients must not have received myelosuppressive chemotherapy within 3 weeks of enrollment onto this study (6 weeks if prior nitrosourea). At least 7 days must have elapsed since the completion of therapy with a growth factor that supports platelet or white cell number or function. At least 14 days must have elapsed after receiving pegfilgrastim. At least 7 days must have elapsed since the completion of therapy with a biologic agent. For biologic agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, the period prior to enrollment must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur. Subjects may have received bevacizumab, VEGFTrap, or other VEGF blocking tyrosine kinase inhibitors, provided that they did not progress while receiving one of these agents. Subjects may not have previously received pazopanib. At least 21 days must have elapsed since the completion of the last dose of VEGFTrap, and at least 7 days since a VEGF blocking tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Subjects must have recovered from any VEGF blocking drugrelated toxicity (e.g., proteinuria). At least 3 halflives of the antibody must have elapsed since prior therapy that included a monoclonal antibody. Radiotherapy: &gt;=2 weeks must have elapsed since local palliative radiotherapy (XRT) (small port); &gt;=3 months must have elapsed if prior Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), craniospinal XRT or if &gt;=50% radiation of pelvis; &gt;=6 weeks must have elapsed if other substantial bone marrow irradiation was given. No evidence of active graft versus host disease and &gt;=2 months must have elapsed since transplant or rescue Adequate Bone Marrow Function defined as peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;=1000/ microlitre (µL), platelet count &gt;= 75,000/µL (transfusion independent, defined as not receiving platelet transfusions within a 7 day period prior to enrollment); and hemoglobin &gt;= 8.0 grams (g)/decilitre (dL), may receive red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. Subjects with bone marrow involvement will be eligible for study (provided they meet the criteria) but will not be evaluable for hematologic toxicity. Adequate Renal and Metabolic Function defined as creatinine clearance or radioisotope Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &gt;= 70 millilitre (mL)/ (min)/1.73 meter (m)^2 or A serum creatinine based on age/gender as follows, age 1 to &lt; 2 years (male0.6 milligrams (mg)/dL, female0.6 mg/dL), age 2 to &lt; 6 years (male0.8 mg/dL, female0.8 mg/dL), age 6 to &lt; 10 years (male1 mg/dL, female1 mg/dL), age 10 to &lt; 13 years (male1.2 mg/dL, female1.2 mg/dL), age 13 to &lt; 16 years (male1.5 mg/dL, female1.4 mg/dL), age &gt;= 16 years (male1.7 mg/dL, female1.4 mg/dL), urine creatinine ratio of &lt;1 or a urinalysis that is negative for protein; or, 24hour urine protein level &lt; 1000 mg/dL, adequate thyroid function ,no more than Grade 1 abnormalities of potassium, calcium (confirmed by ionized calcium), magnesium and phosphorous.

Negative pregnancy tests must be obtained in girls who are postmenarchal. Males or females of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method beginning at the signing of the informed consent until at least 30 days after the last dose of the study drug. The definition of adequate contraception will be based on the judgment of the principal investigator or a designated associate.
