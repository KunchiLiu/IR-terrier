	<brief_title>Study With Cabazitaxel in Previously Treated Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>65 patients with advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the oesophagogastric junction and stomach will be treated with 20mg/m2 Cabazitaxel for a maximum of 6 cycles. Main objective of the study is the Disease Control Rate (DCR) with Cabazitaxel.</detailed_description>

Total bilirubin ≤1.0 x ULN 10. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times the normal value, or creatinine clearance ≥ 60 ml/min 11. Written patient informed consent 1. A history of severe hypersensitivity to taxanes (≥ grade 3) or to medicinal products containing polysorbate 80 (≥ grade 3) 2. Active CAD, cardiomyopathy or NYHA stage IIIIV heart failure 3. Malignant secondary disease dating back &lt; 5 years (exceptions: in situ cervical carcinoma, appropriately treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin) 4. Severe secondary internal diseases, including uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or an acute infection 5. Concomitant medication or planned treatment with strong CYP450 3A4/5 inducers or inhibitors (list of medicinal products in the appendix) or the relevant medicinal products were not discontinued a minimum of one week before treatment 6.
