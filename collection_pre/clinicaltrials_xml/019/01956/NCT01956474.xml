	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ultraviolet-A (UVA)-induced cross-linking of corneal collagen (CXL) as a method to increase the biomechanical and biochemical stability of the cornea by inducing additional cross-links within or between collagen fibers using UVA light and the photo- mediator riboflavin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CXL-04 A Study of Collagen Crosslinking With Ultraviolet-A in Asymmetric Corneas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate the results of Corneal Collagen Crosslinking (CXL) in patients with conditions that include Keratoconus, Pellucid Marginal degeneration, Post-LASIK ectasia, and patients with radial keratotomy who experience fluctuation in their vision. This is an outcomes study, all patients receive treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. 8 years of age or older 2. Having at least one of the following conditions: Keratoconus PostLASIK ectasia Pellucid marginal degeneration Forme fruste pellucid marginal degeneration FFKC History of Radial Keratotomy with fluctuating vision. Terrien's Marginal Degeneration 3. Signed written informed consent and/or assent 4. Likely to complete all study visits 5. Minimum corneal thickness of at least 250 microns measured by ultrasound or Pentacam for all indications other than Terrien's. For Terrien's, the minimal corneal thickness should be consistent with the surgeon's best surgical judgment. 1. Severe corneal scarring that markedly affects vision 2. Contraindications to any study medications or their components 3. Pregnancy or breast feeding 4. Active Herpes Corneal Disease</criteria>
