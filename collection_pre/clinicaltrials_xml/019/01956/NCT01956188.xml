	<brief_summary>It has been demonstrated that EPA and DHA supplementation may have anti-inflammatory properties in several chronic diseases, namely, diabetes, obesity, and in rheumatoid arthritis, although not with controversy. Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease characterized by a chronic inflammatory state which is associated with the disease´s clinical symptoms. Thus, we hypothesized that EPA and DHA supplementation may beneficially affect the inflammatory cytokine profile and clinical features of LES patients.</brief_summary>
