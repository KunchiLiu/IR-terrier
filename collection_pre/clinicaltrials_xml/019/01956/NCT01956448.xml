	<brief_title>SORT-OUT VI - Randomized Clinical Comparison of Biomatrix Flex® and Resolute Integrity®</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SORT OUT VI is a randomized, multicenter, all-comer, two-arm, non-inferiority trial comparing the Biolimus-eluting Biomatrix Flex and the Zotarolimus-eluting Medtronic Resolute Integrity in treatment of atherosclerotic coronary artery lesions. Primary Endpoint: Target lesion failure within 12 months of stent implantation (combination of cardiac death, myocardial infarction (not index procedure related) not related to other than index lesion or target lesion revascularization). Secondary Endpoints: Individual components of the primary end point comprised the secondary end points and stent thrombosis rate according to the Academic Research Consortium definition (see protocol for further specification of secondary endpoints). Clinically driven event detection will be used to avoid study-induced reinterventions. Data on mortality, hospital admission, coronary angiography, repeat percutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary bypass surgery will be obtained for all randomly allocated patients from the following national Danish administrative and healthcare registries: the Civil Registration System; the Western Denmark Heart Registry; the Danish National Registry of Patients, which maintains records on all hospitalizations in Denmark; and the Danish Registry of Causes of Death</detailed_description>
