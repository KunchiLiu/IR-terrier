	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether electrical pharyngeal stimulation in addition to standard care can enhance short-term swallow recovery in tracheostomized dysphagic stroke patients and thereby facilitate earlier decannulation compared to sham treatment plus standard care.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Electrical Pharyngeal Stimulation for Dysphagia Therapy in Tracheostomized Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Readiness for decannulation is assessed after three days of either real or sham electrical pharyngeal stimulation. In case a patient cannot be decannulated at that time point, there is an open-label follow-up treatment phase, in which every patient in the sham treatment arm gets another three days of real electrical pharyngeal stimulation to not deprive any patient of a potentially beneficial treatment.</detailed_description>
