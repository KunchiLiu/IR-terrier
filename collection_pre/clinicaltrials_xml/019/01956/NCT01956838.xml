	<brief_summary>Rationale: The appearance of tastants in the small intestine can result in the activation of a negative feedback mechanism from different parts of the intestine to the stomach, the small intestine and to the central nervous system. These processes inhibit food processing, appetite sensations and food intake, and furthermore they increase feelings of satiety and satiation. We will investigate the effects of intraduodenal infusion of quinine 75mg (bitter), rebaudioside A 540mg (sweet), monosodium glutamate 2g (umami), a combination of these tastants (quinine, rebaudioside A, monosodium glutamate) and placebo (5 test days in total) on ad libitum food intake, satiation and in vivo release of the gut satiety peptides CCK and GLP-1. Study design: To assess the effect of intraduodenal infusion of single ingredients and a combination of tastants (bitter, umami and sweet) on ad libitum food intake. Secondary Objective(s): 1. To investigate the effect of intraduodenal delivery of a combination of tastants on satiation. 2. To assess the effect of intraduodenal delivery of a combination of tastants on gastrointestinal hormone release. 3. To assess the effects of the tastants quinine, rebaudioside A and monosodium glutamate on the parameters as mentioned under the primary objective, and under secondary objectives 1 and 2. 4. To compare the effects, as mentioned under the primary objective, and under secondary objectives 1 and 2, of the combination of tastants to those of the three single tastants quinine, rebaudioside A and monosodium glutamate.</brief_summary>
