	<brief_summary>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a complex systemic disease that mainly involves the respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) tracts. The polymicrobial community composition of respiratory and GI tracts is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Children with CF may harbor an abnormal intestinal microflora, because of altered cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function and heavy drug load (antibiotics, pancreatic enzymes and acid suppressors). The investigators have previously demonstrated that intestinal inflammation is highly frequent in CF children, being a major feature of intestinal involvement. In addition, specific probiotics significantly improved airway and GI inflammation in a preliminary trial. The investigators aim to characterize intestinal and respiratory microflora in CF patients and to investigate the effects of daily Lactobacillus GG (LGG) supplementation on both GI and airway microflora and the eventual relationship between probiotic assumption and clinical and inflammation markers. The investigators aim is to eventually improve the quality of life of CF patients, who often suffer from intestinal and respiratory progressive disease, through a non invasive intervention consisting in the supplementation of probiotic bacteria.</brief_summary>
