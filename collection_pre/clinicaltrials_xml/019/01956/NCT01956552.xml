Metastatic disease outside any previous radiotherapy field (e.g. subclavicular or internal mammary lymph nodes). Metastatic disease accessible to either percutaneous or surgical sampling. Signed written informed consent (approved by an Independent Ethics Committee and obtained prior to any studyspecific screening procedure). Social and psychological welfare in concordance with compliance to the study. To be eligible to participate in the study, patients must fulfill none of the following criteria: Bilateral or multifocal breast cancer. Isolated local or contralateral relapse. Solitary bone and/or brain metastatic disease unless : Metastatic sites eligible for a therapeutic surgery. Metastatic sites sampled for diagnosis purpose. Past or current history of malignant neoplasms, except for curatively treated basal and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Carcinoma in situ of the cervix.
