	<brief_summary>Because Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL) are mainly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the activated B cells (ABC) type, the investigators hypothesize that the synergy of lenalidomide with rituximab shown in systemic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) could be observed in PCNSL. This study will assess the efficiency of the the combination of lenalidomide and rituximab in relapsed/refractory PCNSL, and the efficiency of a maintenance treatment with lenalidomide alone in maintaining the response.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Lenalidomide With Rituximab in Refractory or Relapse of Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators use a two-stage Fleming's design based on the following hypotheses under treatment: 10% (null hypothesis, minimal clinical benefit rate), 30% (alternative hypothesis, acceptable clinical benefit rate), 3% type I error rate, 5% type II error rate. Under these hypotheses, a total of 45 assessable patients will be necessary: 22 for the first stage + 23 for the second stage. Stage 1: following the inclusion of the first 22 assessable patients, if 0 or 1 patient has an objective response (CR, Complete Response + uCR, unconfirmed Complete Response + PR, Partial Response) at the end of induction treatment, the study would be terminated early and the treatment will be considered ineffective. If 2 or more patients have an objective response at the end of induction treatment, then the treatment will be considered as effective in this indication. Otherwise, the second group of 23 patients will be recruited. Stage 2: if at the end of recruitment, 8 or less patients have an objective response, the investigators will conclude to inefficacy, and if 9 or more patients have an objective response, then the treatment will be considered as effective and need further exploration.</detailed_description>

Pregnancy tests (serum βHCG dosage) will be negative at baseline and during the study. Men must agree not to procreate a child and use condoms if their partner can procreate, during all the treatment period, during dose interruptions and for at least 4 weeks after study drug discontinuation. 12.
