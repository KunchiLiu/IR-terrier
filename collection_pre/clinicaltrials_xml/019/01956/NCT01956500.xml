	<detailed_description>Allocation: Randomized. Subjects will be randomized to one of two groups: placebo or Instaflex Joint Support. Supplements will be administered in double-blinded fashion. Intervention Model: Instaflex Joint Support supplement for 8 weeks versus placebo. Sample Size: N=100, with N=50 per group. Statistical Procedures: 2 x 2 repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Study Duration (per subject): 8 weeks. Blood sample schedule: Blood draws pre- and post-study. Monitoring adverse events: Subjects will fill in bi-weekly symptom logs to monitor untoward symptoms. Diagnostic chemistry panels will be measured pre- and post-study. Rescue medication: Paracetamol (i.e., acetaminophen as found in Tylenol) will be allowed as a rescue medicine for pain during the study as needed. Subjects will record paracetamol usage. Paracetamol can relieve pain in mild arthritis but has no effect on the underlying inflammation, redness, and swelling of the joint. Lab visit testing sequence (at the Kannapolis YMCA, in the afternoon by appointment.): 1. First visit: 1. Consent form 2. Medical health questionnaire to verify medical history, and lifestyle habits. 3. Symptoms log for previous 2-weeks symptomatology 4. Height, weight, and percent body fat (bioelectrical impedance, Tanita scale) 5. Questionnaires: Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36), and Measure of Intermittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain (ICOAP). 6. Blood sample (followed by a glass of orange juice) 7. 6-minute walk test (at the local YMCA track) (one practice trial, and then repeat for test). 8. Receive supplement organizer tray with 8-weeks supply (and instructions) 2. 8-week study: a. Subjects will be contacted via email every 2 weeks to monitor compliance and fill in symptom logs. 3. Second lab visit: 1. Same as first lab visit, except for removal of steps "a,b, and h". Supplements: Supplements (Instaflex, placebo) will be prepared in colored gel capsules (3 per day, identical looking), and given to the subjects in supplement organizer trays. Subjects will take 3 capsules/day: one capsule each in the morning, at noontime, and in the evening. The placebo capsules will contain magnesium stearate, an inert substance. Compliance: Compliance will be monitored with bi-weekly email messages, and by counting unused capsules when subjects return the supplement trays at the end of the 8-week study. If subjects miss one, two, or three days of taking supplements, subjects will be asked to double up usage until back on schedule. Subjects missing more than three days of taking the supplements will be asked to leave the study. 1.
