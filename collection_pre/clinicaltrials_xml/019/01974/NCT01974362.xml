	<brief_summary>In patients that did a full mouth implant supported rehabilitation does Cad/Cam Monolithic Zirconia, compared to Cad/Cam Zirconia Suprastructure (zirconium oxide (Yttrium - partially stabilized with tetragonal polycrystalline structure) veneered with feldspathic ceramic, has less post-insertion complications after 1-Year follow-up ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monolithic Zirconia Full-Mouth Implant Supported Rehabilitation Behavior</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Retrospectively study the behavior of implant supported rehabilitations made from full-zirconium dioxide (monolithic) and zirconia veneered with feldspathic in full-mouth type of rehabilitations (maxilla and mandible). In a private clinic we will record the behavior, regarding chipping and complications in both groups (monolithic vs feldspathic ceramic) after 1 year in function. We will make calibration of the investigators for chipping detection, characterization of big and small problem and accept an inter-observer agreement (Kappa) of 0.9 for each parameter. Recording will be made without the help of magnifying utilities such as magnifying glasses or optical microscopes.</detailed_description>
