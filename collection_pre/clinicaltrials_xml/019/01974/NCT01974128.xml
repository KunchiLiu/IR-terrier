	<brief_title>Study to Assess the Safety and Cardiovascular Effects of Autologous Adipose-Derived Stromal Cells Implantation In Patients During the Acute Recovery Phase of ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate in patients recovering from acute myocardial infarction (&lt; 8 days after the index infarction) both the safety profile of intramyocardial ASCs and the preliminary efficacy of ASCs therapy. This will be an open-label, non-randomized patient sponsored multi-center study of ASC implantation using a catheter delivery system. ASCs will be derived from the patient's adipose-derived tissue. Liposuction will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen for subsequent processing to isolate the stem cells. The injection catheter will be used for delivery of the ASCs therapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males and Females between Age 18 and 80 years. Defined acute myocardial infarction &lt;8 days from screening Left ventricular ejection fraction at screening of ≤ 50%, with 2 or more contiguous areas of severe wall motion abnormality on resting echocardiography. Patients must have a minimum myocardial wall thickness of 5mm Need or feasibility for revascularization has been ruled out by coronary angiogram or noninvasive stress testing. Up to date on all age and gender appropriate cancer screening per American Cancer Society Females who are pregnant or nursing or females of childbearing potential who are unwilling to maintain contraceptive therapy for the duration of the study Life expectancy &lt; 6 months due to concomitant illnesses. NYHA CHF Class 4 Severe valvular or other nonischemic myocardial disease. Mechanical complications of the index acute myocardial infarction including but not limited to rupture of the mitral valve with resultant development of mitral regurgitation, rupture of the left ventricular free wall and rupture of the interventricular septum. Active infectious disease and/or known to have tested positive for HIV, HTLV, HBV, HCV, CMV (IgM &gt; IgG) and/or syphilis. If the panel includes antibodies to the HBVcAg and HBVsAg, then an expert will be consulted as to patient eligibility based on the patient's infectious status Any illness which, in the Investigator's judgment, will interfere with the patient's ability to comply with the protocol, compromise patient safety, or interfere with the interpretation of the study results Patients on chronic immunosuppressive transplant therapy Systolic blood pressure (supine) ≤90 mmHg; Resting heart rate &gt; 100 bpm; Active clinical infection within one week of enrollment. Cerebrovascular accident within 6 months prior to study entry Known drug or alcohol dependence or any other factors which will interfere with the study conduct or interpretation of the results or who in the opinion of the investigator are not suitable to participate. History of cancer (other than nonmelanoma skin cancer or insitu cervical cancer) in the last five years. Unwilling and/or not able to give written informed consent.</criteria>
