	<brief_summary>Seizures are a potential complication of surgical repair of intracranial aneurysms. In order to prevent seizures, many surgeons administer prophylactic anti-epileptic medication during the intra-operative and post-operative period, however, such practice is not supported by clinical data. Retrospective review found the incidence of postoperative seizures was higher in those who received anti-epileptics versus those who did not. The goal is to examine the utility of levetiracetam (Keppra) for seizure prophylaxis in patients undergoing surgical repair of unruptured intracranial aneurysms.</brief_summary>
