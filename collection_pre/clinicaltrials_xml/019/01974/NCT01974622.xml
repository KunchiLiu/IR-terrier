	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to use an approved drug(Visudyne) for neovascular age-related macular degeneration, which is essentially choroidal neovascularization for permeability and vascular proliferation for the retinal circulation, to treat another permeable abnormality - retinal capillary abnormalities - located eccentric to the central portion of the macula or in the foveal region.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ICG-Guided Photodynamic Therapy for Treatment of Retinal Capillary Abnormalities: A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will include 30 patients who were diagnosed with retinal capillary abnormalities and include 2 follow-up visits at 6 and 12 months post-procedure to determine if the treatment has been effective in treating their disorder. It is anticipated that approximately half of the patients will require an additional treatment. Patients will be enrolled from our patient population and be 50 years of age and older, male or female. Pregnant women or women of normal child bearing age will be excluded since there are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of photodynamic therapy in pregnant women. Any retinal vascular abnormality that has a standard of care method of treatment will also be excluded from the study population.</detailed_description>
