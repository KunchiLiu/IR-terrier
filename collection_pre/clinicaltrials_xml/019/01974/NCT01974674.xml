	<brief_summary>It is a multicentre, sequential, phase II clinical trial, aiming at evaluating the allogeneic islet transplantation for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. 19 patients with type 1 diabetes will be included and ideally distributed evenly: patients with unstable diabetes without renal insufficiency (AI group for "islet alone" by the international customary determination) and patients with a functioning kidney transplant (IAK group for "islet after kidney"). The main endpoint will be defined by the restoration of normal glycemic control without insulin at 6 months after graft.</brief_summary>
