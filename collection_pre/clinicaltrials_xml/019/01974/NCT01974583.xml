	<detailed_description>Background：Split-thickness skin grafting remains fundamental treatment of patients with deep burns and other traumatic injuries. However, the split-thickness skin graft (STSG) donor site dressing has been controversial until now. Our study here aimed to assess patient comfort and wound-healing efficacy with the application of thin split-thickness grafting on STSG donor sites. Methods: 192 consecutive patients undergoing split-thickness skin grafting were included in the study and the participants were randomly divided into three groups: Group A was regrafted with thin STSG, while, Group B and Group C were covered with the occlusive hydrocellular dressing and paraffin gauze, respectively. The three groups were compared regarding to the time of epithelialization, pain sensed by the patients and the scar formation.</detailed_description>
