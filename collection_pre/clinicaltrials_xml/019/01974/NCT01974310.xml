	<brief_summary>Idiopathic macular holes are an important cause of visual loss. Macular holes can be treated by surgically removing the vitreous gel and injecting intraocular gas. Following macular hole surgery, face-down positioning is often advised with the aim of improving the likelihood of macular hole closure. The current evidence of postoperative positioning protocols is insufficient to draw firm conclusions and guide practice. The investigators wish to compare non-face-down positioning and face-down positioning after surgery for macular holes in a randomized trial. Hypothesis: Non-face-down positioning is equivalent to face-down positioning after surgery for macular holes.</brief_summary>
