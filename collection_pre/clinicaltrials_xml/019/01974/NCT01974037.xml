	<brief_summary>Excess dietary salt intake is closely associated with the development of hypertension and cardiocerebral vascular diseases. Preference of high salt diet might involve salty gustatory cortices change. This study focuses on examining the neuroimaging changes of salty gustatory cortices under different concentration of NaCl solution with or without capsaicin intervention through brain PET/CT scan.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capsaicin on Salty Gustatory Cortices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension and its related complications are common health problems that can lead to multiple organ damage and death. Excessive salt intake plays an important role in the development of hypertension. The experimental design is a randomized, double-blind, interventional study to investigate the neuroimaging changes of salty gustatory cortices under different concentration of NaCl solution with or without capsaicin intervention through brain PET/CT scan.</detailed_description>
