	<brief_summary>Pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) is an important step in the surgical staging and treatment of gynecologic malignancies. Sometimes, complicated lymphoceles after PLND often delay adjuvant treatment including chemotherapy and radiation therapy, which potentially affects the success of cancer treatment. A number of surgical techniques have developed, but failed to reduce the incidence of pelvic lymphoceles after PLND. The investigators hypothesized that floseal can prevent lymphoceles in patients with gynecologic cancer who has undergone PLND. The investigators designed prospective randomized controlled study as a pilot study. The investigators will randomly apply floseal to one side of pelvis after bilateral PLND, and observe the occurence of pelvic lymphoceles after 6 months later.</brief_summary>
