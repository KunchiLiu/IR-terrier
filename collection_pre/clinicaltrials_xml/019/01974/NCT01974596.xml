	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was evaluate the effects of the oral probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri Prodentis upon the peri-implant health of edentulous patients with dental implants and peri-implant mucositis, establishing comparisons versus implants without peri-implant disease. The hypothesis of the study is that using these probiotics are going to improve the periimplant health.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of Probiotics in Oral Health of Patients With Dental Implants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective cross-over study was made. All the patients were edentulous and were divided into two groups: A) with no peri-implant disease; B) with peri-implant mucositis affecting one or more implants. Patients with peri-implantitis were excluded. All patients in both groups initially received the oral probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri Prodentis, followed by placebo. Only the supervisor of the study knew this information; clinical examiner and patients were blind. Were studied: crevicular fluid volume, modified plaque index, probing depth, modified gingival index, and concentrations of interleukin 1Î², interleukin 6 and interleukin 8, and Bacterial load.</detailed_description>
