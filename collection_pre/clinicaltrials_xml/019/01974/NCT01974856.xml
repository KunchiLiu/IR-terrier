	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to assess the extent to which the Prosigna™ Breast Cancer Prognostic Gene Signature Assay affects the medical oncologist's treatment recommendations regarding adjuvant chemotherapy and actual treatments received for patients with early-stage breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Observational Study of Clinical Outcomes for the NanoString® Technologies Prosigna™ Gene Signature Assay</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Changes in treatment recommendations will include (1) hormonal therapy alone, (2) hormonal therapy plus chemotherapy, and (3) changes in types of chemotherapy if chemotherapy was recommended before and after the test.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Resected nodenegative, estrogenreceptorpositive, HER2negative early stage invasive breast cancer (T1T2, N0, pN0 (i+), pN0 (mol+), M0) Estrogen receptor status will be evaluated by Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and more than 1% of stained tumor cells will be considered positive. HER2 status will be evaluated by IHC (0 or 1+, or 2+ will be considered negative) and by insitu fluorescence hybridization. Postmenopausal women defined as: Natural Amenorrhea &gt; 12 months, regardless of age Bilateral oophorectomy, regardless of age (the oophorectomy must have been carried out at least 4 weeks before entering the study) Radiological castration with amenorrhea &gt; 3 months, regardless of age Hysterectomy and postmenopausal blood levels Able to give consent Eligible for treatment of breast cancer with adjuvant chemotherapy ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 Tumor size T3T4 Noninvasive breast cancer (e.g., Paget's disease, DCIS) Tumors with nodes that are not N0, pN0 (i+), or pN0 (mol+) Tumors that are estrogenreceptor negative or HER2 positive Have metastatic disease Unable to give informed consent Unable to complete patient reported outcome surveys Have contraindications for adjuvant chemotherapy Age, performance status, significant comorbidities ECOG performance status &gt; 1</criteria>
