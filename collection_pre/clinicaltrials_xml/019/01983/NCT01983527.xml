	<brief_summary>Arthrographic distention of the shoulder joint is an increasingly popular treatment option in the management of patients with frozen shoulder. Most have included the intra-articular injection of a corticosteroid as part of the procedure, but it is not known if this is necessary. It is also not known whether arthrographic distention using steroid and saline is better than intra-articular steroid injection alone. The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is an additional benefit in the combination of arthrographic distention plus intra-articular corticosteroid injection compared to arthrographic distention or intra-articular corticosteroid injection alone.</brief_summary>
