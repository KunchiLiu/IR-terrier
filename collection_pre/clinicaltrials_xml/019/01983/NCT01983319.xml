	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine whether noninvasive brain stimulation in form of active transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT) offers an additional benefit as compared with sham tDCS combined with CIMT in patients with stroke. Furthermore the purpose is to highlight changes in GABA activity more than 3 months after stroke and its importance for effect of tDCS and CIMT combined with tDCS.</brief_summary>
