	<brief_summary>At the Department of Infectious Diseases, Aarhus Denmark, moxifloxacin is used in the empirical treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). This study was designed to determine the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin 400 mg/day to patients treated empirically for CAP. To accomplish this aim, we established a pharmacokinetic population model. This approach was adopted with the dual purpose of assessing the potential efficacy of the drug and performing Monte-Carlo simulations to characterize the maximal MICs for which recommended pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) targets are obtained for pathogens commonly known to cause CAP.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PK Analysis of Moxifloxacin in the Treatment of CAP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We determined the pharmacokinetic profile of moxifloxacin 400 mg/day in 18 patients treated empirically for community-acquired pneumonia. . Moxifloxacin plasma concentrations were determined the day after therapy initiation using ultra high performance liquid chromatography. The moxifloxacin plasma concentration-time profiles were described with a one compartment model, using NONMEM. Peak drug concentrations (Cmax) and 24-hour area under the free drug concentration-time curve values (fAUC0-24) predicted for each patient were evaluated against epidemiological cut-off MIC values for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Legionella pneumophilia. PK-PD targets adopted were Cmax/MIC â‰¥ 12.2 for all pathogens, fAUC0-24/MIC &gt; 34 for S. pneumoniae and fAUC0-24/MIC &gt; 75 for H. influenzae and L. pneumophilia. The same PK-PD estimates were used in the simulations of probability of target attainment (PTA) versus MIC.</detailed_description>
