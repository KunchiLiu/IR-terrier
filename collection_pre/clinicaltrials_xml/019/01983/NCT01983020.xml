	<brief_summary>This study has been designed as a controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of brief lidocaine infusion, brief ketamine infusion and a lidocaine/ketamine combined infusion when added to conventional opioid therapy following major spine surgery, as well as to evaluate the effects of the lidocaine/ketamine pain protocol on the feasibility of performing routine intraoperative neurophysiology during spine surgery in adults and determine whether this infusion protocol is compatible with intraoperative neurophysiology on spine surgery patients. If one or more of the approaches is confirmed as efficacious and safe, it could have a significant impact on the routine management of postoperative pain in this context.</brief_summary>
