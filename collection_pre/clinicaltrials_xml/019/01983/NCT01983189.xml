	<brief_title>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Evaluation and Treatment of Repetetive Behaviors in Autism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project is a 3-week double blind cross-over trial for adolescents and adults who meet criteria for autism and have clinically prominent repetitive behaviors. The investigator will apply low frequency rTMS for 20 minutes 5 times a week for 3 weeks targeting the area of brain which was involved in repetitive behaviors. The investigator will obtain clinical measures of repetitive behaviors as well as social functioning pre and post treatment. As a control and a cross-over condition , we will stimulate other area of brain which has nothing to do with repetitive behaviors but may improve social functioning in autism spectrum disorders. In addition to r TMS we will perform a pre and post treatment perfusion functional MRI and obtain TMS measure of excitability of brain.</detailed_description>
