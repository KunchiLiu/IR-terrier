	<brief_summary>The clinical trial aims at showing efficacy of prebiotics and the probiotic on microbiota balance. Together, the prebiotic solution in combination with the probiotic is expected to harmonize the microbiota of formula fed neonates with the microbiota of breast fed neonates and to allow a greater diversity of Bifidobacteria species in comparison with a formula non-supplemented with pre and probiotics.</brief_summary>
