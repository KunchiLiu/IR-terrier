	<brief_summary>The long term goal is to improve the quality and equity of chronic pain treatment among VA patients. The primary objective of this study is to improve pain outcomes among black VA patients with chronic, musculoskeletal (MSK) pain, who experience poorer pain treatment and outcomes than their white counterparts. The work proposed is expected to result in a non-pharmacological intervention, delivered by telephone, designed to reduce pain and improve functioning among black patients with MSK pain, by promoting walking. This intervention is specifically designed to address factors that contribute to MSK pain among black Veterans; however, the investigators expect that it will also benefit non-black Veterans. The proposed research is innovative, in its use of proactive outreach and recent advances in self-regulation strategies (such as Action Planning) to help black Veterans overcome psychological, environmental, utilization-related, and provider-related barriers that contribute to pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Proactive Walking Trial to Reduce Pain in Black Veterans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. BACKGROUND/RATIONALE. Chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain is one of the most common conditions among Veterans, affecting approximately 60% of those seen in VA primary care. Although perceived effectiveness of chronic pain treatment is low among all VA patients, black patients are less likely than whites to perceive their treatment as effective, and are more likely to experience functional limitations due to pain. There is growing consensus that chronic MSK pain is best addressed by a biopsychosocial approach that acknowledges the role of psychological and environmental factors, some of which differ by race. For example, blacks experience greater pain-related fear and lower self-efficacy in coping with pain (psychological contributors), and neighborhoods that make physical activity difficult (environmental contributors). However, there is a lack of effective interventions to improve pain treatment among minority patients, particularly those that target psychological and environmental contributors. 2. OBJECTIVES. The long term goal is to improve the quality and equity of pain treatment in order to improve pain outcomes for all Veterans. The objective of this application is to test the effectiveness of a multi-component intervention that specifically targets known barriers to effective pain care among blacks Veterans with chronic MSK pain. The primary hypothesis is that a telephone-delivered intervention, which emphasizes walking and incorporates Action Planning, Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques, and the use of pedometers, will improve core chronic pain outcomes in black Veterans. 3. METHODS. The investigators propose a randomized trial to test the effectiveness of the intervention compared with usual care (UC) among 250 black and 250 non-black patients with chronic MSK pain. Patients from the Atlanta VAMC will be identified using data from the recently funded VA cohort study of Veterans with diagnoses of musculoskeletal pain in VA care. Patients will be screened by phone, and, if eligible, will be administered the full baseline survey. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to the Usual Care (UC) or intervention condition (IC). Intervention participants will receive a pedometer-mediated walking intervention that will incorporate Action Planning and the use MI and CBT techniques. The intervention will be delivered in 6 telephone counseling sessions over three months. Patients in the UC condition will receive an informational brochure and a pedometer. The study is powered to find a difference between the IC and UC groups within the black and non-black groups. The primary outcome is chronic pain-related physical functioning, assessed by the revised Roland and Morris Disability Questionnaire, a measure recommended by the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT). The investigators will also examine whether the intervention improves other IMMPACT-recommended domains (pain intensity, emotional functioning, and ratings of overall improvement), will examine whether psychological factors targeted by the intervention mediate improvement in pain outcomes, and will test the effectiveness of the intervention on non-black patients and other subgroups of patients who may experience barriers to effective pain management. Measures will be assessed by mail or phone survey at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Data analysis of primary aims will follow intent-to-treat methodology. 4. STATUS. In Phase 1, the investigators conducted four focus groups in preparation for the intervention. Intervention and Control recruitment for Phase 2 began early July 2016. 5. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE. This project will result in a non-pharmacological intervention to improve pain-related functioning among black Veterans with chronic MSK pain in VA care, which may also benefit other Veterans who have similar contributors to pain.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligible patients must receive care at the Atlanta VAMC and have back, hip or knee pain for a duration of at least 6 months, moderatesevere pain intensity and interference with function (defined as a PEG score of 5 or greater), selfreported ability to walk at least 1 block, and must be able to communicate effectively by telephone (no cognitive disability). The investigators will not exclude patients who are on medication or receiving interventions to treat their chronic pain. The investigators will not include the approximately 10% of patients who have no race data; administrative race data will be verified on the brief screening survey. The investigators will also not include any vulnerable populations or those who meet any of the following exclusion criteria that may interfere with the outcome assessment: moderately severe cognitive impairment defined as &gt; 1 error on a brief cognitive screener; anticipated back, knee, hip, or other major surgery within the next 6 months, and a diagnosis (on the MSD) of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or other psychosis. The investigators will also exclude any Veterans who also happen to be VA employees at the Atlanta VAMC because employees cannot be compensated for participating in research studies.</criteria>
