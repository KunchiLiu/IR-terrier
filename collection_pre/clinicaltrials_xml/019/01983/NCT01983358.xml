	<brief_title>The Evaluation of Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Stroke Targeting Drug in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>tPA treatment should be used within 3 hours after stroke onset for treating efficacy, but JPI-289 treatment(PARP-1 inhibitor) showed treating efficacy more than 10 hours after stroke onset. PARP-1 inhibitor add-on therapy of tPA will be very useful to prevent social, economic loss from physical, and mental disable by stroke. This clinical trial progresses to explore safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of JPI-289 by single dose escalation(7cohort). Investigational product medication of each level within 4 weeks evaluate safety and tolerability of patient through Data Safety Monitoring Board(DSMB) which is composed of more than 3 experts except principal investigator until the last visit. In each level 6 patients for investigational product and 2 patients for placebo will be allocated respectively in double blind manner.</detailed_description>
