	<brief_summary>Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a common problem in cystic fibrosis (CF). It may lead to worsening lung function and more respiratory infections for a person with CF. This study will look at treating GERD with a medication, esopmeprazole. The medication stops stomach acid from being made. The study will see if there are fewer respiratory infections and improved lung function in patients with CF when taking esomeprazole.</brief_summary>
