	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the activity of Vemurafenib in combination with Fotemustine in Patients with unresectable Stage IV melanoma harboring V600 BRAF mutation who recurred while in treatment with Vemurafenib. In addition the feasibility and safety profile of prolonging treatment of this drugs combination will be assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vemurafenib + Fotemustine to Treat Advanced Melanoma Patients With V600BRAF Mutation Recurred While on Vemurafenib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are treated with Fotemustine 100 mg/m2 q21 + Vemurafenib. Vemurafenib will be administered continuous oral dosing at 960 mg twice daily or dose administered at time of disease progression with Vemurafenib previous treatment (720 or 480 mg).Treatment will be continued until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The Progression-free survival will be assessed as primary endpoint, other outcomes(i.e., incidence of grade III-IV toxicity, Disease Control Rate, and Overall Survival) will be considered secondary endpoints.</detailed_description>
