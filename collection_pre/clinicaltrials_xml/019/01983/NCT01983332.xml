	<brief_title>Impact of MOHO on Therapists Working With Clients in Cancer Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will occur at MDACC, a comprehensive cancer center in the Texas Medical Center (TMC) in Houston. The center is the largest freestanding comprehensive cancer center in the world. The facility provides inpatient and outpatient services and supports research and education. The facility has more than 50 buildings in the greater Houston area and in central Texas. The setting for this study will be the rehabilitation services area on the main campus in the TMC. There are private offices, conference rooms and treatment areas where video chats and monthly meetings will occur. The study is projected to occur over a one year period. Sessions will be videotaped (video chats - initial and follow ups and monthly group meetings) for further review. Analysis of the tapes will provide data for further research and education presentations. Sessions will also be audiotaped and transcribed for further review and data analysis purposes. Neither the videotapes nor audiotapes will be shared with anyone at the facility or any uninvolved parties. Audiotapes and videotapes will be stored in locked file cabinets and password protected computers will be used to view and analyze the audio and video tapes. Only the research team will have access to the stored data locked in the file cabinet.</detailed_description>
