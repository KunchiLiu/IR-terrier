	<brief_summary>The overarching question addressed in the current project is: Does dietary nitrate supplementation (8 weeks) improve physiological function in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD)? The investigators will specifically address whether dietary nitrate supplementation enhances blood vessel function, blood pressure regulation, and exercise capacity. The proposed project uses an array of clearly defined measurements which will allow investigators to quantify blood vessel function (vasodilator responsiveness and arterial stiffness), blood pressure (variability and responsiveness to stress), and functional capacity before and after 8 weeks of dietary supplementation.</brief_summary>
