	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of sub-callosal cingulate (SCC) deep brain stimulation (DBS) in patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD). The working hypotheses are that long pulse-width DBS applied to the SCC region will lead to improvements in TRD patients, and specific neuroimaging biomarkers will correlate with response to DBS; the functional recovery will be enhanced with concurrent cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).</brief_summary>
