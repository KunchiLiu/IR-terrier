	<brief_summary>At the Department of Infectious Diseases, Aarhus University Hospital, continuous infusion with piperacillin/tazobactam for a period of 2 weeks, has been used for several years in patients with cystic fibrosis, suffering from acute pulmonary exacerbations (APE). It is an outpatient treatment. To assess the efficacy and quality of the treatment, a blood test every 3rd day is taken to determine the concentration of Piperacillin in blood-plasma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics of Piperacillin, Given as Continuous Infusion to Patients With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are often colonized with multidrug-resistant microorganisms, which increases the risk of suboptimal dosing of antibiotics as the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration (T&gt;MIC) is suboptimal. Continuous infusion of beta-lactam antibiotics is more likely to optimize T&gt;MIC than intermittent infusion. At the Department of Infectious Diseases, Aarhus University Hospital, continuous infusion with piperacillin/tazobactam for a period of 2 weeks, has been used for several years in patients with CF, suffering from acute pulmonary exacerbations (APE). It is an outpatient treatment, and the patients are given 16 g of piperacillin per 24 hours. To assess the efficacy and quality of the treatment, a blood test every 3rd day will be required to monitor the blood-plasma concentration of piperacillin, as well as C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC).</detailed_description>
