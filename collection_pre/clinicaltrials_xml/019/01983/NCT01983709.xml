	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine if systemically infused allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) home to sites of prostate cancer in men with localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate that are planning to undergo a prostatectomy. Investigators plan to systemically infuse MSCs 4, 6 or 8 days prior to enrolled subjects' planned prostatectomies. Investigators will then quantify the relative amount of donor MSC DNA to recipient DNA present in patients' explanted prostate specimens. This will be accomplished via BEAMing digital PCR. This trial will provide the foundation for future studies aimed at engineering MSCs to deliver a toxin to sites of metastatic prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
