	<brief_title>Effects of Two Physical Exercise Protocols on Cognition and Physical Performances in Elderly Over 80 Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose: To compare the effects of 16-week multicomponent and resistance trainings on cognition and physical performances related to falls in oldest old people living in community; to analyze the same variables after 6-week detraining. Method: We conducted a randomized controlled trial with 69 community elderly over 80 years, sedentary and without cognitive disorder. Participants were allocated to control, multicomponent training or resistance training group. The multicomponent group performed a protocol involving warm-up, aerobic, strength, balance and cool-down exercises. The resistance group underwent to strength exercises using six machines: leg press, chest press, calf, back extension, abdominal and rowing. The control group did not perform any intervention. The trainings had progressive intensity, lasted 16 weeks and included three 1-hour sessions per week. The participants were evaluated at baseline, at the end of 16-week training and at 6-week detraining. The assessment consisted of anamnesis, depression (Geriatric Depression Scale), cognition (Montreal cognitive assessment), dual task walking (associated to cognitive and motor tasks), balance (unipedal and tandem tests), strength of lower limbs (sit-to-stand test) and history of falls. For statistical analysis by intention to treat, we adopted a significance level of Î±=0.05.</detailed_description>
