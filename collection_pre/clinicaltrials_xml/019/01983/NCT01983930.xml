	<brief_title>Memory Training Versus Yogic Meditation Training in Older Adults With Mild Cognitive Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this pilot study intervention is to investigate brain mechanisms of response to memory enhancement training (MET) compared to Kundalini yoga and Kirtan Kriya meditation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that will be acquired from each subject at baseline and at 12 weeks (post-randomization). Overall, the investigators anticipate recruiting 66 adults with memory complaints and diagnosed with MCI for adults 55 years old and older. Subjects will either receive: (1) MET class for 60 minutes per week; or (2) Kundalini yoga and Kirtan Kriya meditation class for 60 minutes per week. All assessments will be completed immediately after the interventions for a total of 10 visits in 12 weeks and a follow-up visit at 6 months (24 weeks)to monitor the overall benefit of the intervention.</detailed_description>
