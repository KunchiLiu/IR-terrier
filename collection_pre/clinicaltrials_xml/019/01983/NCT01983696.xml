	<brief_title>The Effect of Low Oxygen Tension on the Early Development of Human Embryo in IVF/ICSI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The oocytes will be divided into two parts(two groups) form one patient. The two groups of oocytes will be cultured seperately in the incubator with the concentrations of 5% CO2,6%O2,89% N2(low oxygen concentration) verse 6% CO2,20% O2,74% N2(in atmosphere). A series of observational measurement(embryo quality and outcomes of pregnancy) will be performed.</detailed_description>
