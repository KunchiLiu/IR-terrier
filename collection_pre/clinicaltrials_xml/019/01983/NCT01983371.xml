	<brief_title>Diagnostic Accuracy of Ferumoxytol-Enhanced MRI for Detecting Lymph Node Metastases in Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will investigate the accuracy of ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI in detecting lymph nodes that have been invaded by tumor cells in patients with colorectal cancer. This study will be performed in addition to any ongoing routine care and will not serve as a substitute for any imaging tests that would be routinely performed prior to surgery.</detailed_description>
