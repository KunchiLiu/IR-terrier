	<brief_summary>Liver fibrosis has been considered as irreversible change. However, recent study showed that early stage liver fibrosis could be reversible and a lot of new drugs are now developing or developed including anti-viral treatment. Liver biopsy is considered as golden standard for the evaluation of liver fibrosis. But biopsy specimen through biopsy only consists of 1/50000 of the whole liver and heterogeneity of liver fibrosis, accurate diagnosis of liver fibrosis is still challenging. Furthermore, its invasive nature, repeated biopsy is practically almost impossible. Hence, non-invasive diagnosis of liver fibrosis is important. In this study we hypothesized that multi-parametric MR imaging including MR elastography, conventional DWI, and IVIM can predict changes of liver stiffness after anti-viral therapy in patients with chronic liver disease. We will enroll 60 biopsy-proven patients and perform multi-parametric MR imaging at the enrollment and one year later to evaluate changes in quantitative values in MR.</brief_summary>
