	<brief_summary>Malnutrition is seen frequently in hemodialysis units in most developing countries. Malnutrition increases morbidity and mortality in this population and its treatment improves patient survival and health status The purpose of this study is to compare two strategies to improve nutritional status in hemodialysis patients: renal-specific oral supplement (237 ml) versus egg albumin-based protein supplement (30 g) on a daily basis. This trial uses the Malnutrition Inflammation Score (MIS) and Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) in addition to most used biochemical markers to determine nutritional status.</brief_summary>
