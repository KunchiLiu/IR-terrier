	<brief_summary>Gallstone formation is multifactorial: immutable risk factors include genetics and ethnicity, age and being female, and mutable risk factors include obesity, and metabolic syndrome, diet, rapid weight loss, and other conditions such as cirrhosis, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, gallbladder stasis, and the use of certain drugs like Ceftriazone. Previous studies have linked serum cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and fatty liver disease to gallbladder disease. Given betaine's reported beneficial effects on fatty liver and lipid profile, A-F Betafood速 may have a beneficial effect on gallbladder function. The objective of the study is to assess the effect of A-F Betafood速 on gallbladder and liver function as measured by gallbladder ultrasounds and liver function tests. The hypothesis is that A-F Betafood速 will improve gallbladder and liver function after the 12 week treatment period. This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study with two arms. This study will consist of a single 12 week treatment period. The planned sample size for this study is 50 overweight female subjects, with 25 subjects randomized equally to each of the two study arms in double-blind manner at a ratio of 1:1</brief_summary>
