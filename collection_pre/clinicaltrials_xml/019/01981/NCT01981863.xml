	<brief_summary>It is common practice to use antifibrinolytic agents before and during cardiopulmonary bypass. They are not without side effects. The investigators want to show that there is no proof of fibrinolysis in standard sternotomy cardiac surgery patients before cardiopulmonary bypass, and that antifibrinolytic agents should only be started on cardiopulmonary bypass.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fibrinolysis Before Cardiopulmonary Bypass?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Double-blind, placebo controlled, prospective study in two groups of 20 patients. Control group (A) receives standard Epsilonaminocaproic acid treatment before cardiopulmonary bypass (10 gr loading dose, and 1 gr/hr infusion), and second group (B) receives placebo. Before start of Epsilonaminocaproic acid/placebo, D-Dimers and Thromboelastography are measured, repeated just before full heparinization. After heparinization group A receives placebo, and group B Epsilonaminocaproic acid.</detailed_description>
