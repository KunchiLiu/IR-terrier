	<brief_summary>PF-05180999 is a phosphodiesterase-2 inhibitor that is hypothesized to be able to reduce vascular permeability. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and effects on histamine-induced wheal of single doses of PF-05180999 in healthy adult subjects. Histamine-induced wheals are biomarkers of vascular permeability.</brief_summary>
