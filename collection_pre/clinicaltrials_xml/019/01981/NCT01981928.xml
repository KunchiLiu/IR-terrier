	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to see how safe the study drug is and how well it is tolerated after dosing. The study will also investigate how the study drug is taken up, metabolized (chemically broken down), distributed through the body and excreted. A further aim is to look at how this process is possibly altered by food by giving the study drug in the presence and absence of meals.</brief_summary>

Male subject must not donate sperm starting at screening and throughout the clinical study period and for 90 days after the final study drug administration. Subject agrees not to participate in another interventional study while in this clinical study. Subject has a known or suspected hypersensitivity to ASP7962 or any components of the formulation used.Subject has any history or evidence of any clinically significant cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, endocrine, hematologic, hepatic, immunologic, metabolic, urologic, pulmonary, neurologic, dermatologic, psychiatric, renal, and/or other major disease or malignancy, as judged by the Medical Investigator. Subject has any clinically significant abnormality following the Investigator's review of the physical examination, ECG and clinical study protocoldefined clinical laboratory tests at screening or on admission to the clinical unit on day 1. Subject regularly uses any inducer of metabolism (e.g., barbiturates, rifampin) in the 3 months prior to admission to the clinical unit on day 1. Subject had any significant blood loss, donated 1 unit (450 mL) of blood or more, or received a transfusion of any blood or blood products within 60 days or donated plasma within 7 days prior to admission to the clinical unit on day 1.
