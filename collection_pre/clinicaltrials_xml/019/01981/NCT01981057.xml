	<brief_summary>The aim of this prospective noninterventional study is to evaluate the clinical application of Numeta® in preterm infants and critically ill neonates in comparison to individualized prescribed parenteral nutrition. With the prescription software Cato-PAN® (by Cato software solutions) exact valid prescriptions for ordering parenteral nutrition solutions for premature infants are compared. Each PN solution is prescribed individually as well as with Numeta. Prescriptions were mirrored with respect to weight, venous approach, total volume and amount of enteral feeding, 24h medication and flipped vice versa. The key nutrient for calculating Numeta prescriptions was protein. The results of PN prescriptions were compared with each other/ESPGHAN recommendations. The investigators hypothesize that nutrimental content of Numeta prescriptions is equal to individually prescribed .parenteral nutrition solutions</brief_summary>
