	<brief_summary>Our goal is to demonstrate that healthy volunteers treated with fenobam will develop a significantly reduced area of cutaneous hyperalgesia compared to volunteers treated with placebo, after exposure to the heat/capsaicin model of cutaneous sensitization. Additionally we are going to assess changes in mood/affect and cognitive function of subjects following administration of fenobam and after cutaneous sensitization compared to baseline.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fenobam on Heat/Capsaicin Induced Hyperalgesia in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All subjects will receive a topical dose of capsaicin cream 0.1%(Capzasin-HP) to the forearm at the start of the study visit. The order of the 2 treatment regimens indicated below will be randomized and blinded to subjects and researchers. Treatment Regimen 1: Fenobam [1-(3-chlorophenyl)-3-(1-methyl-4-oxo-2-imidazolidinylidine) urea hydrate]: administration of one 150 mg gelatin capsule. Treatment Regimen 2: Placebo (lactose monohydrate): administration of one 150 mg gelatin capsule.</detailed_description>
