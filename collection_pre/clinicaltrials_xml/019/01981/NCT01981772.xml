	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical efficacy of a buffered 4% lidocaine solution for incision and drainage. Ninety patients will be examined clinically to determine a diagnosis of cellulitis or fluctuance. The diagnosis will be confirmed by incision and drainage. Patients will receive either 3.6 ml 4% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine or 3.6 ml 4% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine buffered with 8.4% sodium bicarbonate. Patients will rate pain prior to and throughout the procedure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Buffered Lidocaine in Patients With Facial Swelling</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Incision and drainage of swellings is painful and anesthetic failure is common. One reason may be related to the lowered pH of inflamed tissue reducing the amount of the base form of anesthetic. A buffered anesthetic solution may result in more effective anesthesia than a non-buffered solution.</detailed_description>
