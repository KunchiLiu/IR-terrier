	<brief_summary>It was well known that aspiration is the primary cause of an aspiration pneumonia among the dysphagia patients. In order to predict the degree of an aspitation,video-fluoroscopic-swallowing study and fiberoptic-endoscopic swallowing evaluation have been developed, but those evaluations are invasive and allowed only in a limited condition. In this study, as a precedent study for the non-linear analysis, voice analysis using LPC method will be evaluated. The superiority of LPC method will be compared with a spectral analysis using Jitter and Simmer as a positive control. This clinical study will be performed prospective, positive-controlled, single-blind (i.e. assessor-blind),and single cohort clinical trial for efficacy</brief_summary>
