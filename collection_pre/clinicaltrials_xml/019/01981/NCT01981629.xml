	<brief_summary>Currently, bedside ultrasound (US) is performed routinely in emergency department (ED) patients with undifferentiated shock to help guide resuscitation. Previously, it has never been possible to measure cardiac output on patients in the ED. Our clinical question looks at whether the USCOM device gives clinically relevant information in addition to ED cardiac US in patients with shock.</brief_summary>
