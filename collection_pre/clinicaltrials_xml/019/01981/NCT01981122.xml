	<brief_title>A Study of Sipuleucel-T With Administration of Enzalutamide in Men With Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, open-label study designed to assess the effects of sipuleucel-T when administered concurrently or sequentially with enzalutamide. This study consists of 3 phases. The screening phase will begin at the completion of the informed consent process and continue through registration. The active phase will begin at registration and continue through the post-treatment visit (30 to 37 days following the last study treatment). The long term follow-up (LTFU) phase will begin after the post-treatment visit and will continue until the subject's death or until Dendreon terminates the study.</detailed_description>

Metastatic disease as evidenced by bone metastasis or lymph node metastasis. Castrateresistant prostate cancer as demonstrated by one of the following: Prostate specific antigen progression. Progression of measurable disease. Progression of nonmeasurable disease by soft tissue disease or bone disease. Castration levels of testosterone (≤ 50 ng/dL) achieved via medical or surgical castration. Serum PSA ≥ 2.0 ng/mL. Screening ECOG performance status ≤ 1 Adequate screening hematologic, renal, and liver function as evidenced by laboratory test results obtained ≤ 28 days prior to registration. Negative serology test for human immunodeficiency virus 1 and 2. Resides within driving distance (round trip within 1 day) of the clinical trial site for the duration of the active phase. The presence of known lung, liver, or brain metastases, malignant pleural effusions, or malignant ascites. Spinal cord compression, imminent long bone fracture, or any other condition that is likely to require radiation therapy and/or steroids for pain control during the active phase. History of stage 3 or greater cancer, excluding prostate cancer. Basal or squamous cell skin cancers must have been adequately treated and the subject must be disease free at the time of registration. Subjects with a history of stage 1 or 2 cancer must have been adequately treated and been disease free for ≥ 3 years at the time of registration. History of seizures or of predisposing factors for seizures. ChildPugh Class C hepatic insufficiency. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to sipuleucelT, GMCSF or granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF). Previous treatment with sipuleucelT or enrollment in a sipuleucelT trial, regardless of whether the subject received sipuleucelT or control. Previous treatment with enzalutamide. Previous treatment with abiraterone acetate. Previous treatment with ipilimumab. Previous treatment with ketoconazole other than topical use or for treatment of infections (e.g., oral thrush); most recent use must have been ≥ 7 days prior to registration. Previous treatment with any immunotherapy or investigational vaccine. A requirement for ongoing systemic immunosuppressive therapy. Use of inhaled, intranasal, intraarticular, and topical steroids is allowed. Oral or IV steroids to prevent or treat IV contrast reactions are allowed. Previous treatment with chemotherapy for mCRPC, or chemotherapy for any reason ≤ 2 years prior to registration. Use of concomitant medications that may lower the seizure threshold or the use of antiseizure medications ≤ 1 year prior to registration. Received GMCSF or GCSF ≤ 90 days prior to registration. Ongoing nonsteroidal antiandrogen withdrawal response. Any of the following medications or interventions ≤ 28 days prior to registration: Radiation therapy, either via external beam or brachytherapy. Any systemic steroid. Use of inhaled, intranasal, intraarticular, and topical steroids is allowed. Oral or IV steroids to prevent or treat IV contrast reactions are allowed. Any systemic therapy for prostate cancer, except for ADT. Any investigational product for prostate cancer. Major surgery requiring general anesthesia, with the exception of placement of central venous catheters. Inducers and inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme CYP2C8 (gemfibrozil and rifampin). Medications that are metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19 that have a narrow therapeutic index. Inducers of CYP3A4 (including but not limited to phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, and phenobarbital). A requirement for treatment with opioid analgesics for cancerrelated pain ≤ 21 days prior to registration. An active infection requiring parenteral antibiotic therapy or causing fever (temperature &gt; 100.5˚ F or 38.1˚ C) ≤ 1 week prior to registration. Any medical intervention, any other condition, or any other circumstance which could compromise adherence with study requirements or otherwise compromise the study's objectives.</criteria>
