	<brief_summary>To examine the feasibility of progressive unilateral knee-extension strength training using ankle weight cuffs in patients hospitalized due to acute exacerbation in COPD</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility of Strength Training in Patients Hospitalized Due to COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We decided that feasibility is indicated if: 1) the absolute training loads increase progressively, 2) more than 80% of the planned training sessions are completed, and 3)if the absolute training loads do not exceed 20 kg (2 x10kg weight cuffs) for 90% of patients.</detailed_description>
