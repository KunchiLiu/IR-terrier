The navigator will provide tailored information and assistance to help dialysis patients complete the tasks required at each step in the transplant process. In the control group, dialysis patients will continue to get usual care from their nephrologists and dialysis facility personnel. Hypothesis: Compared to control patients, intervention patients will be significantly more likely to be wait listed or receive a kidney transplant.</brief_summary>
