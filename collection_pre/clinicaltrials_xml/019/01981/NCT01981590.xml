	<criteria>Subjects older than 18 years of age Subject is undergoing a cardiac catheterization involving right heart catheterization and/or EP procedures and/or device implant. Subjects willing and able to give informed consent Subject with a previously implanted transvenous lead, which is still present in the veins under study. Subject with evidence of phrenic nerve palsy. Subject with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Subject with a spinal cord stimulator. Subject needs to receive drugs that might interfere with patient perception. Subjects with medical conditions that would prevent study participation Subjects who are pregnant, nursing, or of child bearing potential and are not on a reliable form of birth control Subjects enrolled in concurrent studies which could confound the results of this study Subject is unable or unwilling to participate with study procedures</criteria>
