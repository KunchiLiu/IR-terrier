	<brief_summary>Extracoporeal shock wave therapy(ESWT) was perfomed on the plantar fascia of chornic plantar fasciitis patients. Pre-ESWT and post-ESWT pain intensity, sonography and sonoelastrography of the plantar fascia was checked. Our hypothesis is that the plantar fascia stiffness increased after ESWT as clinical symptom improves.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sonoelastographic Changes After Low Energy Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT) in Plantar Fasciitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For patient who met the inclusion criteria, we check sonography and sonoelastography for their plantar fascias and obtain a thorough evulation questionaire for clinical symptom and pain condition and intensity in various conditions, also SF-36 questionaire first. Inform consent was done. After the ESWT, we follow patient with questionaire and sonography/sonoelastography at 1-week, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, 9-month, and 12-month post-ESWT time. The colored sonoelastographic image was analysed by computer software "Image-J" with hue analysis method and relative stiffness of selected area within proximal plantar fascia wasa obtained for statistical analysis.</detailed_description>
