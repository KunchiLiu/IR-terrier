	<brief_title>Adherence to Treatment, Safety and Tolerability Study of the Medical Information Device #1 (MIND1) in Subjects With Schizophrenia or Bipolar I Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Poor adherence to medication is a well-recognized problem in psychiatric patients and is a barrier to achieving optimal health. The MIND1 System is being developed to objectively and precisely monitor and measure real-time medication adherence; and to potentially enhance adherence. The MIND1 System includes oral aripiprazole with an embedded ingestible event marker (IEM), a Wearable Sensor, and a computerized device and accessories. This is a trial designed to evaluate adherence to treatment with, and safety and tolerability of, the medical information device #1 (MIND1) system in subjects with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder. This 12-week, single-arm trial will include male and female subjects 18 to 65years (inclusive) with a current diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder who are currently treated with oral aripiprazole.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males and females 18 to 65 years of age, inclusive, at time of informed consent Schizophrenia: Patients with two or more exacerbations of symptoms in past year leading to an intervention, per investigator's judgment (ie, inpatient psychiatric hospitalization, psychiatric ER visit, admission to partial hospitalization program, crisis residential treatment, etc.). This does not include outpatient adjustment of medication. Bipolar I Disorder: Patients with at least one manic episode or exacerbation of bipolar symptoms in past year resulting in an intervention, per Investigator's judgment (i.e., inpatient psychiatric hospitalization, psychiatric ER visit, admission to partial hospitalization program, crisis residential treatment, etc.) This does not include outpatient adjustment of medication. Current primary Axis1 diagnosis of bipolar 1 disorder or schizophrenia as defined by DSMIVTR criteria Bipolar 1 disorder patients with a total YMRS score of 10 to 25 (inclusive) Schizophrenia patients with a total PANSS score of 60 to 90 (inclusive) Currently prescribed oral Aripiprazole for either bipolar 1 disorder or schizophrenia. No changes in their Aripiprazole dose or regimen 2 weeks before screening. Subjects must be able to tolerate blood draws. If subject is on other psychotropic medications, he/she must be on a stable dose and regimen over the last 2 weeks. Subjects with a current Axis I (DSMIVTR) diagnosis other than bipolar 1 disorder or schizophrenia Subjects with a current Axis II (DSMIVTR) diagnosis History of inpatient hospitalization for any psychiatric reason within 2 months before screening Subjects who reside or attend a facility where medication is administered to them Subject has received any investigational product within the last 30 days Allergic, intolerant, or unresponsive to prior treatment with Aripiprazole or other quinolinones History of hypersensitivity to antipsychotic agents</criteria>
