	<brief_summary>Dehydration can result from exposure to harsh environments including hot and dry desert climates. Soldiers and non-military workers are frequently required to work in hot, dry conditions, and dehydration can be productivity limiting and life threatening if unrecognized.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-Invasive Optical Spectroscopic Methods for Dehydration Identification in Marathon Trainees</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research can use low power laser technology to take measurements of muscle tissue water content in volunteers before and after marathon training runs to detect dehydration. Two slightly different devices can be used to detect dehydration. 1). diffuse optical spectroscopy and 2). spatial frequency domain imaging-modulated imaging The researchers can determined by use other methods to assess the level of dehydration status in runners. These methods will include taking weight and temperature before and after run, skin-fold measurements pre and post run, and obtaining saliva samples from before and after run. The researchers can determine the study use non-invasive, laser light technology measure tissue water concentrations, as an indicator of dehydration.</detailed_description>
