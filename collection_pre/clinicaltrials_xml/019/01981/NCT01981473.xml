	<brief_title>Drug Concentration, Immunogenicity, and Efficacy Study in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis Currently Treated With Etanercept, Adalimumab, or Infliximab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>cross-sectional Population will be selected through convenience sampling. Patients sequentially visiting the rheumatology clinic for routine care who are receiving etanercept, adalimumab, or infliximab for between 6 and 24 months will be evaluated for eligibility and interest in participation.
