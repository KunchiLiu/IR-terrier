	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to determine if the diagnostic performance of DaTscan™ single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging is different in non-Caucasian subjects compared with Caucasian subjects with movement disorders.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>For NonCaucasians: NonCaucasian male and female adult subjects (greater than or equal to 18 years of age) with an initial diagnosis of suspected PD or ET who underwent DaTscan SPECT imaging to assist with the subject's final clinical diagnosis of PD or ET. The subject has existing diagnosticquality and interpretable DaTscan SPECT images of the brain. For Caucasians: Caucasian male and female adult subjects (greater than or equal to 18 years of age) with an initial diagnosis of suspected PD or ET who underwent DaTscan SPECT imaging to assist with the subject's final clinical diagnosis of PD or ET. The subject has existing diagnosticquality and interpretable DaTscan SPECT images of the brain. The subject is matched by final clinical diagnosis, sex and age (±5 years) with a nonCaucasian subject. Known/suspected structural abnormalities of the brain (e.g., hydrocephalus; brain tumor; stroke; etc.) that can grossly distort the DaTscan images. Subjects whose race and ethnic information cannot be determined from source document review.</criteria>
