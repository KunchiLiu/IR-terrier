	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the effects of medium chain triglyceride consumption, relative to long chain triglycerides, on hormones involved in appetite regulation and food intake in overweight men. We expect medium chain triglycerides to reduce appetite and food intake and to do so by increasing levels of hormones known to be involved in satiety and reduce levels of those involved in appetite.</brief_summary>
