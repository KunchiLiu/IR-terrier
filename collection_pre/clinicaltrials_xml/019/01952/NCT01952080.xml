	<brief_summary>This will be an open label, 4-cohort study. Non-randomized subjects will receive teduglutide in each of the 3 active cohorts. An attempt will be made to enroll additional subjects into an observational cohort who will receive standard of care. Three doses of teduglutide are to be investigated for 12 weeks. All subjects will be screened prior to the start of treatment (SOT) to establish baseline characteristics including safety, eligibility and nutritional support parameters.</brief_summary>
