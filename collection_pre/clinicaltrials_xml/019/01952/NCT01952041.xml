	<brief_summary>The study is a three year research project whose aims are to design and test a state-of-the-science smartphone Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and sensor technologies to provide mobile monitoring of schizophrenia to detect early signs of relapse. The proposed system will be used to continuously capture multidimensional behavior as it occurs in real-time and in real-world environments, detect individual early warning signs, and trigger targeted interventions that may mitigate the severity of relapses or prevent their recurrence altogether. Mobile sensors include paralinguistic aspects of speech, physical activity and location, and sleep. The first hypothesis is that mobile sensing and EMA techniques will capture early behavioral warning signs. The second hypothesis is that machine learning, coupled with user input, will enable development of individualized predictive "risk signature" models. The third hypothesis is that automated system patient and provider functions will help prevent psychotic relapses.</brief_summary>
