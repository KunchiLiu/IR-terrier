	<brief_summary>The primary aim of the study is to compare migration of the cemented Corail stem representing polished surfaced versions of the femoral stem. Two different methods will be used for reaming the femoral canal and cementing of the stem. Radiostereometric analysis (RSA) will be used in migration measurements. Furthermore pain, postoperative outcome and patient satisfaction will be assessed.</brief_summary>
