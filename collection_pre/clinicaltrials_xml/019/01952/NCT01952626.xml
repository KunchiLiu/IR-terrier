	<brief_summary>Intrathecal administration of morphine is often used for control of postoperative pain. However, pruritus is one of the most common side effects of intrathecal morphine . Specific serotonin receptor antagonists could be an effective prophylactic treatment of neuraxial opioid-induced pruritus. It was reported that palonosetron is more effective than ondansetron for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Therefore, the investigators evaluated the efficacy of prophylactic administration of ondansetron and palonosetron for the prevention of intrathecal morphine-induced pruritus.</brief_summary>
