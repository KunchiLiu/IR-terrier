	<brief_summary>A comparative study to test the efficacy of a novel device - the MiniBoxPFT, in measuring TLC (total lung capacity) compared to TLC measured by standard body plethysmography using the ZAN 500. The study will be conducted as a prospective two-arm, open, randomized comparative study.</brief_summary>
