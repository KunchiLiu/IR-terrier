	<brief_title>Effect of Hypocaloric Diet and Exercise in Obese Women Who Are Subjected to IVF Cycle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is showing that obesity significantly affects the in vitro fertilization cycles lowering the reproductive capacity. The study is been performed in Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau and Fundació Puigvert of Barcelona. Patients recluted are obese women with sterility problems that require in vitro fertilization (IVF) with a body mass index BMI between 30-35. It´s a randomised study in which half of the patients undergo to a 6 weeks program of diet and exercice. We will analyse the response to ovaric stimulation, the results of the egg retrieval (ovocyte number and quality), rates of fecundation, embryo implantation and clinical gestation.</detailed_description>
