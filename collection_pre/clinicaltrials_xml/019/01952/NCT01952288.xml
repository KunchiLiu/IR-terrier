	<brief_title>Simvastatin for mTBI-II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans have experienced repetitive blast exposure mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) with persistent cognitive, emotional, and neurological postconcussive symptoms. There is an urgent need to develop effective treatments to reduce both the intensity of these Veterans' current symptoms as well as their potential long-term risks for developing neurodegenerative dementing disorders related to repetitive mTBI: chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Converging evidence suggests that statins may possess neuroprotective effects against pathologic processes related to tau protein metabolism that appear to be a common feature of CTE, AD, and other neurodegenerative sequelae of repetitive mTBI. The investigators propose a 12-month, double-blind, randomized, active-drug-controlled trial to establish proof-of-concept for use of simvastatin (40 mg/d) for decreasing CSF biomarkers of neurodegeneration and increasing CSF neurotrophins in 120 Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans with repetitive blast trauma mTBI.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males and females ages 2150 years. Documented hazardous duty in Iraq and or Afghanistan with the U.S. Armed Forces. Exposure to one or more blast trauma events resulting in mTBI according to American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine (ACRM) criteria. More than 6 months since last blast trauma exposure Ability to complete psychometric and other clinical assessments in English (i.e., adequate English language skills, vision and hearing). elevated cholesterol levels, i.e. total cholesterol &gt;200 and/or LDL &gt;130. This would generally prompt the initiation of a lipidlowering agent as standard care in the general medical community. No use of statins during the previous year and no recent (past 4 weeks) use of other lipidlowering drugs (e.g., fibrates, niacin &gt; 500mg/d, or high dose omega3 fatty acids) preceding randomization. No clinically significant laboratory abnormalities (electrolytes, glucose, carbon dioxide, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, vitamin B12, folate, albumin, thyroid stimulating hormone). Platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm2. Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18 and 36 inclusive History of head trauma with loss of consciousness (LOC)&gt;30 minutes, or with a penetrating head wound, or with moderate to severe memory or other cognitive impairment. Neurological disorders: multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, stroke, Parkinson's disease (PD), other degenerative Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders, or neuropathy with radicular involvement. Acute or chronic major psychiatric disorders: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or severe major depressive disorder, or severe anxiety disorder except PTSD and panic disorder (PTSD and depressive symptoms are common comorbid conditions for combat mTBI and a subset of these patients have symptoms consistent with panic disorder as well). Use of illegal drugs; alcohol abuse within the past 6 months. Poorly controlled hypertension, heart failure, coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, carotid artery disease, diabetes mellitus, pulmonary disease with hypoxia or hypercapnia, significant hepatic disease or hepatitis C seropositivity, renal failure, treatment for cancer, HIV positive, active infectious disease or presence of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Contraindications to lumbar puncture (LP) (e.g., spinal cord injury; deformity, severe disease or infection in the region of the lumbosacral spine; bleeding tendency, use of anticoagulant medications, or platelet count &lt;100,000/mm2). Receiving medication in an investigational drug study. Exclusionary medications (used in the 4 weeks prior to screening): Fibrates and niacin due to increased risk for myopathy in combination with statins; Potential drugdrug interactions with statins via effects on CYP3A4: itraconazole, ketoconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, nefazodone, amiodarone, cyclosporine, isoniazid, quinidine, or large quantities of grapefruit juice (&gt;1 quart daily); Selected CNSacting medications: antipsychotics, antiParkinson's disease medications and CNS stimulants Other medications affecting coagulation and/or inflammation: coumadin, potent antiinflammatory medications (hydrocortisone, methotrexate or other potent immunemodulating medications), and antiHIV medications. All female subjects of childbearing potential will undergo a urine pregnancy test at every subject visit; subjects with positive pregnancy test results will be excluded. In addition, all female subjects of childbearing potential will be required to use a reliable method of contraception throughout the duration of the study.</criteria>
