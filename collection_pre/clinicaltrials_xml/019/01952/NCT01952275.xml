	<brief_summary>This study investigates the genetic architecture of Neutrophil-Mediated Inflammatory Skin Diseases. After collecting informed consent, all patients' clinical phenotype is graded at inclusion with a detailed case report form and a discovery cohort formed based on the certainty of diagnosis. The DNA of patients in the discovery cohort is analyzed by whole exome sequencing which identifies all protein-coding genetic variants. Subsequently, statistical burden tests are going to identify enrichment of rare coding genetic variants in patients affected by Neutrophil-Mediated Inflammatory Skin Diseases. The ultimate goal is to reveal the responsible gene(s) that may then be targets for clinical intervention.</brief_summary>
