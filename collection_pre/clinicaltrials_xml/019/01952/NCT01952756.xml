	<brief_summary>1. The number and function of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are inversely associated with coronary risk factors and atherosclerotic diseases such as PAOD. 2. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effects of cilostazol on human early EPCs and angiogenesis as well as the potential mechanisms of action in patients with mild-to-moderate PAOD.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. titration of drugs 1. run-in period: eligible subjects are screened and baseline blood samples are obtained 2. study period: 12 weeks - 24 subjects with cilostazol and 20 subjects with dummy placebo - On the first day after the end of the study period, the follow-up data are obtained by the same procedure 3. blood sampling and measurement of serum biomarkers - obtained from peripheral veins in all study subjects at the run-in period and the end of the treatment period of the study - sent for isolation, cell culture, and assays of human EPCs - also stored for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Stromal cell derived factor-alfa1, adiponectin, soluble thrombomodulin, vascular endothelial growth factor) 2. assays of human EPCs 1. colony formation by EPCs 2. quantification of EPCs and apoptotic endothelial cells 3. chemotactic motility, proliferation/viability and apoptosis assays 3. collateral vessels formation and distal run-off assessed by dual-energy multi-slice computed tomography angiography 4. echocardiographic examinations to evaluate left ventricular functions</detailed_description>
