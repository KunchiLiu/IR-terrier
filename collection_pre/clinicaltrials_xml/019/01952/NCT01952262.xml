	<brief_summary>Diaphragmatic dysfunction is an important complication of mechanical ventilation. Critically ill patients admitted in a teaching hospital intensive care unit will be evaluated with diaphragm ultrasound to investigate predictors of diaphragmatic dysfunction and the clinical course of these patients. Vascular surgery patients (aortic abdominal surgery) might also be included and assessed with diaphragm ultrasound before and after surgery irrespectively of the need of intensive care unit. On December 2014 the Etical committee approved an amendment to include the possibility to study elective aortic abdominal surgery patient to assess the relationship between surgery related diaphragmatic dysfunction and postoperative respiratory complications.</brief_summary>
