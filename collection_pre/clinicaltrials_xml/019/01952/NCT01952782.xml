	<brief_summary>The investigators are seeking healthy volunteers and volunteers with reproductive disorders for the study of the role of dynorphin in the reproductive system. Dynorphin is a naturally occurring opioid hormone that is blocked by naloxone. We hypothesize that naloxone, by blocking dynorphin, will stimulate production of GnRH and kisspeptin, 2 other naturally occurring reproductive hormones.</brief_summary>
