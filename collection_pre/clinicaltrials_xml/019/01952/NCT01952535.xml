	<brief_title>A Clinical Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Oral HMS5552 in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled safety study with single oral doses of HMS5552 given to healthy volunteers. The primary objective is to characterize the safety profiles of HMS5552 following single ascending doses (SAD) in healthy adult subjects. The secondary objectives include: 1. To assess the pharmacokinetic profiles of HMS5552 after single dosing 2. To assess the preliminary pharmacodynamic profiles of HMS5552 Each study subject will receive a single oral dose of HMS5552. During each dosing, eight subjects will be allocated to receive HMS5552 and two subjects will be allocated to receive placebo treatment. Several doses of HMS5552 will be tested. Dose titration or reduction is determined for each cohort based on the safety and pharmacokinetic data obtained from the lower dose cohorts.</detailed_description>
