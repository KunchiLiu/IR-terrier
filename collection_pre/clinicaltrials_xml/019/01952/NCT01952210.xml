The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of nutritional and exercise intervention in locally advanced esophageal cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of a Nutritional Consultation and Exercise Program in Esophageal Cancer Patient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with esophageal cancer are often malnourished at presentation due to the primary symptom of dysphagia. Treatments for esophageal cancer are commonly multimodal, incorporating polychemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. These treatments frequently cause or exacerbate poor nutritional status. Recent literature has proved that malnutrition is associated with longer hospital stays, reduced responses to and increased complications from therapies, increased costs, worse quality of life and lower survival rate. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of an intensive nutritional consultation and exercise program on nutritional status and outcomes in patients undergoing chemoradiation for esophageal cancer.</detailed_description>
