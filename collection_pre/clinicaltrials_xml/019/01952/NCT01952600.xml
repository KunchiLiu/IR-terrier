	<brief_summary>The EPOCH-RRT study seeks to fill knowledge gaps by gaining more understanding of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients' priorities; assessing the comparative benefits of hemodialysis (HD) versus peritoneal dialysis (PD), with respect to these priorities; and providing tailored information to assist patients with identifying the best dialysis modality fit for their own unique circumstances and perspectives. The outcomes most relevant to patients ("patient-centered") extend beyond those traditionally assessed in clinical research, with the relative importance varying across patient groups. A tailored decision aid based on these findings can improve patient decision-making processes regarding choice of dialysis modality.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Empowering Patients On Choices for Renal Replacement Therapy (EPOCH-RRT)study seeks to identify factors that matter the most to patients with kidney disease and study how they are impacted by different types of dialysis. The inclusion of patients, caregivers, and patient advocacy organizations as research partners will assure that the study addresses questions of greatest relevance to patients facing the need for dialysis. Aim One of EPOCH-RRT identifies outcomes that are most important to different groups of advanced CKD and dialysis patients through qualitative methods applied for conducting in-depth interviews.</detailed_description>
