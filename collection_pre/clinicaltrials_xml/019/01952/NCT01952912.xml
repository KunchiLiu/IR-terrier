	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that Plasmakinetic Enucleation of the Prostate (PkEP) might yield functional results comparable to OP but with lower perioperative morbidity, and have equivalent long-term efficacy with OP for large prostates. The first objective was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of PKEP compared to OP concerning Qmax at one year postoperatively. To explore the long-term efficacy, we compared the efficacy, safety, and morbidity of PkEP with those of OP in BPH patients with prostate glands larger than 100 g over a follow-up period of 6 years.</brief_summary>
