	<brief_summary>Background: The oral bioavailability of curcumin is low due to its limited intestinal uptake, rapid metabolism and excretion from the body. Considering its potent reported health-beneficial properties, researchers have tried to increase its bioavailability as a means to enhance its biological activities. Objective: The aim of the project was to develop novel curcumin formulations with enhanced oral bioavailability and to study the safety of the formulations and potential sex-differences in humans. Design: In this single-blind crossover study with three arms separated by â‰¥1-week washout periods, healthy subjects (13 women, 10 men) were provided standardized meals and took, in random order, a single oral dose of 500 mg curcumin as native powder, micronized powder, or liquid micelles. Blood and urine samples were collected in intervals for 24 h and total curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bis-demethoxycurcumin were quantified.</brief_summary>
