	<brief_summary>Intake of whole grain cereals has been associated with reducing the risk of hyperlipidaemia and heart disease, however the mechanisms by which oats or oat fractions exert this effect is not totally clear. Furthermore, several large epidemiological studies and a number of recent meta-analyses of nutritional interventions have reported a positive association between increased whole grain intake and reduced risk of developing a range of chronic diseases. Recognising the important role of the gut microbiota in metabolism and metabolic disease risk, we examined the impact of whole grain oats on the human gut microbiota and cardio-metabolic risk factors. The main aims of this human study is to determine the effectiveness of a low GI whole grain oats breakfast cereal compared to a high GI, refined breakfast cereal to beneficially modulate gut microbiota and its metabolic output, plasma lipids, gut satiety hormones and inflammation markers in an at risk of cardio-metabolic disease population</brief_summary>
