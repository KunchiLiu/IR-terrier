	<brief_summary>The purpose of the research study is to collect information about brain function and structure among active duty military personnel or civilians who are healthy. Researchers want to develop a database from normal volunteers that will be used in comparison with a similar database from active duty military with post-concussive syndrome (PCS) from a mild traumatic brain injury. Findings from this study may be used to design larger studies that will evaluate whether hyperbaric oxygen treatments actually improve PCS. Participants in this study will undergo numerous tests to assess physical, mental, and intellectual health and how they might change over time. Participants will wear heart and activity monitors, undergo brain imaging, provide blood and urine for laboratory testing, and have vision, hearing, balance, and muscle function tests. They will also complete a number of questionnaires and interviews. This battery of tests will be repeated twice more over the course of 6 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Normative Datasets for Assessments Planned for Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (NORMAL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose of this study will develop a database from normal healthy participants for the same outcomes used in a program of studies of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) vs. sham control in participants with persistent post-concussive symptoms. This study will characterize the distribution of responses and change in responses over time for each of the outcomes and will examine associations between measures within a given normal participant and across participant characteristics such as age and gender. It will evaluate the test-retest reliability of a series of assessments anticipated for use in the primary, secondary, and exploratory outcomes of this program of studies. A secondary purpose of this study is to compare normative values to results from randomized exploratory studies of HBO2 vs. sham control in participants with persistent post-concussive symptoms. Also, investigators will examine relationships between outcome measures from normal participants (with respect to clinical equivalence, participant burden, and risk) and compare to associations observed in other studies. In this study, normal, healthy, non-brain injured civilians and military participants (active or inactive) will undergo a battery of outcome assessments at defined test intervals to replicate the assessment battery used in a program of studies investigating the safety of HBO2 in patients with post-concussive symptoms following mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). The planned comprehensive assessments will obtain robust neuropsychological, physiological, and neuroimaging data. Other evaluations will include laboratory testing and evaluations of the auditory, vestibular, and visual systems. Neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography angiography) will be assessed in participants at baseline and 6 months. Neurological function and electroencephalography (EEG) will be assessed at baseline only. All other in-person outcome measures will be assessed in participants at baseline, at 13 weeks, and 6 months.</detailed_description>
