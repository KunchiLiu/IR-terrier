	<criteria>1. The subject is a healthy male Korean aged 21 to 45 years, inclusive. 2. The subject has a body mass index (BMI) range of 18.5 to 25.0 kg/m2, inclusive, and weighs at least 50 kg. 3. The subject provided written, informed consent prior to any clinical studyspecific procedures. 4. Male subject and his female spouse/partner who is of childbearing potential must be using highly effective barrier method of contraception starting at screening and continue throughout the clinical study period and for 3 months after final study drug administration. 5. Male subject must not donate sperm starting at screening and throughout the clinical study period and for 3 months after final study drug administration. 1. Any clinically significant history of allergic conditions 2. Any history or evidence of any clinically significant disease or as judged by the Investigator. 3. Any clinically significant abnormality after the Investigator's review of the physical examination, ECG and clinical study protocoldefined clinical laboratory tests at screening or admission to the clinical unit. 4. A mean pulse of &lt;45 or &gt;90 beats per minute (bpm) and mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt;140 mmHg; mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt;90 mmHg 5. A mean QTcB interval &gt;450 ms at screening. If the mean QTcB exceeds the limits above, one additional triplicate ECG may be taken. If this triplicate also gives an abnormal result, the subject should be excluded. 6. Use of any prescribed or nonprescribed drugs in the 2 weeks prior to study drug administration, except for the occasional use of paracetamol (up to 2 g/day). 7.

The subject has any other condition, which in the opinion of the Investigator precludes the subject's participation in the clinical study. 16. Employee of the Sponsor or the site. 17. Vulnerable subjects, e.g. subjects kept in detention. 18. Veins unsuitable for repeat venipuncture. 19. Are unlikely to comply with the protocol requirements, instructions and study related restrictions; e.g. uncooperative attitude, inability to return for followup visits and improbability of completing the clinical study.</criteria>
