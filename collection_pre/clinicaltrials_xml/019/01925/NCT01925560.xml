	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to assess the tolerance and utilization of agave inulin. This will be accomplished through analyses of breath and fecal samples to quantify fermentation end-products- hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane will be measured in the breath, and short-chain fatty acids, ammonia, phenol, and indole will be measured in feces. Microbial populations will also be measured in fecal samples.</brief_summary>
