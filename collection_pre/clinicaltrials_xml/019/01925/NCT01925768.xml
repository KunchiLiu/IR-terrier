	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Apremilast to Treat Psoriatic Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 3b, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apremilast monotherapy in subjects with active psoriatic arthritis. Approximately 214 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either apremilast 30 mg BID (twice a day) or identically-appearing placebo, with approximately 107 subjects per treatment group. This is a 113-week study. The subjects will spend 24 weeks in the double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment phase, followed by 28 weeks of active treatment phase (ie, up to Week 52 visit). The original treatment assignments (apremilast 30 mg BID (twice a day) or placebo) will remain blinded until all subjects have completed their Week 52 visit (or have discontinued). After the Week 52 visit, all subjects in the extension phase will continue to receive treatment with apremilast 30 mg BID (twice a day) until the end of the study (ie, up to Week 104 visit) or until early discontinuation from the trial. The study will consist of 5 phases: 1. Screening Phase - up to 5 weeks 2. Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Double Blind Treatment Phase - Weeks 0 to 24 3. Active Treatment Phase - Week 24 to Week 52 4. Open-label Extension Phase - Week 52 to Week 104 5. Post-treatment Observational Follow-up Phase</detailed_description>

Subjects taking disease modifying antirheumatoid drugs (DMARDs), with the exception of cyclosporine and leflunomide (see 7.3. Exclusion Criteria 20, 21), do not require a washout, however, they must discontinue the DMARD treatment at least one day prior to their baseline visit (ie, Visit 2, Day 0) 11. Subjects who have been previously treated with leflunomide will require a 12week washout or treatment with the cholestyramine, per leflunomide prescribing label (ie. 8 g cholestyramine 3 times daily for 11 days. 12. Subjects who have been previously treated with cyclosporine will require a 4week washout prior to randomization to participate in the study 13. If taking oral corticosteroids, must be on a stable dose of prednisone less than or equal to 10 mg/day or equivalent for at least 30 days prior to baseline visit (ie, Day 0) 14.

If initial test shows ALT or AST greater than 2 times the ULN, one repeat test is allowed during the screening period. Total bilirubin less than or equal to 2 mg/dL (less than or equal to 34 μmol/L) or Albumin greater than LLN. If initial test result is greater than 2 mg/dL, one repeat test is allowed during the screening period. Hemoglobin at least 9 g/dL (at least 5.6 mmol/L) Hemoglobin A1c less than or equal to 9.0% 16. All females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must use one of the approved contraceptive options as described below while on investigational product and for at least 28 days after administration of the last dose of the investigational product. At the time of study entry, and at any time during the study when a female subject of childbearing potential's contraceptive measures or ability to become pregnant changes, the investigator will educate the subject regarding contraception options and the correct and consistent use of effective contraceptive methods in order to successfully prevent pregnancy. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and Baseline. All FCBP subjects who engage in activity in which conception is possible must use one of the approved contraceptive options described below: Option 1: Any one of the following highly effective methods: hormonal contraception (oral, injection, implant, transdermal patch, vaginal ring); intrauterine device (IUD); tubal ligation; or partner's vasectomy; OR Option 2: Male or female condom (latex condom or non latex condom NOT made out of natural [animal] membrane [for example, polyurethane]; PLUS one additional barrier method: (a) diaphragm with spermicide; (b) cervical cap with spermicide; or (c) contraceptive sponge with spermicide. 17.
