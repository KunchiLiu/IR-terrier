	<brief_title>Safety Study of Adenovirus Hepatocyte Growth Factor to Treat Ischemic Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Ischemic heart disease refers to a group of closely related syndromes by an imbalance between the myocardial oxygen demand and the blood supply. 2. Gene therapy offers an attractive alternative to current pharmacologic therapies and may be beneficial in refractory disease. Gene therapy with hepatocyte growth factor induces angiogenesis, decreases apoptosis and leads to protection in the ischemic heart. In this study, we mainly explore the safety and effects of adenovirus hepatocyte growth factor for the treatment of ischemic heart disease.</detailed_description>
