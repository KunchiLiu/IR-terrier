	<brief_summary>This study has 3 parts. The purpose of Part 1 of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of brentuximab vedotin in combination with RCHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) (known as BV+RCHOP) in patients with DLBCL that have never been treated. Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive RCHOP together with 1 of 2 doses of brentuximab vedotin. Patients will be tested to see if there is a difference in side effects between the 2 groups. The purpose of Part 2 of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of brentuximab vedotin in combination with RCHP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone) (known as BV+RCHP) in patients with CD30-positive DLBCL that have never been treated. Patients will be enrolled to receive RCHP together with 1.8mg/kg of brentuximab vedotin. The purpose of Part 3 of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of BV+RCHP compared to standard RCHOP in patients with CD30-positive DLBCL that have never been treated. Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either BV+RCHP or RCHOP. Patients will be tested to see if there is a difference in side effects between the 2 groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Brentuximab Vedotin Combined With RCHOP or RCHP in Front-line Treatment of Patients With Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the first part of this study, patients in the 2 groups were tested to see if there was a difference in the response to treatment and whether there were differences in the side effects (unwanted effects). After the sponsor and study doctors reviewed side effects in both dose levels, they noticed that patients in the higher dose of brentuximab vedotin had more problems with nerve function in their arms or legs (peripheral neuropathy). The patients receiving the lower dose of brentuximab vedotin did not report more problems with nerve function in their arms or legs (peripheral neuropathy) compared to the patients receiving the higher dose, so the higher dose is not being used anymore in combination with RCHOP and all patients will be treated with the lower dose. The second and third parts of the study are being done to see if there are any side effects (unwanted effects) of the higher dose of brentuximab vedotin when combined with a modified version of RCHOP that omits vincristine, which may also cause peripheral neuropathy. The third part of the study is also being tested to see if there is a difference between BV+RCHP and RCHOP in the response to treatment.</detailed_description>
