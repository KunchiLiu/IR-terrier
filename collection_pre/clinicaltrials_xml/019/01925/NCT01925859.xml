Any clinically significant abnormality on standard laboratory examinations (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis), as determined by the Investigator, in consultation with the Sponsor. 19. History of hepatitis B and/or C, and/or positive serology results, which indicate the presence of hepatitis B and/or C (Hepatitis B surface antigen and/or antibody to Hepatitis C). 20.
