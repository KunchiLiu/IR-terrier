	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the direct effects of the ten-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine administered to infants on nasopharyngeal carriage at 3 to 5 years of age. These children have been vaccinated in infancy in the cluster-randomized Finnish Invasive pneumococcal Disease (FinIP) Trial (a separate protocol reported at ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT00861380) during 2009 to 2011. Also the indirect effect on nasopharyngeal carriage will be assessed on vaccinees' elder non-vaccinated siblings aged 5 to 9 years.</brief_summary>
