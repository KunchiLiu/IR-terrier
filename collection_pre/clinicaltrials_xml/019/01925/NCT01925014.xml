	<brief_title>Low vs. Standard Dose CT for Appendicitis Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Acute appendicitis is a very common disease. Many patients are adolescents or young adults. - CT is the current standard imaging test for the diagnosis of appendicitis. - In recent years, the awareness of carcinogenic risk associated with CT radiation has increased. - According to a recent single-institutional randomized controlled trial, LD CT (employing a quarter of standard radiation dose) was found to be noninferior to SD CT with respect to NARs in adolescents and young adults with suspected appendicitis. - However, LD CT is not yet widely accepted. - To establish LD CT as the first-line imaging test, a multi-institutional study is needed to confirm the generalizability of the prior single-institutional study.</detailed_description>
