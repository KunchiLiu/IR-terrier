	<brief_summary>Suicide is the second leading cause of mortality for Canadian adolescents. Mental health complaints are one of the leading reasons for an emergency department visit at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario and 60% of adolescents report suicidal ideation. The goal of the present investigation is to test the efficacy of a brief group intervention for adolescents with passive suicidal ideation and their caregivers that will focus on coping, familial support, and emotional regulation. The investigators hypothesize that a brief group intervention, delivered in the weeks following presentation for crisis services, will reduce suicidal ideation and improve coping and familial support.</brief_summary>
