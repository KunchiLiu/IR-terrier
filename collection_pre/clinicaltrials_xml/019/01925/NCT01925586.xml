	<brief_summary>This study is designed to look at whether it is feasible to observe women with atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) of the breast, or whether surgical excision is necessary.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atypical Lesions of the Breast: Close Observation Versus Excision (ALCOVE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize that surgical excision may not yield an improvement in survival over hormonal therapy and/or close observation alone in patients who present with ADH on core needle biopsy of the breast. An alternate (non-inferior) strategy for management may be possible, and may be associated with improved quality of life and fewer complications, and lower overall costs. Although several researchers have suggested a clinical trial to investigate this idea this would be the first time it has been done, and could therefore be practice changing.</detailed_description>
