	<brief_summary>Partially HLA-matched irradiated donor lymphcyte infusion alone resulted in 27% overall response rate (ORR) in advanced renal cell carcinoma without significant toxicities. In addition, high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2)showed an ORR of 6-21% in metastatic melanoma or renal cell carcinoma with a durable response in patients who achieved complete remission. Therefore, irradiated donor lymphocyte infusion plus high-dose IL-2 might show a synergistic anti-tumor activity agaist relapsed or metastatic melanoma or renal cell carcinoma.</brief_summary>
