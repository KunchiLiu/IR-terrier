	<brief_summary>Feasibility study on robotic-assisted single-site donor nephrectomy utilizing da Vinci instrumentation and Single-Site platforms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Robotic Single Port Donor Nephrectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our center has performed over 200 single-port donor nephrectomies with standard laparoscopy and has reported patient benefits associated with a single port approach. The single port robotic platform offers the potential to ameliorate the significant technical and ergonomic challenges that currently limit more widespread application of single port donor surgery. After being informed of the potential risks and off-label use of the da Vinci Single-Site approach in our study, patients will undergo a robotic-assisted single-site donor nephrectomy performed by a two-surgeon team utilizing existing da Vinci instrumentation and Single-Site platforms. Renal mobilization and vascular dissection will be performed with manual laparoscopy performed for vascular division utilizing stapling devices.</detailed_description>
