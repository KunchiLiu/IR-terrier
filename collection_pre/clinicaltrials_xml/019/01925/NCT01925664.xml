	<brief_title>Doula Support for Young Mothers: A Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this study is to evaluate a doula home visiting model -- sometimes called the "community doula model." This model differs from typical hospital based doula interventions in several ways. Doulas are providers from the same community backgrounds as their clients. Services are not just provided during labor and delivery, but throughout the final trimester and during the first weeks after delivery. Prenatal and postpartum services are provided in the homes of the mothers. The model was developed specifically for working with low-income mothers and with young mothers. A two-armed randomized controlled trial was conducted at the University of Chicago Hospitals. Participants were recruited through two out-patient obstetric clinics affiliated with the Hospitals. The clinics primarily served a low-income, African-American population, reflective of the families in the communities near to the hospital. The study was open to all young women receiving prenatal care at the clinics who met age and eligibility criteria. After providing informed consent and completing a baseline interview, participants were randomized into two groups. The experimental group, in addition to receiving regular clinical care, received weekly home visiting services from a doula and the support of a doula at the hospital during labor and delivery. Doulas worked with their clients until three months postpartum. The control group received standard clinical care and had access to social work case management. Four paraprofessional doulas delivered the study intervention. Before providing study services, doulas had been trained to provide childbirth education, labor support, breastfeeding education, and parent-child interaction support. Followup research assessments of the doula and control group mothers and infants were conducted during the first three days postpartum, at 4 months postpartum, at 12 months postpartum, and at 24 months postpartum. 80% of the sample was retained through the 24 month followup assessment. Follow up assessments involved interviews with the mothers, videotaping of mother-infant interaction, and behavioral assessment of the infants. Obstetric and newborn hospital medical charts were also reviewed. The study evaluated outcomes that have been the focus of prior studies of hospital-only doula services: use of obstetrical intervention in labor and delivery (anesthesia, surgical delivery), mother labor efficacy, breastfeeding, and maternal depression. A major contribution of this study is to explore longer term outcomes not evaluated in prior studies of doula intervention, particularly parenting and child development outcomes. The study evaluated multiple dimensions of parenting including parenting behavior (sensitivity, stimulation), parenting efficacy, parenting attitudes, and parenting stress. Child development outcomes included cognitive development and early behavior problems.</detailed_description>
