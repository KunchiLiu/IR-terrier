	<brief_summary>A new device is being developed to screen for sleep-breathing disorders. Within this device is a new software algorithm which will determine sleep/wake states. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of this new algorithm. This prototype will be compared against a commercially available device which monitors sleep/wake patterns. Volunteers will be asked to wear the prototype and comparative devices for 1-2 nights. The data from both devices will be downloaded after the completion of the study and analysis wil be performed to compare the two recordings.</brief_summary>
