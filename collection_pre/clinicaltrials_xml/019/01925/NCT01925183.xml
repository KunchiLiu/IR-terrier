	<brief_summary>Response-guided triple-therapy with boceprevir (BOC) in combination with pegylated interferon (PEGIFN) and ribavirin (RBV) is the current standard of care for HIV-negative patients infected with hepatitis C genotype (HCV-GT) 1. In contrast, in HIV-positive patients, a fixed treatment duration of 48 weeks is used. The aim of this study is to assess efficacy and safety of response-guided triple-therapy with BOC in combination with PEGIFN and RBV in HIV-positive patients. Thus, treatment duration will be individualized based on HCV-RNA negativity at treatment week 8 (W8). All patients will receive 4 weeks of PEGIFN/RBV lead-in. Patients with undetectable HCV-RNA at W8 will be treated with 24 weeks of BOC/PEGIFN/RBV triple-therapy resulting in a total treatment duration of 28 weeks, while patients with detectable HCV-RNA at W8 will receive 44 weeks of BOC/PEGIFN/RBV triple-therapy and a total treatment duration of 48 weeks.</brief_summary>
