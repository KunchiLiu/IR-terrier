	<brief_summary>Like most developed countries the population of Sweden is getting older and consequently the number of individuals with chronic diseases will be an increasing challenge for its healthcare system. To improve care of the frail elderly, wards with a coordinated multidisciplinary team and multidisciplinary mobile teams were established several years ago. Treatment and follow up is planned in accordance to the patients' medical, psychological and functional capabilities (Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment = CGA). There are to our knowledge only few studies concerning CGA applicable to Swedish conditions. We plan to conduct a Swedish study that evaluates if care and treatment with a modified CGA-model in an outpatient setting can improve quality of life for frail older people.</brief_summary>
