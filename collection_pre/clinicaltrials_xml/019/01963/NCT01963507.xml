	<brief_title>Effects of a Resistance Training Period on Blood Pressure of Hypertensive Elderlies: Influence of the Polymorphism of the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To investigate the chronic effects of resistance training on blood pressure and biochemical exams in elderly, 135 hypertensive elderlies were divided into 2 groups: trained and control. The trained group was submitted to a resistance training period. Before the 16 weeks ACE gene was genotyped (PCR). Before and after 16 weeks, blood pressure (ambulatory), HDL-cholesterol, Total cholesterol, Glycemia, Triacylglycerol (colorimetric assay) and plasminogen activator inhibition (PAI-1), intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1), vascular endothelial cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1), Adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), C Reactive Protein, Angiotensin II, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme, Angiotensin 1-7, (ELISA assay) were measured.</detailed_description>
