	<brief_summary>This double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial will compare the effects of the use of a combined oral contraceptive pill to a placebo pill for women who are experiencing irregular and/or heavy bleeding associated with the use of an etonogestrel (ETG) implant. The hypothesis of the study is: - Use of combined oral contraceptive will significantly improve bleeding patterns for users of ETG implant - Continuation rate of ETG implant users will be increased by use of combined oral contraceptive in women desiring ETG implant removal because of the undesirable bleeding - Adverse events will be uncommon and acceptable to women who use a combined oral contraceptive with the ETG implant</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Women who are experiencing irregular and/or heavy bleeding associated with the use of an etonogestrel (ETG) implant will be recruited for this study. Women who have bothersome bleeding will be randomized to use either a combined oral contraceptive pill or a placebo pill. Participants will take one pill every day and record their bleeding patterns on a daily diary. Participants will have one screening/enrollment visit, two in-person follow up visits, and one telephone follow up contact. Subjects will be enrolled for a total of 84 days (three months). Participants will be assigned to a treatment group at her screening/enrollment visit. Her first follow up visit will occur 22-28 days after her enrollment. Participants can choose to: - Continue use of assigned treatment medication - Discontinue use of assigned treatment medication, but use an open-label combined oral contraceptive pill - Discontinue the use of assigned treatment medication, decline use of an open-label combined oral contraceptive pill - Discontinue use of ETG implant. Participants who choose to continue use of ETG implant will have a follow up telephone contact 50-56 days after her enrollment visit. A final in-person visit will occur 78-84 days after enrollment. Bleeding patterns will be assessed by daily bleeding diaries completed by the participant.</detailed_description>
