	<detailed_description>In this study patients are referred to the Department of Radiology for an image-guided (either CT or ultrasound) core needle biopsy of a liver mass suspicious for primary liver cancer as a part their clinical care. A written informed consent will be obtained for the clinical biopsy per standard protocol.

The additional research biopsy is not mandatory and is subject to a separate written informed consent, which will be obtained prior to the clinical biopsy.</detailed_description>
