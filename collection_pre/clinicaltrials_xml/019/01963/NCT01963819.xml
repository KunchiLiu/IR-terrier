	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential benefits in implantation, clinical pregnancy and live birth rates by an endometrial biopsy prior to an IVF/ICSI treatment. Including a follow up on possible pregnancy complications and data on children at birth. Further it is planned to aspirate secretions from the uterus and take blood samples during the treatment, which presumably can provide information about the mechanisms underlying the possible effect of the treatment.</brief_summary>
