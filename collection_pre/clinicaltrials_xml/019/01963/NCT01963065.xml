	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether babies are exposed to significant levels of chemicals during their stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). For example, other research studies have shown that babies are exposed to plasticizers (bisphenol A, phthalates) in the NICU. Plasticizers are chemicals that are used to make plastic medical equipment soft and flexible. The research team wants to find out whether the amount of plasticizer and other chemicals babies may be exposed to in the NICU makes a difference in how they grow and how they perform on neurologic tests.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. Significance Premature newborns may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of toxic chemicals in the environment because of their small body size, immature hepatic and renal clearance mechanisms, and rapid rate of development. Approximately 8% of neonates in the United States require admission to a level II or III NICU following birth; thus over 300,000 infants annually are exposed to the chemical-intensive hospital environment during a developmentally vulnerable period. Neonates treated in the NICU have elevated risk of developmental delay, cognitive dysfunction, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism that is only partially explained by degree of prematurity or severity of clinical disease. Lesions found on neuroimaging are relatively insensitive predictors of long-term cognitive and behavioral outcome. Moreover, many medical conditions associated with prematurity, such as chronic lung disease and retinopathy of prematurity, are incompletely predicted by gestational age at birth or severity of newborn illness. We hypothesize that a portion of the neurocognitive, social, and somatic impairments seen in NICU graduates are attributable to potentially preventable NICU-based exposures. As NICU care has matured, survival is likely for all but the most premature infants. Our research emphasis is therefore shifting from survival to developing methods for improving the long term growth and development of our patients. We believe this research strategy must examine the potential contribution of chemical exposures that occur during the NICU stay as predictors of neurodevelopmental outcome. All subjects in the proposed study are cared for in the NICU - therefore comparisons are internally valid. While findings may not be generalizable to non-NICU populations, the potential positive impact of this work on thousands of NICU graduates makes this work a high impact public health priority. We focus on very low birth weight (VLBW) infants as these infants generally experience much of the third trimester developmental window ex utero in the NICU. Studies of in utero chemical exposure indicate the vulnerability of developmentally immature individuals during this same developmental window. It is therefore logical to assess whether ex utero exposures occurring in the NICU act similarly. Additionally, small cross-sectional studies indicate the high exposure levels faced by NICU inpatients. Both through the proposed study and through continuation of this line of research in future studies, we plan to characterize the role of hospital-based chemical exposure on neurodevelopment in NICU graduates. 2. Preliminary Studies and Innovation Substantial information on the health effects of community-based early life exposure, as well as the presence in the NICU environment, exist for the chemicals of interest in this study. Numerous materials used in NICU care, such as incubators, respiratory support devices, and intravenous (IV) and enteral feeding supplies, are made from plastics that act as vehicles of chemical exposure. Phthalates - chemicals used to make plastic flexible and resilient - are common in medical materials. Bisphenol A (BPA) and contaminating metals are also present in plastic materials. Silver is added to plastic IV catheter components as an antimicrobial. Parenteral nutrition (PN), frequently administered for long duration in the NICU, contains Mn. Surprisingly, there is little evidence to support the safety of the total dose of Mn added to PN, and a growing body of literature suggests that Mn toxicity may be occurring among NICU patients. Exposure to these chemicals may be associated with significant systemic and neurodevelopmental impairment, however, their impact on neurodevelopment in NICU graduates is largely unstudied. 3. Chemical Childhood Outcome Associated with Early Life Exposure Evidence of Exposure Evolving evidence suggests that chemical and non-chemical stressors in the NICU may impact infant neurodevelopment. The built environment, ambient noise, in-hospital parent-child interactions, and parental stress during the NICU stay have been associated with altered neurodevelopment among NICU graduates. Socioeconomic factors and psychological functioning of the primary caregiver are also linked to childhood neurodevelopmental outcomes generally. These factors must therefore be considered as confounders and/or modifiers in any comprehensive NICU neurodevelopmental outcome association study. 4. Study Goals and Plan This study will identify specific sources of chemical exposure among NICU inpatients and explore the association between exposure and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Overall, we will use the research portion of this career development award to identify chemical targets and neurodevelopmental assessment protocols for the PI's subsequent R01 application(s). The proposed study will identify the prevalence and dose of chemicals to which NICU inpatients are exposed and provide pilot data on associations with neurodevelopmental outcomes. In year four, the PI will use this data as the basis of her first R01 application in which she will generate a cohort of NICU graduates in whom exposure dose and timing are quantified and neurophenotypes measured in infancy and childhood. We have picked a small number of candidate chemicals for which exposure is known or likely, the negative neurodevelopmental impact of community exposure is documented, and the health implications for NICU-based exposure are unknown. Prior studies have documented numerous phthalate-containing materials in the NICU and elevated biomarkers of phthalates and BPA in NICU inpatients. These studies were limited by cross-sectional specimen sampling, patient enrollment without attention to factors likely to affect chemical metabolism including gestational or chronologic age and severity of illness, and small sample size. To our knowledge, biomarkers of NICU-exposure to Ag, Cd, and Mn have not been assessed, despite the documented presence of these metals in the NICU and known adverse health outcomes related to early life exposure. No previous study of NICU chemical exposure has considered the important potential confounders/modifiers of chemical toxicant impact to be considered in the proposed study. The proposed study will also develop a novel clinical exposure assessment tool, the NICU Exposure Checklist (NICE-Check). Using detailed biomarker analysis coupled with prospective assessment of contact with medical materials over the duration of the NICU hospitalization, we hope to define the association between the intensity of exposure to specific medical materials and chemical biomarker levels. This type of association was preliminarily noted but incompletely characterized by Green et al. in their pilot study of phthalate exposure in the NICU.(54) Development and validation of NICE-Check, a novel, rapid, accurate, and cost-effective chemical exposure assessment tool, would allow preliminary identification of sources of chemical exposures that could potentially be removed, and facilitate future large studies of hospital-based chemical exposure. This would be a particularly valuable screening tool for the field, as exposure biomarker testing for large numbers of chemicals is prohibitively expensive for most studies. To our knowledge, the relationship between biomarkers of exposure to chemicals in the NICU and specific care practices has not been explored. Additionally, the potential association between NICU-based chemical exposures and neurodevelopmental deficits has not been evaluated. Two studies assessed outcomes related to NICU phthalate exposure, but neither used exposure biomarkers or other validated exposure assessment methods to characterize initial exposure nor considered important non-chemical confounders. The proposed study will address these limitations and will be a comprehensive, longitudinal evaluation of chemical exposure in the NICU designed to evaluate environmental chemical exposure and clinical outcomes in this vulnerable population. This study will also assess psychosocial stressors in the NICU that co-occur with chemical exposures and could modulate/confound outcome assessment. This study's success will be aided by its interdisciplinary nature bringing together neonatologists (including the PI) and NICU staff (including RN leadership) with environmental health scientists (the mentor and co-mentors).</detailed_description>
