	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study are to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and anti-tumor activity of AGS15E in subjects with metastatic urothelial cancer who failed at least one prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ASG-15ME is a Study of Escalating Doses of AGS15E Given as Monotherapy in Subjects With Metastatic Urothelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All subjects will receive a single intravenous infusion of AGS15E once weekly for 3 weeks of every 4 weeks. A cycle is 4 weeks. Subjects will continue treatment until disease progression, intolerability of AGS15E, investigator decision, or consent withdrawal. In subjects who discontinue therapy without documented disease progression and who still consent to study procedures, every effort should be made to continue monitoring their disease status by radiographic imaging until progression is documented, or new anticancer therapy, or death. All subjects will continue to be followed for survival until withdrawal of consent or study closure. If assessed as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per local review a confirmatory scan will be performed no less than 4 weeks from previous scan and preferably at week 5. Tumor imaging should also be performed whenever disease progression is suspected. Images will be sent to a central third party imaging vendor for an independent assessment per RECIST version 1.1. Although the imaging studies will be reviewed by a central third party imaging vendor in a retrospective fashion, all clinical decisions will be based on the interpretation of the investigator at the site treating the subject. Post-Treatment Follow-up Progression Free Survival: Subjects who discontinued the study for reasons other than objective disease progression will continue disease assessments until radiologically confirmed progression, initiates a new anticancer therapy, death, loss to follow-up or withdraw consent for further follow-up, whichever of these events occurs first. The purpose of the post-treatment follow-up is to ascertain the duration of progression-free survival for all subjects enrolled in the study. Overall survival: All subjects will be followed by telephone contact every 2 months until death, loss to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent, whichever of these events occurs first. A standard of care clinic visit can be used in lieu of a telephone call, if the subject is already coming to clinic.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Histologically confirmed Transitional Cell Carcinoma of the Urothelium (TCCU) (i.e., cancer of the bladder, renal pelvis, ureter, or urethra). Subjects with Urothelial Carcinoma with squamous differentiation or mixed cell types are eligible. Part A: Subject must have failed at least one prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease and/or is unfit for cisplatinbased chemotherapy. Part B: Subject must not have received any prior lines of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting (prior treatment with immunotherapy is allowed). Part C (CPITreated Expansion): Subject must have received prior treatment with a CPI in the metastatic setting Subjects must have measureable disease according to RECIST (version 1.1). Part A and C: Subject must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 Part B: Subject must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤ 2 Life expectancy of ≥ 3 months Adequate hematologic function Parts A and C: Renal function, as follows: serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL, or measured 24 hour creatinine clearance of ≥ 45 mL/min Part B: Renal function, as follows: creatinine clearance estimate ≥ 15 mL/min and &lt;60 mL/min by cockroft gault equation adjusted for body weight Adequate liver function Preexisting sensory neuropathy Grade ≥ 2 or motor neuropathy Grade ≥ 2 Uncontrolled central nervous system metastases Use of any investigational drug within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug Any anticancer therapy, including: small molecules, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, radiotherapy or any other agents to treat cancer (antihormonal therapy given as adjuvant therapy for earlystage estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer is not considered cancer therapy for the purpose of this protocol) Subjects with Immunotherapy related adverse events requiring high doses of steroids (≥ 40 mg/day of prednisone) are not eligible Any Pgp inducers/inhibitors or strong CYP3A inhibitors within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug History of thromboembolic events and/or bleeding disorders ≤ 14 days (e.g., deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE)) prior to the first dose of study drug Active angina or Class III or IV Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) (New York Heart Association CHF Functional Classification System) or clinically significant cardiac disease within 12 months of study enrollment, including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, grade 2 or greater peripheral vascular disease, congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, or arrhythmias not controlled by outpatient medication Known HIV or AIDS Positive Hepatitis B surface antigen test Positive Hepatitis C antibody test Decompensated liver disease as evidenced by clinically significant ascites refractory to diuretic therapy, hepatic encephalopathy, or coagulopathy Known sensitivity to any of the ingredients of the investigational product AGS15E Major surgery within 28 days prior to first dose of study drug History of a primary invasive malignancy not listed in the inclusion criteria, which has not been in remission for at least 3 years. The following are exempt from the 3 year limit: Nonmelanoma skin cancer; adenocarcinoma of the prostate that has been surgically treated with a posttreatment PSA that is undetectable; cervical carcinoma in situ on biopsy or squamous intraepithelial lesion on Pap smear; and definitively treated, stage I/II ER+ breast cancer Active infection requiring treatment ≤ 7 days before first dose of study drug History of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or diabetic neuropathy Condition or situation which may put the subject at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere significantly with subject's participation in the study Has ocular conditions such as: Active infection or corneal ulcer (e.g., keratitis) Monocularity History of corneal transplantation Contact lens dependent (if using contact lens, must be able to switch to glasses during the entire study duration) Uncontrolled glaucoma (topical medications allowed) Uncontrolled or evolving retinopathy, wet macular degeneration, uveitis, papilledema, or optic disc disorder</criteria>
