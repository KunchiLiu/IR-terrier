	<brief_summary>This is a study conducted in 60 patients, randomly assigned to one of two groups of 30: the first will receive ropivacaine alone and the second will receive the association ropivacaine/clonidine. The aim of the study is to prove that the association of Clonidine with Ropivacaine is more effective than ropivacaine alone for locoregional anaesthesia of the eye for retinal surgery. The principal interest of this association of drugs is that it procures faster and longer anaesthesia of the eye with less ropivacaine (therefore fewer injections). This provides greater comfort to the patient during and after the intervention.</brief_summary>
