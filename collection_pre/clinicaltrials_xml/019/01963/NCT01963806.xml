	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND: Smartphone technology presents a novel and promising opportunity to extend the reach of psychotherapeutic interventions by moving selected parts of the therapy into the real-life situations causing distress. This randomised controlled trial will investigate the effect of a transdiagnostic, Internet-administered cognitive behavioural (iCBT) self-help program for anxiety, supplemented with a tailored smartphone application. The effect of added therapist support will also be studied. METHODS/DESIGN: 150 participants meeting diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder and/or panic disorder will be evenly randomised to one of three treatment arms: (1) smartphone-supplemented iCBT with therapist support; (2) smartphone-supplemented iCBT without therapist support; or (3) an active waiting list control group with delayed treatment. After the 10 week treatment period, the control group (3) will receive the same treatment as group (2). Primary outcome measure will be the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item self-rating scale. Secondary measures include other anxiety, depression and quality of life measures. In addition to pre- and post-treatment measurements, the study includes two mid-treatment and two follow-up assessments (12 and 24 months). HYPOTHESES: Based on prior research, we hypothesise that the therapist-guided form will be superior to the unguided form in reducing anxiety levels, and that both delivery modes will be superior to an active waiting-list control group.</brief_summary>
