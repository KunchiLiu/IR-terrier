	<brief_summary>Platinum, fluorouracil and taxane based regimen are all acceptable in the first line treatment of metastatic gastric cancer. The TX and XELOX regimen are two common regimen used in MGC. whichever regimen is used, the average response rate is less than 50%. So a rather part of patients can't get benefit from the treatment. It is urgent to find out the predictive factors of these regimens in order to get a higher response and better survival outcome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial of Exploring the Predictive Factors of TX and XELOX Regimen in the First Line Treatment of MGC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with MGC will be treated with TX or XELOX regimen. Before treatment, 14 days after treatment and after progression, the blood sample will be collected. Primary tumor blocks will also of collected. These samples will be used to detect predictive factors of the two types first line therapy.</detailed_description>
