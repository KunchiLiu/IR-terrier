	<brief_summary>Background and Purposes: Cancer is the leading cause of our mortality. It threatens people's life and quality of life (QOL). Although the incidence of cancer is still rising, with the promotion of cancer screening and progression of medical technology, its survival rate is improving. However, the sequels from cancer or its treatment and the side effects impact the patients along with their lives. Breast cancer is the most incident cancer in women with high survival rate, continuing care after the diagnosis and treatment is much more needed. This study is using breast cancer as an example to establish a continuing service model. This study aims (1) to establish a tailored, continuing care model which emphasizes on breast cancer patients' function. (2) To investigate the effectiveness of the new care model comparing with the control. (3) To find a cutting point of bioelectrical impedance to identify late development of lymphedema. Methods: This is a randomized-controlled trial expanding for 3 years. Women being newly diagnosed with breast cancer and first OPD visit after operation at National Taiwan University Hospital will be invited to join the surveillance and care system. Exclusion criteria are: younger than 20 years old, stage IV, recurrent or both sides involved, with other cancer diagnosis, functional impairments from previous injury or operation on the affected upper extremity and other physical or mental problem to influence the test or filling the questionnaire. It is estimated there will be 100 subjects participate this study every year. After the initial evaluation, they will be randomly allocated to surveillance group (SG) or general care group (CG). Totally, in this three-year study, there will be 200 subjects (100/group), follow-up for 0.5 to 2 years. SG will have health education brochure and free class from the first visit post-operatively but CG will only have the brochure. Moreover, SG will be screened every time when they visit the clinics. If there is any early sign of impairment, professional advice and counseling will be given additionally. In these visits, if CG raises any health-related question, they can be answered. Detailed physical examination to identify their impairments and QOL are at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months after operation for both groups. Patients' characteristics, functional status, QOL will be presented by descriptive statistics. T-test/Mann-Whitney U test will be used to compare the differences between patients in two groups. Survival analysis and log-rank test will be used to show the prevalence of various functional impairments and test their difference. ROC curve will be used to find the cutting point for prediction of lymphedema. Expected Results: It is expected (1) to set up the education program and brochure for breast cancer patients. (2) to establish a continuing surveillance and care model for breast cancer patients and extending to all cancers. (3) Women in the new care model will have less impairment and higher QOL comparing with women at the same post-operative stage. (4) To find out the prevalence of functional impairments from the data of control group. (5) A cutting point of bioelectrical impedance to identify late development of lymphedema will be found. (6) To train the team members of cancer care and research.</brief_summary>
