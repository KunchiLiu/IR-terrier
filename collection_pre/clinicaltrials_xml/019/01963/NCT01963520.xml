	<brief_summary>Data from large prospective cohort studies of prosthetic joint infections are lacking. Aim of this study: analyzing prospectively the incidence of reinfection in patients with prosthetic hip infections who underwent surgery and received antibiotic therapy. Hypothesis: to confirm in a large group that the incidence of reinfection after excision -synovectomy in acute prosthesis hip infection is 30% and 15% for chronic infection after exchange arthroplasty (one or two stage exchange).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim of the study: to analyze the incidence of reinfection in patients with prosthetic hip infection who underwent surgery and received antibiotic therapy Methods: prospective cohort study in a French referral center for osteoarticular infections from November 2002 to March 2010. Population - all patients who consented to participate in the study with prosthetic hip infections treated by: - debridement-synovectomy for acute infection or with one-stage or two-stage - exchange arthroplasty or resection arthroplasty for chronic infection - antibiotic therapy Outcome: - Follow-up: minimum of 2 years - Events monitored: reinfection including relapse and new infection, joint revision for mechanical reasons, prosthetic hip infection related and non-related deaths</detailed_description>
