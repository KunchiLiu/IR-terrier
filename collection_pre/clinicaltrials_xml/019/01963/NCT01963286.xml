	<brief_title>Reduction of Inappropriate Shocks of Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) With Enhanced SVT Discriminators</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With Ellipse™ and Fortify Assura™ ICD family, St. Jude Medical introduced enhanced device algorithms that may be helpful to further improve SVT discrimination success: SecureSense™, Far field morphology, Chamber Onset. These algorithms in combination with a tailored device setting (primary or secondary prevention) will be prospectively investigated within this trial.</detailed_description>
