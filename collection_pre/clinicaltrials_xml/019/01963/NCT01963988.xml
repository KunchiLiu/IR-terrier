	<brief_summary>On the EAU (European Association of Urology) guidelines, the ulcer type bladder pain syndrome (BPS) should be treated with transurethral resection (TUR) or coagulation (TUC) of ulcer. But, Up to date, there was no study to compare the therapeutic efficacy of TUR with TUC in ulcer type BPS patients. We assume TUR have a more therapeutic effect than TUC.</brief_summary>
