	<brief_title>Bevacizumab in Combination With Chemotherapy in Patients With Advanced or Recurrent Non-squamous NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is an observational study for the safety and tolerability of the combination of bevacizumab with chemotherapy in locally advanced or metastatic and recurrent non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. We try to evaluate the safety of bevacizumab in real life population with lung cancer. For patients with performance status 0-1 platinum based chemotherapy was recommended and acceptable doses of bevacizumab was either 7.5 or 15 mg/kgr. Safety profile was evaluated with Common Toxicity criteria v 3.0. Especially for bevacizumab we evaluate specific situations as thrombotic or hemorrhagic events, hypertension, albuminuria, and gastrointestinal disorders.</detailed_description>

Known hypersensitivity to bevacizumab or any of its excipients, and any of the chemotherapies 19. Evidence of ongoing or active infection, any other disease, neurological or metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding or laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or puts the patient at high risk for treatmentrelated complications 20.
