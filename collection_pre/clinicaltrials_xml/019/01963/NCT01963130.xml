	<brief_title>Does Vildagliptin Affect Portal Vein Pressure In Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus? A Cross Sectional Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Group 1 used metformin (1000 mg bid) and gliclazide (60 mg qd); Group 2 used the same amounts of metformin and gliclazide, with the addition of vildagliptin (50 mg bid). The patients were prospectively assigned to each of these two groups for the purpose of this study. Using Doppler ultrasound, all cases were measured for portal vein flow velocity, portal vein flow and portal vein diameter. Degree of hepatosteatosis was also recorded.</detailed_description>
