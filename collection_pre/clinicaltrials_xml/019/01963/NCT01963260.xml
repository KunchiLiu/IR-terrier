	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of this study are to assess the safety and tolerability of single rising doses of MK-8723 in healthy adult participants and adult participants with chronic immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) and to assess pharmacodynamics of MK-8723 in participants with ITP. The primary hypothesis is that the true placebo-adjusted platelet response rate to MK-8723 in adult patients with chronic ITP is &gt;50%.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Rising Dose Study of MK-8723 in Healthy Participants and Participants With Immune Thrombocytopenia Purpura (MK-8723-001)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Part 1 of the trial, safety and pharmacokinetics of MK-8723 will be evaluated in healthy participants. In Part 2 of the trial, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics will be evaluated among participants with ITP. In Part 1, dose escalation will occur in up to 5 serial panels of participants; each participant will receive a single intravenous (IV) dose of MK-8723 (or placebo). In Part 2, dose escalation will occur in up to 3 serial panels of participants with ITP; each participant will receive a single IV dose of MK-8723 (or placebo), once safety and tolerability of the corresponding dose is shown in Part 1. Amendment 3 specified a re-enrollment procedure for eligible participants in Part 2 to participate in more than one dosing panel.</detailed_description>
