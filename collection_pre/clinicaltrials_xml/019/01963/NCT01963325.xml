	<brief_title>S-1 in Combination With Abraxane in Treating Cholangiocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are no standard second-line treatment for cholangiocarcinoma, new therapies are needed. The efficacy of S-1 as first-line treatment for cholangiocarcinoma was confirmed in several studies. The IMPACT study showed that Abraxane plus gemcitabine provide better survival than gemcitabine alone. Since cholangiocarcinoma displayed similar sensitivity to chemotherapy which was used in pancreatic carcinoma, we assume that S-1 plus Abraxane is effective and safe in treating cholangiocarcinoma.</detailed_description>
