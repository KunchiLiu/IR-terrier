	<brief_summary>15% of diabetics have a diabetic foot (DF) in their lives associated with a risk of amputation and mortality two times greater than that of a diabetic population without DF. Predicting the occurrence of an DF is limited and only the occurrence of a diabetic wound up involved assessment and treatment. Our team is behind the discovery of the Pressure-Induced Vasodilation (PIV) first observed in healthy subjects after local application of a gradual pressure on the skin leading to cutaneous vasodilation at the application of pressure. This gain in blood flow delays the onset of ischemia. However the involvement of PIV in the DF, which is also a pressure-induced skin lesion, remains to be demonstrated in diabetic subjects. The main objective of this study is to show that PIV, a functional examination of the cutaneous microcirculation we developed, is altered in the presence of DF, taking into account the influence of age and neuropathy.</brief_summary>
