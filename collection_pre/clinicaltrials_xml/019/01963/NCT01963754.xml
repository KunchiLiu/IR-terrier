	<brief_summary>In patients that are going to receive a dental implant in the posterior mandible (distal from canine), does the subperiosteal anesthetic technique with Articaine 1:100.000 4 % Epinephrine compared to the loco-regional one, produces the same analgesia during surgery ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Compare Subperiosteal and Loco-Regional Anesthesia in Posterior Mandible Dental Implant Installation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inter/Intra observer agreement will be made for administration of local subperiosteal, loco-regional anesthesia, operatory evaluation of pain and radiologic examination. One group will receive articaine 1:100.000, 4% epinephrine subperiosteal and the other 1:100.000 4% epinephrine loco-regional for dental implant installation in posterior mandible. The evaluation parameters will focus on intraoperatory pain, Intraoperatory anesthetic complications, anesthetic efficiency, correlation between distance from implant to inferior alveolar nerve, intraoperatory pain, post-operatory at 3 and 10 days and correlate changes, and survival rate of dental implants during and post osseointegration period.</detailed_description>
