	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to establish the effectiveness of a preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation program in patients awaiting lung resection for lung cancer by Video-assisted thoracic surgery in order to improve exercise tolerance and quality of life. The investigators hypothesized that a pulmonary rehabilitation program including both endurance and strength training may improve exercise tolerance and quality of life measured with a submaximal exercise test and a quality of life questionnaire respectively.</brief_summary>
