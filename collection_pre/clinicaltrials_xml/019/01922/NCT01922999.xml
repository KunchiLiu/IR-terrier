	<brief_summary>The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of melatonin supplementation in CKD and ESRD patients with sleep disorders to reduce sleep latency times, the number of apnea/hypopneic episodes, and prolong duration in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in CKD and ESRD patients with sleep disordered breathing.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study will look at the safety and efficacy of melatonin supplementation given to patients with chronic kidney disease and end stage renal disease who have sleep disorders to reduce sleep latency times, the number of apnea/hypopneic episodes, and prolong duration in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in CKD and ESRD patients with sleep disordered breathing.</detailed_description>
