The 24 h ambulatory blood pressure should be at least 130 mm Hg systolic or 80 mm Hg diastolic, or higher; 5. Fasting total cholesterol concentration ranging from 4.14 to 6.22 mmol/L (160 to 240 mg/dL); 6. Endotheliumdependent flowmediated dilatation (FMD) below 10%; 7. Serum activity of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) should be within the normal range; 8. Patients should not be on treatment with statins or other lipidlowering drugs within 3 months of randomization; 9. The patients should sign the informed consent form prior to the participation in the trial at the first visit; 10. Patients should be independent and likely to adhere to the study protocol. 1. Secondary hypertension; 2. Lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) below 2.59 mmol/L (100mg/dL); 3. Renal dysfunction defined as eGFR&lt;60ml/min/1.73m2; 4. Current treatment with specific drugs or diets, such as fibrates (especially gemfibrozil), verapamil, amiodarone, grapefruit juice; 5.
