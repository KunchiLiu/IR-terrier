	<brief_summary>Typically pacemaker electrode has been attached to the right ventricular apex. This method lead to Non-physiological Ventricular contraction. It has been reported to cause by ventricular dysfunction. In conclusion, this study demonstrate that impact of right ventricular pacing determined by electrocardiography was planned.</brief_summary>
