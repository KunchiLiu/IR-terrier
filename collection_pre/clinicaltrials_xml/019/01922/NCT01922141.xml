	<brief_summary>This study is designed to compare the blood pressure lowering efficacy of aliskiren, a combination of aliskiren plus amlodipine, and ramipril in elderly patients with mild to moderate hypertension. It will also compare the long-term safety of an aliskiren-based regimen to a ramipril-based regimen</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients ≥ 65 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of essential hypertension at Visit 1. Mean sitting SBP (MSSBP) ≥ 140 mmHg and &lt; 180 mmHg at Visit 2/Visit 201 and Visit 3. Absolute MSSBP difference ≤ 20 mmHg between Visit 3 and the Visit immediately prior History of hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or to drugs of similar chemical classes. Severe hypertension (MSSBP ≥ 180 mmHg or MSDBP ≥ 110 mmHg) at Visit 1, Visit 2, Visit 201 or Visit 3 or during patient self measured blood pressure (SMBP) monitoring in the prerandomization period confirmed by office measurement. Current treatment with any blocker of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) (aliskiren, ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker or an aldosterone antagonist) and unable to discontinue this therapy. Concurrent use of any antihypertensive medications except a stable dose of 3 months prior to Visit 1 of alpha adrenergic blockers for benign prostatic hypertrophy (e.g., tamsulosin [Flomax®] for benign prostatic hypertrophy), beta blockers for angina, or beta blocker ophthalmic preparations. Contraindications to aliskiren, ramipril, amlodipine, or hydrochlorothiazide. Other protocol defined inclusion/exclusion criteria apply</criteria>
