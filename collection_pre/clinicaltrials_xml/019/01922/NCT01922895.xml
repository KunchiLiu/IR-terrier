	<brief_title>Novel Therapies in Moderately Severe Acute Alcoholic Hepatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim 1: Evaluate the effects of probiotic supplements on improvement in MELD score and gut mucosal integrity in patients with MELD &lt; 21. Patients will be randomized to receive daily probiotics for 6 months and standard of care treatment or placebo with standard care. Aim 2: Document the natural history of moderately severe alcoholic hepatitis. Patients who decline randomization will be offered the option of inclusion in the study prospectively for data collection purposes and research study procedures. Aim 3: Create a data and tissue biorepository. This biorepository will serve as a national resource for studies related to acute alcoholic hepatitis.</detailed_description>
