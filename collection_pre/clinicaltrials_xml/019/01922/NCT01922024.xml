	<brief_summary>The Curetis Unyvero LRT55 Application is intended to detect and to identify genes of 21 microorganisms and 19 genes associated with antibiotic resistance in 4 hours. In this study, the performance of the Unyvero LRT55 Application shall be tested under clinical conditions and compared to (1) a composite reference method (for non-atypical or cultured microorganisms) or (2) a molecular PCR based reference method for the 3 atypical microorganisms Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumoniae, and Pneumocystis jirovecii, and for resistance genes. PCR amplifications are followed by bi-directional sequencing, including comparison of the test results Time to result will be compared for the Unyvero LRT55 Application and standard-of care.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Detection of Microorganisms and Antibiotic Resistance Genes Using the Curetis Unyvero LRT55 Application</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a non-interventional, controlled, non-randomized multicenter clinical study that compares a new diagnostic device, the Unyvero LRT55 Application (based on molecular diagnostic methods) to either (1) a composite reference method (for non-atypical microorganisms), (2) a composite PCR-based method for 3 atypical microorganisms or (3) a PCR-based reference method for resistance genes. The study will use leftover lower respiratory tract samples taken from subjects suspected with lower respiratory tract infections: (a) Specimens taken prospectively for standard-of-care (i.e. microbiology testing) from hospitalized subjects. (b) Banked specimens for rare microorganisms. As the device is under investigation, the test results provided by the Unyvero LRT55 Application will not be made available to the treating physician and therefore will not be used for diagnosis, treatment or other management decisions.</detailed_description>
