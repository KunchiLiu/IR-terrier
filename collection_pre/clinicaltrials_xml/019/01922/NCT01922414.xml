	<brief_title>Laser Versus Ultrasonic Lithotripsy in Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy for Staghorn Stones</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with complete staghorn stones who are eligible to percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) will be randomized between two groups. Group 1: will undergo Laser lithotripsy during PNL Group 2: will undergo ultrasonic lithotripsy during PNL</detailed_description>

	<mesh_term>Kidney Calculi</mesh_term>
	<mesh_term>Nephrolithiasis</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Complete staghorn stones (filling the renal pelvis and branching to 3 major calyces 2. Age: 1870 years 1. Congenital renal anomalies such as horse shoe kidney. 2. Contraindications to PNL such as bleeding tendency and uncontrolled hypertension. 3. Associated pathological features requiring open intervention such as UPJO 4. Partial staghorn stones (filling the renal pelvis and branching to 2 major calyces) 5. Giant staghorn stone (very large staghorn stone that branch and rebranch in hugely dilated calyceal system)</criteria>
