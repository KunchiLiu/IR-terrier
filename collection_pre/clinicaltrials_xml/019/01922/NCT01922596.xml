	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to compare the effect of a Adductor Canal Blockade (ACB) vs a Femoral Nerve Blockade (FNB), on muscle strength, mobility and pain in patients with severe pain (VAS pain score &gt; 60) after Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adductor Canal Blockade vs Femoral Nerve Blockade on Muscle Strength, Mobility and Pain After TKA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patients will be included after surgery (the first 2 postoperative days). Patients reporting VAS &gt; 60 during active flexion of the knee can be included. All included patients will receive 2 blockades at the same time - an ACB and a FNB, one blockade with 30ml ropivacaine 0,2% and the other with 30ml saline according to randomization. Prior to, and after, the blockades VAS pain scores will be obtained, muscle strength (quadriceps and adductors) will be measured using a handheld dynanometer and a Timed Up and Go test will be performed. The study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov after inclusion of the first patient. The reason for this is that we recently became aware of that some journals do not accept a EudraCT registration. The study was registered at EudraCT (2012-004554-28)prior to enrollment of patients.</detailed_description>
