	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different dosing regimens of 0.5 mg ranibizumab given as intravitreal injection in comparison to verteporfin PDT in patients with visual impairment due to choroidal neovascularization secondary to pathologic myopia (PM)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Ranibizumab 0.5 vs Veteporfin PDT in Patients With Visual Impairment Due to Choroidal Neovascularization Secondary to Pathologic Myopia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase III, multi-center, randomized, double-masked, active-controlled study comparing 0.5 mg ranibizumab vs. vPDT therapy. The study includes 15 scheduled visits over 12 months, and there will be two additional visits (2a, 3a) for subset of patients in whom PK analysis will be performed. There will be 3 periods in this study: Screening period-from Day -14 to Baseline; Treatment period-from Baseline to Month 11; Follow-up period-from Month 11 to Month 12 Patients will enter the 11 months Treatment period at Visit 2 (Day 1) if eligibility criteria are met and will be randomized in three treatment groups Group I ranibizumab 0.5 mg driven by VA stability criteria or Group II ranibizumab 0.5 mg driven by disease activity criteria or Group III vPDT (randomization ratio of 2:2:1) and will receive first treatment of either a ranibizumab injection and sham vPDT or sham injection and active vPDT and will return to the clinical center within 7 days to undergo safety assessments as well as assessments of the effect of treatment by the evaluating investigator. The following visits will be performed at one month intervals starting at Visit 4 and continuing through Visit 14.At all monthly visits (at/from Month 2 for group I, at/from Month 1 for group II and at/from Month 3 for group III) the decision for treatment will be made by the evaluating investigator based on the VA stability criteria and on the disease activity criteria. At Month 3 (visit 6) and at all following monthly visits for all three groups one of the three options can recommended by evaluating investigator: a) ranibizumab 0.5 mg, b) ranibizumab 0.5 mg + vPDT; c) vPDT. The treating investigator will then perform treatment based on randomization and masking requirements. At each monthly visit, patients will have a safety evaluation by the evaluating investigator prior to study treatment, consisting of visual acuity measurements, ophthalmic examinations and evaluation of adverse events and vital signs. Routine hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis profiles will be obtained at Visit 6, 9 and 12 (Month 3, 6 and 9). At Month 12 several procedures and assessments will be performed which are required at study completion visit.</detailed_description>
