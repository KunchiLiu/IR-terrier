	<brief_summary>The aims of the present study are to investigate the effect of vitamin K2 on bone turnover, bone mass, bone structure, glucose metabolism, and arteriosclerosis. Osteoporosis, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease are common diseases that affect large groups of people in the Western world. Our hypotheses is that vitamin K2 (MK-7) reduces undercarboxylated osteocalcin in postmenopausal women and reduces bone turnover and increases bone mineral density; increases insulin sensitivity and decreases indices of arterial calcification.</brief_summary>
