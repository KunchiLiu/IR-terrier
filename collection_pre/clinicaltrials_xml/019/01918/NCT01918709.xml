	<criteria>1. Healthy male of 20 to 45 years of age at screening 2. 19 kg/m2 ≤ BMI≤ 27 kg/m2 at screening 3. 90 mmHg ≤SBP&lt;140 mmHg and 60 mmHg ≤DBP&lt;90 mmHg at sitting position at screening 4. At screening AST and ALT ≤ 1.5 times of upper normal limit Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times of upper normal limit CK ≤ 2 times of upper normal limit 5. A subject who is able to understand the study, to participate whole periods of the study and to provide written informed consent voluntarily after being fully informed of the study objectives, procedures and study drug 1. A subject who has medical history of or has clinically significant hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, respiratory, musculoskeletal, endocrinological, neurologic, hematologic/oncologic, or cardiovascular disease 2. A subject with severe renal insufficiency (CrCL &lt; 10mL/min by CockcroftGault estimation) 3. A subject with a history of gastrointestinal disease (e.g., ulcer, Crohn's disease) or surgery (except a simple appendectomy or repair of a hernia) that may influence the absorption of the study drug 4. A subject with a history of drug allergies to valsartan, rosuvastatin, or other drugs (e.g., aspirin, antibiotics), or a history of clinically significant allergies 5. A subject with a history of drug abuse or a positive urine drug screen for barbiturate, benzodiazepine, methamphetamine, cannabinoids, cocaine, or opiate 6. A subject who has taken any prescribed medication or herbal compounds within 14 days before the first drug administration. In addition, a subject who has taken any overthecounter drug or vitamin supplement within 7 days before the first drug administration. (However, investigators made the final decision on the eligibility for the trial if all other conditions were satisfied) 7. A subject who has participated in any other clinical trial and received study drug within 60 days before the first drug administration 8. A subject who has donated a unit of blood or blood components within 60 days or 30 days, respectively, or received a transfusion before the first drug administration 9. A subject who has taken the drug which inhibits or induces drug metabolism such as barbital 10. A subject with unusual dietary habit which may influence on the administration, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs 11. A subject who consumes caffeine excessively (&gt; 5 units/day) 12. A subject with consumes alcohol excessively (&gt; 21 units/week, 1 unit = 10 mL of pure alcohol) or with a history of alcoholism 13. A heavy smoker ( &gt;10 cigarettes/day) 14. A subject of positive result in serology tests (HBV, HCV, HIV, or syphilis) 15. A subject who has hereditary muscle disease or family history of hereditary muscle disease, or who has history of muscle disorder induced by drug 16. The investigator determines whether or not the subject is eligible for the study after, for example, reviewing clinical laboratory results, ECG result, or for other reason</criteria>
