	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation is the most frequent sustained arrhythmia. Catheter ablation is a procedure that is currently used for the treatment of symptomatic atrial fibrillation patients. We have organized a multi-centric national survey of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation in order to have a feedback on the type of procedures being performed and the overall results (freedom of atrial fibrillation) over an average follow-up of 18 months.</brief_summary>
