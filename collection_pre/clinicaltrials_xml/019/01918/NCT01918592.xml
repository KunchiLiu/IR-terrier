	<brief_summary>Muscle invasive bladder cancer is an aggressive malignancy. Currently the investigators lack accurate imaging technologies in clinical staging and estimation of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy as well as prognostic biomarkers. In the current study novel imaging modality (MRI/PET) is utilized to stage bladder cancer prior to transurethral resection of bladder-tumor and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Also prognostic biomarkers are studied from TUR-BT tissues, blood and urine to estimate response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
