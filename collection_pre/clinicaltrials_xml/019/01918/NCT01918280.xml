	<brief_summary>Klinefelter Syndrome (KS) is the most common sex chromosomal abnormalities (1/600 newborn males), and is characterized by a hypergonadism hypogonadism. Until few years ago, mostly non-mosaic KS was considered as a model of a complete male infertility although few KS (4-8%) have an oligospermia. Recent studies in adult with non-mosaic KS reported the possibility of sperm retrieval by testicular biopsy (TESE) in around 50% cases and more than some pregnancies have been obtained after TESE with Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI). Since 1997, more than one hundred births are described. As some studies shown a decrease of successful sperm retrieval with the increasing of age, we plan to compare the potential of sperm retrieval between two groups "adult" (23-55 years) and "young" after the onset of puberty (15-22 years). The study will be performed by searching spermatozoa on two seminal analyses spaced out 3 months followed by a testicular biopsy if the azoospermia is confirmed on semen analyses.</brief_summary>
