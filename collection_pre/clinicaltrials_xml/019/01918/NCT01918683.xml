	<brief_summary>This trial is designed to be the initial prospective pilot investigation of the effectiveness of combined SBRT and TACE as bridging therapy for HCC patients awaiting liver transplanation. No prospective clinical trials regarding the combination of TACE and SBRT in pre-transplant population have been performed. We propose the trial be conducted as a pilot clinical trial with the goal of enrolling 40 patients into each arm</brief_summary>
