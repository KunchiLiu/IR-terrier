Patients are classified to （0-6h）and (6-72h) teams. Herbs is separated too. The period of the therapy lasts two weeks, and the follow up should last three months. The main indexes are mortality rate, disability rate and the brain hematoma situation. The review is made by the reference to (NIHSS),(GCS) and so on.

	<brief_title>Clinical Re-evaluation of Removing Blood Stasis Therapy in Treating Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Safety and Efficacy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>objective: to investigate the safety and effect of acute cerebral hemorrhage treated with "Blood Activating and Stasis Dispersing" therapy and to verify the traditional methods can influence the brain hematoma enlargement or not. Methods: from 2013.8 to 2015.12, 360 cases of AICH will be included in 13 research centers. Patients are randomly into 3 groups within 6hrs from onset,such as, group A, blood activating herbal medicine (8 herbals), Group B, herbal medicine without blood activating herbal(6 herbals), Group C, placebo for 10days. All the patients will be treated according AHA guideline of AICH. All patients will be set to the CT at the onset, 24h later and 10-14days after treatment. So the rate of enlargement of brain hematoma in the 72h later, mortality rate in the two weeks and the disability rate in the 90 days can be evaluated.</detailed_description>
