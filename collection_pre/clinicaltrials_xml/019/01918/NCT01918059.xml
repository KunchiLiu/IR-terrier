	<brief_summary>This project is a randomized, controlled trial investigating wound cosmetic appearance after repair of traumatic lid lacerations with three different approaches to skin closure: absorbable sutures, non-absorbable sutures, and tissue adhesive. Photographs will be taken at two intervals after repair and later blindly assessed using standard cosmetic assessment scales. The investigators hypothesize that cosmetic wound outcome will be equivalent in across all three treatment arms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cosmetic Outcome Study of Lid Laceration Repair With Suture Versus Tissue Adhesive</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project is a randomized, controlled trial investigating the cosmetic appearance after repair of traumatic lid lacerations with three different approaches to skin closure: absorbable sutures (surgical gut suture), non-absorbable sutures (polypropylene suture), and tissue adhesive (octyl-2-cyanoacrylate). The population will include patients presenting to Memorial Hermann Hospital requiring repair of traumatic lid lacerations. The study will include partial thickness, full-thickness, and margin-involving lacerations where first standard layered tarsal and marginal suture repair will be performed if necessary, and then the patient will be randomized to superficial skin closure with either polypropylene suture closure, surgical gut suture closure, or tissue adhesive closure. Subjects will be followed in an outpatient setting at 1 week and 1 month post-repair at which time standardized photographs will be taken and later assessed using two standardized appearance assessment tools: Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Hollander Wound Evaluation Score (HWES).</detailed_description>
