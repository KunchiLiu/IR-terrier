	<brief_summary>Children born to obese women are at risk of increased adiposity and later adverse metabolic outcomes. We have conducted a follow-up study on an existing clinical trial, called the LiP study (Lifestyle in Pregnancy), registration number NCT00530439,in which 360 obese pregnant women were randomized to either lifestyle intervention or routine obstetric care. This present study follows the children until 3 years of age. We have the hypothesis, that the intervention during pregnancy results in a lower degree of adiposity and metabolic risk factors in the offspring. Clinical examination is taking place at age 2.5-3 years including anthropometric measurements, Dual energy x-ray (DXA) scans and blood samples measuring metabolic markers.In addition, we have included an extra control group of children born to normal weight women, who were not part of a lifestyle intervention program during pregnancy. We have the hypothesis that the children of the normal weight women have a better metabolic profile than the children born to the obese women.</brief_summary>
