	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare 3 cycles of neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemotherapy + operation with the standard treatment of locally advanced colon cancer, which is operation + 8 cycles of (adjuvant) chemotherapy. Patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy may not need adjuvant chemotherapy after the operation and, if this is the case, they will be spared of 5 cycles of chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
