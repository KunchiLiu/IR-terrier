	<brief_summary>Children born to obese women are at risk of increased adiposity and later adverse metabolic outcomes. We have conducted a follow-up study on an existing clinical trial, called the LiP study (Lifestyle in Pregnancy), registration number NCT00530439,in which 360 obese pregnant women were randomized to either lifestyle intervention or routine obstetric care. This present study follows the children until 3 years of age. We have the hypothesis, that the intervention during pregnancy results in a lower degree of adiposity and metabolic risk factors in the offspring. Clinical examination is taking place at age 2.5-3 years including anthropometric measurements, Dual energy x-ray (DXA) scans and blood samples measuring metabolic markers.</brief_summary>
