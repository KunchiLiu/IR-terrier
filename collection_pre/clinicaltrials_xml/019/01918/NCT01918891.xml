	<brief_title>Center for Stroke Disparities Solution - Community Transitions Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Targeted study participants are Black and Hispanic patients with a history of stroke and a current systolic blood pressure (BP) above JNC7 recommended range (&gt;=140 mmHg) who recently entered home care service. The NP only program will provide a 30 day intervention while the NP/HC team will provide 3 months of support via in-home and telephone encounters for patients randomized to one of these groups. In the first 30 days post-enrollment the NP will focus on medical case management and coordination with primary care providers and specialists, provide self-management coaching, and intervene if gaps in care are identified - all with a focus on BP reduction and preparing the patient for ongoing BP maintenance. As applicable, the HC will pick up the case after 30 days and follow up with the plan of care jointly established by the patient, NP and HC. The focus will be on ongoing self-management coaching, providing preparation support for physician visits, and linking patient to additional community resources, as needed.</detailed_description>
