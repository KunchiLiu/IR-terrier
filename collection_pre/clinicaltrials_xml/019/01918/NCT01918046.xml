	<brief_summary>This is a single-center, prospective sample collection study. Samples will be used to establish the performance characteristics of myo-inositol oxygenase (MIOX) as an aid in the early diagnosis of acute renal injury (AKI) following cardiac surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MIOX for Early Detection of Acute Kidney Injury After Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 100 adults scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery involving the use of cardiopulmonary bypass will be eligible for enrollment in this study. Blood and urine samples will be obtained from all patients in the study for future measurement of both MIOX and creatinine concentrations in the same sample at each of the following time points: - Baseline (within 24 hours prior to the start of surgery) - Immediately following cardiopulmonary bypass (time 0), 3 (± 1), 6 (± 2), 12 (+/-2) 18 (± 2), and 24 (± 2) hours following cardiopulmonary bypass. Urine and lithium heparin anti-coagulated blood will be collected at each time point. Blood and urine samples will be immediately centrifuged, aliquoted, and frozen at -80oC prior to analysis. Samples will be stored and analyzed at Washington University School of Medicine. The results of these assessments will be blinded to the medical team during the study and will not impact the medical management of the patient. Serum creatinine measurements obtained by the medical team as part of routine care both pre-operatively and post-operatively as well as any additional post-operative renal insults, the development of oliguria, need for a nephrology consultation, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, initiation of dialysis and mortality will be recorded through Day 10. Patients will be followed throughout their hospital stay, which on average is expected to be about 10 days. The statistical analysis will evaluate the correlation of plasma and urine MIOX (absolute and change from baseline) with parameters indicative of renal injury (e.g., increases in plasma creatinine through Day 5 and development of oliguria, need for a nephrology consult or initiation of dialysis through Day 10). These results will assist in establishing the sensitivity and specificity of plasma and urine MIOX for the detection of meaningful kidney injury following cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.</detailed_description>
