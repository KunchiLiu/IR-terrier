	<brief_summary>Our objective is to investigate neuro-anatomical correlates of the regulation of energy intake by means of functional MRI. Administration of glucose with and without lactisole and exendin as well as fructose is followed by functional brain MRI, and findings are correlated with serum GLP-1 levels as an endogenous satiety signal in humans.</brief_summary>
