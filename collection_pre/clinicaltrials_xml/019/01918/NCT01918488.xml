	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine whether a diuretic drug called amiloride is capable of increasing renal salt excretion and thereby decrease blood pressure in diabetic patients with kidney disease. Our hypothesis states that amiloride is capable of reducing blood pressure in these patients and thus decrease the cardiovascular risk associated with diabetic kidney disease.</brief_summary>
