	<brief_title>Protective Immune Mechanisms in Alcoholic Hepatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will study hepatic biopsies from patients with alcoholic hepatitis. In these biopsies, the investigators will assess the production of IL-22 and which cells produce the cytokine. The investigators will study the expression of the IL-22 receptor and also the production of the IL-22 binding protein, which can inhibit the actions of the cytokine.</detailed_description>
