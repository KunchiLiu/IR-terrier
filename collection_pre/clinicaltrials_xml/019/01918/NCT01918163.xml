	<detailed_description>Pomegranate contains a high concentration of vitamins ( C, B1, B2, B3, B5), potassium, Magnesium , Zinc and is a good source for polyphenols .Polyphenols molecules have been found to possess antioxidant properties and may effects the expression of different genes . Recent studies indicate that among foods that contain polyphenols, juice extracted from the pomegranate has the highest concentration of measurable polyphenols . Pomegranates have shown inhibitory effect on NF-κB and the MAP kinases JNK and ERK, which are critical steps in the cascade of events leading to inflammatory response. The NF- κB pathway is activated in response to bacterial infection and initiates the inflammatory cascade, which may explain the protective effect of Pomegranates on bacterial infections.</detailed_description>
