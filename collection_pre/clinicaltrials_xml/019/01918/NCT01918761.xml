	<brief_title>Dacomitinib + Pemetrexed for Patients With Advanced Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label phase Ib trial aims to determine the safety, tolerability, the pharmacokinetic profile, and to identify a dose of dacomitinib in combination with pemetrexed. Three sites in Austria will participate in this study. Six to nine patients will initially be enrolled to receive the target dose of 45 mg qd dacomitinib (starting from day 2 of first cycle) in combination with pemetrexed (500 mg/m² 10 min infusion, once every 3 weeks). One cycle is defined as 21 days. The first 3 subjects will be enrolled at a rate of ≤ 1 subject per week. If the target dose regimen is safe based on the incidence of DLT another 3 subjects will be enrolled. If the dose of 45 mg qd is not safe alternate lower doses will be explored (dose level -1, dose level -2) to identify the MTD of dacomitinib in combination of pemetrexed. Six to nine patients per dose level will be enrolled.</detailed_description>
