	<brief_summary>The investigators are proposing a project that will examine the effectiveness of brief motivational enhancement therapy in a population with concurrent psychotic disorders and substance use disorders. This study will represent an emerging line of inquiry, as best practice interventions with this concurrent disordered (CD) populations are yet to be established.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brief Motivational Enhancement Therapy for Concurrent Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Motivational enhancement therapy (MET) is grounded in research that explores the process of change. The MET approach assists individuals to move through increasingly higher levels of change towards action (making change) and maintaining change. The MET approach aims to invoke rapid and internally motivated change. The Two MET sessions adapted from Sampl and Kadden (2001) are prepared as two individual sessions to reflect the original design of MET, allowing for client's to be met at their respective stage of change. Further, individual sessions allow the treatment to be tailored to client's individual reasons for change and personal coping strategies. The use of the Personalized Feedback Report (PFR) further encourages treatment around client's personal concerns and goals (Ramchand et al., 2011; See appendix 1 for further detail). In the first treatment session, the therapist provides feedback from the initial CD consultation, using the PFR to stimulate discussion about personal substance use and reasons for change. Rapport building is also a key element to the first session, during which a strong therapeutic alliance is initiated. The second session is aimed at strengthening the commitment to change, exploring goal setting, and preparation for group. The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) Schizophrenia Division introduced a CD service in 2009. Since the time of its inception, more than 200 consultations have been conducted. Of those consultations, more than 80%recommended attending CD groups offered with the Schizophrenia Program. However, less than 10% have followed those recommendations and attended the CD group. Based on what is known about challenges surrounding engagement of CD clients in recommended treatments coupled with guidelines for evidence-based treatment with this population (Ledgerwood et al., 2008; Tsuang et al., 2006; Roncero et al., 2011), the purpose of the current study is to explore the ability of MET to increase engagement in CD interventions for clients diagnosed with psychotic and substance use disorders.</detailed_description>
