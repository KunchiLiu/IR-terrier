	<brief_summary>Synchronous Tele-Endoscopy: A clinical feasibility study of gastrointestinal tele-endoscopy by implementing and evaluating synchronous tele-endoscopy using ENDOALPHA in a hospital based endoscopy unit. EndoAlpha will be used on the hospitals existing Intranet/LAN and the possibilities of tele-endoscopy on WAN through existing network, on separate dedicated line or through new established transmission lines, will be evaluated. The EndoAlpha system will be integrated in a highly advanced endoscopy procedure room. The system will integrate through LAN with doctor office, clinic conference and lecture room and GI pathologist room. Through either LAN or WAN, connection will be establish to a referral GI center in Denmark. Through WAN, connection will be established to doctor home and to an expert Spanish center.</brief_summary>
