	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of QRS®-1010 PelviCenter in female patients with stress urinary incontinence. Based on the available data on magnetic stimulation, the investigators hypothesize that magnetic stimulation via QRS®-1010 PelviCenter will reduce the number and amount of urinary leakage upon exertion as well as improve patients' quality of life.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A total of 120 female patients will be randomly assigned into two treatment groups (active arm and sham arm) in a 1:1 ratio. The standard QRS®-1010 PelviCenter treatment plan involves 16 sessions of 20 minutes each. Each subject will attend 2 sessions per week (total 16 sessions).</detailed_description>
