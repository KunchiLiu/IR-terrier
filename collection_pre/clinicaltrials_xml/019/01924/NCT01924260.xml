	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of alisertib when given together with gemcitabine hydrochloride in treating patients with solid tumors or pancreatic cancer that is metastatic or cannot be removed by surgery. Alisertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving alisertib with gemcitabine hydrochloride may be an effective treatment for solid tumors or pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alisertib and Gemcitabine Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors or Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To investigate the feasibility and safety of MLN8237 (alisertib) when given in combination with gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) to patients with advanced solid tumors. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MLN8237 when given in combination with gemcitabine to patients with advanced solid tumors and to recommend a phase II dose for the combination. II. To obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy as judged by response rate and progression-free survival for this combination. III. To investigate the pharmacokinetics of MLN8237 given in combination with gemcitabine in an expanded cohort of patients with pancreatic cancer. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of alisertib. Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and alisertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.</detailed_description>

Prior gemcitabinebased regimes in the palliative setting are permitted if no evidence of progression on therapy or at least 6 months after discontinuation of gemcitabine based treatment. Prior gemcitabine in the adjuvant setting is permitted if last treatment was greater than 6 months prior to registration Any prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy or targeted therapy must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to start of this protocol and all side effects (except alopecia, lymphopenia and hyperglycemia) resolved to grade 1 or less; any prior radiation must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to start of therapy Pregnant or nursing women are ineligible; women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Ability to swallow and retain oral medications Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any studyrelated procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care Female subject is either postmenopausal or surgically sterilized or willing to use an acceptable method of birth control (ie, a hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the duration of the study Male subject agrees to use an acceptable method for contraception during the entire study treatment period through 4 months after the last dose of MLN8237; male patients, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy) must agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through four months after the last dose of study drug, or completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse Prior treatment with Aurora Atargeted agents, including MLN8237 History of Gilbert's syndrome Cardiac disease: congestive heart failure &gt; class II New York Heart Association (NYHA); patients must not have unstable angina (anginal symptoms at rest) or new onset angina (began within the last 3 months) or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months Symptomatic or uncontrolled brain metastasis; patients with neurological symptoms must undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to exclude brain metastasis; previously treated brain metastases will be allowed as long as the patient is neurologically stable and is off steroids and anticonvulsants Prior radiation to greater than 25% of the bone marrow or whole pelvis radiation Patients requiring full therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin are ineligible because therapy on this trial may result in frequent and recurrent thrombocytopenia; full therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin, low molecular weight heparin, or direct factor Xa inhibitor is permitted Patients with a diagnosis of active human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, on antiretroviral therapy, or with a cluster of differentiation (CD) 4 count less than 200 are ineligible;
