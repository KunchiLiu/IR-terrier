	<brief_summary>The primary aims of this study are: 1) to determine whether maternal prenatal vitamin D3 supplementation (4200 IU/week, 16,800 IU/week, or 28,000 IU/week) versus placebo increases or decreases infant length at 1 year of age, and 2) to determine whether maternal postpartum vitamin D3 supplementation (28,000 IU/week) versus placebo increases or decreases length at 1 year of age among infants born to women who received vitamin D 28,000 U/week during pregnancy. Infants enrolled in the study will be followed for 2 years to document the persistence of any observed effects measured at 1 year of age. This study aims to enroll 1300 pregnant women in the 2nd trimester at a maternity hospital in Dhaka. Participants will be randomized to one of three doses of vitamin D3 (4200 IU/week, 16,800 IU/week, or 28,000 IU/week) or placebo throughout pregnancy. Women in the 28,000 IU/week group will be additionally randomized to either placebo or a continuation of 28,000 IU/week for 6 months postpartum. In addition to linear length, the trial will include analyses of inflammatory and hormonal determinants of infant growth, epigenetic phenomena that affect vitamin D metabolism, and diarrheal and respiratory morbidity in the infants.</brief_summary>
