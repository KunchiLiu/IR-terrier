	<brief_summary>The aim of this Phase I/II study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dendritic cells (DC) vaccine combined with cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells in patients with renal cell carcinoma. Experimental recombinant adenovirus-transfected DC, which engineered to express MUC1 and Survivin are used for DC-based immunotherapy. Based on the results of our previously performed preclinical study with DC vaccine combined with CIK cells, the investigators plan to perform the clinical trial.</brief_summary>
