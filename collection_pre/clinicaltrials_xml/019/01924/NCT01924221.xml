	<brief_summary>Cardiac resynchronization therapy with pacemaker alone, or in combination with a cardioverter-defibrillator, prolongs life and decreases risk of heart failure exacerbation in patients with low ejection fraction and wide QRS. Some patients achieve decrease in QRS duration 6 months after cardiac resynchronization therapy. Such fenomenon is called reverse electrical remodeling of native conduction. Retrospective analysis showed that reverse electrical remodeling of the native conduction after at least 6 months of CRT is associated with decreased rate of ventricular arrhythmias and better survival. This study is designed to study reverse electrical remodeling prospectively.</brief_summary>
