	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to look at the effect of ketoconazole and fluconazole on how much baricitinib gets into the blood stream. The study will also look at the tolerability of baricitinib and ketoconazole when given together and the tolerability of baricitinib and fluconazole when given together. Participants will be recruited into one of 2 treatment groups (Group A, Group B). Each treatment group will participate in 2 study periods. Participants will take baricitinib alone in one period and baricitinib with either ketaconazole or fluconazole in the other period. This study will last approximately 7 weeks.</brief_summary>
