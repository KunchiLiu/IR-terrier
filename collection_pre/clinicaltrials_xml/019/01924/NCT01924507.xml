	<brief_summary>The investigators aimed to evaluated the role of bedside sleep medicine in an cardiology intensive care unit. The patients will be submitted to a overnight polysomnography. Those individuals with sleep apnea will be treated with CPAP during the ICU admission. Also, the investigators will identify the factors that compromise the sleep and will act to minimize them to improve the sleep quality. After the interventions, the investigators will evaluate if there are reduced days of hospital admission, major cardiovascular events (infarction, reinfarction, heart failure and stroke) and overall mortality.</brief_summary>
