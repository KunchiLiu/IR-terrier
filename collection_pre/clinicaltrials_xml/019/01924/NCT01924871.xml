	<brief_summary>It has been reported that deep extubation can reduce cardiopulmonary complication against endotracheal tube extubation during emergence from general anesthesia. The investigators hypothesized that using desflurane with target controlled infusion of remifentanil is more effective than using desflurane alone during deep extubation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of remifentanil to prevent respiratory complication (etc. coughing) during emergence from general anesthesia.</brief_summary>
