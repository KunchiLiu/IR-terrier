	<brief_summary>The main goal of this research is to advance understanding of how stroke changes both the structure and function of the brain. The investigators will determine which is the key driver of recovery of arm function after stroke: changes in the structure of the brain or changes in how brain regions interact with one another.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main goal of this research is to advance understanding of how stroke changes both the structure and function of the brain. Further, the investigators will determine which is the key driver of recovery of arm function after stroke: changes in the structure of the brain or changes in how brain regions interact with one another. Together, these data will advance the investigators understanding of how neural systems support recovery from stroke. The investigators will use a MRI technique that allows us to assess the health of a brain structure called myelin. This structure is important as it allows information to travel down nerves faster; the more myelin the quicker the signal can be conducted. The investigators aim is to test whether or not movement training can restore myelin in the brain. If movement training does restore myelin in the brain, the investigators will have identified an important new target for rehabilitation interventions.</detailed_description>
