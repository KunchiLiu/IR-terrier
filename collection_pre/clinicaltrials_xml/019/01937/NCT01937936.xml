	<brief_summary>Family caregivers are vulnerable to health problems because of the stress and demands of their role as a caregiver. With the growing incidence of heart failure (HF) and the anticipated growth in the aging population, the number of HF caregivers is expected to rise. This study will pilot test a cognitive behavioral intervention designed to reduce stress among HF caregivers, which will ultimately contribute to promoting health and quality of life among HF caregivers and their loved ones with HF.</brief_summary>
