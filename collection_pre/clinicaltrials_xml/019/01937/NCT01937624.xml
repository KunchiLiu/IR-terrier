	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of using a diagnostic musculoskeletal ultrasound in pediatric distal radius fractures in an outpatient setting. Ultrasound reliability and accuracy will be tested. The result of the diagnostic ultrasound will be compared to x-ray diagnosis under routine conditions in the investigator's injury and fracture treatment evening clinic. Data will be collected and recorded during the duration of the 12 week study. Through the literature review and experience with ultrasound, the investigators anticipate that diagnostic ultrasound will provide very high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing distal radius fractures in children.</brief_summary>
