	<brief_summary>This study will be a non-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) of women presenting for abortion at &lt;13 6/7 weeks. Women will be randomized either to receive support by a trained abortion doula (intervention) or to have standard procedure (control) during the abortion procedure. The investigators hypothesize that women who receive doula support during a first trimester abortion will report less pain during the abortion procedure compared to women who do not receive abortion doula support.</brief_summary>
