	<brief_summary>The purposes of this study are: 1. To test if 36 weeks of standard dose of ribavirin with PEGASYS® is non-inferior to standard dose of 48 weeks of ribavirin with PEGASYS® in SVR for patients with RVR and HVL 2. To test if the 72 weeks of treatment with PEGASYS® plus standard dose ribavirin is superior to 48 weeks of the same treatment for patients with HCV RNA seropositivity at week 12</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aims of the present study are: 1. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of 36-week versus 48-week regimen of PEGASYS® (peginterferon alfa-2a, PegIFN) plus standard-dose of ribavirin (RBV) in hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infected, treatment-naïve CHC patients who have high viral loads (HVL, defined as baseline HCV RNA ≧ 400,000 IU/mL) and achieve a rapid virologic response (RVR) (defined as seronegativity of HCV RNA at week 4 of treatment) 2. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of 48-week versus 72-week regimen of PegIFN plus standard-dose of RBV in HCV virus genotype 1 infected, treatment-naïve CHC patients with PCR-seropositive of HCV RNA at week 12</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male and female patients *18 years of age Patients have never been treated with traditional interferon plus ribavirin or peginterferon plus ribavirin Serologic evidence of chronic hepatitis C infection by an antiHCV antibody test Detectable serum HCVRNA and HCV viral genotype 1 Liver biopsy findings consistent with the diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C infection with or without compensated cirrhosis (Exception: hemophiliacs in whom biopsy is medically contraindicated do not require biopsy.) Compensated liver disease (ChildPugh Grade A clinical classification) Negative urine or blood pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential) documented within the 24hour period prior to the first dose of study drug All fertile males and females receiving ribavirin must be using two forms of effective contraception during treatment and during the 6 months after treatment end Women with ongoing pregnancy or breast feeding Therapy with any systemic antineoplastic or immunomodulatory treatment (including supraphysiologic doses of steroids and radiation) *6 months prior to the first dose of study drug Any investigational drug *6 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug Coinfection with active hepatitis A, hepatitis B and/or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) History or other evidence of a medical condition associated with chronic liver disease other than HCV (e.g., hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, metabolic liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, toxin exposures) Signs or symptoms of hepatocellular carcinoma History or other evidence of bleeding from esophageal varices or other conditions consistent with decompensated liver disease Neutrophil count &lt;1500 cells/mm3 or platelet count &lt;90,000 cells/mm3 at screening</criteria>
