	<brief_summary>Grazoprevir (MK-5172) and Elbasvir (MK-8742) were studied as the principal components of combination oral therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV). The study examined the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of Grazoprevir and Elbasvir following 10 days of dosing in participants with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) or participants with severe renal impairment. Both groups were compared to healthy matched controls.</brief_summary>
