	<brief_title>Impact of Emotional Mimicry and Oxytocin on Frontotemporal Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Pick's disease cause changes in personality, behaviour, and emotional responses. The usual treatments for Frontotemporal dementia focus on reducing agitation and aggressive behaviours. However, these drugs do not help all patients who experience blunting of emotion and loss of empathy. This study will evaluate the effects on emotions and neural activity of a one time dose of intranasal oxytocin vs. placebo in patients with FTD and healthy controls.</detailed_description>
