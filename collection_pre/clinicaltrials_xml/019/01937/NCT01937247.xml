	<brief_summary>The main purpose of the study is to examine whether operating room (OR) efficiency will be improved by significantly decreasing non operative time. This study also aims: 1) to evaluate whether a decrease in non-operative time will result in increased surgeon and staff satisfaction, 2) to determine whether there is an increase in the complication rate during the redesigned process perioperatively and until discharge from the post anesthesia care unit, and 3) to rate patient satisfaction.</brief_summary>
