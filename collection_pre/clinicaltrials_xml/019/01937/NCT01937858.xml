	<brief_summary>The value of HbA1c as a tool to determine glycemic control in patients with diabetes and renal failure has not been well studied, the same accepted normal ranges for HbA1c are applied to all patients with diabetes regardless of their renal function. We would like to evaluate the use of HbA1c as a tool of assessing long term glycemic control in this subgroup of patients with diabetes and evaluate the effect of dialysis on HbA1c</brief_summary>
