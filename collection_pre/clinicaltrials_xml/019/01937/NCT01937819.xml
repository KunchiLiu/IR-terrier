	<brief_title>Patients Judging Bowel Preparation by Using SMARTPHONE Application</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a randomized, prospective, endoscopist-blinded clinical trial in which the efficacy of SMARTPHONE application on the bowel cleansing was inspected. A intervention patients take the picture of stool using SMARTPHONE camera application, and then assess the bowel cleansing result. If the result is "Pass", they stop the addition of bowel preparation agent. but the result is "Fail", so they have the additive bowel preparation agent and repeat using the SMARTPHONE application. After the bowel preparation, Endoscopists, who were blinded to the study group of the patient, immediately completed the Ottawa scale after procedure.</detailed_description>
