	<brief_summary>Radiation therapy plus concurrent chemotherapy is now the standard therapy for patients with localized carcinoma of the esophagus selected for nonsurgical treatment. The standard radiation dose is 50-50.4Gy/1.8-2.0Gy/F.All of this were based on 2D radiation technology. Entering new century, 3D-CRT or IMRT has used on esophageal cancer. In China,the recommend radiation dose of concurrent chemoradiation was 60Gy. The study is a clinical phase III, randomized trial to compare the different radiation dose(60Gy vs 50Gy) of concurrent chemoradiation using 3D-CRT or IMRT in patients with unresectable esophageal carcinoma.</brief_summary>
