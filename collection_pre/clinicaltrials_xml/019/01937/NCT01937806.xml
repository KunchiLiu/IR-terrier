	<brief_summary>To prove that a study drug is noninferior to a control drug with a proportion of subjects who showed HBV DNA undetected (less than 400 copies/mL (69 IU/mL)) at the 48th week after 48-week administration of Besifovir 150 mg, or Tenofovir 300 mg as a control drug to chronic hepatitis B patients</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 3 Study of Besifovir</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Screening Period Subject registration is conducted with confirming selection and exclusion criteria after a written consent form is obtained within 28 days before clinical trial drug administration. - Wash-out Period Subjects who had been treated with antiviral agents within 12 weeks should complete a 4-week wash-out period from the stage of stopping antiviral agent treatment before a baseline visit and subjects who have no experience of antiviral agent treatment start a baseline visit without a wash-out period. - Baseline Subjects who visit on the date of starting clinical trial drug administration are randomized to a test group or a control group at a ratio of 1:1. Double blindness is applied for both groups. - Treatment period Subjects are orally administered with a clinical trial drug q.ds.i.d. for 48 weeks and visit at the 0, 4th, 12th, 24th, 36th, and 48th week for an HBV DNA test, laboratory tests, a physical test, vital signs, and adverse events. - Follow-up period Subjects are provided with appropriate treatment after completing the 48-week trial or dropping out. Subjects visit once at the 60th week for follow-up of adverse events, such as acute deterioration of hepatitis B, and HBV DNA test results. If any treatment is not conducted after 48-week administration, subjects visit at intervals of four weeks until a follow-up visit (60th week) and the same tests with the 24th week visit (Visit 5) are conducted. However, subjects who participate in a 48-week separate extended trial conducted after 48-week administration in this clinical trial do not have a follow-up period.</detailed_description>
