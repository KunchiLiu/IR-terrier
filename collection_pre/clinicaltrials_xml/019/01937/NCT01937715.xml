	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, open label Phase 1b/2 study in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma. The Phase 1b will identify the dose of the combination of PF-05212384 plus FOLFIRI. The randomized, two-arm Phase 2 portion will compare the efficacy and safety of PF-05212384 plus FOLFIRI to that of bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI. The study population will consist of patients with mCRC previously treated with an oxaliplatin-based regimen in the first line setting or who have progressed within 6 months of the end of an adjuvant oxaliplatin-based regimen.</brief_summary>
