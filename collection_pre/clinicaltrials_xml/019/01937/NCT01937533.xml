	<brief_summary>This study aims to develop the technique of Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging(DW-MRI)for the assessment of stage 1 cervical cancers. An endovaginal receiver coil has been designed and developed at the Institute of Cancer Research and Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust for use at high field strengths(3T). This will be used to evaluate if DW-MRI at 3T can be used to differentiate different histological characteristics within whole tumours and so determine if the technique could be of prognostic value. The study hypothesis is that this technique will be able to differentiate tumours with histological features known to be associated with poor prognosis (tumour type, grade and lymphovascular space invasion).</brief_summary>
