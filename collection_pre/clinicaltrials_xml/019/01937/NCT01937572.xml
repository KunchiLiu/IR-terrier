	<brief_summary>The purpose of the current study is to validate the technology of MRI-based alignment for total knee replacements and to collect data on potential advantages of the computer aided system. 1. It is hypothesized that there will be no significant differences in position, loosening, or function of the Visionaire total knee as compared to the conventional total knee. 2. It is hypothesized that the Visionaire total knee will be significantly better with regard to operative time, tourniquet time, blood loss, and procedural set-up, turnover time, and overall costs.</brief_summary>
