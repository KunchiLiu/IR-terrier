	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the additive effect of brinzolamide 1%/brimonidine 0.2% (SIMBRINZA® suspension) in subjects with either open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who are currently on a prostaglandin analogue (PGA) monotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of SIMBRINZA® Suspension as an Added Therapy to a Prostaglandin Analogue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was divided into 2 sequential phases. The Screening/Eligibility Phase included one Screening Visit and two Eligibility Visits, during which subjects washed out of all other intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering medications and dosed with TRAVATAN Z®, XALATAN®, or LUMIGAN®, 1 drop instilled in each eye once daily for 28 days. Subjects who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomized at the second Eligibility Visit. The Treatment Phase consisted of two on-therapy visits (Week 2 and Week 6).</detailed_description>
