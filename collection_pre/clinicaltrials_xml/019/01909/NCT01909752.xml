	<brief_summary>This study will test an investigational vaccine, called DRibbles, for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We hypothesize that vaccination with the DRibble vaccine will cause an immune responses against proteins contained in the DRibble vaccine and the protein antigens targeted by this strong immune response will include common antigens shared by both the vaccine and the patient's tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Vaccine Immunotherapy (DRibbles) for Patients With Definitively-Treated Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, randomized study in which the first 33 patients will be assigned to receive the either: - DRibbles vaccine and HPV vaccine - DRibbles vaccine, HPV vaccine, and imiquimod - DRibbles vaccine, HPV vaccine, and GM-CSF After 11 patients have been assigned to each group, the study arm with the greatest number of vaccine-induced strong antibody responses will then continue with enrollment of 15 further patients. The primary objective is to determine the best strategy to induce strong (&gt;15 fold) tumor-specific or tumor-associated antibody responses in patients with stage III A and B NSCLC. The goal is to select one regimen to advance to additional clinical trials.</detailed_description>
