	<brief_title>A Human Mass Balance Study to Determine the Total Recovery of Radioactivity in Urine and Faeces Following a Single Oral Dose of 14C Radiolabelled ONO-4053</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single centre, open-label, non-randomised study in healthy adult male subjects. Six subjects will receive a single dose of 14C ONO-4053 administered orally as a suspension. Safety measurements (ECG, vital signs, biochemistry and haematology) and adverse events will be monitored throughout the study. After administration of 14C ONO-4053 subjects will remain in the clinical facility for collection of blood, urine and faecessamples. Samples will be analysed for recovery of radioactivity and characterisation of metabolites of ONO-4053.</detailed_description>
