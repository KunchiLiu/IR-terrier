	<brief_summary>The purpose of this is to test lateral foot orthoses with different amount of wedging to find a model that predicts the optimal lateral inclination of foot orthosis based on biomechanical or feelings measures. This study was a cross-sectional study with patients serving as their own control. The investigators recruited 24 knee osteoarthritis. Knee radiography and clinical angles measures was carried out before making orthoses, then motion analysis with an optoelectronic system was performed with each pair of foot orthoses. During motion analysis, five gait trials were carried out in each condition.</brief_summary>
