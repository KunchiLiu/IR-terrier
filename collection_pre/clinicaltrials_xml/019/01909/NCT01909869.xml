	<criteria>1. 18yrs≤Age≤75yrs . 2. De novo lesion at native coronary artery. 3. Single target vessel and single target lesion. 4. Lesion length ≤32mm. 5. RVD 2.5mm～4.0mm. 6. DS%≥70% by visual estimation. 7. Target lesion could be covered by only one stent. 8. Subjects are willing to follow the specified requirements followup. 9. A process by which a subject voluntarily confirms his or her willingness to participate in a particular trial, after having been informed of all aspects of the trial that are relevant to the subject's decision to participate. Informed consent is documented by means of a written, signed and dated informed consent form. 1. AMI within one week. 2. CTO(TIMI0),LM lesion,ostial lesion,graft vessel lesion,bifurcation (side branch RVD≥2.5mm),ISR,mutivessel disease need to be treated. 3. Severe calcified lesion unable to predilate. 4. extremely tortuous proximal to the lesion that is inadequate to stent delivery. 5. NYHA≥Ⅲ or LVEF≤40%. 6. Prior stenting within 1 year. 7. Pregnancy or lactation, and plan in postoperative pregnancy or lactation. 8. Subjects had bleeding tendency or blood coagulation dysfunction or PCI contraindications, or anticoagulant therapy taboo or can't continue DAPT healers at least 1 year. 9. There are other diseases (such as cancer,malignant tumor ,congestive heart failure,organ transplantation or candidate) or abuse history (alcohol cocaine heroin, etc.), scheme compliance is poor, interference related data explanation or the limited life (&lt; 1 year). 10.
