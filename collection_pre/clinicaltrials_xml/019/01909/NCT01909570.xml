	<brief_title>eSET Plus Single Embryo Cryotransfer vs Double Embryo Transfer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective is to evaluate the In Vitro Fertilization/Intracytoplasmic Sperm Inyection (IVF/ICSI) results in terms of clinical pregnancy and multiple pregnancy rates, comparing elective single embryo transfer plus cryotransfer of one embryo if pregnancy is not achieved, with double embryo transfer. This is a prospective randomized study, including couples arriving to the Reproductive Unit of the Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves. All these patients had good reproductive prognosis and had been asigned randomly to one of the following groups: Group 1: elective single embryo transfer. In the case pregnancy is not achieved a cryotransfer of one embryo will be carried out. Group 2: elective double embryo transfer.</detailed_description>
