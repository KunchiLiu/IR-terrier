	<brief_summary>Adults with Social Anxiety Disorder will be pseudo randomly assigned to either an individual cognitive behavior therapy, attention bias modification treatment (allocation ratio - 1.5:1). Outcome measures will be social anxiety symptoms and severity as measured by gold standard questionnaires as well as diagnosis of social anxiety disorder derived from structured clinical interviews based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) IV criteria. The investigators expect to find significant reduction in social anxiety symptoms in all of the groups, with the cognitive behavior therapy group showing greater reduction in symptoms than the other groups. Mechanisms of change in all of the groups will be examined via measures of cognitive biases, affect, and other common and specific factors.</brief_summary>
