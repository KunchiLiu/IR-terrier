	<brief_summary>The experience of negative emotions is associated with an increased risk of incident atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, independent of traditional risk factors. The strongest data supporting this relation is with provoked anger. There is also some evidence that becoming acutely depressed or anxious are also triggers of incident CVD. The underlying putative mechanisms are poorly understood. Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) play an essential role in maintaining vascular tone and the integrity of blood vessels. Evidence suggests that dysfunction of the endothelium is an early pathogenic process underlying atherosclerosis development and CVD event onset. The aims of this study are to primarily examine the acute effects of provoked anger and secondarily depressed mood and anxiety on EC health. Examination of these critical pathways will help determine whether endothelial dysfunction is a biological mechanism linking the experience of core negative emotions and incident CVD risk. In this application, a state-of-the-art, laboratory-based, randomized controlled experiment is proposed that will test whether provoked anger, depressed mood and anxiety will induce endothelial dysfunction in humans. We hypothesize that compared to an emotionally neutral condition, an anger recall task will impair endothelium-dependent vasodilation, injure ECs, and reduce EC reparative capacity. We will also examine whether a depressed mood and anxiety induction task will similarly induce endothelial dysfunction, as well as whether levels of provoked self-reported anger, depressed mood, and anxiety are associated with the degree of endothelial dysfunction. Finally, given that endogenous nitric oxide (NO) inhibition plays a central role in exacerbating endothelial dysfunction, we will explore whether NO inhibition partially mediates the acute adverse effects of provoked anger, depressed mood, and anxiety on endothelial function. In the United States, atherosclerosis-related CVD events remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Further, anger, depressed mood, and anxiety are negative emotions commonly experienced by adults in the general population on a day-to-day basis. Therefore, evaluation of these hypotheses is timely and highly significant, as it will help identify a putative biological pathway linking the experience of core negative emotions to CVD incidence, for a large number of individuals who are at increased risk for CVD events.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Effects of Negative Emotions on Endothelial Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) events remain the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in industrialized nations. Atherosclerosis is a diffuse disease characterized by the deposition of lipid and other blood-borne material within the arterial wall. Evidence demonstrates that disruption of an arterial atherosclerotic plaque and subsequent thrombus formation is responsible for the onset of CVD events. Cardiovascular research efforts have been directed toward the identification of early underlying factors that initiate this cascade. It has been known for some time that the experience of negative emotions is associated with an increased risk of incident CVD events, independent of traditional risk factors. Among the best-studied negative emotions is anger. Population-based studies have demonstrated that the experience of anger is a trigger of incident CVD events. The mechanism(s) by which provoked anger acutely affects the pathways that underlie atherosclerosis development and progression remain to be fully characterized. Endothelial dysfunction is a promising mechanism that may explain the link between anger and incident CVD events. Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) play essential roles in maintaining vascular tone and the integrity of blood vessels. Evidence suggests that endothelial dysfunction is an early pathogenic process underlying atherosclerosis development and CVD event onset. Our preliminary findings show in apparently healthy individuals, an anger recall task acutely induces endothelial dysfunction by impairing endothelium-dependent vasodilation, injuring ECs, and disrupting the molecular processes underlying EC reparative capacity. We have additionally found that this task may induce endogenous nitric oxide (NO) inhibition, which plays a central role in aggravating endothelial dysfunction. Therefore, NO inhibition may partially mediate anger-provoked endothelial dysfunction. Although the strongest data are on anger-provoked CVD events, there is also some evidence that the experience of other core negative emotions such as depressed mood and anxiety may trigger CVD events. Whether the provocation of depressed mood and anxiety acutely induces endothelial dysfunction and NO inhibition remains to be determined. The overall aim of this study is to primarily examine the acute effects of provoked anger and secondarily depressed mood and anxiety on EC health. We will also explore whether NO inhibition partially mediates the acute effects of anger, depressed mood, and anxiety on endothelial function. Examination of these critical pathways will help identify the biological pathways by which the experience of core negative emotions leads to incident CVD risk. To address these highly significant research questions, we propose a state-of-the-art, laboratory-based, randomized controlled experiment in which 280 participants will be randomized to one of four experimental conditions: an anger recall task (N=70), a depressed mood recall task (N=70), an anxiety recall task (N=70), and an emotionally neutral condition (N=70). Our specific study aims and hypotheses are as follows: Primary Hypotheses: Compared to the neutral condition, the anger recall task will acutely induce endothelial dysfunction by: impairing endothelium-dependent arterial vasodilation (Hypothesis 1a); increasing circulating levels of EC-derived microparticles (EMPs), a marker of EC injury (Hypothesis 1b); and reducing circulating levels of bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), a marker of EC reparative capacity (Hypothesis 1c). Secondary Hypotheses: Compared to the neutral condition, the depressed mood and separately the anxiety recall tasks will acutely impair endothelium-dependent arterial vasodilation, increase circulating levels of EMPs, and reduce circulating levels of bone marrow-derived EPCs. There will be a relation of the level of self-reported anger, depressed mood, and anxiety with endothelial dysfunction.</detailed_description>
