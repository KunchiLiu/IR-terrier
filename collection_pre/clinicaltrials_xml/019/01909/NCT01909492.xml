	<criteria>Subjects with suspected MS, who have had a clinical attack within the last 12 weeks, have at least one gadoliniumenhancing lesion on brain or spinal cord MRI taken within the prior 4 weeks, and for which they have not received any immunomodulating or immunosuppressant medication. Subjects with clinically stable definite MS, with no evidence of clinical relapse for at least the past 12 weeks, and have no gadolinium enhancing lesions on MRI in the prior 4 weeks. These subjects will fulfill the Revised (2010) McDonald's Criteria for the Diagnosis of MS. Subjects without evidence of inflammatory systemic or inflammatory central nervous system disease, who require CSF removal for some other cause, such treatment of benign intracranial hypertension or as part of the procedure for insertion of an intrathecal medication delivery system.
