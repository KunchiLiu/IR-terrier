	<brief_summary>After routine induction of general anaesthesia peak airway pressure (= P max) and other respiratory parameters(i.e. expiratory tidal volume, expiratory CO2) are measured with and without head support in three different head positions: neutral position, reclination of the head, a position deemed ideal by the anaesthesist; primary study goal is pmax depending on different head positions;</brief_summary>
