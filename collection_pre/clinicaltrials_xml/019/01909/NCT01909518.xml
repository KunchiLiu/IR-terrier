	<brief_title>Detection of Early Esophageal Squamous Neoplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE; Cellvizio, Mauna Kea Technologies, Paris, France) is a newly developed endoscopic device and has shown its value for diagnosing Barrett's esophagus, colonal polyps and etc. However, none research has focus on early esophageal squamous neoplasia until now. Previous diagnosis of early esophageal neoplasia is based on the lugol staining which is time wasting and have many adverse events.Other researches have suggested virtual chromoendoscopys are beneficial for screening esophageal tumors. Therefore, the aim of the present study is 1.To investigate the diagnosing value of pCLE for early esophageal squamous neoplasia according to the surface maturation scoring(SMS) diagnostic criteria and 2. To assess the detection rate of early esophageal squamous neoplasia by virtual chromoendoscopy(I-SCAN).</detailed_description>
