	<brief_title>PMC Split Preparation for Colon Cleansing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Picosulphate/magnesium citrate is a very effective, safe and tolerated low-volume preparation for colon cleansing. This study evaluates whether split dosing is associated to a further increase in efficacy and acceptability in comparison to the standard dose regimen. This is a multicenter, randomized, single-blind study performed in 15 endoscopic services in Italy. Adult outpatients undergoing colonoscopy will receive picosulphate/magnesium citrate either in the standard dosing (group A, two sachets the day before endoscopy), or in the split dosing (group B, the second dose in the morning of colonoscopy). Bowel cleansing will be assessed using the Boston Scale (BBPS) and rated as adequate if &gt;2 in each segment. Patient acceptance, satisfaction, and related symptoms will be also recorded.</detailed_description>
