The first part included demographic data (age, marÂ¬ital status and Body Max Index) and the second part included a checklist to record the patient's vital signs (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, and pulse rate). All measurements were conducted in same time in both groups as follow: before the intervention (the whole massage therapy), one hour, two hours, three hours, and four hours.
