	<brief_summary>DelAgua Health and Development, Manna Energy and the Rwanda Ministry of Health are collaborating on a project financed by carbon credits that will distribute household-based water filters and high-efficiency cook stoves to approximately 600,000 households in Rwanda. Prior to the full roll out of the campaign, the implementers are conducting research in connection with a distribution among 2000 households in western Rwanda. The objective of this matched cohort study (Phase 1B)are to investigate whether the filters and stoves delivered in October 2012 are still performing and in use, to determine whether they are associated with reductions in exposure to pathogens from drinking water and stoves, and to assembly information on health and other conditions necessary for the design of a large scale health impact evaluation.</brief_summary>
