	<brief_summary>Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) of pancreatic stones has been described as an effective approach for stone drainage and pain relief, and general or epidural anesthesia has been reported for such procedure. Single infusion of remifentanil has been described in ESWL of urinary stones, but it has never been described in ESWL of pancreatic stones. Moreover, single infusion of remifentanil might induce several complications, such as postoperative nausea and vomiting. The investigators attended to investigated whether combination of flurbiprofen with remifentanil reduced remifentanil dose and attenuated the complications.</brief_summary>
