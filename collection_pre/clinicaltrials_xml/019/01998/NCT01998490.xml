	<brief_summary>The overall research aim of this study is to investigate changes in measures related to the risk of falls among elderly with dementia participating in animal-assisted or robot-assisted interventions. In addition the study will investigate how knowledge transfer occurs among involved health personnel, and how knowledge is refined and transformed as practical competence. The design will be a prospective and cluster randomized multicenter trial, but mixed-methods will be used to target different outcomes. The study population will be elderly (age above 65) at nursing homes diagnosed with dementia, or having a cognitive deficit. The intervention will consist of 30 minutes sessions with animal-assisted activity or robot-assisted activity two times a week for 12 weeks in groups of 4-6 participants. Control groups will receive treatment as usual. Research questions: 1. Is there an effect in use of ordinary and optional medication among elderly persons with dementia at nursing homes participating in animal-assisted or robot-assisted interventions compared to a control group? 2. Is there an effect on agitation, restlessness and depression among elderly persons with dementia at nursing homes participating in animal-assisted or robot-assisted interventions compared to a control group? 3. Is there an effect on social interaction, activeness and wellbeing among elderly persons with dementia at nursing homes participating in animal-assisted or robot-assisted interventions compared to a control group?</brief_summary>
