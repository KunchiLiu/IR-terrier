	<brief_summary>This study aims to investigate genetic causes of early childhood obesity. We will enroll children with severe early onset obesity (BMI &gt; 99th percentile) diagnosed prior to 6 years of age. We will ask questions about their health, eating behavior and perform a brief physical examination. We will collect saliva or blood to perform genetic testing. We will also invite family members to participate in the genetic study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Investigate Genetic Causes of Severe Early Childhood Onset Obesity.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a clinical and genomic study designed to investigate monogenic causes of severe early childhood obesity. Subjects with severe early onset obesity attending clinics at Boston Children's Hospital will be identified by screening of the clinical database. These subjects will be invited to participate in the study. After obtaining informed consent, we will obtain history on the proband and the family. We will perform a brief examination and collect genetic material. Targeted sequencing of genes associated with monogenic and syndromic forms of obesity will be performed using next-generation sequencing at Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA. In selected individuals with favorable family history, full exome sequencing will be performed. Functional analysis of newly identified variants will be performed where possible.</detailed_description>
