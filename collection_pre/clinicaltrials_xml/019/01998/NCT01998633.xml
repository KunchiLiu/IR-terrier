	<brief_summary>HLH, HLH-related disorders, Chronic Granulomatous (CGD), HIGM1, Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, and X-linked inheritance (IPEX) and severe LAD-I represent primary immune disorders that are typically fatal without Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (HCT). However, transplant is often complicated by inflammation, infection and other co-morbidities. In addition, these disorders have been shown to be cured with partial chimerism, making them an ideal target for the use of reduced intensity approaches, where a portion of patients may not achieve full donor chimerism, but instead achieve stable mixed chimerism. Reduced-intensity conditioning strategies have demonstrated improved survival with decreased Treatment Related Mortality (TRM) in institutional series for patients with HLH (Cooper et al., 2006; Marsh et al., 2010; Marsh et al., 2011). However, graft loss and unstable chimerism remain challenges. An institutional case series from Cincinnati Children's Hospital demonstrated full or high-level chimerism and improved durable engraftment using intermediate (Day -14) timing alemtuzumab (Marsh et al., 2013b). This study aims to test the efficacy of the Intermediate RIC strategy in a prospective multi-center study including HLH as well as other primary immunodeficiencies where allogeneic transplant with RIC has been shown to be feasible and stable chimerism is curative.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reduced Intensity Conditioning for Hemophagocytic Syndromes or Selected Primary Immune Deficiencies (BMT CTN 1204)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal of this Phase II clinical trial is to determine the one-year overall survival of patients treated for immune deficiencies including HLH, HLH-like disorders, CGD, HIGM1, IPEX syndrome, and severe LAD-I with Matched Related Donor (MRD)/ Matched Unrelated Donor (MUD) bone marrow transplant using a reduced-intensity conditioning strategy including intermediate-timing of alemtuzumab. The donor choice is an unaffected related bone marrow donor who is a 6/6 match at HLA-A, -B (intermediate or higher resolution) and -DRB1 (at high resolution using DNA-based typing) OR a 7/8 or 8/8 match for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, -B, -C and -DRB1 (at high resolution using DNA-based typing), OR an unrelated bone marrow donor who is a 7/8 or 8/8 match at HLA-A, -B, -C and -DRB1 (at high resolution using DNA-based typing). The transplant conditioning regimen will include fludarabine, melphalan, and alemtuzumab starting at Day -14 (Flu/Mel/Alem). Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) prophylaxis will consist of cyclosporine and corticosteroids through engraftment. Post-transplant supportive care will include infection surveillance and prophylaxis, and disease-specific supportive care.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1. Patient is ≥ 3 months and ≤ 45 years of age at time of enrollment. 2. Meets criteria for one of the following immune disorders (2A2F) requiring HCT: 2A. HLH or related disorder with indication for HCT [a. Inherited gene mutation associated with HLH: PRF1, UNC13D (MUNC132), STXBP2 (MUNC182), STX11, RAB27A (Griscelli syndrome, type 2), SH2D1A (XLP1), XIAP (XLP2), LYST (ChediakHigashi syndrome) OR b. Meets clinical criteria for HLH, refractory to therapy according to HLH94 or HLH2004 (dexamethasone/etoposide), or recurrent episodes of hyperinflammation OR c. Meets clinical criteria for HLH, without identified gene defects, with affected sibling OR decreased or absent NK cell function at the last evaluation, OR a history of CNS inflammation as evidenced by pleocytosis in CSF or MRI evidence of hyperinflammation in the CNS] 2B. CAEBV: Patients with chronic EBV infection (CAEBV) with or without associated lymphoma (in complete remission) or active HLH. Note that this diagnosis is distinct from posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder/ EBVassociated lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD/LPD). [Patients must meet all of the following: a. Severe progressive illness, usually with fever, lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly that either began as primary EBV infection or was associated with markedly elevated antibody titers to EBV viral capsid antibody (≥ 1:5120) or early antigen (≥ 1:640), or markedly elevated EBV DNA in the blood; AND b. Infiltration of tissues (e.g., lymph nodes, liver, lungs, CNS, bone marrow, eye, skin) with lymphocytes; AND c. Elevated EBV DNA, RNA or proteins in affected tissues; AND d. The absence of HIV or posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder] 2C. Chronic granulomatous disease with indication for HCT [a. Oxidative burst &lt; 10% normal with dihydrorhodamine (DHR) assay AND b. Documented CGD mutation(s) in gp91phox, p47phox, p67phox, p22phox or p40phox AND c. Severe disease as evidenced by one or more of the following: history of one or more potentially lifethreatening infections; inflammatory bowel disease; failure to thrive with height &lt;10% for age (unless parent(s) height &lt;10%); or autoimmune complication felt to be linked to CGD] 2D. Xlinked Hyper IgM Syndrome (HIGM1) [a. Decreased serum IgG (more than 2 standard deviations below normal for age) AND b.
