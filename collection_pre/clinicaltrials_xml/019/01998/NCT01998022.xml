	<brief_summary>Numerous studies highlight the insufficiency of blood pressure control in treated hypertensive population [1]. As shown in the MONICA study, increased cardiovascular mortality is found in Alsace compared to other french regions. The incidence and prevalence of diabetes and obesity are likely explanatory factors leading to this excess mortality [2]. Furthermore, the incidence and prevalence of alsacian patients with end-stage renal failure (ESRD) is also higher than the national average. The high prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and obesity in this population is also probably responsible for the high prevalence of ESRD [3]. Opportunities to prevent the progression of kidney disease involve an optimal control of treatable evolutionary factors. Beyond control of diabetes and obesity, optimization of blood pressure control are an important factor to consider, as national and international guidelines recommend lower blood pressure targets in this population [4]. Knowledge of the disease and treatment goals are a key component of hypertensive patient management. Studies have shown that the knowledge of hypertensive disease and therapeutic targets were correlated with treatment compliance and with the rate of blood pressure control [5]. Patient education and participation of non-medical actors (nurses, pharmacists, â€¦) are likely to improve the management and treatment compliance of these patients [6]. To our knowledge, no investigation has been performed in our region to determine the epidemiological characteristics, the knowledge level and blood pressure control in the population of hypertensive patients. The main objectives of this observational study are to evaluate, in a treated hypertensive population: the knowledge level of the blood pressure treatment goals, the impact of patient knowledge on this blood pressure control, the potential impact of the patient's comorbidities on his blood pressure control. Such a study should provide the basis for the feasibility of a large survey.</brief_summary>
