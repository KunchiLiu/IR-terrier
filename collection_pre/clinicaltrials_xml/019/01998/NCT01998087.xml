	<brief_summary>In Croatia, between 95% and 99% of mothers initiate breastfeeding, but by 3 months a third have stopped, and by six months only half are still providing any human milk for their babies. Exclusive breastfeeding rates are even lower, with only about 9% of Croatian mothers exclusively breastfeeding at 6 months, despite the WHO recommendation of 6 months of exclusive breastfeeding. Currently, in Croatia, no breastfeeding information or other pregnancy and parenting related written information is routinely provided to expectant couples. In our study we would like to find out whether providing written breastfeeding information in pregnancy and breastfeeding focused support phone calls during pregnancy and after the birth of the baby result in better outcomes than providing general pregnancy/parenting information and support phone calls. This will be tested by randomising women, attending their primary health care provider for routine antenatal visits between 20 and 32 weeks, to an intervention focused on promoting and supporting breastfeeding, to an intervention focused on general pregnancy and parenting issues, and to a non-intervention control group. Women will be followed-up for 6 months after the birth of their baby and data will be collected at 3 and 6 months on breastfeeding rates, breastfeeding self-efficacy, breastfeeding difficulties, social support and attitudes toward infant feeding.</brief_summary>
