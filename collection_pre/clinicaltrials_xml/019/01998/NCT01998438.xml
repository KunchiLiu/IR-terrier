	<brief_summary>Tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic drug, is wildly used in cardiac surgeries to decrease perioperative bleeding and allogenic transfusion. But the optimum dose of tranexamic acid is still unknown. We use three different doses to find which is the optimum dose of tranexamic acid in cardiopulmonary bypass cardiac surgery.</brief_summary>
