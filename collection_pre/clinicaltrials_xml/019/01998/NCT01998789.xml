	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an everolimus conversion (EVR) protocol as compared to the standard tacrolimus (TAC) based protocol in liver transplant recipients, as determined by renal function, rejection rates, and progression to fibrosis (in HCV positive subjects). Additionally, safety profile and tolerability of these regimens will be assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Everolimus Post Orthotopic Liver Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The mainstay of maintenance immunosuppression post-transplantation includes a calcineurin inhibitor, either cyclosporine or tacrolimus. The introduction of calcineurin inhibitors led to a significant improvement in graft and patient outcomes post solid organ transplantation. However, one of the severe limitations of this class of drugs, is its associated nephrotoxicity. Data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients reveal that the incidence of stage 4 chronic kidney disease or stage 5 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) after Orthotopic Liver Transplantation (OLT) at 1, 3, and 5 years is 8%, 14%, and 18%, respectively, increasing to approximately 25% by 10 years after transplantation.Furthermore, renal dysfunction is associated with a four-fold increase in patient mortality post solid organ transplantation. Several calcineurin inhibitor sparing and minimizing regimens have been studied. Most recently, in the phase III, randomized study in de novo liver transplant recipients,demonstrated significantly improved renal function in the tacrolimus minimization arm (everolimus plus tacrolimus one year post transplant.In fact superior renal function was achieved with the tacrolimus minimization arm one month after randomization and was maintained to Month 12. With this pilot study, we aim to compare the efficacy of the standard immunosupression post liver transplant with Tacrolimus and Mycophenolic acid (Myfortic)with calcineurin sparing regimen using the combination of everolimus and enteric coated mycophenolic acid, as determined by the estimated Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at one year post transplant, with acceptable rates of biopsy proven rejection.</detailed_description>
