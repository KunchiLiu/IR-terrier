	<brief_summary>This is an open label, phase I/IIa, 3 x 3 dose escalation study with an initial phase I followed by a disease focused phase II. The primary objective of the phase I is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of the combinations of oral 5-azacitidine and romidepsin in patients with lymphoma. The safety and toxicity of this combination will be evaluated throughout the entire study. If the combination of oral 5-azacitidine and romidepsin is found to be feasible and an MTD is established, the phase II part of the study will be initiated. Phase II will consist of a 2 stage design of the combination of oral 5-azacitidine and romidepsin for patients with relapsed or refractory T-cell lymphomas.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Romidepsin Plus Oral 5-Azacitidine in Relapsed/Refractory Lymphoid Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will receive oral 5-azacitidine and romidepsin, administered as follows: oral 5-azacitidine from Days 1-14 (Dose cohorts -1 to 5) or Days 1-21 (Dose cohort 6); and romidepsin administered intravenously on Days 8 (Dose cohorts 1-4) of a 28 day cycle, and Day 22 (Dose cohorts 5 and 6) of a 35 day cycle. Cohorts of 3 patients will be enrolled sequentially as outlined in the dose escalation scheme. Once the MTD is reached the Phase II part of the protocol will be initiated in patients with T-Cell Lymphoma.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Phase I: Histologically confirmed relapsed or refractory nonHodgkin lymphoma or Hodgkin lymphoma (WHO criteria), with no accepted curative options. Phase II: Relapsed or refractory Tcell lymphoma, including patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement or lymphomatous meningitis are allowed on study. Relapsed or refractory disease following frontline chemotherapy. No upper limit for the number of prior therapies. Patients may have relapsed after prior autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant. Evaluable Disease in the Phase I, and measurable disease for the Phase II. Age &gt; or = 18 years. ECOG performance status &lt; or = 2. Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function. Negative urine or serum pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential. All females of childbearing potential must use an effective barrier method of contraception during the treatment period and for at least 1 month thereafter. Male subjects should use a barrier method of contraception during the treatment period and for at least 3 months thereafter. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Prior Therapy Exposure to chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 2 weeks earlier. Systemic steroids that have not been stabilized ( ≥ 5 days) to the equivalent of ≤10 mg/day prednisone prior to the start of the study drugs. No other concurrent investigational agents are allowed. History of allergic reactions to Oral 5azacitidine or Romidepsin. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Pregnant women. Nursing women. Active concurrent malignancy (except nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix). If there is a history of prior malignancy, the patient must be diseasefree for ≥ 3 years. Patients known to be Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)positive. Patients with active hepatitis A, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C infection. Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors. Any known cardiac abnormalities.</criteria>
