	<brief_summary>The investigators will collect fibrocytes (CD45+Col-1+) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The investigators hypothesize that patients with NSCLC experience expansion of immunosuppressive fibrocytes, which are predicted to augment tumor growth by mediating immune escape in NSCLC patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Circulating Fibrocytes in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fibrocytes have been described in both mice and humans, where they bear a hematopoietic progenitor phenotype (CD45+Col-1+). Fibrocytes have previously been described in murine cancer, implicated as mediators of tumor immune escape. In this study, the investigators will collect fibrocytes including CD45+Col-1+ expression. The cells express indoleamine oxidase, which is primarily responsible for their immunosuppressive properties. The investigators hypothesize that patients with non-small cell lung cancer experience expansion of immunosuppressive fibrocytes, which are predicted to augment tumor growth by mediating immune escape in non-small cell lung cancer patients.</detailed_description>
