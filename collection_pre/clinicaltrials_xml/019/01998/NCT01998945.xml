	<brief_summary>We will compare two programs that are designed to help older adults who have had fall injuries manage anxiety and improve their level of functioning. We expect that both programs will provide some benefit, but that one will promote better management.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Back on My Feet: Emotional Recovery From Fall Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fall accidents can be frightening experiences that cause life-changing injuries. Each year, millions of older Americans who fall may develop disabling anxiety and related distress, functional limitations, and poor health. Our previous study adapted a well-researched anxiety treatment, Exposure-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (ET), for older adults diagnosed with full posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), subsyndromal PTSD, or fear of falling after fall injury. The approach was well-accepted by subjects and they reported both reductions in anxiety and having more fully returned to normal living immediately after the treatment and then three months later. The purpose of this pilot study is to compare ET to another active treatment, Relaxation Training (RT). Both study treatments will consist of eight home-based sessions. ET consists of education about anxiety, relaxation training, managing distressing thoughts, healthy routine, and confronting avoided memories and situations. RT consists of techniques to ease bodily tension. Twenty-four subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups. The study will compare how subjects in each group improve on outcomes such as diagnosis, anxiety severity, and quality of life over the course of treatment, and at three- and six-month follow-up. The findings will provide the basis for larger future studies.</detailed_description>
