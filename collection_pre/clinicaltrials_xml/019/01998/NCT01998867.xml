	<brief_summary>1. To develop a database containing matched information from dynamic tests of postprandial glycemic control (OGTT or MMTT), results of a broad panel of fasting biomarkers, and clinical information related to diabetes risk obtain through subject interview. 2. To use the database to identify fasting biomarkers and associated algorithms to best predict parameters derived from dynamic tests (OGTT or MMTT) such as Insulin Glucose Tolerance (IGT), impaired first phase insulin response, etc., controlling for clinical information such as current medication use.</brief_summary>
