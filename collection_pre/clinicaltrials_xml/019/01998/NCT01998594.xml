	<brief_title>Use of FlexHD as Post Trapeziectomy Spacer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be followed for 12 months post basilar joint arthroplasty procedure with an interposition arthroplasty technique using a spacer constructed from human acellular matrix (HADM). Their postoperative DASH scores, grip strength, pinch strength, pain scale scores, quality of life and trapezial space on radiographs are compared to their preoperative scores. Study visits will coincide with standard clinical course visits including: Pre-operative visits and follow-up visits at week 6, month 6, and year 1 post-operatively.</detailed_description>
