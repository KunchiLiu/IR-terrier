The study consists of 4 phases: screening phase, treatment phase, recovery phase and follow-up phase. Screening for eligible participants will be performed within 14 days before administration of the study drug. The safety and tolerability of study drug will be evaluated by physical examinations, electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse events (AEs) according to the Time and Events Schedule. Participants safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
