	<brief_title>The Discovery of the Double Sphincter in Gallbladder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To contrast the recurrence rate of gallstones between patients with gallbladder double sphincter and patients with general gallbladder sphincter who underwent the treatment of cholecystolithiasis by minimally invasive cholecystolithotomy with gallbladder reservation. Method:Patients with gallbladder double sphincter and patients with general gallbladder sphincter who underwent the treatment of cholecystolithiasis by minimally invasive cholecystolithotomy with gallbladder reservation in The Affiliated Hospital of Guiyang Medical College from May 2012 to December 2015. We collect these patients' bile during surgery.Patients with gallbladder double sphincter as trial group, patients with general gallbladder sphincter as control group.the overall follow-up period is 3 years. Then the investigators statistically analyze improvement of cholecystolithiasis symptoms, thickness of gall bladder wall, the gallbladder function and the rate of the recurrence of cholesterol gallstone in 2 groups.we also analysis of the genetic differences from bile between two groups.</detailed_description>
