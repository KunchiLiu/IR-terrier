	<brief_summary>The specific objective of this study is: - Evaluate and quantify colorimetric changes in young permanent anterior teeth; - Compare the efficiency and efficacy of three gels used for self-administered home whitening and an over the counter whitening strip; - Analyze the increase in dental sensitivity in adolescent patients submitted to home whitening with 6% and 7.5% hydrogen peroxide with and without the addition of calcium (whitening strips); - Assess sensitivity, comfort and acceptance of whitening strips by patients; - Assess patient satisfaction with the method and material used for home whitening.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of the proposed controlled clinical trial will be to assess colorimetric changes and increased dental sensitivity in adolescent patients submitted to tooth whitening with 6% and 7.5% hydrogen peroxide using home kits with whitening strips. Adolescents aged 12 to 20 years will be allocated to different groups based on treatment (n = 16 per group): 1) placebo; 2) 6.0% hydrogen peroxide (White Class with calcium - FGM); 3) 7.5% hydrogen peroxide (White Class with calcium - FGM); and 4) 7.5% hydrogen peroxide (Oral B 3D White - Oral-B). After the whitening procedures, the participants will be evaluated using a visual analogue scale for tooth sensitivity and digital spectrophotometry for the measurement of changes in color.</detailed_description>
