	<detailed_description>Results: The improvement in the signs of recovery for physical and mood symptoms in the patient training intervention group were seen (p &lt; 0.05). The score of quality of life had significantly improved in the two groups (Mean difference was 9.31Â±3.03 and P&lt;0.003). This improvement was significantly higher in the patient training intervention group (P=0.008). After adjustment for education level, the score of quality of life in patient training intervention group had a higher improvement, but the difference between the two groups was not significant (P = 0.1). Conclusions: This study showed the important role of training and the patients' educational level on better treatments. The appropriate training in the patient could create a change in the treatment process and has a better effect on quality of life.</detailed_description>
