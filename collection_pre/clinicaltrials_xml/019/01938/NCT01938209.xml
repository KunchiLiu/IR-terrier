	<brief_title>A Comparison of Seated Thoracic Manipulation and Targeted Supine Thoracic Manipulation on Cervical Flexion Motion and Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of seated thoracic manipulation versus targeted supine thoracic manipulation on cervical spine pain and flexion range of motion. There is evidence that thoracic spine manipulation is an effective treatment for patients with cervical spine pain. This evidence includes a variety of techniques to manipulate the thoracic spine. While each of them is effective, no research has compared techniques to determine which produces the best outcomes. METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with cervical spine pain were randomly assigned to either a seated thoracic manipulation or targeted supine thoracic manipulation group. Pain and flexion range of motion measures were taken before and after the intervention.</detailed_description>
