	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to examine whether the chronic administration during 12 weeks of polyphenols contained in Red Grape Cells (RGC) powder has an effect on mRNA expression of SIRT1 and Clock Genes, on circulating levels of HbA1c, lipids, blood pressure and on postprandial response of glucose, lipids, insulin, C-peptide and GLP-1 in patients with type 2 diabetes .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Red Grape Cells (RGC) Powder in Type 2 Diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating that polyphenols and specially the most investigated Resveratrol contained in the Red Grape Cells (RGC) exert beneficial effects on several markers of metabolic syndrome i.e. antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-atherosclerotic, vasodilator and antihypertensive activity. Many of this beneficial metabolic effects of polyphenols, occurs via activation of sirtuin-1 or silent information regulator-1 gene (SIRT1). This gene is expressed in adipose tissue, muscle, endothelium, peripheral blood cells, etc where it plays a pivotal role in the regulation of Circadian Clock Genes (CCG) involved in glucose lipid metabolism, endothelial function, etc . By activation of SIRT1 and CCG the polyphenols, may influence the circadian secretion of adiponectin, insulin, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and other hormones that influence insulin sensitivity, muscular glucose uptake, NO synthesis, nocturnal hepatic glucose production, lipolisis and endothelial function It was shown in several studies in animals and in clinical studies in subjects with metabolic syndrome that SIRT1 expression and its regulation of the CCG, improves insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle, preventing weight gain; improves pancreatic beta-cell function enhancing insulin secretion and glucose tolerance. It was associated with increased lipolisis in white adipose tissue, decreased glycolysis, increased fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle and with increase Nitric Oxide in the endothelium. Given that polyphenols directly on the clock genes or by enhancing SIRT1 expression appears to counter some of the effects of a high-fat diet, obesity and metabolic syndrome, by protecting against insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia and endothelial dysfunction. It rise the possibility that the polyphenols contained in Red Grape Cells (RGC) by activation SIRT1 may also exert beneficial effects in subjects affected by type 2 diabetes</detailed_description>
