	<brief_title>Genetics of Type 1 Diabetes in Chinese Adolescents and Youth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase 1: Baseline investigation Aims: To explore genetic susceptibility of diabetes in Chinese adolescent and youth. Subjects and Methods: 500 patients under diabetic conditions and sex,age-matched NGR Healthy control(2:1) will be enrolled ,all aged from 14-30 years old. A comprehensive examination including questionnaire, anthropometric measurements, biochemical analysis will be performed in each study participant. Diabetes should be diagnosed according to the WHO 1999 criteria,type 1 or type 2 diabetes diagnosed by clinical features recommended by International Society of Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes ( ISPAD ). Phase 2: Cohort follow-up Aims : To explore the association of genetic backgrounds and clinical characteristics in different types of diabetes in Chinese adolescent and youth. Subjects and Methods: To recruit and follow up 200 newly diagnosed and genotyped patients for 3 years. Questionnaire, anthropometric measurements, biochemical analysis performed respectively at baseline,3,6,12,24,36 months after enrollment.</detailed_description>
