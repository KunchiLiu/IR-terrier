	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the trial is to determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of BI 860585 alone and in combination with exemestane or paclitaxel. To determine the MTDs, patients are entered sequentially into escalating dose cohorts. Secondary objectives are objective response and disease control according to RECIST criteria version 1.1</brief_summary>
