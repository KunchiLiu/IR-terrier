	<brief_summary>To development of clinical assessment technique using multi-radiotracer positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) in prostate cancer - to establish the optimal imaging technique of PET/MR using multiple radioactive tracers for prostate cancer - to establish the imaging biomarker using PET/MR for clinical assessment of prostate cancer and early detection of recurrent prostate cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development of Clinical Assessment Technique Using Multi-radiotracer PET/MR in Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To establish the optimal imaging technique of PET/MR using multiple radioactive tracers for prostate cancer - Recruiting 30 patients with prostate cancer ahead to radical prostatectomy - PET/MR using 18F-choline with dedicated prostate MRI in all patients - PET/MR using 18fluoride(F)-fluorodeoxyglucose(FDG)in all patients after 2-7 days - PET/CT using 18F-FDG in all patient immediate after 18F-FDG PET/MR - outcome assessment: comparison of scan time, image quality, tumor detection rate, standardized uptake values of lesions - establishing optimal imaging technique for prostate PET/MR To establish the imaging biomarker using PET/MR for clinical assessment of prostate cancer - comparison of findings on PET/MR, MRI and PET/CT with pathological mapping after radical prostatectomy - outcome assessment: accuracy of PET/MR for localization and staging of prostate cancer compared with MRI only and PET/CT only To establish the imaging biomarker using PET/MR for early detection of recurrent prostate cancer - Recruiting 15 patients with recurrent prostate cancer treated by surgery, hormone, or radiation therapy - Recruiting 15 patients with treated prostate cancer without recurrence - PET/MR using 18F-choline with dedicated prostate MRI in all patients - PET/MR using 18F-FDG in all patients after 2-7 days - PET/CT using 18F-FDG in all patient immediate after 18F-FDG PET/MR - comparison of findings on PET/MR, MRI, and PET/CT with clinical data in two patient groups with or without recurrent prostate cancer - outcome assessment: accuracy of PET/MR for early detection and localization of recurrent prostate cancer compared with MRI only and PET/CT only</detailed_description>
