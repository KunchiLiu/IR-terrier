	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate photostress recovery with blue light filter clip-on glasses among pseudophakes [ie, subjects in which the natural lens of the eye has been replaced with an artificial lens (intraocular lens) during cataract surgery]. This study will enroll subjects previously implanted with no blue light filter intraocular lenses (IOLs) for at least 3 months.</brief_summary>
