	<brief_summary>Spinal anaesthesia also called spinal block or sub-arachnoid block (SAB), is a form of regional anaesthesia involving injection of a local anaesthetic into the subarachnoid space, generally through a fine needle. There is no generic hyperbaric form of levobupivacaine currently available so we aimed in this study that to find the appropriate concentration of the levobupivacaine which achieves unilateral spinal anesthesia. The potential benefits of this type of anesthesia are less motor blockade and urinary retention, decrease in hospital stay. Therefore, it seems to be suitable for outpatient anesthesia.</brief_summary>
