	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate effect of steady-state (when the amount of drug administered (in a given time period is equal to the amount of drug eliminated in that same period) of simeprevir and daclatasvir on the steady-state pharmacokinetics (what a medication does to the body) of cyclosporine (applicable to Part 1 only) and tacrolimus when administered as a combinational regimen in post-orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) participants with recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b infection and effectiveness of a 24-week treatment regimen containing simeprevir, daclatasvir, and ribavirin (RBV) with respect to the proportion of HCV genotype 1b infected post-OLT participants achieving sustained virologic response 12 weeks after end of treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Pharmacokinetics, Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability, of the Combination of Simeprevir (TMC435), Daclatasvir (BMS-790052), and Ribavirin (RBV) in Patients With Recurrent Chronic Hepatitis C Genotype 1b Infection After Orthotopic Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all participants of this study know the identity of the intervention) and multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites) study. This study will be conducted in 2 parts. Both the parts of the study will consist of screening phase (4 weeks), treatment period (24 weeks), and a post-treatment follow-up (24 weeks). A total of 30 participants will be enrolled in Part 1 and Part 2 of the study. A minimum of 9 participants were planned to receive cyclosporine as stable immunosuppressant therapy and a minimum of 9 participants were planned to receive tacrolimus as stable immunosuppressant therapy during Part 1. All participants will be receiving tacrolimus as stable immunosuppressant therapy during Part 2. In Part 1 of the study, participants with Metavir score of F1-F2, will receive a combination of study drugs - simeprevir, daclatasvir, and ribavirin for 24 weeks. In Part 2 of the study, participants with Metavir score F1-F4 will receive a dosing regimen of study drugs based on the data from Part 1 of the study. Safety evaluations will include assessments of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, urinalysis, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination. The total study duration for each participant will be approximately 52 weeks.</detailed_description>
