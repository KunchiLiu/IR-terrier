	<brief_title>Assessment of Efficacy, Safety and Dosing of Clevidipine in Pediatric Patients Undergoing Surgery (PIONEER)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label study to assess, in a stepwise approach across 4 age cohorts from oldest to youngest (birth to &lt;age 18), the efficacy and safety of clevidipine exposure for a minimum of 30 minutes and up to a maximum of 96 hours in pediatric patients undergoing a surgical procedure with anesthesia for greater than or equal to 1 hour and for whom parenteral intravenous antihypertensive therapy for the management of blood pressure is expected.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Less than 18 years of age Written informed consent obtained before initiation of any studyrelated procedures The enrolling physician determines that the patient will likely require a 15% reduction in BP during the perioperative course Intraarterial line is available for blood pressure monitoring Surgical procedure requiring a minimum of 1 hour of anesthesia, in which IV antihypertensive therapy to control BP for at least 30 minutes is anticipated Administration of an IV or oral antihypertensive agent within 2 hours prior to study drug administration Congenital heart disease described as single ventricle Evidence of liver failure, severe liver disease, pulmonary disease (e.g. uncontrolled asthma), hyperlipidemia, lipoid nephrosis, lipid dysfunction or acute pancreatitis Allergy to soya bean oil or egg lecithin Known to be intolerant to calcium channel blockers Hemophilia or blood coagulation disorders Any serious medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to interfere with study procedures Clinically significant abnormal physical findings at the screening evaluation Any serious surgical or medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to interfere with study procedures or with the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the study drug Patient is terminally ill (death likely to occur within 48 hours) Use of Methylphenidate, calcium channel blockers, Aripiprazole and other atypical anti psychotics and antihypertensives used for BP control within 2 hours prior to study drug initiation Positive serum or urine pregnancy test for any female of child bearing potential Participation in other clinical research studies involving the evaluation of other investigational drugs or devices within 30 days of enrollment Patients who, for any reason, are deemed by the Investigator to be inappropriate for this study Subject is a relative of the Investigator or his/her deputy, research assistant, pharmacist, study coordinator, other staff directly involved in the conduct of the study</criteria>
