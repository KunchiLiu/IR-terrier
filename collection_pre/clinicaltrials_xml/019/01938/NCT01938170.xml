	<brief_summary>This study will examine the feasibility of having parents and caregivers administer FluMist live intranasal vaccine to their children at home outside the traditional medical environment and without the involvement of medical personnel. The study will recruit patients and families that are already eligible to receive the FluMist vaccine. After consent is obtained and vaccine is given to the family, they will go home to administer vaccine to other members within 24 hours. Telephone follow up within 48 hours will confirm that vaccine was given successfully and within 9-12 days to assess patient preferences for giving vaccine at home and if there were any adverse events.</brief_summary>
