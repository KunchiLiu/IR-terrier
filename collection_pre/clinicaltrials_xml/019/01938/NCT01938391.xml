	<brief_summary>IVUS imaging will be utilized to assess performance of the Sponsor's Orbital Atherectomy System (OAS) followed by adjunctive balloon angioplasty (BA) in patients who have symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) occurring in the Superficial Femoral Artery (SFA), Popliteal (POP),and/or Tibioperoneal Trunk (TPT).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tissue Removal Assessment With Ultrasound of THe SFA and Popliteal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a prospective, single-arm (non-randomized), post-market study which will enroll up to 25 subjects. IVUS imaging and angiography will be used to assess procedural outcomes in patients who have symptomatic peripheral artery disease who are treated with the Sponsor's OAS and adjunctive balloon angioplasty. An independent IVUS Core Lab will be used to provide adjudicated analyses for IVUS outcomes. In clinic follow-up visits will be performed to one year (2 weeks, 6 months, 12 months).</detailed_description>
