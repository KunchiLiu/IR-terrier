	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this project is to improve the process for contacting patients that test positive for a sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the emergency department by using text messaging. We believe patients that are contacted by both a phone call and a text message will be reached more often and they will be reached sooner than those that only receive a phone call or only a text message. In addition, patients will be given reminder cards at the time of testing to remind them that they will be contacted within 7 days if they test positive. Half of the reminder cards will have a number to call for test results. We believe patients that receive a card with a number are more likely to be contacted within 7 days.</brief_summary>
