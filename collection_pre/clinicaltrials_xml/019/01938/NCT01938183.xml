	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: metronidazole gel applied topically after periodontal debridement in smokers volunteers could improve clinical parameters when compared to metronidazole tablets + periodontal debridement. Method: 30 smokers with chronic periodontitis were randomly assigned into 3 groups: periodontal debridement combined with 3 g placebo gel; periodontal debridement combined with daily topical application of 3 g metronidazole benzoate gel (15%); and periodontal debridement combined with a daily single dose of 750 mg metronidazole. Clinical parameters evaluated were visible plaque, gingival bleeding, probing pocket depth and relative attachment level.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background. The benefit of adjunctive metronidazole on periodontal procedure in smokers with chronic periodontitis (CP) is uncertain. The authors compared the effect of metronidazole (Mtz) on full-mouth periodontal debridement (PD= 1 hour of ultrasonic calculus/plaque removal) in smokers with CP. Methods. This pilot study involved 30 Individuals (having at least six teeth with a clinical attachment loss of ≥ 5 mm and probing pocket depth (PPD) of ≥5 mm) that were randomly assigned into three groups (n=10): 1) PD plus 3 g of placebo gel daily topical application 2) PD plus daily topical application of 3 g of 15% Mtz benzoate gel; and 3) PD plus a daily single dose of 750 mg Mtz (Flagyl®). Clinical parameters visible plaque index (VPI), gingival bleeding index (GBI), relative attachment level (RAL) and PPD; and the quantitative analysis (real-time PCR) of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia were assessed baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months after PD.</detailed_description>
