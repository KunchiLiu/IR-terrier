	<brief_summary>A study of the cardiovascular outcomes following treatment with ertugliflozin in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and established vascular disease. The main objective of this study is to assess the cardiovascular safety of ertugliflozin. This trial includes a pre-defined glycemic sub-study in participants receiving background insulin with or without metformin, a pre-defined glycemic sub-study in participants receiving background sulfonylurea monotherapy, and a pre-defined sub-study in participants receiving background metformin with sulfonylurea (all fully-enrolled).</brief_summary>
