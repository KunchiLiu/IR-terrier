	<brief_title>Virtual Peer-to-Peer (VP2P) Support Mentoring for Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA): A Pilot RCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this project is to develop and examine the impact of a virtual peer support program on health outcomes and quality of life of adolescents with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis using a waitlist randomized controlled trial. In addition to standard medical care, adolescents in the experimental group will receive a manualized peer mentorship program that will provide modeling and reinforcement by trained young adults aged 16-25 years who have learned to function successfully with their pain. Mentoring sessions consist of 10 sessions of 30-45 minute Skype calls over 8 weeks. Feasibility of the program will be measured in addition to quality of life, physical and emotional symptoms, pain coping, self-efficacy, social support, and self-management skills.</detailed_description>
