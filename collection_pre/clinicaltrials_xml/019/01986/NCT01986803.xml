	<brief_summary>This is a Prospective, randomized (1:1), active control, single-blind, non-inferiority, European multicenter clinical trial. The primary objective of this study is to assess the neointimal healing score (as evaluated by intra-coronary OFDI) in patients with ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) and treated with Abbott Vascular ABSORB everolimus eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) at 6 months follow-up by comparing with a metallic drug eluting stent (XIENCE). Furthermore, the safety and feasibility of implanting ABSORB BVS in patients with STEMI is assessed. It is hypothesized that acutely and at 6 months follow-up implantation of the ABSORB fully bioresorbable everolimus-eluting scaffold is at least as safe as implantation of metallic drug-eluting stent, and that at late follow-up the ABSORB scaffold could improve the arterial healing process and potentially reduce late stent thrombosis in patients presenting with STEMI. This is a preparatory trial in anticipation of a major outcome study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A total of 190 patients will be included in this trial, at 8-10 European sites. The primary endpoint is arterial healing at 6 month follow up. To assess the arterial healing, at 6 months follow-up all patients will undergo angiographic follow-up with OFDI investigation. To score the arterial healing, a Healing Score is used.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subject must be at least 18 years of age; 2. Primary PCI within 24 hours of symptom onset; 3. STsegment elevation of &gt; 1mm in &gt; 2 contiguous leads, or (presumably new) left bundle branch block, or true posterior MI with ST depression of &gt;1mm in &gt;2 contiguous anterior leads; 4. Presence of at least one acute infarct artery target vessel with one or more coronary artery stenoses in a native coronary artery within planned device deployment segment (Dmax) by visual estimation of ≥ 2.5 mm and ≤ 3.8 mm; 5. Subject agrees to not participate in any other investigational or invasive clinical study for a period of 6 months following the index procedure. 1. Inability to provide informed consent; 2. Known pregnancy at time of randomization. Female who is breastfeeding at time of randomization; 3. Known intolerance to aspirin, heparin, PLLA (poly(Llactic acid), everolimus, contrast material; 4. Cardiogenic Shock; 5. Unprotected left main coronary artery stenosis; 6. Distal occlusion of target vessel; 7. Acute myocardial infarction secondary to stent thrombosis; 8. Mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction; 9. Severe tortuous, calcified or angulated coronary anatomy of the study vessel that in the opinion of the investigator would result in suboptimal imaging or excessive risk of complication from placement of an OFDI catheter; 10. Fibrinolysis prior to PCI; 11. Active bleeding or coagulopathy or patients at chronic anticoagulation therapy; 12. Subject is currently participating in another clinical trial that has not yet completed its primary endpoint.</criteria>
