	<brief_title>Recurrence Following CT-guided Drainage of 1st Episode Hinchey II Diverticulitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will test the feasibility of randomizing patients with a first episode of diverticulitis with abscess defined by CT scan amenable to drainage to observation or elective sigmoid resection. The study will also gather preliminary data on relative safety of surgery and observation.</detailed_description>
