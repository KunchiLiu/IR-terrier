	<detailed_description>Participants will be asked to undergo three brain-imaging scans throughout the course of the study. Once they are deemed eligible for participation based on two assessment visits, they will be scheduled for their baseline test day. On this they, they will be asked to under a series of cognitive tests following by a brain-imaging scan. They will then take the first dose of either the LDX or placebo, wait for 3 hours and then undergo another brain-imaging scan to assess acute changes to memory/cognition due to the study drug. They will then come in for three 30-minute check-in visits during weeks 2, 4 and 6 on the study drug. They will be asked to undergo a final scan and series of cognitive tasks during weeks 8-10 on the study drug. They will then be discharged from active study participation. All participants, regardless of randomization, will be offered a consultation with the study MD and optional prescription for 4-weeks of treatment with LDX.</detailed_description>
