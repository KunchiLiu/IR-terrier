	<brief_summary>High-protein meals have previously been shown to acutely reduce appetite and energy intake. More recently, meals higher in calcium have also been shown to increase feelings of fullness, circulating insulin and intestinal peptide concentrations and reduce appetite sensations. This study aims to assess whether calcium and protein act synergistically to acutely influence appetite and energy intake.</brief_summary>
