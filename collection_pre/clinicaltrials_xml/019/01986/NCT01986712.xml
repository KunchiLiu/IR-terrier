	<brief_title>A Study to Compare Quality of Life and Compliance in Patients Receiving High-dose Interferon Versus Pegylated Interferon in Patients With Surgically Resected Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is: â€¢ To evaluate compliance with the administration of standard HDI versus PEG IFN for patients with melanoma in need of adjuvant therapy The secondary objectives of this study are: - To compare the convenience and satisfaction with chemotherapy for patients on standard HDI versus PEG IFN using a chemotherapy convenience and satisfaction questionnaire (CCSQ) and to evaluate the treatment-related side effects that may impact the patient's HRQOL using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy of Biologic Response Modifier (FACT BRM) - To assess the frequency of Grade 3 and 4 toxicities, according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) for patients on standard HDI versus PEG IFN - To examine reasons for patients' choice of treatment with HDI versus PEG IFN, for those cases in which patients are presented with a choice of either treatment option - To assess Health Resource Utilization on both arms of the study</detailed_description>
