	<brief_summary>Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of dental biofilm removal by brushing with and without conventional toothpaste. Settings and Design: Twenty-four students aged 17 to 28 years old participated in this randomized clinical trial. Materials and Methods: Quadrants 1-3 or 2-4 were randomly allocated to the test group (brushing without dentifrice) or control group (brushing with dentifrice). After 72 hours of cessation of oral hygiene, Quigley &amp; Hein (Turesky) plaque index was assessed before and after brushing by a calibrated and blind examiner. Overtime and intergroup comparisons were performed by paired sample t test.</brief_summary>
