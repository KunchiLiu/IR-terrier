	<brief_title>Essential Fatty Acid Status &amp; Immune Function in Parenteral Nutrition Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients, who suffer from severe chronic intestinal failure and whose nutritional intake cannot be met by oral food intake, have as their final option total parenteral nutrition, which contains all necessary macro- and micronutrients. Lipid emulsions are essential for these patients as they are a source of non glucose fuel calories, and they contain (essential) fatty acids which are important as structural component for many cells in the human body. Home parenteral nutrition patients are at risk for essential fatty acid deficiency. Data are lacking that indicate the optimal amount of essential fatty acids required for these patients. The latter seems especially relevant for patients receiving lipid prescriptions which are low in essential fatty acids, like ClinOleic®. Long-term parenteral nutrition dependent patients successfully use ClinOleic®. It is however unknown whether these patient remain to have an adequate essential fatty acid status in the long run.</detailed_description>
