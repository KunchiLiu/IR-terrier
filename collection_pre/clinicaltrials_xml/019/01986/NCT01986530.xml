	<brief_summary>Irisin, a newly discovered myokine induced in exercise, has potential effects in stimulating adipose tissue browning, fighting obesity and diabetes. No prior study has reported on the role of circulating irisin in healthy individuals in correlation with lean and fat body mass. Furthermore, the circadian and seasonal variation of irisin is largely unknown.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main aims of this prospective study will be to investigate: 1) circulating irisin levels in healthy, young men and women according to their lean and fat mass; 2) the circadian variations of irisin levels; 3) the seasonal variations of irisin levels.</detailed_description>
