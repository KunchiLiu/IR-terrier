	<criteria>Primary diagnosis: pharyngitis confirmed by a TonsilloPharyngitis Assessment ≥ 5 Complaint of sore throat with an onset ≤ 4 days prior to randomization Have at least one symptom of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) on the URTI Questionnaire (e.g., sore throat, runny nose, cough, fever) Have moderate or severe sore throat pain on the Throat Pain Scale Have a baseline Sore Throat Scale (STS) ≥ 6 If the patient is a female of childbearing potential, she has been using effective contraception since the last date of menses and is not breastfeeding or lactating. She is also willing to take adequate contraceptive precautions through 24 hours after the completion of the study. If the patient is a female of childbearing potential, the patient must have a negative urine pregnancy test (UPT) result (indicating "not pregnant") obtained on the day of scheduled randomization, prior to the designated time of randomization The patient is willing to remain at the study centre for 3 hours after receiving the dose of study medication During the 3hour evaluation of the study medication lozenge at the site, the patient is willing to take "nothing by mouth" (e.g., no smoking, food, candy, lozenges, chewing gum, liquids). Known allergy and/or hypersensitivity to aspirin or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or any other inactive ingredients such as honey, lemon flavor, menthol, or sucrose. History of an upper gastrointestinal ulcer within the past 60 days, current clinically significant upper gastrointestinal complaints, or current regular use (≥ 3 times in the previous week) of any medication for upper gastrointestinal symptoms, including antacids, H2 blockers, proton pump inhibitors or sucralfate History of any hepatic disease or renal dysfunction Other severe acute or chronic medical condition that may increase the risk associated with study participation or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study. History of chronic analgesic use (≥ 3 times per week over the prior 4 weeks) Use of an antibiotic for an acute disease within the previous 24 hours before randomization. (Chronic antibiotic use, such as for acne, is acceptable.) Use of any quinolone antibiotic such as ciprofloxacin or nalidixic acid within the past week or concurrently is specifically prohibited. Use of mifepristone in the 12 days prior to the screening visit Use of inhaled therapy (e.g., inhaled steroids or βagonists, such as Ventolin) on an acute basis for disease exacerbation in the week prior to the screening visit Use of any immediate release analgesic within 4 hours preceding administration of the study medication. Use of any sustained release analgesic within 12 hours preceding administration of the study medication. Use of any "cold medication" (i.e. decongestants, antihistamines, expectorants, antitussives) within 4 hours preceding administration of the dose of study medication. Use of any throat lozenge, throat spray, cough drop, or mentholcontaining product within 2 hours preceding administration of the study medication Consumption of any caffeinecontaining beverage (e.g., coffee, tea, hot chocolate, caffeinated soft drinks) within 5 minutes preceding administration of the study medication. Any evidence of mouthbreathing (which could worsen sore throat pain). Coughing that causes throat discomfort or any active physical disease (such as bronchopneumonia) which could compromise respiratory function and worsen a sore throat Unable in the opinion of the Investigator to comply fully with the study requirements</criteria>
