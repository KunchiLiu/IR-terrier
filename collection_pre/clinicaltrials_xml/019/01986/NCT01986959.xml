	<brief_summary>Background: There is controversy regarding the postoperative effects of periodontal dressing on the periodontium, pain and discomfort. The aim of the present study was to compare postoperative pain following surgical crown lengthening with and without the use of periodontal dressing. Material and Methods: A blind, randomized, clinical trial was carried out with 36 patients. Following surgical crown lengthening, the individuals were randomly allocated to the periodontal dressing group (PDG) and control group (CG - non-placement of periodontal dressing). Pain and discomfort were analyzed using a visual analog scale (VAS), verbal scale (VS) and the number of analgesics consumed in seven days postoperatively. Postoperative infection, stability of the gingival margin and type of healing were also evaluated.</brief_summary>
