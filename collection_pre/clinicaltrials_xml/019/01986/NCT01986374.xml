	<brief_title>Injection of Hormone to Enhance Implantation in Embryo Transfer After IVF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is in pilot phase, uncontrolled. The risks appear to be minimal and there are conflicting new reports being announced. A small amount of fluid with HCG is injected into the uterus. HCG is a potent signal to the uterus for preparation for implantation. This is not a funded study. Three published studies suggest the approach is valid; one refutes the concept.</detailed_description>
