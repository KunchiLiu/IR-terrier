History of orthostatic hypotension or orthostatic hypotension present at the screening visit, defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure greater than 20 mm Hg and a drop in diastolic blood pressure greater than 10 mm Hg with a change in position from supine to standing 7. A history of erectile dysfunction or a prostatectomy 8. Any surgical or medical condition that may interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the test article 9. Acute disease state (eg, nausea, vomiting, fever, or diarrhea) within 7 days before study Day 1 10. History of drug abuse within 1 year before study Day 1 11. History of alcoholism within 1 year before study Day 1, admitted alcohol abuse, or average consumption of more than 2 standard units of alcohol per day (a standard unit equals 12 ounces of beer, 1Â½ ounces of 80proof alcohol, or 6 ounces of wine) 12.
