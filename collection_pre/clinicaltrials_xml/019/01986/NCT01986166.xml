	<brief_summary>This open-label, multicenter, global Phase Ib study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of intravenous (IV) dosing of MEHD7945A in combination with oral dosing of cobimetinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that carry a Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (KRAS) mutation and for which standard therapies do not exist, have proven ineffective or intolerable or are considered inappropriate. The study comprises a dose-escalation (Stage 1) and an indication-specific cohort expansion stage (Stage 2).</brief_summary>
