	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies short-infusion ziv-aflibercept in treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer receiving combination chemotherapy. Ziv-aflibercept may stop the growth of colorectal cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving the drug over a shorter infusion time may result in improved efficiency and patient satisfaction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short-Infusion Ziv-aflibercept in Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Receiving Combination Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the feasibility of a shorter infusion of 30 minutes and 15 minutes of standard dose ziv-aflibercept when combined with FOLFIRI (folinic acid [leucovorin calcium], fluorouracil, and irinotecan [irinotecan hydrochloride]) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Describe the institutional safety experience with this combination using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4 for toxicity grading. OUTLINE: Patients receive ziv-aflibercept intravenously (IV) over 15-30 minutes followed by FOLFIFRI chemotherapy comprising leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes, and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.</detailed_description>
