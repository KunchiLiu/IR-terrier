	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin), 3-period, 3-way crossover thorough QT study, which includes a Screening Period, Treatment Periods (1 through 3), and a Follow-up Visit. Subjects will be confined to the investigational site for 4 nights/3 days during Period 1 and for 3 nights/2 days during Periods 2 and 3. There will be a minimum of a 14 day washout between treatments.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Thorough QT/QTc Study to Evaluate the Effects of an Intravenous Infusion of Eravacycline (TP-434) on Cardiac Repolarization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each of the following treatments will be evaluated on Day 1 of each period in a crossover fashion. The IV eravacycline (TP-434) and IV placebo will be double-blinded. - Treatment A: Eravacycline (TP-434) 1.5 mg/kg administered intravenously over 60 minutes and one placebo oral tablet; - Treatment B: Placebo (0.9% sodium chloride) administered intravenously over 60 minutes and one moxifloxacin 400 mg oral tablet; and - Treatment C: Placebo (0.9% sodium chloride) administered intravenously over 60 minutes and one placebo oral tablet. Subjects will be randomized to a treatment sequence according to a pre-generated treatment scheme. Subjects will receive a different treatment during each of the 3 periods.</detailed_description>

Females must be surgically sterile (hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy), postmenopausal for 1 year (with folliclestimulating hormone [FSH] in menopausal range), or agree to use 2 medically accepted, effective methods of birth control (e.g., hormonal contraception, including oral, implant/patch, or injection, or latex condom with spermicide, diaphragm with intravaginal spermicide, cervical cap with spermicide, or indwelling intrauterine device) from the time of signing informed consent until 2 weeks after the FollowUp Visit. One of the birth control methods must be a barrier method; 3. Male subjects with sexual partners of childbearing potential must agree to use 2 medically accepted, effective methods of birth control (e.g., hormonal contraception, including oral, implant/patch, or injection, or latex condom with spermicide, diaphragm with intravaginal spermicide, cervical cap with spermicide, or indwelling intrauterine device) for the duration of the study and for 90 days after the Followup Visit. Male subjects who have had a vasectomy &gt;6 months prior to the first dose of study drug must agree to use 1 medically accepted barrier method for the duration of the study and for 90 days after the Followup Visit; 4. Male subjects (including those who have had vasectomies &gt;6 months prior to the first dose of study drug) whose partners are currently pregnant must agree to use a barrier method (without spermicide) for the duration of the study and for 2 weeks after the Followup Visit; 5. Body mass index of 18 kg/m2 to 33 kg/m2, inclusive; 6. Nonsmokers must have quit smoking &gt;3 months prior to the Screening Visit; 7. Have negative alcohol and drug screens; 8. Have a quantitative urine cotinine screen &lt;3; 9. Willing and able to be confined to the investigational site as required by the protocol; and 10. Able to comprehend and willing to provide written informed consent in accordance with institutional and regulatory guidelines. 1. Evidence of clinically significant hematologic, renal, endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, gastrointestinal, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or allergic disease (including multiple or clinically significant drug allergies), cancer, or any other condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might significantly interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of study drug, interfere with the integrity of electrophysiologic data, or place the subject at an unacceptable risk as a participant in this study; 2. A personal or family history of long QT syndrome, Torsades de pointes, or other complex ventricular arrhythmias or family history of sudden death; 3. Mean QTcF interval &gt;450 msec on screening ECG, performed in triplicate. The mean QTcF of these tracings will be used by the Investigator; 4. Cardiac conduction abnormalities denoted by any of the following at the Screening Visit: evidence of seconddegree (Mobitz type II) or thirddegree atrioventricular block, evidence of ventricular preexcitation, complete left bundle branch block, right bundle branch block, intraventricular conduction delay with QRS duration &gt;120 msec, atrial fibrillation, or presence of cardiac pacemaker; PR interval &gt;220 msec or &lt;120 msec; heart rate &lt;45 bpm or &gt;90 bpm; other clinicallysignificant ECG abnormalities (measured as a mean value from triplicate ECGs); 5. Use of hormone replacement therapy; 6. Any major surgical procedure within 3 months prior to the first dose of study drug; 7. Gastrointestinal disorders or surgical procedures that could interfere significantly with the absorption of orally administered drugs; 8. Use of another investigational drug or device within 30 days prior to receiving eravacycline (TP434), or within at least 5 halflives of the previous investigational drug, whichever is longer; 9. History of malignancy (other than basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ carcinomas of the cervix, or in situ prostate cancer); 10. History or presence of hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure &gt;150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 mmHg). If the subject's blood pressure is outside of the acceptable range at the Screening Visit, the subject may be retested within 24 hours at the discretion of the Investigator; 11. Known allergies to moxifloxacin, other quinolone or tetracycline antibiotics, or related compounds or a history of multiple adverse drug allergies of any origin; 12. Inadequate venous access; 13. Obvious clinical signs or symptoms of liver disease, acute or chronic active hepatitis, or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;2 the upper limit of normal (ULN). An abnormal ALT or AST test may not be repeated; 14. Total bilirubin &gt;1.5 ULN with elevated direct bilirubin. An abnormal total or direct bilirubin test may not be repeated; 15. Serum potassium, magnesium, or calcium levels that are outside of the laboratory's reference range; 16. History of alcoholism or drug abuse within 2 years prior to dosing; 17. Typical weekly alcohol consumption of 14 alcoholic drinks. One drink is defined as 1 glass of beer (approximately 10 oz to 12 oz) or 1 can (12 oz) of beer, 1 glass of wine (approximately 4 oz to 5 oz), or 1 glass of distilled spirits (hard liquor) containing 1 oz of the liquor (1 oz of liquid is approximately 30 mL); 18.
