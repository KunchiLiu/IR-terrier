	<brief_title>Calcium Electroporation for Treatment of Cutaneous Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Double-blinded phase II clinical study. We will compare the effect of calcium electroporation for the treatment of cutaneous metastases with standard treatment: electrochemotherapy with intratumoral injection of bleomycin. Separate randomisation will be performed and the lesions will be treated with either intratumoral injection of calcium or bleomycin. It is a once only treatment and the patients will be followed up for 6 months. It is a non-inferiority study and we accept a difference in response on 15%.</detailed_description>
