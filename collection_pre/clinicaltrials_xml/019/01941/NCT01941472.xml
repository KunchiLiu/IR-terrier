	<brief_summary>Fluid challenge is often carried out in critical ill patients. Its responsiveness usually requires invasive monitoring. To use non-invasive methods is very tempting. Investigators hypothesize that transcutaneous pO2,transcutaneous pCO2 and Central Venous SO2 variations provide feasible estimation on fluid responsiveness in critical ill patients.</brief_summary>
