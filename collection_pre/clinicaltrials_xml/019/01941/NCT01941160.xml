	<brief_title>Effect of a Lacidofil® STRONG in Healthy Adults Taking Antibiotic Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is hypothesized that the proportion of subjects having a diarrhea-like defecation, defined as a stool frequency ≥ 3 per day and/or stool consistency ≥ 5 (Bristol Stool Score) for at least 2 days will be lower in the group receiving Lacidofil® STRONG compared to the group receiving placebo and therefore mean Bristol Stool Scores will be lower in subjects receiving Lacidofil® STRONG compared to those receiving placebo.</detailed_description>
