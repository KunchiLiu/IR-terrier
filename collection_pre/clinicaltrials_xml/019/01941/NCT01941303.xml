	<brief_summary>As one of the few centers, MAASTRO also aggressively re-treats patients with recurrent non-small cell lung cancer. Even after primary radical treatment to high doses, re-irradiation (with concurrent chemotherapy) is also given in curative intent, thus again using high doses of radiation. Publications on high-dose re-irradiation of lung cancer patients are scarce, and outcome and toxicity for patients treated in MAASTRO are unknown at present. This study will provide knowledge on benefit and risks of such a therapeutic approach.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis of Treatment Outcome and Toxicity in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Wither-irradiated to a High Dose for Recurrent Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MAASTRO clinic is a leader in the (individual) management of patients with lung cancer. This has resulted in major publications in the past on individualized (chemo)radiotherapy for (NSCLC) [van Baardwijk 2006 and 2010]. As one of the few centers, MAASTRO also aggressively re-treats patients with recurrent non-small cell lung cancer. Even after primary radical treatment to high doses, re-irradiation is also given in curative intent, thus again using high doses of radiation. Publications on this topic are rare. Most reports address the results of palliative re-irradiation of NSCLC [Ebara 2007, Jackson 1987, Montebello 1993, Tada 2005]. The ones available on re-irradiation with curative intent used outdated techniques [Okamoto 2002, Wu 2003]. Only one recent publication has analyzed the results of 37 NSCLC patients of whom 9 were re-irradiated with at least 50 Gy using helical tomotherapy [Kruser in press]. The results of radical re-irradiation applying highly conformal radiation techniques within MAASTRO are unknown. This study will provide knowledge on benefit and risks of such a therapeutic approach. Furthermore, it may provide enough evidence to initiate a Phase II/III clinical trial for re-irradiation of NSCLC patients with curative intent.</detailed_description>
