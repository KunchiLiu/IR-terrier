	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of vaccine therapy in healthy volunteers with or without previous exposure to cytomegalovirus. Vaccines made from a gene-modified virus may help the body build an immune response and may help prevent cytomegalovirus infection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Healthy Volunteers With or Without Previous Exposure to Cytomegalovirus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To establish a biological optimal dose of the cytomegalovirus (CMV)-modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) Triplex vaccine (multi-CMV epitope modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine). II. To determine if the vaccine is safe and well tolerated in healthy volunteers at these doses. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To provide preliminary evidence of CMV-MVA Triplex vaccine driven expansion of CMV-specific immune responses that would support further evaluation of this vaccine in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients. II. To confer CMV-specific immunity to CMV-negative volunteers and to determine the duration of immune enhancement of CMV-specific cell mediated immunity (CMI) function up to 12 months following immunization of healthy volunteers. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Participants receive multi-CMV epitope modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine intramuscularly (IM) followed by a booster injection 28 days later in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 12 months.</detailed_description>
