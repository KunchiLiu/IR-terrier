	<brief_summary>This study is aimed at evaluating the efficacy regarding the response rate and metastasis-free survival time of cabazitaxel as a neoadjuvant treatment in patients with high risk prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy With Cabazitaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be treated by 6 cycles of Cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 every three weeks and extended radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymphadenectomy 4 weeks after completion of chemotherapy. Multiparametric MRI will be performed at baseline, after 3 cycles and after 6 cycles. If there will be evidence of clinical progression after 3rd cycle, patients can be removed from the study and given local therapy, including radical prostatectomy or external beam radiotherapy, at the discretion of the patient's physicians. If patients have evidence of response, they continue on treatment for a total of 6 cycles. If multiparametric MRI demonstrates stable disease an individual risk-benefit analysis has to be performed with regard to continuing or to stopping the neoadjuvant treatment since the definition stable disease includes patients with ≤ 20% tumour shrinkage or tumour progression</detailed_description>
