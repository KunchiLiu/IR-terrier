	<brief_summary>This multicenter, open-label, single arm study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous (SC) tocilizumab as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate or other non-biologic DMARDs in participants with active rheumatoid arthritis who are either naïve to or have an inadequate response to prior non-biologic or/and biologic DMARDs. The anticipated time on study treatment is 52 weeks. Those participants who will complete the 60-week study period and have achieved Disease Activity Score (DAS) 28 remission or a good European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response at 52 weeks will be eligible to enter the extension phase until tocilizumab is commercially available and reimbursed in Greece.</brief_summary>
