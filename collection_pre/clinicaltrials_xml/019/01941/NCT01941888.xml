	<brief_summary>Many studies address safety and effectiveness of non-anesthesiologist propofol sedation (NAPS) for GI endoscopy. Target Controlled Infusion (TCI) is a sophisticated tool for providing optimal sedation regimen and avoiding under or oversedation. This randomized double blind controlled study compares standard moderate sedation level of sedation (group S) during upper endoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy (CS) versus propofol NAPS (group P).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Propofol TCI Administered by Gastroenterologists During Endoscopy: a Randomized Double Blind Controlled Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>70 CS and 70 EGD ASA I-II patients were studied. In group S (n=70) we administered fentanyl (1μg/kg) + midazolam (0.04-0.03 mg/kg) for CS and midazolam (0.04-0.03 mg/kg) for EGDS and in group P (n=70) fentanyl 1µg/Kg + propofol TCI 1.2-1.6 μg/ml for CS and propofol TCI 1.2-1.6 μg/ml for EGD. Vital parameters and Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation Scale (OAA/S) were monitored throughout the study. Endoscopist's and patient's satisfactions were measured after procedure and 24-72 h later by visual analog scale (VAS).</detailed_description>
