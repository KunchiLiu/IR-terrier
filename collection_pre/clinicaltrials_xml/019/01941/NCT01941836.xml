	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to see how ETC-1002 is tolerated in the body, to measure the amount of ETC-1002 in the blood, and to determine how ETC-1002 affects the level of LDL-cholesterol (bad cholesterol) and other markers of health and disease in blood and urine in patients with elevated LDL-cholesterol with or without statin intolerance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of ETC-1002, Ezetimibe, and the Combination in Hypercholesterolemic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypercholesterolemic patients either with or without a history of statin intolerance (1:1 ratio) will be randomized to receive once daily by mouth capsules containing either ETC-1002, ezetimibe, or ETC-1002 + ezetimibe. This study will explore the safety and efficacy of concomitant administration of ETC-1002 and ezetimibe, while also exploring the effect of ezetimibe on ETC-1002 systemic exposure.</detailed_description>
