	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to collect clinical data, blood samples, and self reported symptoms from patients that experience unusually severe neuropathy after treatment with paclitaxel. This data will be used to develop predictive markers for neuropathy. Blood samples will be used to create induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and eventually artificial nerve cells to be used to study neuropathy in the lab.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria (Severe Toxicity Group): Diagnosis of cancer (including, but not limited to, breast and ovarian cancer) Females aged 18 and older History of grade 3 or higher peripheral neurotoxicity, any neuromotor, neurocortical, or neurocerebellar toxicity, myalgias or arthralgias refractory to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and steroids, ongterm persistence (&gt; 6 months) of grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy, or other unusually severe neurotoxicity approved for inclusion in study by Principal Investigator after completion of paclitaxel chemotherapy regimen or history of peripheral neuropathy that required treatment with narcotics or grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy after only 1 to 2 doses of paclitaxel. Inclusion Criteria (Control Group): History of no neurotoxicity (grade 0) after completion of a standard paclitaxelcontaining chemotherapy regimen Females age 18 and older Matched to a specified subject with neurotoxicity based on age (within 10 years), tumor type, chemotherapy regimen or total paclitaxel dosage, race, and ethnicity Exclusion Criteria : Treatment with other severely neurotoxic chemotherapy (i.e. cisplatin) prior to or concomitantly with paclitaxel. Carboplatin therapy is allowed. Presence of peripheral neuropathy prior to paclitaxel therapy Poorly controlled or insulindependent diabetes or other condition likely to predispose to neurotoxicity (alcoholism, CharcotMarieTooth disease)</criteria>
