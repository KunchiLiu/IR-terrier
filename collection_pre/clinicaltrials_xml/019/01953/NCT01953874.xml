	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to compare the effects of MV targeted ASV in addition to optimized medical therapy versus optimized medical therapy alone at 6 months in patients with acute decompensated HF. The study will also assess changes in functional parameters, biomarkers, quality of life (QOL), and sleep.</brief_summary>
