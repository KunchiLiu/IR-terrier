	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the bioequivalence and compare the safety profiles following inhalation of Vantobra to TOBI nebulizer solution in healthy subjects. Bioequivalence will be investigated based on the pharmacokinetic plasma profiles of Vantobra nebulizer solution compared to TOBI nebulizer solution.</brief_summary>
