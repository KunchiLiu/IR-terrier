	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic robotic surgery (LSM) seems to increase quality of surgery. Diffusion of LSM is limited by cots of the only available system today. Kymerax® is a cheaper new system of LSM. Aim : To evaluate feasibility of laparoscopy with Kymerax® system in different laparoscopic procedures in gynecology. Material and methods : Observational study. Inclusion criteria were : patient requiring laparoscopic procedure in gynecology who give informed consent. The investigators evaluate procedures routinely performed by laparoscopy in gynecology. Hypothesis : Procedures performed routinely in gynecology were feasible with Kymerax® system.</brief_summary>
