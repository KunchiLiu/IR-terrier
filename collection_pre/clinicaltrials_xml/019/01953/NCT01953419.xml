	<detailed_description>Patients enrolled in this study received pemetrexed 500mg/m2, once every 21 days, until the presence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. All patients took dexamethasone 3.75 mg twice daily, starting from the day before and continuing to the day after the drug administration.
