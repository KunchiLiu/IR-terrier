	<brief_summary>The prevalence of anemia in gynecologic oncology new patients has been seen in previous studies to be as high as 35-59%. this population includes women with several types of gynecologic malignancies. Therefore, it is assumed that the origin of the anemia can be due to anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency anemia. No previous studies have looked at the efficacy of oral iron supplementation with concurrent Vitamin C in women with newly diagnosed gynecologic malignancies. Hypothesis: In newly diagnosed gynecologic oncology patients who are surgical candidates does treatment with 3-6 weeks of oral ferrous fumarate 300 mg once a day improve the mean change in hemoglobin levels, from baseline to pre-operative, in comparison to placebo.</brief_summary>
