	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of 12 weeks of subcutaneous evolocumab administered every 2 weeks and once a month, compared with placebo, on percent change from baseline in LDL-C when used in combination with statin therapy in adults with high cardiovascular risk and with hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) Reduction Using Evolocumab (AMG 145) in Japanese Patients With Advanced Cardiovascular Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After a screening and placebo run-in period, eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 open-label background statin treatments (atorvastatin 5 mg or 20 mg daily [QD]) and entered a 4-week lipid stabilization period. After the lipid stabilization period, eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to investigational product (evolocumab or placebo) for the 12-week treatment period. Both randomizations were stratified by subject diagnosis and lipid-lowering therapy as follows: - current or prior diagnosis of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) - no diagnosis of HeFH and receiving intensive lipid-lowering therapy - no diagnosis of HeFH and receiving non-intensive lipid-lowering therapy. A participant was considered randomized into the study after successfully completing the screening period, meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria including meeting final laboratory safety criteria, and undergoing both randomization procedures.</detailed_description>
