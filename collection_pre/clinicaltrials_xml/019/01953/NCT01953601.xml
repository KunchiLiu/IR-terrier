	<brief_summary>This study consists of two parts, Part I and Part II. The purpose of Part I of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of verubecestat (MK-8931) compared with placebo administered for 104 weeks in the treatment of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD), also known as prodromal AD. Participants will be randomized to receive placebo, or 12 mg or 40 mg verubecestat, once daily. The primary study hypothesis for Part 1 is that at least one verubecestat dose is superior to placebo with respect to the change from baseline in the Clinical Dementia Rating scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score at 104 weeks. Participants who complete Part I of the study may choose to participate in Part II, which is a long term double-blind extension to assess efficacy and safety of verubecestat administered for up to an additional 260 weeks. In Part II, all participants will receive either 12 mg or 40 mg verubecestat, once daily.</brief_summary>

If participant is receiving an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor or memantine, the dose must have been stable for at least three months before Screening 4. Must have a reliable and competent trial partner/informant who has a close relationship with the participant and is willing to accompany the participant to all required trial visits, and to monitor compliance of the administration of the trial medication 5. Agree to inform their general practitioner of their participation in this study Inclusion Criteria for Extension Period (Part II): 1.
