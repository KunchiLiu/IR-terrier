	<brief_summary>This study is being conducted to confirm that GSK1322322 has no negative impact on hormone levels and contraceptive efficacy when co-administered with a frequently prescribed oral contraceptive thereby to facilitate the use of GSK1322322 in women of child-bearing potential receiving oral contraceptive (OC) pre-infection. This study is designed to investigate steady-state plasma ethinyl estradiol (EE) and norethindrone (NE) pharmacokinetic (PK) following administration of Ortho-Novum (EE/NE) 1 tablet every 24 hours (q24h) fed with and without GSK1322322 1500 milligram (mg) q12h fed. Each subject will participate in the study for approximately 12 weeks: a 30 day screening period, 4-week run-in period, three 7 day treatment periods, and a 3-5 day follow-up period. The study is planned to enroll approximately 24 subjects (18 active/6 placebo).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator feels that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. Non smoking female (of childbearing age), between 18 and 45 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy without oophorectomy (at least one functioning ovary required) or child bearing age with the presence of nondrug eluting intra uterine device (IUD) i.e. copper. NOTE: The IUD placement needs to be confirmed by an obstetriciangynecologist. Subjects must be willing to use EE/NE in combination with one of the following appropriate contraceptive methods from at least 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug until completion of the followup visit Complete abstinence from intercourse for at least 14 days prior to the first dose of IP, throughout the study, and for the subsequent post study monitoring or; A barrier method plus a spermicide (e.g., condom or diaphragm with spermicidal foam/gel/cream/ suppository for at least 14 days prior to the first dose of IP throughout the study, and for the subsequent post study monitoring or Sterilization (vasectomy) of male partner prior to commencement of female subject's last normal menstrual period prior to IP administration and the male partner is the sole partner for that female subject Body weight &gt;=50 kilograms (kg) (110 pounds [lbs]) and &lt;114kg (&lt;250 lbs) and body mass index within the range 19 to 32 kg/meter^2 (inclusive). Alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;=1.5xupper limit of normal (ULN) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%) at screening and checkin (repeat allowed at checkin only). QT interval corrected for heart rate by Bazett's formula (QTcB) &lt; 450 millisecond (msec) at screening and checkin. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form Pregnant females as determined by positive human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test at screening or prior to dosing. History of any condition that would contraindicate OrthoNovum administration (including hypertension, stroke, ischemic heart disease, venous thromboembolism or family history of thromboembolism, known factor V Leiden mutation or other gene mutations associated with increased risk of thromboembolism, migraine headaches, carcinoma of the breast, liver or endometrium, gallbladder disease, history of undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding, etc. Females with conditions or concurrent medications that could adversely affect hormone levels (e.g. oophorectomies). Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones). Endocrine system: untreated or unstable thyroid disorder and/or diabetes mellitus (I and II). Treatment of the condition must be stable for at least 4 weeks prior to first dose of study drug. Have suffered a urinary tract, bladder, or vaginal infection within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug, or has a urinalysis result at Screening consistent with an urinary tract infection. Subjects diagnosed with an infection at Screening should be treated appropriately and may be rescreened after 4 weeks. Fasting triglycerides &gt; 300 mg/deciliter (dL) at Screening. A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen, positive Hepatitis C antibody, or a positive test for human immuno virus (HIV) antibody result within 3 months of screening. A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen. History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as An average weekly intake of &gt;7 drinks for females. One drink is equivalent to 12 gram of alcohol: 12 ounces (360 milliliter [mL]) of beer, 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of 80 proof distilled spirits. Concurrentmedications that alter gastrointestinal motility result in diarrhea or bind study drugs (for example erythromycin, antacids, prokinetic agents, cholestyramine). The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer). Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day. Unable to refrain from the use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety due to potential drug interaction. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period. Lactating females. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparininduced thrombocytopenia. Urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking or regular use of tobacco or nicotinecontaining products within 4 weeks prior to screening.
