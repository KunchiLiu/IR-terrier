	<brief_summary>Primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the safety of afatinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR (Epidermal growth factor receptor) mutation(s) and have never been treated with an EGFR-TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitor). Secondary objective is to assess the time to symptomatic progression (as judged by investigator).</brief_summary>
