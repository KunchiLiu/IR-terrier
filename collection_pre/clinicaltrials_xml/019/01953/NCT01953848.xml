	<brief_summary>Tamsulosin (sold under the name Omnic OCAS) is used for treatment of voiding complaints related to an enlarged prostate. Solifenacin (sold under the name Vesicare) is used for the treatment of patients suffering from problems related to overactive bladder, such as needing to go to the toilet frequently and often having a sudden urgent need to go to the toilet. Certain patients with an enlarged prostate have complaints that may benefit from a combination of tamsulosin and solifenacin. EC905 is a single tablet containing both tamsulosin and solifenacin. The current study aims at investigating how tamsulosin and solifenacin are taken up from the intestine, distributed through the body and eventually eliminated from the body when taken as a single EC905 tablet.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate How Tamsulosin (at 1 Dose) and Solifenacin (at 2 Different Doses) Are Taken up From the Intestine, Distributed Through the Body and Eliminated From the Body When Administered in Combination as a Single Tablet (Called EC905)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study there are two sequence groups with 27 subjects in total. In Period 1, subjects are randomized to receive one of the two final combination tablet formulations of tamsulosin HCl and solifenacin succinate. In Period 1, 13 subjects receive one combination and 14 subjects receive the other combination. In Period 2, the alternate treatment is provided. Screening takes place from Days -21 to -2 before the first admission day (Day -1). EC905 is administered from Day 1 to Day 12 (treatment period 1), and from Day 13 to Day 24 (treatment period 2). All treatments are administered with subjects in the fasted state. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of tamsulosin HCl and solifenacin free base are collected, and assessments of vital signs, safety electrocardiogram (ECG), safety laboratory, adverse events and concomitant medications are performed. Subjects are discharged on day 25 and an End of Study Visit takes place at least 10 days after the second treatment period, or after withdrawal.</detailed_description>
