	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of different parameters (voltage, pulse width, frequency) of subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) on motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Retrospective Study of the Effects of Different Parameters on Motor Symptoms of PD in Bilateral STN Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this observational study, we will retrospectively analyze the one-year follow-up data of 27 PD patients who received bilateral STN DBS in the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University in the years 2008-2012. The data, including parameter settings and severity of motor symptoms indicated by Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III scores, was collected during the patients' annual visit to the hospital for reprogramming. A correlation analysis will be conducted to investigate the relationship between change of a specific parameter and the subsequent change of motor scores.</detailed_description>
