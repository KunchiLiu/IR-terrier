	<brief_title>Icotinib With Whole Brain Radiation Therapy in NSCLC Patients With Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the malignant tumors with the highest incidence of brain metastases. Patients with multiple brain metastasis showed poor prognosis and displayed an untreated median survival of only 3-6 months, and most patients died due to the progression of brain metastases. This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of icotinib combined with whole brain radiotherapy for NSCLC patients with brain metastases. The primary endpoint is intracranial objective response rate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histological or cytological confirmation of nonsmallcell lung cancer (NSCLC). Diagnosis of nonsystematic brain metastases on a Gadoliniumenhanced MRI. More than 2 sites of intracranial metastases, or the longest diameter of the intracranial lesion is more than 3cm. No other metastases except for brain metastases. Previous usage of EGFRTKI or antibody to EGFR: gefitinib, erlotinib, herceptin, erbitux. CSF or MRI findings consistent with metastases of spinal cord, meninges or meningeal.</criteria>
