	<brief_summary>Patients with Raynaud's phenomenon suffer from painful attacks triggered by stress or cold causing acute lowering of blood flow through the digits. In this trial the safety and efficacy as well as the effect of one dose of the sGC stimulator Riociguat on digital blood flow will be measured during a cold exposure test in patients suffering from Raynaud's phenomenon. Measurements of two periods will be compared: in one period the patient will be given active drug and in the other period a placebo.</brief_summary>
