Known history of positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 3. Any clinically significant abnormality identified at the time of screening that in the judgment of the investigator or any subinvestigator would preclude safe completion of the study or constrain assessment of endpoints, such as major systemic diseases or participants with short life expectancy. 4. Participants considered by the investigator or any subinvestigator to be inappropriate for this study (e.g, geographic or social), actual or anticipated, that the investigator felt would restrict or limit the participant's participation for the duration of the study. 5.
