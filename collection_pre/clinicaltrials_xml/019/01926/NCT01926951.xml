	<brief_title>Renal Denervation Using Externally Focused Therapeutic Ultrasound</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a prospective, multi-center trial wherein each included subject will receive the experimental externally focused ultrasound renal denervation therapy. It will be conducted on a maximum of twenty patients who meet the eligibility criteria and have signed the informed consent form. Safety is the primary endpoint of this study. Safety will be assessed by incidence and evaluation of any serious adverse effects associated with the investigational procedure through the 52-week evaluation. Clinical utility is a secondary endpoint of this study. Clinical utility will be evaluated by comparing pre and post therapy systolic and diastolic blood pressure.</detailed_description>
