	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, randomized clinical trial to compare the efficiency and safety of mild stimulation and controlled ovarian stimulation protocol on the treatment of POR. The randomization is achieved on the basis of a computer-generated randomization list in a 1:1 ratio.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Ovarian Mild Stimulation and Controlled Ovarian Stimulation in Poor Ovarian Responders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>500 poor ovarian responders will be equally randomized to two different ovarian stimulation protocol arms,i.e, mild ovarian stimulation(experimental arm) or controlled ovarian stimulation(control arm). In experimental arm, patients will received letrozole 5mg per day from cycle day 3 to 7 and recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) 150 international unit (IU) on day 4 and 6. The dose of recombinant FSH is adjusted according to the ovarian response and the gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH)antagonist(Cetrotide) 0.25mg per day is administrated when the estradiol level reaches 200 pg/ml and the serum luteinizing hormone （LH）level rises above 2 times of basal LH level. In control arm,patients will be stimulated with short-acting GnRH agonist long protocol. After complete downregulation is achieved through GnRH-agonist, recombinant FSH 300 IU/d is given for 5 days, then the dose of recombinant FSH is adjusted according to ovarian response. The clinical and ongoing pregnancy rate and other secondary outcome parameters are compared between these two groups.</detailed_description>
