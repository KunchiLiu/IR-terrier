	<brief_summary>To study the effects of Erigeron Injection on human serum VEGF, MMP-9 and EPC levels after acute cerebral infarction,test is made by random double-blind controlled.patients with acute cerebral infarction were divided randomly into erigeron injection+aspirin group,aspirin group,and health people. The main indexes are the serum level of VEGF, MMP-9 and EPC.The review is made by the reference to NIHSS and so on. So, Erigeron Injection have the function of promoting angiogenesis in multiple targets through this test.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Erigeron Injection on Acute Cerebral Infarction Serum VEGF, MMP-9 and EPC Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of Erigeron Injection on human serum VEGF, MMP-9 and EPC levels after acute cerebral infarction. METHOD: 40 patients with acute cerebral infarction(in accordance with the inclusion criteria) were divided randomly into erigeron injection+aspirin group,aspirin group,and 20 health people. Erigeron injection+aspirin group and aspirin group drew peripheral blood on the prior treatment,the posttreatment 1th, 3th and 7th day,and tested the level of VEGF, MMP-9 and EPC.Tested the health people one time.</detailed_description>
