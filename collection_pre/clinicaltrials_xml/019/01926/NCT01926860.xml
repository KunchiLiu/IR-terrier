	<brief_summary>The present study explores whether a simultaneously given hepatitis A vaccine (Epaxal) will have an impact on the immune response to PCV13 (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; Prevenar13) vaccine in adults. The immune response to PCV13 is measured as levels of serotype specific serum antibodies and their opsonophagocytic activity. The results of volunteers receiving PCV13 and Epaxal will be compared to that in a control groups of adults receiving either hepatitis A or PCV13 vaccines only.</brief_summary>
