	<brief_summary>Endoscopic correction of VUR has gained its popularity due to its less invasiveness, associated low morbidity and short hospital stay. Although short term follow-up had justified their efficacy; however, long term recurrence and complications following endoscopic correction were also being reported in the literatures (6). Currently, there are insufficient evidences on the efficacy and safety of biocompatible tissue augmenting materials used for endoscopic correction of VUR; particularly on the new tissue bulking agents. (6) Polyacrylate polyalcohol copolymer (PPC)-Vantris Â® (Promedon, Cordoba, Argentina) is the newest tissue augmenting biocompatible Acrylics used for endoscopic correction of VUR.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Included patients for the study were only those who had 1 3months and &gt;1year posttreatment followup study with voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG), kidney ultrasound, dimercaptosuccinic acid(DMSA) renal scan, and urine culture. Excluded cases were patients who had VUR grade 1 and grade 5, no complete followup work ups, concomitant neurogenic bladder, anatomical malformation of the urinary tract (obstruction, complete duplicated pelvocaliceal system), previous surgical or endoscopic procedures, and suspected or confirmed dysfunctional voiding by clinical findings or abnormal results (irregular bladder wall, diverticulum) on VCUG or urodynamic study.</criteria>
