	<brief_summary>Patients with non-curable disseminated follicular lymphoma receive local radiotherapy targeting single lymph nodes and injection of low-dose rituximab (anti-CD20) and autologous dendritic cells. The therapy is repeated 3 times, targeting different lesion. Aims are to induce tumor immunity and clinical responses.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Cancer Vaccine Trial for Patients With Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical protocol is based on the rationale that the immune system has been developed to combat infectious disease. To mimic the environment in infected tissue, selected tumor-affected lymph nodes are treated locally with a single dose of 8 Gy radiotherapy and injected with therapeutic antibody (anti-CD20/Rituximab). Later, dendritic cells (DC) are injected into the damaged tumor tissue together with a stimulatory cytokine (GM-CSF) to initiate an immune response. Patients with untreated or relapsed stage III/IV follicular lymphoma not in need of standard therapy receive intra-tumoral injections of low-dose anti-CD20 antibodies (5 mg) on days 1 and 3 and local radiotherapy on day 2. On days 4 and 5, dendritic cells generated from monocytes isolated from the patients blood are injected into the site together with the stimulatory cytokine GM-CSF administered subcutaneously. Additional lymph nodes are treated similarly after 2 and 4 weeks. The treatment is thus performed three times, targeting different lymphoma nodes. The primary aims are to induce tumor-specific immune responses and clinical responses.</detailed_description>
