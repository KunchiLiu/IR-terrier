	<brief_title>Evaluation of Pain and Inflammation After Injection of Lucentis vs Eylea for Treatment of Wet Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, Phase I-II study of post injection pain and inflammation after intravitreally administered Ranibizumab and Aflibercept in 100 subjects with Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration. We will enroll both treatment experienced ( patients who were treated with Lucentis or Eylea, but not Avastin in the past) and treatment naive patients ( new onset Neovascular AMD with no history of intravitreal injections). The treatment experienced patients will be treated with the intravitreal medication other than what they were receiving in the past, for example, patients treated with Lucentis will switch to Eylea for study purposes and vice versa. Consented, enrolled subjects will receive open-label intravitreal injection of either 0.5mg Ranibizumab or 2mg Aflibercept. A standard intravitreal injection protocol will be followed. Patients will be reevaluated between 24-48 hours and 5-7 days post injections. A non-injecting physician will evaluate the patients for anterior chamber inflammation; this physician will be blinded about the specific treatment. Anterior chamber inflammation is described as any cell or flare in the anterior chamber. These will be evaluated using Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) working group classifications. Pain score will be evaluated using a Numerical Rating Scale. Each patient will have a standard script verbally read to them at their visit, and asked to rate their pain based on this scale.</detailed_description>
