	<brief_summary>Partial thickness burns are a common, painful injury requiring a great deal of resources in their care. Silver sulfadizine is a commonly-used topical antimicrobial, but is difficult to remove due to its lipid base. We are comparing a water-based topical antimicrobial therapy to silver sulfadiazine and hypothesize that the water-based therapy is superior in terms of pain control and resources required to deliver care.</brief_summary>
