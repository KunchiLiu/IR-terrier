	<brief_summary>We aimed to assess the accuracy of visual and quantitative analysis performed on low radiation dose lung CT scan (30-60 mAs)compared with that performed on standard radiation dose lung CT scan (110 mAs), in ARDS patients. If the results in computing lung recruitment will be similar, we will be able to use Low Dose CT scan for monitoring of the evolution of the disease in ARDS patients.</brief_summary>
