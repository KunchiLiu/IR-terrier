	<brief_summary>Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) can cause oxidative damage, resulting in oxidation of lipids, proteins and DNA. In fatigue patients, there are some evidences of oxidative damage to DNA. Ascorbic acid was known to protect mitochondrial injury against oxidative stress by depolarizing the mitochondrial membrane. The copy number of mitochondrial DNA(mtDNA) was suggested mitochondrial gene stability and biogenesis and reflected mitochondrial function. There is no evidence ascorbic acid would decrease the mtDNA damage in fatigue patients. The investigators hypothesized that decreasing in mtDNA copy number in salivary and blood sample may be reversed by high-dose vitamin C intravenous injection in fatigue patients. The investigators will compare the mtDNA copy number and fatigue scale between moderate-severe fatigue patients and control group that had not malignant and chronic illness by a randomized controlled trial.</brief_summary>
