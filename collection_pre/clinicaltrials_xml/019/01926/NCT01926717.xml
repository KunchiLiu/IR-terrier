	<criteria>Patient 30 years of age or older Pathologically confirmed pancreatic cancer (biopsy may be performed at our institution) No evidence of metastases(a) decide performe RouxenY(b) single RouxenY reconstruction is technically feasible(c) Patients will be registered and consent obtained, if the surgeon believes there is no evidence of metastases. If metastatic disease is identified at the time of operation, the patient will not be randomized. Patients will be conditionally enrolled, and consent obtained, if the surgeon believes the patient may need a sngle RouxenY at the time of operation. If a sngle RouxenY is not performed, the patient will not be randomized. the surgeon feels that the single RouxenY is not technically feasible at the time of operation,the patients will be excluded. This may be due to prior abdominal surgery, anatomic variants, or anything else at the surgeon's discretion. Not expected to be able to provide followup over 2 years (due to geographic or other limitations)</criteria>
