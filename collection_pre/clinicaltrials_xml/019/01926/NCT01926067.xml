	<brief_summary>Aim of the study: To validate accelerometers for continuous monitoring of global cardiac function during weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in cardiac surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monitoring of Cardiac Function With 3-axis Accelerometers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis: The following hypothesis will be tested: Accelerometer measures are clinical relevant indices of global left and right myocardial performance during weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. Model: The performance of the accelerometer will be tested in a intraoperative setting, during weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. Accelerometer measures of ventricular systolic and diastolic function will be compared to corresponding measures and indices of ventricular functions by echocardiography and hemodynamic monitoring during a step wise controlled weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, ensuring precise control of pre- and afterload.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The hypothesis will be tested in 20 elective patients. Significant aortic valvular disease scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery with an estimated extracorporeal circulation time &gt; 40 min. Evolving myocardial infarction, dyskinetic wall motions, cardiogenic shock, hepatic dysfunction or esophageal disease.</criteria>
