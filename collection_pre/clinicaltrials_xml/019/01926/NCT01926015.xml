	<brief_summary>The study will evaluate the immunogenicity of the Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis and Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine (DTP-IPV) with concomitant administration of RotaTeq™ (V260) in healthy Japanese infants. The hypothesis to be tested is that the antibody response rates to DTP-IPV with concomitant administration of RotaTeq™ are non-inferior to those with staggered administration of RotaTeq™.</brief_summary>
