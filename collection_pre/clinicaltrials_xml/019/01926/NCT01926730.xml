	<brief_summary>The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial of a limited restriction diet compared to a regular diet among patients with Crohn's disease (CD) in remission. At baseline, patients will complete a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire assessing usual dietary patterns over the preceding month. Disease activity will be assessed with the abbreviated Crohn's Disease Activity Index (aCDAI)59. Self-reported disease status will be assessed during follow-up using an internet-based questionnaire. Repeat assessment of adherence to the study diets will be assessed with food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) administered after 20 weeks. Follow-up duration will be for 48 weeks. Statistical analysis will compare the time to relapse using Cox regression for patients in the two study arms. In the exploratory aim, we will compare outcomes among patients in the highest tertile for other food items and nutrients to those in the lowest tertile based on self-reported usual dietary patterns at baseline. Thus, the study population will be analyzed both as a randomized controlled trial and as a prospective cohort study.</brief_summary>
