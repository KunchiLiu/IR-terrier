	<brief_summary>Diabetes is a major public health problem. Hispanics/Latinos are known to be at higher risk for type 2 diabetes. The function of the endothelium has played a key role in the understanding of vascular complications in people with diabetes. Endothelial function and vascular reactivity are impaired not only in white adults with type 2 diabetes but also in those at risk for the disease by virtue of having impaired glucose tolerance or parental history of type 2 diabetes. Whether this finding is applicable to hispanics is not known. The investigators plan to assess the endothelial function and vascular reactivity in young Hispanic adults at risk of developing type 2 diabetes by virtue of being obese and belonging to a minority population.</brief_summary>
