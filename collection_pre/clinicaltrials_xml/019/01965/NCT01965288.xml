	<brief_title>Clinical Performance of Biofinity Toric Versus Air Optix for Astigmatism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single masked, open label, randomized, bilateral, crossover study design comparing comfilcon A against lotrafilcon B lenses over 1 month of daily wear for each study lens. Each subject will be randomized to wear the test lens (comfilcon A) or the control lens (lotrafilcon B) for one month of daily wear before repeating the schedule for the second pair without a washout period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A person is eligible for inclusion in the study if he/she: Is between 18 and 40 years of age (inclusive) Has had a selfreported visual exam in the last two years Is an adapted soft toric contact lens wearer Has a contact lens spherical prescription between +6.00 to 10.00 (inclusive) Have no less than 0.75diopter (D) of astigmatism and no more than 2.25D in both eyes. Can achieve best corrected spectacle distance visual acuity of 20/25 (0.10 logMAR) or better in each eye. Can achieve a distance visual acuity of 20/30 (0.18 logMAR) or better in each eye with the study contact lenses. Has clear corneas and no active ocular disease Has read, understood and signed the information consent letter. Patient contact lens refraction should fit within the available parameters of the study lenses. Is willing to comply with the wear schedule (at least 5 days per week, &gt; 8 hours/day assuming there are no contraindications for doing so). Is willing to comply with the visit schedule A person will be excluded from the study if he/she: Has a contact lens prescription outside the range of the available parameters of the study lenses. Has a spectacle cylinder less than 0.75D or more than 2.25 D of cylinder in either eye. Has a history of not achieving comfortable contact lens wear (5 days per week; &gt; 8 hours/day) Has contact lens best corrected distance vision worse than 20/25 (0.10 logMAR) in either eye. Presence of clinically significant (grade 24) anterior segment abnormalities Presence of ocular or systemic disease or need of medications which might interfere with contact lens wear. Slit lamp findings that would contraindicate contact lens wear such as: Pathological dry eye or associated findings Pterygium, pinguecula, or corneal scars within the visual axis Neovascularization &gt; 0.75 mm in from of the limbus Giant papillary conjunctivitis (GCP) worse than grade 1 Anterior uveitis or iritis (past or present) Seborrheic eczema, Seborrheic conjunctivitis History of corneal ulcers or fungal infections Poor personal hygiene Has a known history of corneal hypoesthesia (reduced corneal sensitivity) Has aphakia, keratoconus or a highly irregular cornea. Has Presbyopia or has dependence on spectacles for near work over the contact lenses. Has undergone corneal refractive surgery. Is participating in any other type of eye related clinical or research study.</criteria>
