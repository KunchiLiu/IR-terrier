	<brief_summary>High-intermediate or high risk in IPI has a long-term chance of cure in the range about 50% in patients with DLBCL treated by R-CHOP. These high risk patients should be considered for additional new treatment to standard R-CHOP or investigational approaches in the context of clinical trials that are designed to ensure that potentially curative therapy. Bortezomib has shown activity in vitro against DLBCL-derived cell lines. Single-agent bortezomib or chemotherapy combined bortezomib are feasible in follicular, mantle cell, marginal zone lymphoma and DLBCL with manageable toxicities. Bortezomib enhances the activity of chemotherapy in non-GCB but not GCB DLBCL, and provide a rational therapeutic approach based on genetically distinct DLBCL subtypes. High CR/CRu rate with bortezomib with standard R-CHOP suggests it may be a good backbone for additional maintenance leading to durable response. However, there is no study of bortezomib as maintenance therapy after treated with R-CHOP in high risk patients with DLBCL. So we applied additional bortezomib as maintenance therapy in order to assess improving efficacy and survival rates in high risk patients with non-GCB DLBCL who had been confirmed CR after treated with R-CHOP.</brief_summary>
