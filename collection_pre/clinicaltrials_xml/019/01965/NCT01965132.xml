	<brief_summary>We plan to establish a nationwide Biologics Registry (in the form of an inception cohort) to study the safety profiles in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis patients receiving biologic agents.As this registry is to observe the "real world" use of anti-rheumatic treatments under routine clinical practice, no hypothesis to prove is planned.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Korean College of Rheumatology Biologics Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This registry is a multi-centre, prospective, observational program that will gather and analyze data on patients being treated with biologics in Korea. In contrast to a controlled clinical trial, there is no imposed experimental intervention and solely the patients' physicians will determine the patient's treatment. Thus, the data captured and reported in this registry will reflect a "real world" approach to the treatment with biologics. There will be no additional visit or laboratory test done outside the routine clinical practice. Selection of biologic agent, dosing and treatment duration are at the discretion of the investigator. Informed consent will be obtained from the patient prior to the collection of any data.</detailed_description>
