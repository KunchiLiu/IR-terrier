	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of ExAblate MR guided focused ultrasound surgery in the treatment of soft tissue tumors of the extremities.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility of ExAblate MRI Guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound Tx of Soft Tissue Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives include assessment of the incidence and severity of adverse events associated with treatment, and the accuracy of ablation by comparing the measured volume treated based on MR thermometry and post-contrast non-perfused tissue calculations to the actual treated volume in the resected tumor. In addition, the tissue adjacent to the treated region within the tumor but outside the gross limits of the ablation will be examined histologically for evidence of thermal damage.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Males and females at least 10 years of age. 2. Patients who have benign or malignant soft tissue tumors of the extremities, flanks, pelvis, or shoulders that require surgical intervention. 3. Tumor must not have been treated previously with radiation. 4. Patients (or guardians/parents) who are able and willing to give consent (and assent where applicable) and able to attend all study visits. 5. Able to safely undergo MRI exam and receive mild sedation for the treatment. 6. Patient is able to tolerate being in the MRI scanner for the duration of the study. 7. Targeted tumor(s) are accessible to the ExAblate device 8. Patients in whom the targeted volume within the tumor is located deeper than 1 cm from the skin 9. Targeted tumor is clearly visible by noncontrast MRI 10. Karnofsky Performance Status &gt; 60 11. Normal platelet count and coagulation profile 12. Glomerular filtration rate &gt; 60 ml/min 1. Previous radiation treatment to the tumor. 2. Patients on dialysis. 3. Patients with acute medical condition (e.g. pneumonia, sepsis) that is expected to hinder them from completing this study 4. Patients with unstable cardiac status including: 1. Unstable angina pectoris on medication 2. Patients with documented myocardial infarction within six months of protocol entry 3. Congestive heart failure requiring medication (other than diuretic) 4. Patients on antiarrhythmic drugs 5. Severe hypertension (diastolic BP &gt; 100 on medication) 6. Patients with contraindication for MR imaging such as implanted metallic devices that are not MRIsafe, size limitations, etc 7. Patients with severe hematologic, neurologic, or other uncontrolled disease 8. Known intolerance or allergy to medications used for sedation (midazolam), analgesia (fentanyl), and local and regional anesthesia (lidocaine, bupivacaine, and ropivacaine) 9. Known intolerance or allergy to MR contrast agent (gadolinium chelates) including advanced kidney disease a. Pregnant and nursing patients will be excluded from the study because of a contraindication to administering MRI contrast agents to these patients 10. Karnofsky Performance Score &lt; 60 11. Severe cerebrovascular disease (multiple CVAs or CVA within 6 months) 12. Individuals who are not able or willing to tolerate the required prolonged stationary position during treatment (can be up to 5 hrs of total table time) 13. Target volume in tumor is less then 1cm from neurovascular bundles, major blood vessels, bowel or bladder. 14. Targeted tumors: NOT visible by noncontrast MRI, OR NOT accessible to ExAblate device 15. Patient not candidate for either regional anesthesia or mild sedation 16. Patient should not be part of another trial testing other Investigational Agents or Devices</criteria>
