	<brief_title>Performance of Junctional Tourniquets in Normal Human Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Four FDA-cleared junctional tourniquets (Combat Ready Clamp (CRoC), Abdominal Aortic and Junctional Tourniquet (AAJT), Junctional Emergency Treatment Tool (JETT), and SAM Junctional Tourniquet (SJT)) wereassessed in a laboratory on healthy human volunteers. Lower extremity pulses were measured in 10 volunteers before and after junctional tourniquet application aimed at stopping the distal pulse assessed by Doppler auscultation. Tourniquets were applied in a randomized fashion, with 5 min rest periods between each application. Each tourniquet was applied to each subject, such that the subjects acted as their own controls.</detailed_description>
