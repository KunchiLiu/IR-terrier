	<brief_summary>Oseltamivirphosphate is hydrolysed to its active metabolite-the free carboxylate of oseltamivir. Oseltamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor, serving as a competitive inhibitor of the activity of the viral neuraminidase (NA) enzyme upon sialic acid, found on glycoproteins on the surface of platelets. By blocking the activity of the enzyme, oseltamivir may prevent platelet destruction in liver.The project was undertaking by Qilu Hospital of Shandong University and other 5 well-known hospitals in China. In order to report the efficacy and safety of oseltamivirphosphate combined with high-dose dexamethasone for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) with high platelet desialylation level, compared to high-dose dexamethasone therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multicenter Randomized Open-label Study of Oseltamivir Combined With High-dose Dexamethasone Versus High-dose Dexamethasone in the Management of Immune Thrombocytopenia With High Platelet Desialylation Level</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators are undertaking a parallel group, multicentre, randomised controlled trial of 240 newly diagnosed ITP adult patients with high platelet desialylation level from 6 medical centers in China. One part of the participants are randomly selected to receive oseltamivirphosphate (oral administration at a dose of 150 mg twice for 7 consecutive days), combining with dexamethasone (given intravenously at a dose of 40 mg per day for 4 days, the others are selected to receive high-dose of dexamethasone treatment (given intravenously at a dose of 40 mg daily for 4 days). Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment. Adverse events are also recorded throughout the study. In order to report the efficacy and safety of oseltamivirphosphate combining with high-dose dexamethasone therapy compared to high-dose dexamethasone for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed ITP with high platelet desialylation level.</detailed_description>
