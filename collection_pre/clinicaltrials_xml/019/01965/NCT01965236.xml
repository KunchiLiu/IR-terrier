	<brief_summary>The objective of the present study is to asses the effectiveness of the aorta-ventricular coupling according to low and high sodium intake in 28 controled hypertensive patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence of Sodium Intake on Left Ventricular-arterial Coupling</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Comparison of left ventricular function in two groups of 13 patients according to their different salt's consumption in double blind and crossover study. Performance estimation of the left ventricle by echocardiographic and central arterial pressure by tonometry.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Hypertension stage 1, with medium or high risk, when the treatment (mono or therapy without diuretics) is efficient, when the great pressure is reached (&lt;140/90 mmHg) High sodium intake (sodium urinary excretion for 24h (UNaV) &gt; or = 170 mmol/24h before visit 0 Limited sodium intake objective (UNaV&lt;85 mmol/24h)attempted at the end of the limited sodium intake period of 2 weeks Patients aged between 18 and 80 years Subject has given written informed consent Subject has subscribed a health care insurance Secondary hypertension Complications associated with the arterial hypertension : history of cardiovascular diseases or myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, coronary disease, ... Arterial hypertension associated with cardiopathy Arterial hypertension associated with nephropathy Arterial hypertension associated with diabetes Measure of central arterial pressure by tonometry is impossible Cardiac echogenicity is not satisfactory for the analysis of left ventricular loop analysis Patient refuses informed consent Followup impossible for 15 weeks Pregnant or women without efficacy contraception Patient without freedom by administration decision Patient in exclusion period Patient without french insurance Adult protected by the law</criteria>
