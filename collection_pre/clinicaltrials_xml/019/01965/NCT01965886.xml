	<brief_summary>The most common surgical approach to perform a total knee replacement is called medial parapatellar approach. It's effective and can be applied virtually to all types of knee deformities. The Keblish approach is an alternative approach which uses the lateral side of the patella to enter the joint. Some orthopaedic surgeons consider the latter approach a better option when facing a valgus deformity of the osteoarthritic knee but there is no convincing evidence on the literature supporting one or another approach. The objective of this study is to compare the medial vs lateral approach for total knee replacement on valgus knee.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Medial vs Lateral Approach for Total Knee Replacement on Valgus Knee: a Randomized Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total knee replacement is a procedure for the treatment of advanced knee osteoarthritis. The most common surgical approach to perform a total knee replacement is called medial parapatellar approach, or simply medial approach. It's effective and can be applied virtually to all types of knee deformities. The Keblish approach is an alternative approach which uses the lateral side of the patella to enter the joint. It's also called lateral parapatellar approach. Some orthopaedic surgeons consider the latter approach a better option when facing a valgus deformity of the osteoarthritic knee. Theoretically, the Keblish approach can promote better soft tissue balance and patellar tracking, but there is no convincing evidence on the literature supporting one or another approach for a total knee replacement on valgus knee. The objective of this prospective and randomized clinical trial is to compare the medial vs lateral approach for total knee replacement on valgus knee.</detailed_description>
