	<brief_summary>Preload dependence assessment is difficult during prone position, and to date, no hemodynamic parameters have been validated to rationalize fluid loading in that position. This study aims to validate several hemodynamic parameters, using continuous cardiac output by pulse contour analysis and transpulmonary thermodilution.</brief_summary>
