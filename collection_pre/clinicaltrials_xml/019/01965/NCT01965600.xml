	<brief_summary>An endotoxin challenge will be administered to healthy subjects to induce production of inflammatory markers. An investigational drug or placebo will be administered prior to the endotoxin challenge to assess the effect of the investigational drug on the markers of inflammation. Safety and tolerability will also be assessed.</brief_summary>
