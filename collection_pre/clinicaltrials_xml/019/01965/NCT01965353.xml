	<brief_summary>This research study is evaluating an investigational drug called "panobinostat" (LBH589) in combination with the standard agents lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone as a possible treatment for multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study Of Panobinostat/Lenalidomide/Bortezomib/Dex for Relapsed And Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this research study, the participant will be given a study drug-dosing diary for each treatment cycle. Each treatment cycle lasts 21 days (3 weeks) . The diary will also include special instructions for taking the study drug(s). The investigator are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have multiple myeloma, not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the study drug. The dose each participant will get will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the study before each participant and how well they have tolerated their doses. Each treatment cycle will be 21 days long. The participant will have to come to the clinic on days 1, 4, 5, 8, 10 and 11 in Cycle 1 and on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 in Cycles 2 and beyond. Days 1 and 5 of Cycle 1 will take about 8 hours. Every other visit should take about 1-4 hours, however there is always the possibility that it could take longer. Study Drugs: - Panobinostat is a capsule that the participant will take three times a week for the first two the weeks of each cycle. Then participant will have one week off study medication. - Bortezomib will be administered in clinic as a subcutaneous injection twice a week during the first two weeks of each 21 day cycle. - Lenalidomide will be taken orally once daily on days 1-14 of each cycle. - Dexamethasone will be taken orally on the days of and after bortezomib administration during Cycles 1-8, and on days 1, 8 and 15 for Cycles 9 and beyond. Planned Follow-up: The investigators would like to monitor the participant's medical condition even after the participants are no longer participating in the study. The investigators would like to do this by calling the participants on the telephone once every 6 months to see how the participant is doing. Keeping in touch with the participant and checking on their condition helps the investigator look at the long-term effects of the research study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must meet the following criteria on screening examination. All laboratory assessments should be performed within 21 days of initiation of protocol therapy unless otherwise specified. Participants must have a previous diagnosis of Multiple Myeloma, according to International Myeloma Foundation 2003 Diagnostic Criteria Patients must have relapsed or relapsed and refractory disease after receiving 2 or more lines of therapy. Relapse is the occurrence of any of the following: 1) &gt;25% increase in Mprotein from the baseline levels; 2) reappearance of Mprotein that had disappeared; or 3) definite increase in the size and number of lytic bone lesions recognized on radiographs (compression fractures per se do not constitute a relapse). Subjects will be considered refractory to therapy, as defined by progression during treatment or within 60 days after the completion of salvage treatment. Subjects with primary refractory disease are excluded. This includes: 1) nonresponding, nonprogressing; and 2) progressive; primary refractory, progressive disease where patients meet criteria for true progressive disease (Durie 2006). Participants must have measurable myeloma, defined as one or more of the following: serum Mprotein ≥ 0.5 g/dl, urine Mprotein ≥ 200 mg/24 h, and/or serum FLC assay: involved FLC level ≥ 10 mg/dl with abnormal serum FLC ratio. Age ≥ 18 years at the time of signing informed consent. ECOG performance status &lt;2 (Karnofsky &gt;60%) Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 50 mlU/mL 10 to14 days prior to therapy and repeated again within 24 hours of starting lenalidomide and must either commit to complete abstinence from heterosexual contact or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional effective (barrier) method, AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before she starts taking lenalidomide. FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing. Men must practice complete abstinence or agree to use a condom during sexual contact with a FCBP even if they have had a successful vasectomy. All participants agree to enroll and comply with the RevAssist® program for the prevention of pregnancy. A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature female who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Voluntary written informed consent must be obtained before performance of any studyrelated procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the participant at any time without prejudice to future medical care. Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be eligible: Participants with primary refractory disease Participants who have a history of prior MM treatment with panobinostat, or an alternative HDACinhibitor. Participant has ≥ Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy on clinical examination within 21 days before initiation of protocol therapy. Renal insufficiency, defined as creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min (either actual or calculated value), within 21 days of initiation of protocol therapy. The CockcroftGault formula should be used for calculating creatinine clearance values: 140age) x Body mass (kg) x 0.85 (female) or 1.0 (male)/serum creat.
