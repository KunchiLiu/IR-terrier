	<brief_summary>This research puts liver biopsy as the enrollment screening criteria and the primary efficacy assessment indicators. Patients at different developmental stages of hepatitis B related liver fibrosis are respectively diagnosed and treated by Traditional Chinese medicine to determine optional diagnosis and treatment plan of traditional Chinese medicine to screen the advantage-treated population and to establish a treatment program, which can save national medical resources, for clinical application of Traditional Chinese medicine Diagnosis and Treatment blocking and reversing hepatitis B-related liver fibrosis. The research can help to build automation pathological analysis and diagnosis systems and non-invasive clinical assessment criteria and models of liver fibrosis which can be applied in clinical. It can also help to realize electronic patient data collection and management, to establish patients management centre and follow-up database. Then it will help to improve clinical efficacy of being blocked and reversed chronic hepatitis B related liver fibrosis by Chinese medicine Diagnosis and Treatment program, to reduce the incidence of liver cirrhosis and hepatitis B-related mortality, to prolong patients' survival and improve patients' quality of life, to make clinical efficacy, which is about Traditional Chinese Medicine blocking and revering chronic hepatitis B-related liver fibrosis, increase by 15% or more .</brief_summary>
