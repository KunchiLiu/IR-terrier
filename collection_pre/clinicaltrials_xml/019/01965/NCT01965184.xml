	<brief_summary>This is a randomized controlled study of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for disruptive behavior such as anger and aggression in children and adolescents. CBT will be compared to Supportive Psychotherapy (SPT) and participants of this study will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to receive CBT or SPT. Participants will be also asked to complete functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrophysiological (EEG) tasks (recordings/images of brain activity) before and after treatment. CBT is a behavioral intervention that consists of 12 one-hour long, weekly sessions. During CBT children are taught various skills for coping with frustration and parents are taught various strategies for managing situations that can be anger provoking for their child. This study is conducted to examine whether reduction of behavioral problems including anger outbursts, irritability, aggression and noncompliance after CBT may be paralleled by changes in areas of the brain responsible for emotion regulation and social perception.</brief_summary>

Unmedicated or on stable medication for aggression, ADHD, anxiety, or depression for at least 6 weeks, with no planned changes for duration of study. 4. Children can speak English sufficiently enough to participate in CBT and study assessments. 5. Children should have 1) no metal medical implants, 2) a body weight of less than 250 lbs. and 3) no claustrophobia. [These are necessitated by the safety requirements of the fMRI.] 6. Children should be able to meet fMRI data quality requirements at baseline [to enable pre to posttreatment comparison.] 7. Families can commute to the Yale Child Study Center in New Haven, CT for weekly visits. 1. IQ below 85. 2. Children across various DSM diagnoses will be eligible for participation. However, significant levels of psychopathology that require immediate clinical attention such as severe depression or psychosis will be exclusionary because it will require alternative treatments. 3. Significant medical condition such as heart disease, hypertension, liver or renal failure, pulmonary disease, seizure disorder, brain injury based on medical history which can interfere with participation in the study. 4. Concurrent psychotherapy can continue, but CBT for aggression is exclusionary. Subjects will be asked not to initiate any new child psychotherapy during the study.</criteria>
