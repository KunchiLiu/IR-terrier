	<brief_summary>Despite intermittent control of tracheal cuff pressure using a manual manometer, cuff underinflations and overinflations frequently occur in critically ill patients, resulting in increased risk for microaspiration and tracheal ischemic lesions. The aim of this study is to determine the efficiency of Mallinckrodt electronic device (Mallinckrodt electronic cuff pressure controller, VBM Medizintechnik GmbH, Sulz aN) in continuous control of tracheal cuff pressure.</brief_summary>
