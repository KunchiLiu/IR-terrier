	<brief_summary>In this proposed study with People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), we will use a stepped care model called a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) to examine the efficacy of low- and high-intensity smoking cessation treatments for nicotine dependent PLWHA that incorporate the current standard of care and prize-based contingency management. Intervention will be administered in a community-based HIV integrated care clinic in downtown Detroit, which has the highest prevalence rates of HIV/AIDS and smoking in Michigan. Phase 1 will last 4 weeks, and will involve brief intervention to help participants stop smoking. For phase 2, participants will be assigned to different study arms depending on whether they are Responders (reduced their smoking) or Non-responders (continued to smoke). 1. Phase 1: We hypothesize that brief high-magnitude prize contingency management will result in greater reduction in smoking than standard of care alone. 2. Phase 2a: We hypothesize that non-responders who are assigned to contingency management will be more likely to reduce their smoking throughout treatment and to abstain from smoking at all follow-up points. 3. Phase 2b: We hypothesize that responders who are assigned to monitoring and low-magnitude prize contingency management will be more likely to maintain their reduced or abstinent smoking status at all follow-up time-points.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All research related activities will take place at the Tolan Park Medical Building located at 3901 Chrysler Service Dr, Detroit, 48201. Participants in Phase 1 will be randomized to one of two brief interventions based on standard of care guidelines (SoC): A) brief counseling and bupropion (SoC); or B) SoC plus brief high-magnitude prize CM (HM-CM). At the end of Phase 1, participants will be classified as responders or non-responders on the basis of smoking reduction/abstinence. All participants will continue to receive bupropion. Non-responders will enter Phase 2a and be randomly assigned to: A) continued counseling and monitoring support to quit smoking (MS); or B) MS plus prize CM for abstinence (MS+CM). Phase 1 responders will be entered into Phase 2b and randomly assigned to: A) no additional treatment (NAT); or B) Continued monitoring and low intensity prize CM (LI-CM). The primary dependent variables will include cotinine and carbon monoxide (CO) levels, and longest duration of abstinence from cigarettes. Seven-day point prevalence will be used to assess outcome at post-treatment, 6-month and 12-month follow-up points. Participants will be paid $35 for intake and $25 for each follow-up interview, which will occur at post-phase 1, post-phase 2, and 6-months and 12-months after treatment initiation. Some assessments as well as treatment sessions will be recorded to ensure data quality.</detailed_description>
