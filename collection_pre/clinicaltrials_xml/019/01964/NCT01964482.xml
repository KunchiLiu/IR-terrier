	<brief_summary>The project aims to investigate the clinical value of simple strength training during hospitalization and after discharge as part of an enhanced recovery programme for acutely admitted older medical patients, in order to prevent mobility decline following acute hospitalization. Note 11/23/16: As noted in the protocol (doi: 10.1186/s13063-016-1309-1) we have obtained funding and ethical approval (H-2-2012-115/09-12-2016) to extend the study to achieve sufficient power to look more deeply into our secondary outcomes. This will constitute a secondary part of the trial (started Nov. 2016). The primary trial report will include data for the pre-specified sample size for which the last patient was assessed Oct. 2016. Hence, the primary completion date for part 1 was April 2016 and the study completion date for part 1 was Oct 2016. The trial status is still "recruiting" although this applies to part 2 of the study.</brief_summary>
