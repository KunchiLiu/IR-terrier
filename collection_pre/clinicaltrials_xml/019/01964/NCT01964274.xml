	<brief_summary>In this prospective, multicenter observational study the investigators capture the perioperative course of peripheral cholinesterase activity. The focus is the perioperative inflammation causing postoperative delirium. Therefore we measure the activity of Acetylcholine-Esterase and Butyrylcholine-Esterase in whole blood of adults in the perioperative context. Early postoperative delirium will be detected by Nu-DESC in the Recovery Room or the Postanaesthesia-Care-Unit. The course of the peripheral cholinesterase activity will be compared with the incidence of postoperative delirium and other clinical dysfunctions. We follow up the patients for up to five years regarding Delirum, comorbidities and mortality data.</brief_summary>
