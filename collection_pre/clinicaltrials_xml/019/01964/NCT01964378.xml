	<brief_summary>Pain is one of the most common symptoms associated with malignant tumor. The purpose of this trial is to determine whether cebranopadol is as effective in patients with cancer related pain as morphine sulfate prolonged release.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CORAL - Cebranopadol Versus Morphine Prolonged-release in Patients With Chronic Moderate to Severe Pain Related to Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial comprises an enrollment period, a treatment period (titration and maintenance), and a follow-up period. Participants will receive either cebranopadol or morphine for 44 days. Initially participants will be titrated after 2 and then every 4 days to a morphine or cebranopadol dose that provides adequate analgesia and is tolerated. The titration period is planned to last 16 days. Thereafter the dose of morphine prolonged release or cebranopadol is to be kept stable for a further 28 days, i.e. no dose adjustments will be allowed during the maintenance period. This 28 day period is the maintenance period. The follow-up period is planned for up to 18 days after the end of last pain medication treatment intake.</detailed_description>
