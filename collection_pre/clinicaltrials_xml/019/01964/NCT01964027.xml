	<brief_title>The Study of Irinotecan Plus Epirubicin as the Second-line Chemoregime for Advanced Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main purposes: to determine the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of gastric cancer patients given irinotecan + epirubicin as second-line treatment, who are at Stage IV with disease progressed or recurred after first-line chemotherapy failed, , The Secondary purposes: to determine disease control rate (Disease Control Rate, DCR), the objective response rate (Object Response rate, ORR) and the Quality of life (Quality Of Life, QOL)</detailed_description>
