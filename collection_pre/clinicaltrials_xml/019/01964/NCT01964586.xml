	<brief_summary>It is very important to decrease the bleeding during nasal septoplasty in order to increase the visibility of the surgical site. Our primary goal was to investigate the effects of dexmedetomidine and lidocaine plus adrenaline on visibility of surgical site and postoperative analgesic consumption.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Preincisional Infiltrated Dexmedetomidine and Lidocaine Plus Adrenaline for Nasal Sephoplasty Surgery.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nasal septoplasty is a surgery procedure which needs to have decrease the bleeding during the surgery for the visibility of surgical site.And postoperative pain is very usual after the surgery, so an effective postoperative analgesia procedure reduces the complications and helps to be discharged earlier from the hospital. An alpha 2 agonist Dexmedetomidine has an analgesic effect and vasoconstructive effect on the periferal blood vessels. Our hypothesis was dexmedetomidine makes a better surgecal conditions during the surgery and reduce the postoperative analgesic consumption. We administered the infiltrated dexmedetomidine or lidocaine plus adrenaline to the both side of the nasal septum 10 minutes before the surgery. Bleeding scores (Fromm and Boezaart Bleeding Scores) were recorded during the surgery. And postoperative analgesic consumptions were recorded in first 24 hours after the surgery.</detailed_description>
