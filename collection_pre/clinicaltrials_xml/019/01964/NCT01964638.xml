	<brief_summary>This is a prospective single center trial to examine the rates of cancer diagnosis when using computerized software to target suspicious lesions within the prostate identified on mpMRI. The primary evaluation involves comparing the rate of cancer diagnosis when using software-based MRI-Ultrasound image fusion guided biopsy to sample mpMRI findings to the use of visual guided biopsy (cognitive or mental targeting) of the same target. The hypothesis being tested is that fusion guided biopsy will increase detection prostate cancer within mpMRI findings as compared to visual guided biopsy of these areas</brief_summary>
