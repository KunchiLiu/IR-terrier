	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well peginterferon alfa-2b works in treating younger patients with craniopharyngioma that is recurrent or cannot be removed by surgery. Peginterferon alfa-2b may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of craniopharyngioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peginterferon Alfa-2b in Treating Younger Patients With Craniopharyngioma That is Recurrent or Cannot Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the 1-year disease stabilization rate associated with the use of Sylatron (peginterferon alfa-2b) in patients with progressive unresectable or recurrent craniopharyngiomas following surgery alone who have not received radiation therapy. II. To estimate the sustained objective response rate (partial response [PR] + complete response [CR]) to Sylatron in patients with craniopharyngiomas which progress or recur following radiation therapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the response rate in patients with progressive unresectable or recurrent craniopharyngioma treated with Sylatron by study stratum. II. To estimate the progression-free survival distribution for patients with unresectable or recurrent craniopharyngiomas treated with Sylatron by study stratum. III. To evaluate the toxicity profile of Sylatron in children with unresectable or recurrent craniopharyngiomas. IV. To compare the protocol specific disease assessment criteria to MacDonald criteria during the first year of treatment in stratum I and at the time of objective response and progressive disease in both strata. V. To characterize evidence of WNT pathway activation by immunohistochemistry and MAPK pathway activation by pyrosequencing in resected tumor tissue in patients with craniopharyngiomas, and correlate these results with outcome and response data. OUTLINE: Patients receive peginterferon alfa-2b subcutaneously (SC) weekly for 6 weeks. Treatment may repeat every 6 weeks for up to 18 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient must have a histologically verified diagnosis of craniopharyngioma Stratum 1: patients with progressive unresectable or recurrent craniopharyngiomas treated with surgery alone, who have not received radiation therapy; patients with unresectable craniopharyngiomas, (i.e. residual measurable disease following surgical resection) will be enrolled at the time of progression Stratum 2: patients with progressive or recurrent craniopharyngiomas following radiation therapy All patients must have measurable residual disease defined as tumor measurable in two perpendicular diameters on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Please note: measurements are required for both the solid and cystic components Subjects must have recovered from the acute toxicities of all prior therapy before entering this study; for those acute baseline adverse events attributable to prior therapy, recovery is defined as a toxicity grade =&lt; 2, using Common Terminology Criterial for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v.) 4.0, unless otherwise specified in the inclusion and exclusion criteria Myelosuppressive chemotherapy (includes intracystic bleomycin): Subjects must have received their last dose of known myelosuppressive anticancer chemotherapy at least three (3) weeks prior to study registration or at least six (6) weeks if nitrosourea Subjects must have received their last dose of investigational or biologic agent &gt;= 7 days prior to study registration In the event that a subject has received an investigational or biologic agent and has experienced &gt;= grade 2 myelosuppression, then at least three (3) weeks must have elapsed prior to registration If the investigational or biologic agent has a prolonged halflife (&gt;= 7 days) then at least three (3) weeks must have elapsed prior to registration Subjects must have completed at least 3 halflife periods from the last dose of monoclonal antibody prior to registration Note: a list of halflives of commonly used monoclonal antibodies is available on the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC) website under Generic Forms and Templates Stratum 1: patients must not have received radiation therapy Stratum 2: patients must have received radiation therapy, including gamma knife or phosphorus32 (P32) More than 6 months from the time of enrollment if the recurrence is predominantly solid More than 12 months from the time of enrollment if the recurrence is predominantly cystic At least 7 days since the completion of therapy with a hematopoietic growth agent (filgrastim, sargramostim, and erythropoietin) and 14 days for longacting formulations Karnofsky performance scale (KPS for &gt; 16 years [yrs] of age) or Lansky performance score (LPS for =&lt; 16 years of age) &gt;= 60 assessed within two weeks prior to registration Age: 18 months 25 years (Minimum weight 20 Kilogram is required to be eligible for the study, since the minimum injection volume of SYLATRON is 0.05 ml, 20 mcg, SQ as suggested by Merck) Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1000/ul (unsupported) Platelets &gt;= 100,000/ul (unsupported) Hemoglobin (Hg) &gt;= 8g/dL (unsupported) Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =&lt;
