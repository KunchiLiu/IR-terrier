	<brief_title>"Self-consciousness and the Inter-subjective Body"</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anorexia nervosa is a severe psychiatric disorder, with high level of mortality. Anorexic patients often experience a serious disturbance in body and their own shape perception. We hypothesize that bodily self-consciousness is co-constituted by four subjective dimensions which are all inter-subjectively open: in encountering others, one's body is experienced as 1. objectified, 2. the bearer of inter-subjective feelings, 3. an inter-subjective agent and 4. the anchor of an inter-subjectively negotiated perspective. Across several experiments, we sought to determine which dimension of bodily self-consciousness is altered in Anorexia Nervosa compared to healthy subjects.</detailed_description>
