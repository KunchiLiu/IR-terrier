	<brief_summary>This study is establish whether INC280 is safe and has beneficial effects in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma known to have dysregulation of c-MET pathway and whose disease progressed while on, or after, treatment with sorafenib or who are intolerant to sorafenib. Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive INC280 at 600mg BID plus best supportive care (BSC) or placebo plus BSC, until disease progression or intolerable to study treatment. Patients treated with placebo plus BSC will have the opportunity to receive INC280 treatment upon documented further disease progression (RECIST 1.1) per investigator's discretion after unblinding. Patient will be stratified to geographical region (Asia vs Rest of World ) and tumor burden (present macroscopic vascular invasion and/or extra-hepatic spread vs not present).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Confirmed cMET pathway dysregulation. Hepatocellular carcinoma stage B or C according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver cancer staging classification. Current cirrhotic status of ChildPugh class A with no encephalopathy. Documented disease progression during or after discontinuation of sorafenib treatment or intolerance to sorafenib treatment. Measurable disease as determined by RECIST v1.1. ECOG performance status ≤ 1 Previous local antineoplastic therapy or investigational drug completed less than 5 halflives of the agent prior to randomization and have not recovered from clinically significant toxicity from such treatment to grade ≤1 by the NCICTCAE. Received any targeted therapy other than sorafenib. Active bleeding within 28 days prior to screening visit including variceal bleeding (esophageal varices should be treated according to standard practice and procedure completed 28 days prior to screening visit). Clinically significant venous or arterial thrombotic disease within past 6 months.</criteria>
