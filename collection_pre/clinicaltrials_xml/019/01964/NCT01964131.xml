	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is; To investigate whether a D961H sachet 20 mg is bioequivalent to a D961H HPMC capsule 20 mg by the assessment of percentage of time with intragastric pH&gt;4. To compare a D961H sachet 20 mg with a D961H HPMC capsule 20 mg by the assessment of percentage of time with intragastric pH&gt;3 during 24 hours and 24-hour median pH. To compare PK properties of a D961H sachet 20 mg with those of D961H HPMC capsule 20 mg. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a D961H sachet 20 mg and D961H HPMC capsule 20 mg.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BE Study Between a Capsule and a Sachet Formulation of D961H by Pharmacodynamics in Japanese Healthy Male Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is; To investigate whether a pellets based sachet formulation of D961H 20 mg (D961H sachet 20 mg) is bioequivalent to a commercial HPMC capsule of D961H 20 mg (D961H HPMC capsule 20 mg) after repeated oral doses by the assessment of percentage of time with intragastric pH&gt;4 during 24 hours after dose on Day 5. To compare a D961H sachet 20 mg with a D961H HPMC capsule 20 mg after repeated oral doses by the assessment of percentage of time with intragastric pH&gt;3 during 24 hours and 24-hour median pH after dose on Day 5 To compare PK properties of a D961H sachet 20 mg with those of D961H HPMC capsule 20 mg after repeated oral doses by the assessment of AUCÏ„, Cmax,ss, AUC0-t,ss, MRT, tmax,ss, and t1/2,ss of esomeprazole after dose on Day 5. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a D961H sachet 20 mg and D961H HPMC capsule 20 mg by the assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, blood pressure (BP), pulse rate and body temperature.</detailed_description>
