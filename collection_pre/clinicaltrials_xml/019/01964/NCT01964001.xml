	<brief_summary>Carcinoma is the leading cause of worldwide. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second cause of cancer mortality in Taiwan. Vitamin B-6 and coenzyme Q10 has been recognized as antioxidants and anti-inflammatory nutrients in recent clinical studies. The purposes of this study are going to investigate the relation of vitamin B-6 and coenzyme Q10 with the indicators of oxidative stress, antioxidant enzymes activities and the inflammatory markers in patients with stage 1 and stage 2 HCC. The study is designed as an intervention study. The investigators will recruit HCC patients with stage 1 and stage 2 (n = 150) who are identified by liver biopsy. HCC subjects are randomly assign to placebo, vitamin B-6 (50 mg/d), coenzyme Q10 (300 mg/d), and vitamin B-6 plus coenzyme Q10 supplements groups. Intervention is going to administration for three months. The concentrations of vitamin B-6, coenzyme Q10, oxidative stress indicators, antioxidant enzymes activities, antioxidant vitamins (vitamin A and E), and inflammatory markers are going to be analyzed. The results would provide more information nutrients for clinical physicians and dietitians for considering suggesting patients with HCC using vitamin B-6 or coenzyme Q10 supplementation to improve their clinical outcomes.</brief_summary>
