	<brief_summary>The duration of sensory block after single dose of long acting local anesthetics is not sufficient to avoid the postoperative use of opioids. Alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists such as clonidine have been shown to increase the duration of peripheral nerve block. Dexmedetomidine is a more potent and selective Î±-2-adrenoceptor compared to clonidine. To the best of our knowledge, the use of Dexmedetomidine as adjuvant to local anesthetic was not previously reported for femoral nerve block.</brief_summary>
