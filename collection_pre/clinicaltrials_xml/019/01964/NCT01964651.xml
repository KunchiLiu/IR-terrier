	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of JNJ-42165279 in Healthy Young and Elderly Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives), randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance is compared with a medication to test whether the medication has a real effect in a clinical study) trial that will be conducted in two parts. Thirty two (32) healthy participants are planned to be included in total, in four cohorts (groups). Participants in each cohort will receive JNJ-42165279 (n=6) or placebo (n=2) once-daily for 10 consecutive days. In Part 1, two cohorts of healthy male participants, 18 to 55 years of age, will be enrolled. Cohort A will receive 50 mg JNJ-42165279 or placebo for 10 days, and Cohort B will receive 30 mg JNJ-42165279 or placebo for 10 days. In Part 2, Cohort C will consist of 8 healthy female participants of non-childbearing potential (surgically sterile or postmenopausal), 18 to 58 years of age, who will receive 100 mg JNJ-42165279 or placebo for 10 days. Cohort D will consist of 8 healthy elderly male or female participants, from 65 to 85 years of age, who will receive 100 mg JNJ-42165279 or placebo for 10 days. The dose may be adapted before each cohort starts based on available data. The maximum dose will not exceed 100 mg once-daily. For all participants, this study will consist of an eligibility screening examination (between 28 and 3 days prior to the first dose administration), a double-blind treatment phase consisting of 2 days before dosing, 10 dosing days (Day 1 to 10), 4 days after dosing (Day 11 to 14), and a follow-up examination (within 7 to 14 days after last dose administration). The total study duration for each participant will not exceed 8 weeks.</detailed_description>
