	<brief_title>Evaluating the Safety and Immune Response to Five Different Combinations of HIV Vaccines in Healthy, HIV-Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immune response to five different combinations of three HIV vaccines—a DNA vaccine (DNA-HIV-PT123), a NYVAC vaccine (NYVAC-HIV-PT1 and NYVAC-HIV-PT4 injections), and the AIDSVAX® B/E vaccine—in healthy, HIV-uninfected adult participants. The study will enroll 180 healthy, HIV-uninfected participants aged 18 to 50 years. The participants will be randomly assigned to one of five groups. All participants will receive injections according to their assigned group schedule at study entry (Month 0) and Months 1, 3, and 6. The immune response of different prime and boost vaccine strategies will be tested in Groups 1 through 4, and the immune response of the co-administration of the DNA and AIDSVAX® B/E vaccine will be tested in Group 5. Group 1 participants will receive AIDSVAX® B/E as a prime followed by NYVAC as a boost; Group 2 participants will receive NYVAC as a prime followed by an AIDSVAX® B/E boost; Group 3 participants will receive AIDSVAX® B/E as a prime followed by a DNA boost; Group 4 participants will receive a DNA prime followed by an AIDSVAX® B/E boost; and Group 5 participants will receive both the DNA and AIDSVAX® B/E vaccines at each of the 4 vaccination visits. Total study duration will be approximately 42 months and will involve 12 months of scheduled clinic visits at screening, study entry [Month 0], and Months 0.5, 1, 1.5, 3, 3.5, 6, 6.5, 9, and 12) followed by annual health contacts via e-mail or phone to a total of 3 years following initial study injection. All study visits will include a physical exam, HIV risk reduction counseling, and an interview and/or questionnaire. Select study visits will include blood collection, urine collection, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and a pregnancy test for participants who were born female. For participants in Groups 1 and 2, select study visits will also include an assessment of cardiac symptoms. Participants will remain in the clinic for 30 minutes after receiving the vaccines for observation and monitoring. For 7 days after receiving the vaccines, participants will record their symptoms and report them to study researchers.</detailed_description>

NonU.S. sites may use locally available assays that have been approved by HVTN Laboratory Operations. Negative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) Negative antihepatitis C virus (antiHCV) antibodies (Abs), or negative HCV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if the antiHCV is positive Normal urine: negative urine glucose, negative or trace urine protein, and negative or trace urine hemoglobin (if trace hemoglobin is present on dipstick, a microscopic urinalysis with red blood cells levels within institutional normal range) Participants who were born female: negative serum or urine beta human chorionic gonadotropin (βHCG) pregnancy test performed prior to vaccination on the day of initial vaccination A participant who was born female must: agree to consistently use effective contraception for sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy from at least 21 days prior to enrollment through the last required protocol clinic visit. (More information on this criterion can be found in the protocol); OR not be of reproductive potential, such as having reached menopause (no menses for 1 year) or having undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation; OR be sexually abstinent. Participants who were born female must also agree not to seek pregnancy through alternative methods such as artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization until after the last required protocol clinic visit. Blood products received within 120 days before first vaccination Investigational research agents received within 30 days before first vaccination Body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 40; or BMI greater than or equal to 35 with 2 or more of the following: age greater than 45 years, systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg, or known hyperlipidemia Intent to participate in another study of an investigational research agent before the last required protocol clinic visit Pregnant or breastfeeding HIV vaccine(s) received in a prior HIV vaccine trial. For participants who have received control/placebo in an HIV vaccine trial, the HVTN 102 Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT) will determine eligibility on a casebycase basis. NonHIV experimental vaccine(s) received within the last 5 years in a prior vaccine trial. Exceptions may be made for vaccines that have subsequently undergone licensure by the FDA. For participants who have received control/placebo in an experimental vaccine trial, the HVTN 102 PSRT will determine eligibility on a casebycase basis.
