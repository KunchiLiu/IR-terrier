	<brief_summary>Individuals with insomnia have been shown to have higher overall metabolic rates compared to good sleepers, but it is not known which metabolic processes are involved. The goal of this study is to compare a wide array of metabolic processes in 15 people with insomnia and 15 good sleepers. We hypothesize that there will be distinct metabolic processes that are functioning differently in those with insomnia.</brief_summary>
