	<brief_summary>Depression and bipolar disorder are major public health concerns for adolescents today. Teenage depression and bipolar disorder are associated with social isolation, family stress, school failure, substance abuse and suicide. Screening for depression and bipolar disorder so that treatment can be started early in the course of illness is an urgent public health priority. Many teens with bipolar disorder are incorrectly diagnosed as having unipolar depression. It is critical that adolescents receive proper screening and assessment that leads to an accurate diagnosis and treatment. An efficient, cost-effective, blood-based screening program could be performed on an annual or semi-annual basis to potentially detect depression and then differentiate between unipolar and bipolar depression. If this type of screening were able to detect a significant percentage of teens with depression or bipolar disorder, the positive impact on U.S. public health would be substantial. The purpose of this study is to conduct a pilot study to assess the probability of detecting adolescent unipolar and bipolar depression through blood samples.</brief_summary>
