	<brief_summary>To evaluate if somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) obtained with electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) can be used to detect changes in cortical plasticity in responders to a single IV infusion of ketamine as compared to non-responders.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Investigate Evoked Potentials as Markers of Ketamine-induced Cortical Plasticity in Patients With Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be conducted in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and divided into 2 sequential cohorts. Cohort 1 will be conducted in 12 patients at a single center. For each patient, there will be up to 4 sequential phases: a screening phase of up to 6 weeks, an open-label treatment phase of up to 4 weeks, an optional open-label treatment phase of up to 1 week, and a follow-up phase of up to 1 week (if applicable). Cohort 2 will be conducted in 20 patients and will be a multicenter, double-blind (neither physician nor patient knows the treatment that the patient receives), randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect in a clinical trial) design. For each patient, there will be up to 4 sequential phases: a screening phase of up to 6 weeks, a double-blind treatment phase of up to 4 weeks, an optional open-label treatment phase of up to 1 week, and a follow-up phase of up to 1 week (if applicable). The total study duration for each patient will be maximally about 12 weeks. Participant safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
