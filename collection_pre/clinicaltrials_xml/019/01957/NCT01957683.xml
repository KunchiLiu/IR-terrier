	<brief_title>Canadian eCLIPs™ Safety and Feasibility Study Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With this other endoluminal stent/device implantation technique to treat intracranial aneurysms in conjunction with embolic coils, the neurovascular device is placed across the aneurysm neck, to act as a bridge to prevent coils from protruding into the parent artery. Stenting may allow to more safely achieve a higher packing density of coils. These effects may improve the rates of complete aneurysm occlusion and enhance the durability of the coiling treatment. The eCLIPs™ device manufactured by Evasc Medical Systems Corp. has a high density 'leaf' which is implanted across the bifurcation aneurysm neck and anchored in one of the branch arteries of the bifurcation and may provide improved bifurcation aneurysm treatment by allowing for a higher packing density of embolic coils implanted behind the eCLIPs™ device and the eCLIPs™ device in combination with embolic coils may reduce the recurrence/retreatment rate by increasing the rate of complete aneurysm occlusion.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Only patients with the following characteristics are eligible for study entry: 1. Patient whose age is between 18 and 80 years old 2. Patient with an unruptured, saccular, intracranial aneurysm or recurrent aneurysm, which arises at a bifurcation and has a neck length of ≤ 6mm and aneurysm size of 535mm 3. Patient aneurysm arises at a bifurcation artery with at least one of the two branch artery vessels having a diameter between 2.0mm and 3.25mm 4. Patient understands the nature of the procedure and has the capacity to provide informed consent. 5. Patient is willing to have onsite 30 day, and 6month, followup evaluations as per standard clinical practice. Patients with the following characteristics are not eligible for study entry: 1. Patient who presents with an intracranial mass or currently undergoing radiation therapy for carcinoma of the head or neck region. 2. Patient with an International Normalized Ratio (INR)≥ 1.5. 3. Patient with serum creatinine level ≥104 µmol/L at time of enrolment. 4. Patient with a platelet count ˂100x103 cells/mm3 or known platelet dysfunction at time of enrolment 5. Patient who has a known cardiac disorder, likely to be associated with cardioembolic symptoms such as AFIB (atrial fibrillation) 6. Patient with any condition which in the opinion of the treating physician would place the participant at a high risk of embolic stroke 7. Patient with known allergies to nickeltitanium metal 8. Patient with known allergies to aspirin, heparin, ticlopidine, or clopidogrel 9. Patient with a life threatening allergy to contrast (unless treatment for allergy is tolerated) 10. Patient with inappropriate anatomy as demonstrated by angiography due to severe intracranial vessel tortuosity or stenosis, or intracranial vasospasm not responsive to medical therapy. 11. Patient who is currently participating in another clinical research study. 12. Patient who has had a previous intracranial stenting procedure associated with the target aneurysm. 13. Patient who is unable to complete the required followup. 14. Patient who is pregnant or breastfeeding. 15. Patient who has participated in a drug study within the last 30 days.</criteria>
