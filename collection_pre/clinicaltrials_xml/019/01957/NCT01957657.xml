	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Healthy volunteers (males and females) or patients with impaired renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 89 and 15) in relatively good health as determined by past medical history, physical examination, vital signs, ECG and laboratory assessments (aside from abnormalities specific for renal impairment) Age from 18 to 79 years Subjects must be able to understand and comply with study requirements Exclusion criteria: Any relevant deviation from healthy conditions for healthy volunteers Subjects with significant diseases other than renal impairment will be excluded.
