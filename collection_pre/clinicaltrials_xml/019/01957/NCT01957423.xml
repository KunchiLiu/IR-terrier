	<brief_title>Immune Response Regulation and Nutritional Status of the Crohn's Disease Patients.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patients were split into two groups: one group was supplemented with whey protein and the other, with soy protein. Participants were assessed at three moments: before starting the intervention and after 8 and 16 weeks. The nutritional status and body composition were measured using bioimpedance analysis, anthropometry and albumin and pre-albumin dosages. Dietary intake was determined by 24-h dietary recalls. The disease activity was evaluated by Crohn's Disease Activity Index, serum cytokines and C-reactive protein dosages.</detailed_description>
