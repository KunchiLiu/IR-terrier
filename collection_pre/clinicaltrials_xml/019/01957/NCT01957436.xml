	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center phase III study to compare the clinical benefit of androgen deprivation therapy (+/- docetaxel) with or without local radiotherapy with or without abiraterone acetate and prednisone in patient with metastatic hormone-naïve prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase III of ADT +/- Docetaxel +/- Local RT +/- Abiraterone Acetate in Metastatic Hormone-naïve Prostate Cancer.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patients can be randomize in the trial after his consent form has been signed, and after all inclusion and non-inclusion criteria have been checked. The randomisation will result in the allocation of arm A (ADT), arm B (ADT + Abiraterone), arm C(ADT + radiotherapy) or arm D (ADT + Abiraterone + radiotherapy) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The randomization will be stratified (by minimization) according to: - enrolment center, - performance status (0 vs. 1-2) - disease extent: lymph nodes only vs. bone (with or without lymph nodes) vs. presence of visceral metastases. CRPC is defined by cancer progression (either a confirmed PSA rise or a radiological progression) with serum testosterone being at castrated levels (&lt;0.50 ng/mL). When the CRPC stage is reached, castration (either LHRH agonist or LHRH antagonist) will be maintained in all patients. Patients from arm B and D will then stop abiraterone (in selected cases e.g. slow/asymptomatic progressions, the investigator may consider continuing ADT + abirateroneprednisone at CRPC, rather than switching directly to another therapy, for patients included in the abiraterone arms, the use of prednisone at this stage is left to the investigator decision). Investigators will be free to manage patients reaching CRPC at their discretion (using for example docetaxel, zoledronic acid, denosumab, sipuleucel-T, radium-223, cabazitaxel, etc) according to local uses and guidelines. Abiraterone may be used in arm A and C if abiraterone has become the standard treatment for CRPC when this stage is reached.</detailed_description>
