	<brief_summary>In cases of Plantar Fasciitis not responding to conservative management, minimally invasive techniques may be used. These include platelet rich plasma injections and corticosteroid injections. Corticosteroids have long been used for symptomatic relief. However there are growth factors present in PRP injections that contribute to the healing of the pathology, and not just symptom control. A single blind, prospective, randomized, comparative, control study will be performed. The study population consists of a total of 80 participants. They will be randomly assigned to receive either a corticosteroid injection, or a platelet rich plasma injection. Data will be collected through questionnaires and ultrasound findings. Patients will have a follow up at 3, 6, 12, and 24 weeks after they receive their injection.</brief_summary>
