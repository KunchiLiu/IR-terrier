	<brief_summary>On joint orthopaedic hardware infections are one of the most frequently encountered complications in orthopaedic surgery. However 6% of the cultures remain sterile, etiological diagnosis cannot be established despite obvious signs of infection. As part of this research project, we have developed a new strategy diagnosis including directly the use of PCR to reduce the number of negative results. This should have a major therapeutic impact in terms of timeliness and specificity of antibiotic. Primary: Evaluate the effectiveness of the new diagnostic strategy on etiological identification of prosthesis infections. Hypothesis: Minimum 6 percent increase in the number of patients with an etiological diagnosis of infection on prosthesis.</brief_summary>
