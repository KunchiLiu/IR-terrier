	<detailed_description>This feasibility study will assess the following outcomes: - Voiding diaries - Patient reported assessments of response or satisfaction - Adverse events</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Urinary Incontinence, Urge</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Implanted with either Neurostimulator Model 3023 (InterStim) or Neurostimulator Model 3058 (InterStim II) for at least 3 months 2. Implanted with tined lead models 3889 or 3093 3. Tined lead is located at S3 as determined by sensory or motor responses or xray or fluoroscopy 4. Currently showing some efficacy with an InterStim device but has the potential to be optimized per the opinion of the Investigator 5. Primary diagnosis before InterStim implant is urinary urge incontinence. 6. Must be willing to maintain her current regimen (dosage and frequency) of any overactive bladder (OAB) medication (anticholinergic, antimuscarinic or Myrbetriq (Mirabegron)) or tricyclic antidepression medication over the study duration, if applicable. 7. Female subject 18 years of age or older 8. Willing and able to accurately complete voiding diaries and questionnaires, attend visits (within the visit windows +7 days), and comply with the study protocol that includes maintenance of InterStim programming settings over the course of the study 9. Have had no more than one (InterStim) reprogramming at or within 28 days at or prior to randomization 10. Able to consent to participate by signing the Informed Consent Form 11. History of Multiple sclerosis 12. History of Reiter's syndrome 13. History of spinal cord injury or a cerebral vascular accident (CVA) 14. History of diabetes unless the diabetes is wellcontrolled through diet and/or medications 15. Active symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) 16. Stress incontinence as the primary diagnosis 17. Urgency frequency as a primary diagnosis 18. Pelvic pain of uncertain etiology that is not associated with a voiding dysfunction or where pelvic pain is the primary diagnosis 19. Interstitial cystitis as the primary diagnosis 20. Urinary retention as the primary diagnosis 21. Treatment of urinary symptoms with botulinum toxin in the past 12 months or any plan to have botulinum toxin treatment during the study 22. Bilateral lead placement 23. Have other implantable neurostimulator, pacemaker, or defibrillator 24. Have knowledge of planned diathermy, microwave exposure, high output ultrasonic exposure, RF energy exposure, or MRI scans not included within the scanning conditions provided within the MRI Guidelines for InterStim Therapy neurostimulation systems. 25. Have an anticipated system modification within the next 5 months 26. Women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant (women of childbearing potential must undergo a pregnancy test, with a clear negative result, no more than 7 days prior to randomization visit) 27. Subjects who frequently use the patient programmer to change device program settings ("frequently" is defined as at least once a day and does not include shutting off the device for safety purposes) 28. Characteristics indicating a poor understanding of the study or characteristics that indicate the subject may have poor compliance with the study protocol. 29. Study site personnel will contact the Medtronic Study Manager (or designee) to determine if a potential subject who plans to enroll in an investigational device or drug trial, or is currently enrolled in an investigational device or drug trial is eligible for this study</criteria>
