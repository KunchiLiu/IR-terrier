	<brief_summary>This is an open-label Phase 1b dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of vantictumab when combined with docetaxel.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Vantictumab (OMP-18R5) in Combination With Docetaxel in Patients With Previously Treated NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) has been determined, up to 10 patients may be enrolled in the cohort-expansion phase to better characterize the safety, tolerability and PK of vantictumab combined with docetaxel. Up to approximately 34 patients may be enrolled into the study.</detailed_description>
