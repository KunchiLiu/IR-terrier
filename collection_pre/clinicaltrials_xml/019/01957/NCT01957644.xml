	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Adult patients with previously untreated, intermediate2 or high risk MDS or CMML not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) based on documented patients characteristics like age, performance status, concomitant diagnoses, and organ dysfunctions Further inclusion criteria apply Exclusion criteria: Prior or concomitant therapy for higher risk MDS (for example, but not limited to, hypomethylating agents like azacitidine). Note: Prior treatment with EPO is allowed up to &gt; 1 week before treatment with study medication. Patients must have not received MDS therapy since diagnosis of higherrisk MDS. However, previous lenalidomide treatment could have been administered for lowerrisk MDS treatment as long as this therapy was discontinued at least &gt; 4 weeks before initiation of the current study treatment. Treatment with any investigational drug within 2 weeks before first administration of present trial drug or within less than 5 half lives of the investigational drug before treatment with the present trial drug, whichever is longer. Second malignancy currently requiring active therapy (except for hormonal/antihormonal treatment, e.g. in prostate or breast cancer). Corrected QT interval according to Friederica (QTcF) prolongation &gt; 470 ms or QT prolongation deemed clinically relevant by the investigator (e.g., congenital long QT syndrome).The QTcF will be calculated as the mean of the 3 Electrocardiograms (ECGs) taken at screening. Total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal not related to Gilberts disease, hemolysis, or secondary to MDS. Aspartate amino transferase (AST) or alanine amino transferase (ALT) &gt; 2.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) Creatinine &gt; 1.5 x ULN Active hepatitis B or hepatitis C, or laboratory evidence for a chronic infection (hepatitis test results done in routine diagnostics are acceptable if done within 14 days before first study treatment dose). HIV infection (HIV test results in routine diagnostics are acceptable if done within 14 days before first study treatment dose). Severe illness or organ dysfunction involving the kidney, liver or other organ system (e.g. active uncontrolled infection , unstable angina pectoris or history of severe congestive heart failure, clinically unstable cardiac disease or pulmonary disease), which in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with the evaluation of the safety of the study treatment Further exclusion criteria apply</criteria>
