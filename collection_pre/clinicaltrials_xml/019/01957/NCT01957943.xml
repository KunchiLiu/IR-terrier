	<brief_title>Omega 3 Lipid Emulsions and Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be divided intro three groups, A control group will receive equivalent volume of glucose 10% solution both 3 days before and 5 days after the operation . A peri-operative groups, in which patients will receive omega 3 enriched lipid emulsion (SMOFLipid) for 2 days pre-transplantation and 5 days post-transplantation A Post-operative group, in which patients will receive glucose 10% 3 days before the operation and omega 3 enriched lipid emulsion (SMOFLipid) for 5 days post-transplantation The primary outcome objective will be the incidence of Ischemia re-perfusion injury, secondary outcomes includes post-operative complications, graft and patient's outcomes and graft regeneration</detailed_description>
