	<brief_summary>PPI-383 is an antiviral agent (an inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus NS5B polymerase) that is being developed as a potential treatment for hepatitis C virus infection. This study is being done to assess the dose-related safety and tolerance of PPI-383 when given to healthy volunteers for up to 5 days (Part I of the study) and to hepatitis C patients for up to 3 days (Part II). In addition, the study will assess how much PPI-383 is absorbed into the bloodstream. In Part II, the dose-related effect of PPI-383 on the amount of hepatitis C virus in patients' bloodstream (serum HCV RNA levels) also will be assessed.</brief_summary>
