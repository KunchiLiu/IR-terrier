	<brief_summary>This study used the generally recognized as safe (GRAS) grade of Bacillus subtilis natto to produce Vitamin K2, Menaquinone-7(MK-7), via fermentation, for functional evaluation. There are four major objectives for this study: (1) bioavailability of calcium; (2) evaluation of bone density improvement; (3) evaluation of blood-vessel calcification and sclerosis improvement; (4) safety evaluation.</brief_summary>
