	<criteria>1. Written informed consent for study participation must be obtained prior to any study related procedures being performed (local regulations are to be followed in determining the assent/consent requirements for children and parent[s]/guardian[s]) and according to international guidelines and/or applicable European Union guidelines. 2. Female and Male aged 12 to 75 years inclusively, at the time of visit 1. For those patients, who are 17 on the day of Visit 1 but will turn 18 after this day, will be considered an adolescent for the purposes of this trial. 3. History of physiciandiagnosed asthma requiring treatment with mediumtohigh dose ICS (&gt;250μg fluticasone dry powder formulation equivalents total daily dose) and a LABA, for at least 12 months prior to Visit 1 4. Documented treatment with ICS and LABA for at least 3 months prior to Visit 1 with or without oral corticosteroids and additional asthma controllers. For subjects 18 years of age and older, the ICS dose must be &gt;500 mcg/day fluticasone propionate dry powder formulation or equivalent daily. For subjects ages 1217, the ICS dose must be ≥500 mcg /day fluticasone propionate dry powder formulation or equivalent daily. Exclusion criteria: 1. Clinically important pulmonary disease other than asthma (e.g. active lung infection, COPD, bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, hypoventilation syndrome associated with obesity, lung cancer, alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency, and primary ciliary dyskinesia) or ever been diagnosed with pulmonary or systemic disease, other than asthma, that are associated with elevated peripheral eosinophil counts (e.g. allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis/mycosis, Churg Strauss syndrome, hypereosinophilic syndrome) 2. Any disorder, including, but not limited to, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, neurological, musculoskeletal, infectious, endocrine, metabolic, haematological, psychiatric, or major physical impairment that is not stable in the opinion of the Investigator and could: Affect the safety of the patient throughout the study Influence the findings of the studies or their interpretations Impede the patient's ability to complete the entire duration of study 3. Acute upper or lower respiratory infections requiring antibiotics or antiviral medication within 30 days prior to the date informed consent is obtained or during the screening/runin period 4. Any clinically significant abnormal findings in physical examination, vital signs, haematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis during screening/runin period, which in the opinion of the Investigator, may put the patient at risk because of his/her participation in the study, or may influence the results of the study, or the patient's ability to complete entire duration of the study</criteria>
