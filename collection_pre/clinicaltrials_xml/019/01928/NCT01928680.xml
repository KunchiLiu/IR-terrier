	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Capecitabine and Cisplatin to Treat Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cisplatin contained regimens have been demonstrated to be effective in metastatic triple negative breast cancer patients in some phase II clinical trials. Meanwhile, Capecitabine is also a highly effective choice for metastatic breast cancer with considerable duration of response. Combination of cisplatin and capecitabine have been proved effective in metastatic breast cancer in several phase II trials. This study is aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of this combination in triple negative breast cancer patients.</detailed_description>
