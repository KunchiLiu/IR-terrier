	<brief_summary>The main goal of this study is to see if a drug called telmisartan will decrease fibrosis (scarring) and inflammation (irritation) in people who are infected with HIV and doing well on their HIV medications. The study is also being done to see what effects telmisartan has on other signs of disease and inflammation in the body, and to see whether people who have HIV can take telmisartan safely and without side effects that make them want to stop the drug. Telmisartan is FDA-approved for treating high blood pressure and decreasing the chance of heart attacks and strokes in people over the age of 55 years of age who are at high risk for these events.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Step 1 HIV1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to Step 1 entry and confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV1 antigen, or plasma HIV1 RNA viral load &gt;2000 copies/mL on two occasions. On antiretroviral therapy (ART) continuously for ≥48 weeks prior to Step 1 entry. Documentation of HIV1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL at screening, performed by any US laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent. At least one HIV1 RNA level &lt;200 copies/mL in the 48 weeks prior to Step 1 entry (not including the screening). No change in ART regimen in the 12 weeks prior to Step 1 entry (except as noted below). NOTE: Modifications of ART dosing during the 12 weeks prior to Step 1 entry are permitted. In addition, the change in formulation (eg, from standard formulation to fixed dose combination or single tablet regimen) is allowed within 12 weeks of Step 1 entry. A withinclass single drug substitution (eg, switch from nevirapine to efavirenz or from atazanavir to darunavir) is allowed within 12 weeks of Step 1 entry, with the exception of a switch from any other NRTI to abacavir. No other changes in ART in the 12 weeks prior to Step 1 entry are permitted. No active plan to change ART for the 48week study duration. Body mass index (BMI) 2035 kg/m2. For females of reproductive potential, negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 3 days prior to Step 1 entry. Ability and willingness of subject or legal guardian/representative to provide informed consent. Willingness to undergo the Step 1 entry and week 48 lymphoid and adipose tissue biopsies. Step 2 Entry lymphoid tissue and adipose tissue specimen for assay of the primary endpoint has been obtained. Willingness to undergo the week 48 lymphoid and adipose tissue biopsies. Step 1 More than one HIV1 RNA &gt;200 copies/mL in the 48 weeks prior to Step 1 entry. One HIV1 RNA 200500 copies/mL in the 24 weeks prior to Step 1 entry that is not immediately preceded and followed by HIV1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL. NOTE: The preceding viral load &lt;50 copies/mL may be &gt;24 weeks prior to Step 1 entry. Confirmed systolic blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg or &lt;100 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mmHg. Known untreated renal artery stenosis. Known cirrhosis or severe liver disease (eg, ascites, encephalopathy, history of variceal bleeding). NOTE: Potential subjects with chronic hepatitis B or C virus infection with no known cirrhosis or severe liver disease may participate in the study, provided there are no plans to start therapy for hepatitis C infection during the 48week study duration. Unstable coronary artery disease/angina or decompensated congestive heart failure. Either breastfeeding or pregnant within 24 weeks prior to Step 1 entry. Use of thiazolidinediones or any angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) in the 24 weeks prior to Step 1 entry. If the subject took either of these classes of medications for less than 2 weeks in the 24 weeks prior to Step 1 entry, the subject may enroll if 30 days have passed since the last dose. If the subject is diabetic and/or has a calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;60mL/min, aliskirencontaining medications are also prohibited. History of intolerance, other than cough, to any ARB or ACEi. Use of anticoagulants other than aspirin 81 mg or 325 mg daily. NOTE: If the subject is on aspirin 81 mg or 325 mg daily and is willing/able to stop therapy for 7 days prior to the biopsy procedures, the subject may enroll. Any known bleeding disorder or coagulopathy. Projected need for daily potassium supplementation for ≥2 weeks during the study period. The following laboratory values obtained within 30 days prior to Step 1 entry by any US laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≤750 cells/mm3 Hemoglobin ≤10 g/dL Platelet count ≤75,000/mm3 Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) &lt;50 mL/min, as estimated by the CockcroftGault equation Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (SGOT) &gt;/=3x ULN (upper limit of normal) Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (SGPT) &gt;/=3x ULN Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &gt;1.2x ULN Prothrombin time (PT) &gt;1.2x ULN Heritable connective tissue disorders (eg EhlersDanlos syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, Stickler syndrome, Marfan's syndrome). NOTE: Subjects with acquired/autoimmune chronic inflammatory diseases/connective tissue disorders who are clinically stable (in the opinion of the site investigator) and not on a prohibited medication may enroll with approval of the A5317 study chairs. Serious illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization until subject either completes therapy or is clinically stable on therapy, in the opinion of the site investigator, for at least 7 days prior to Step 1 entry. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements. Any condition that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would compromise the subject's ability to participate in the study. Step 2 Any AE associated with the Step 1 entry biopsy that would exclude the subject from undergoing followup biopsy at week 48.</criteria>
