	<brief_summary>Purpose: the aim of the present study was to analyze the impact of mandibular denture relining with soft or hard denture liners in the oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL) of edentulous patients. The null hypothesis was that there would be no difference in OHRQoL findings after mandibular denture relining between patient groups treated with hard or soft denture liners.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Complete denture wearers had their existing mandibular dentures relined with a soft silicone-based denture liner (Mucopren Soft; Group 1; n=22) or a hard acrylic resin based denture liner (Kooliner; Group 2; control n=22) with chairside procedures. The OHIP EDENT (Oral Health Impact profile) questionnaire was given to patients prior to reline procedures (baseline-T0) and 90 days (T90) post relining. Three possible answers and scores were proposed for each question: never (0), sometimes (1) and almost always (2). Results were analyzed by means of the generalized linear model (pâ‰¤0.05) considering two factors: time (T0 and T90) and group (hard and soft denture liners).</detailed_description>
