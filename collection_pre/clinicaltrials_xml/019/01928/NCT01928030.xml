	<brief_summary>This phase 1-2 trial studies the side effects and the best dose of recombinant human hyaluronidase and to see how well it works in treating lymphedema in patients with cancer. Recombinant human hyaluronidase (r-hu-hyaluronidase, rHuPH20) may reduce limb edema size in patients with lymphedema.</brief_summary>
