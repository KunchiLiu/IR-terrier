	<brief_title>Real-Time Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Neurofeedback for Regulation of Psychophysiological Functions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall goal of the outlined study is to establish a real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (RT-fMRI-NF) protocol aiming at modulating brain activity and psychophysiological functions. About two weeks after the initial training session it will be estimated how stable training effects have been. The two weeks in between, subjects will receive ambulatory training of the strategies via a smartphone-based application.</detailed_description>
