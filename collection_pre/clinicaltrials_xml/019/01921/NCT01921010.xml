	<brief_summary>The combination of HDL-C elevation, lowering of triglycerides and further LDL-C reduction accomplished by the addition of niacin to statin medication would improve endothelial function as compared to LDL-C reduction alone in patients with and without coronary artery disease and the combination of low HDL-C/high triglycerides. The combination of lipid lowering therapy would have beneficial effects on markers of inflammation. These benefits would be particularly evident in women.</brief_summary>
