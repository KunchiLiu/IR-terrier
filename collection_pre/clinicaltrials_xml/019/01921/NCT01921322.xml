	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, randomized (open label), multi-center and post-market study. The study is to compare effectiveness of sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy versus multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy in hospitalized patients with insulin treating type 2 diabetes in China</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CEP270 China SAP Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective: To compare the length of time to achieve target glucose range using Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose (SMBG), as reference method, with the 722 Paradigm Real-Time insulin pump versus MDI Secondary Objectives: To compare glycemic variability (using CGM as reference method) with the 722 Paradigm Real-Time insulin pump versus MDI This is a prospective, randomized (open label), multi-center study. The clinical study staff will conduct screening tests according to inclusion/exclusion criteria in order to verify the subject's eligibility for the study. Inpatient Period A patient is admitted into hospital for treatment of diabetes Randomization Subjects are randomized (at a 1:1 ratio) to group A or B in the study database. A total of 80 subjects will be randomized into 2 study groups: - Group A will wear 722 Paradigm Real-Time System (treated with 24h per day insulin infusion) - Group B will be on MDI and wear the CGMS-Gold (treated with 4 insulin injections). It is anticipated that the total duration for the study will be within one year from site initiation to finalization of all data entry and monitoring. Each subject will participate in the study approximately 2 weeks.</detailed_description>

Subject needs to be hospitalized to receive treatment for glucose management according to Endocrinologists' discretion 6. Subject is willing to follow protocol and underdo all study procedures 7. Subject is willing and able to provide informed written consent personally or by legal proxy 1. Subject has known hypersensitivity to insulin or insulin infusion set 2. Subject has been treated with drugs with a known effect on BG within 8 weeks before enrollment other than diabetes medications such as insulin or oral agents. 3. random blood glucose is above 33 mmol/L 4. Subject is currently using real time CGM therapy prior to screening 5. Subject is currently using insulin pump therapy prior to screening 6. Female subject who is pregnant, or plans to become pregnant during the course of the study 7. Patients who are critically ill that must go to intensive critical care unit per Investigator discretion 8. Subject has any systemic disease or medical condition found on the screening tests that may interfere with the safety of the patient and efficacy of the study treatment, in the opinion of the Investigator, may preclude him/her from participating in the study. The following includes, but not limited to, those conditions: Female subject has a positive serum pregnancy screening test Subject has visually impaired or disability limits the use of RTCGM. Subject has any unresolved adverse skin condition in the area of sensor placement or device replacement (e.g., psoriasis, rash, Staphylococcus infection) Subject has disease with a known effect on BG such as Active Graves' disease Subject has a history of alcohol abuse 9. Any other condition, which may not be suitable for the study at physician's discretion.</criteria>
