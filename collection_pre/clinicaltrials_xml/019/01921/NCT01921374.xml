	<brief_summary>The incidence of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is approximately 1 in 3.500 male newborns. During its progression there is loss of mobility, swallowing difficulties and a significant reduction in respiratory capacity. Due to the severity and consequences, is inevitable the need for a caregiver, that normally rely the mother.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mother-caregivers of Children With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a neuromuscular disease characterized by genetic alteration, whose consequence is the progression of muscle degeneration. The mother-caregiver dedicates herself entirely to her son, putting aside the care of their physical and psychological health. The responsibility and workload to care for the child is high. Because of this extreme amount of work associated with other factors such as stress, this mothers-caregivers are more likely to develop hypertension, respiratory disease, susceptibility to infections, depression, anxiety, insomnia, impaired immune and cardiovascular problems. Moreover, they are more likely to develop sleep disorders, those who may cause a high health risk, since many sleep disorders are related to cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological and immune systems.</detailed_description>
