	<brief_summary>The research uses hydrophilic-based dressing (KoCarbonTM) which is developed by Medical Technology Company Limited (Bio-medical Carbon Technology; BCT) to investigate the wound healing effects of activated-carbon-fiber-based wound dressing on different types of wounds.The dressing is composed by three layers. The first layer is a material of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) weave which is great breathable; Second layer, the activated carbon fiber cloth, is as the absorption of excess tissue fluid, bacteria and contaminations. It reduces the smell of wound and restrains the development of bacteria. In addition, activated carbon has features of far-infrared and anion, which promote blood circulation, speed up metabolism and shorten the time of wound healing. The third layer is a polyethlene (PE) film, which touches the wound surface and provides the anti-adhesion effects. The aim of this study is to investigate how the application of the dressing affects the wound healing conditions on four different types of wounds, including general traumatic wounds, elective surgery wound, diabetes foot ulcer (level 2) and chronic wounds. Due to the characteristics of great fluid absorption and far-infrared features, the hydrophilic-based dressing (KoCarbonTM) is expected to work perfectly on improving the wound repair conditions.</brief_summary>
