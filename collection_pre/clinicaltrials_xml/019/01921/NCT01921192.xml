	<brief_summary>Homocysteine, a well-known inducer of vascular endothelial cell damage has been associated with extracellular matrix changes. Many studies demonstrated that high levels of this aminoacid in diabetic patients increases significantly the risk of the development of this pathology. This study has been undertaken to investigate the role of homocysteine and its cofactors (folic acid, vitamin B6 and B12) during the progression of the diabetic retinopathy.</brief_summary>
