	<brief_title>The Effects of Dexmedetomidine on Peroperative Shivering Incidence Under Spinal Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The design of the study includes three study groups done in random order. The groups are as follows: 1) Control group received 15 mg levobupivacaine intrathecally and intravenous 0.9% sodium chloride; 2) Intravenous group received 15 mg levobupivacaine intrathecally and intravenous dexmedetomidine (1mcg/kg/10min, 0.5mcg/kg/h infusion) ; 3) Intrathecal group received 15 mg levobupivacaine + 3 mcg dexmedetomidine intrathecally and intravenous 0.9% sodium chloride. Throughout the study period,shivering scores, tympanic temperature were recorded, heart rate were measured continuously using an electrocardiogram; blood pressure was determined oscillometrically at 5 min intervals at the ankle. In case heart rate decreased by more than 30% of the baseline atropin received and blood pressure decreased 30% of the baseline effedrin received. Side effects (bradycardia, hypotension, hypothermia, nausea and vomiting etc ) were recorded peroperatively in the operating room and postanesthetic care unit.</detailed_description>
