	<brief_summary>To evaluate for the presence of HCV Core protein, HCV RNA and SPP in the placenta and fetal membranes using paraffin-embedded sections and post-delivery specimens respectively. In parallel, we will assess placental tissue for evidence of HCV infection using a novel in situ hybridization technique and translate our in vitro findings to these in vivo samples. Our overall hypothesis is that cytotrophoblasts at the maternal-fetal interface within the placenta serve as a "barrier" that must be crossed during vertical transmission and that cytotrophoblasts are permissive to HCV at a low level that may be enhanced under certain conditions. By comparing the regulation of key steps in the intracellular life cycle of HCV in cytotrophoblasts to highly permissive hepatocytes, significant differences in HCV regulation should be revealed. Based on our preliminary data, our working hypothesis is that HCV Core protein is differentially processed in cytotrophoblasts compared to hepatocytes.</brief_summary>
