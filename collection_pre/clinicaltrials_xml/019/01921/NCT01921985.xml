	<brief_title>Terlipressin Administration in Patients Undergoing Major Liver Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Surgery offers the only potential cure in many patients with primary or metastatic liver cancer. Extending the limits and improving safety of liver resection would allow more patients to benefit from surgery and to increase their survival. The prerequisite for successful and safe liver surgery is the optimal regeneration of the remaining hepatic tissue in order to fulfill the metabolic demands of the patient. Liver regeneration depends on a correct portal pressure and portal blood flow. In the preliminary results the investigators show an elevation of portal pressure post partial hepatectomy in mice. Pharmacologic reduction of such elevated portal pressure using terlipressin, a vasopressin agonist, was associated with improved liver regeneration. Objective Surgery offers the only potential cure in many patients with primary or metastatic liver cancer. Extending the limits and improving safety of liver resection would allow more patients to benefit from surgery and to increase their survival. Liver regeneration depends on a correct portal pressure and portal blood flow. Pharmacologic reduction of elevated portal pressure using terlipressin, a vasopressin agonist, is potentially associated with improved liver regeneration. Aim: To perform a prospective randomized trial comparing terlipressin versus placebo in patients undergoing major hepatic resection. Methods</detailed_description>
