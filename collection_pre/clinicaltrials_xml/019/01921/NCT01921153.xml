	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to test effectiveness of an environmental intervention designed to encourage healthy food intake during meals. It is hypothesized that fruit, vegetable, whole grain, lean protein, and low-fat dairy consumption will increase during the intervention. It is also hypothesized that nutrition knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors will change as a result of the intervention. The findings from this study will provide insight into the applicability of this intervention in military dining facilities.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Environmental Intervention to Encourage Healthy Food Choices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies attempting to increase consumption of healthy foods in military dining facilities have had mixed results, and alternative approaches need to be considered. The present intervention was designed with the results of previous studies in mind, and as such, does not focus on labeling only healthy food choices. Instead, the present intervention aims to encourage consumption of nutritionally well-balanced meals using an environmental cue in military dining facilities.</detailed_description>
