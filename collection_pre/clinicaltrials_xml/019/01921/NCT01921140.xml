	<brief_summary>This is a 3 part study for patients with solid tumours. The purpose of Part A is to measure the amount of olaparib or its breakdown products in the bloodstream for up to 72 hours after eating and the effect of olaparib on QT interval following a single oral dose of olaparib tablets. Part B will determine the effect of olaparib on the QT interval following multiple oral dosing. Part C will allow patients continued access to olaparib tablets and will provide additional safety data collection.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: For inclusion in the study, patients should fulfil the following criteria: 1. Provision of written informed consent prior to any study specific procedures. 2. Patients aged greater than or equal to 18 years. 3. Able to eat a highfat meal within a 30minute period, as provided by the study site. 4. Histologically or, where appropriate, cytologically confirmed malignant solid tumour refractory or resistant to standard therapy or for which no suitable effective standard therapy exists. 5. Normal organ and bone marrow function measured within 28 days prior to administration of investigational product (IP) as defined below: Haemoglobin greater than or equal to 10.0 g/dL, with no blood transfusions in the previous 28 days. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.5 x 109/L. White blood cells (WBC) greater than 3 x 109/L. Platelet count greater than or equal to 100 x 109/L. Total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) except in the case of Gilbert's disease. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than or equal to 2.5 x institutional ULN unless liver metastases are present in which case it must be less than or equal to 5 x ULN. Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x institutional ULN. Serum potassium, sodium, magnesium and calcium within the institutional normal range. 6. Calculated serum creatinine clearance greater than 50 mL/min (using CockroftGault formula or by 24hour urine collection). 7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 2. 8. Patients must have a life expectancy of greater than or equal to 16 weeks. 9. Evidence of nonchildbearing status for women of childbearing potential, or postmenopausal status: negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 28 days of study treatment, confirmed prior to treatment on Day 1 of the first treatment period in Part A. Postmenopausal is defined as: Amenorrheic for 1 year or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments. Luteinising hormone and follicle stimulating hormone levels in the postmenopausal range for women under 50 years of age. Radiationinduced oophorectomy with last menses greater than 1 year ago. Chemotherapyinduced menopause with greater than 1 year interval since last menses. Surgical sterilisation (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy). 10. Patients are willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations. 11. Patients must be on a stable concomitant medication regimen (with the exception of electrolyte supplements), defined as no changes in medication or in dose within 2 weeks prior to start of olaparib dosing, except for bisphosphonates, denosumab, and corticosteroids, which should be stable for at least 4 weeks prior to start of olaparib dosing. Exclusion criteria: 1. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to AstraZeneca staff, its agents, and/or staff at the study site). 2. Previous enrolment in the present study. 3. Participation in another clinical study with an IP during the last 14 days (or a longer period depending on the defined characteristics of the agents used). 4. Patients receiving any systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy (except for palliative reasons) within 2 weeks prior to study treatment (or a longer period depending on the defined characteristics of the agents used). The patient can receive a stable dose of bisphosphonates or denosumab for bone metastases before and during the study as long as these were started at least 4 weeks prior to treatment. 5. Patients who have received or are receiving inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4. 6. Toxicities (greater than or equal to CTCAE Grade 2) caused by previous cancer therapy, excluding alopecia. 7. Patients with symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases. A scan to confirm the absence of brain metastases is not required. Patients with asymptomatic brain metastases or with symptomatic but stable brain metastases can receive a stable dose of corticosteroids before and during the study as long as these were started at least 4 weeks prior to treatment. 8. Major surgery within 2 weeks of starting study treatment and patients must have recovered from any effects of any major surgery. 9. Patients unable to fast for up to 14 hours. 10. Patients considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical disorder, nonmalignant systemic disease, uncontrolled seizures, or active, uncontrolled infection. Examples include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3 months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive bilateral interstitial lung disease on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan, or any psychiatric disorder that prohibits obtaining informed consent. 11. Patients with a history of poorly controlled hypertension with resting blood pressure (BP) greater than 150/100 mm Hg in the presence or absence of a stable regimen of hypertensive therapy. Measurements will be made after the patient has been resting supine for a minimum of 5 minutes. Two or more readings should be taken at 2 minute intervals and averaged. If the first 2 diastolic readings differ by more than 5 mm Hg, an additional reading should be obtained and averaged. 12. Patients with a history of heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction, and patients who require calcium channel blockers. 13. Patients with type I or type II diabetes. 14. Patients who have gastric, gastrooesophageal or oesophageal cancer. 15. Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with gastrointestinal disorders or significant gastrointestinal resection likely to interfere with absorption of olaparib. 16. Breastfeeding women. 17. Immunocompromised patients, eg, patients who are known to be serologically positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 18. Patients with known active hepatic disease (ie, hepatitis B or C). 19. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to olaparib or any of the excipients of the product. 20. Mean QTc with Fridericia's correction (QTcF) greater than 470 ms in screening ECG or history of familial long QT syndrome: A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (eg, repeated demonstration of a QTc interval greater than 470 ms). A history of additional risk factors for Torsade de pointes (eg, heart failure, hypokalaemia, family history of long QT syndrome). 21. The use of concomitant medications that prolong the QT/QTc interval. 22. Clinical judgment by the investigator that the patient should not participate in the study</criteria>
