	<brief_summary>Docetaxel is currently one of standard second-line therapy in patients with gastric cancer. As angiogenesis and FGFR pathway has been suggested to be associated with gastric cancer, dovitinib, dual VEGFR and FGFR inhibitor, may have the potential to improve the outcomes of patients with gastric cancer. Therefore, we investigated the combination regimen of docetaxel and dovitinib.</brief_summary>

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0~2 7. Adequate bone marrow function (Absolute neutrophil counts ≥ 1,500/uL, hemoglobin ≥ 8.0g/dL, and platelet ≥ 100,000/uL) 8. Adequate renal function (creatinine &lt; 1.5mg/dL) 9. Adequate hepatic function (total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL, transaminase &lt; 3 times the upper normal limit [5 times for patients with liver metastasis]) 10. No prior antiangiogenic therapy (antiVEGF or VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor etc) or FGF/FGFR inhibitor 11. No prior radiation therapy within 4 weeks of the study (Irradiated lesions should not be included in the evaluable lesions.) 12. Written informed consent 1. Past or concurrent history of neoplasm other than gastric adenocarcinoma, except for curatively treated nonmelanoma skin cancer or in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri 2.

Presence of central nervous system (CNS) metastasis 6. History of significant neurologic or psychiatric disorders 7. Significant cardiac disease within 6 months of the study (congestive heart failure uncontrollable by medication, symptomatic coronary heart disease, or arrhythmia, myocardial infarction) 8. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessed by 2D echocardiogram (ECHO) or multiple gated acquisition scan (MUGA), &lt; 45% 9.
