	<brief_summary>Many women with breast cancer who are treated with aromatase inhibitor medications develop difficulty sleeping and fatigue during treatment. Some examples of aromatase inhibitor medications include anastrozole (Arimidex), exemestane (Aromasin), and letrozole (Femara). Frequently, sleeping pills do not work very well to improve sleep. Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) is a medication that was originally developed to treat muscle spasms. It may also improve sleep in patients with chronic pain disorders, such as fibromyalgia. In this study we are testing to see if cyclobenzaprine at bedtime will help improve sleep in women treated with aromatase inhibitors.</brief_summary>
