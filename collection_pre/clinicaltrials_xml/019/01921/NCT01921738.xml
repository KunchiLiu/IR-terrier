	<brief_title>The Effect of Azithromycin in the Treatment of Chronic Periodontitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that is carried out in eighty patients who referred to the Department of Periodontology, Isfahan School of Dentistry. Main inclusion criteria were: 1) Patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis 2) At least twenty teeth 3) Age over 18 years. Main exclusion criteria were: 1) History of allergy to the macrolide group 2) History of antibiotic therapy within the 4 months ago 3) The lack of patient cooperation. For all patients is initially performed scaling and root planning (SRP). Oral health education is given to all patients. After one month, patients are randomly divided into four equal groups (two test groups and two control groups). Azithromycin(AZM) 250 milligram (mg) capsules, two times a day (bid), for three days will be given to a test group. In the other test group, 1% AZM gel is locally injected into the periodontal pockets in single-root teeth. Placebo capsules with the same dose and frequency will be given to a control group. In the other control group, placebo gel is injected in the same places. Clinical parameters included pocket depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), papillary bleeding index (PBI), and periodontal disease index (PDI), which are recorded at baseline (before SRP), at 1, 2, 3 and 4 months after treatment. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), microbiological assessment of the percentage of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g) and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a) are randomly done for 40 patients (10 patients from each group) at baseline and at 3 months after the treatment.</detailed_description>
