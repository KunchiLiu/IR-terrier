	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well high or standard intensity radiochemotherapy after gemcitabine hydrochloride and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation (nab-paclitaxel) work compared with gemcitabine hydrochloride and nab-paclitaxel alone in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride and nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs, such as capecitabine, may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving radiation therapy in different ways and adding chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether high intensity radiochemotherapy after gemcitabine hydrochloride and nab-paclitaxel is more effective than standard intensity radiochemotherapy after gemcitabine hydrochloride and nab-paclitaxel or gemcitabine hydrochloride and nab-paclitaxel alone in treating pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High or Standard Intensity Radiation Therapy After Gemcitabine Hydrochloride and Nab-paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Pancreatic Cancer That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if intensified radiochemotherapy following gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) and nab-paclitaxel in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer will show a signal for improved 2-year overall survival (OS) from 10% to 22.5% as compared to chemotherapy with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel alone. II. To determine if standard radiochemotherapy, following gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer will show a signal for improved 2-year OS from 10% to 22.5% as compared to chemotherapy with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel alone. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate patterns of failure (local and systemic progression) by SMAD family member 4 (SMAD4) status and intensity of radiation therapy. II. To evaluate the impact of radiochemotherapy on OS for the subset of SMAD4 intact patients. III. To evaluate adverse events associated with the treatments. IV. To evaluate correlation between SMAD4 status determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and genetic SMAD4 status. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30-40 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for *3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 3-5 weeks later, patients undergo high-dose intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) 5 days a week for 6 weeks (28 fractions) and receive concurrent capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) 5 days a week for 6 weeks. ARM II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation as in Arm I. Beginning 3-5 weeks later, patients undergo standard-dose 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) or IMRT 5 days a week for 6 weeks (28 fractions) and receive capecitabine as in Arm I. ARM III: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30-40 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. NOTE: *In Arms I and II, 2-6 weeks after completion of radiation therapy, patients resume receiving gemcitabine hydrochloride and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month and then every 3 months.</detailed_description>
