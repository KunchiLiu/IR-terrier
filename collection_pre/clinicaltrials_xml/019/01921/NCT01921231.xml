	<brief_summary>Selective spinal anesthesia is widely used for ambulatory surgery. Unilateral spinal anesthesia is a suitable option for ambulatory anesthesia as it is efficient and effective. Lidocaine has been the well-known choice for this procedure. However, it is associated to transient neurologic symptoms (TNS). Different anesthetic strategies for this procedure have been performed, for example, the use of small doses of long-acting agents and the use of additives such as opioids. The ideal local anesthetic should be lidocaine-like without risk of transient neurologic symptoms. We design and plan a randomised clinical trial to show if hyperbaric prilocaine 2% would be an alternative.</brief_summary>
