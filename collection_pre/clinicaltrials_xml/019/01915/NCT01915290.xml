	<brief_title>Physical Activity and Its Correlation to Maximal Oxygen Uptake in an Elderly Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data is collected using activity monitors. This data then compared to self reported physical activity obtained through questionnaires. Questionnaires are based on recall. Overall physical activity will then be correlated to maximal oxygen uptake to see whether people with high activity also have high maximal oxygen uptake.</detailed_description>
