	<brief_summary>We have reported that CPAP treatment improved the walking capacity of overlap syndrome patients. However, the previous study was not randomized, double blinded study. Therefore, we design a prospective, randomized, double blinded, controlled, cross-over trial to confirm this finding.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CPAP Improves the Walking Capacity in Patients With COPD and OSA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>inclusion criteria : - COPD : FEV1/FVC &lt; 70%, no response to bronchodilator (FEV1 change &lt;12% and &lt;200ml) - OSA : AHI &gt; 15/h, obstructive type predominant exclusion criteria : - any malignancy - pregnancy - claustrophobia - age&lt;18 primary outcome : exercise capacity (walking distance (meter), measured by incremental shuttle walking test) Method : For those fit in criteria. CPAP titration will be performed to determine the optimal pressure Baseline measurement : incremental shuttle walking test, urine catecholamine, heart rate variability, muscle power and other baseline characteristics Randomized those patients to group A and group B group A : CPAP treatment with optimal pressure for 1 month, repeat measurement change CPAP treatment to sham pressure 5cm H2O for 1 month, repeat measurement group B : CPAP treatment with sham pressure for 1 month, repeat measurement change CPAP treatment with optimal pressure for 1 month, repeat measurement</detailed_description>
