	<brief_summary>This study was designed to determine the optimal dose of remifentanil that can prevent the complications associated with the removal of LMA without delaying emergence.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimal Effect-site Concentration of Remifentanil for Inhibiting Response to Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) Removal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups. All patients received a predetermined effect-site concentrations (Ce) of remifentanil by target-controlled infusion (TCI) according to their group assignments (R0, remifentanil Ce of 0 ng/ml; R0.5, remifentanil Ce of 0.5 ng/ml; R1.0, remifentanil Ce of 1.0 ng/ml; R1.5, remifentanil Ce of 1.5 ng/ml) from 10 minutes before the end of surgery to LMA removal. Airway complications (airway obstruction, desaturation, breath holding, and coughing), nausea, and vomiting were assessed during the emergence phase.</detailed_description>
