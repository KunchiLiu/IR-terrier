	<brief_summary>The purposes of this study are to: i) confirm and improve the accuracy of the correlation between levels of Zinc in prostate tissue and the grade of prostate cancer in that tissue as determined through pathology; and ii) determine the levels of zinc in prostate tissue declared as non-cancerous by pathology and located in the vicinity of tissue declared as cancerous by pathology, and verify that the Zinc levels for the declared non-cancerous tissue are lower (statistically significantly) than the levels for benign tissue not in the vicinity of cancerous tissue.</brief_summary>
