	<detailed_description>All consecutive patients admitted with acute (within 24 hours after stroke onset) ischemic stroke in three University Hospital of Northern and Central Greece will be included. Blood pressure measurements are being obtained with ambulatory 24-hour BP monitoring (ABPM) every 20 minutes within 24 hours of admission using automated oscillometric device (TM2430, A&amp;D Company Ltd) during day-time (7:00-22:59) and night-time (23:00-6:59). Several clinical, laboratory and imaging parameters are prospectively registered. Also, patients' medical history, previous medical treatment and cardiovascular risk factors are registered. Functional outcome is assessed by the modified Rankin Scale score at 3 months. Also, stroke recurrence and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality will be assessed.</detailed_description>
