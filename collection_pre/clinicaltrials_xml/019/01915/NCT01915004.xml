	<brief_summary>Children with non-neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) represent a significant subgroup of pediatric urology patients, comprising up to 30 percent of some out-patient clinics. These children present with urinary tract infections (UTIs), abnormal voiding habits and various other lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTs) such as incontinence, urinary urgency and urinary frequency. Furthermore, the effects of NLUTD on a child's physical health, mental health and its potential negative clinical sequelae, which includes upper or lower urinary tract damage, must be taken into account when treating these children. These patients have complex needs requiring a significant amount of health teaching and it is imperative to determine the effectiveness of the various modes of delivering urotherapy. To determine the best modality to deliver urotherapy, this trial will compare the effectiveness of a 7 minute bladder training video to the effectiveness of standard urotherapy provided at a pediatric urology clinic at improving NLUTD/DES symptoms and quality of life in children between 5-10 years of age.</brief_summary>
