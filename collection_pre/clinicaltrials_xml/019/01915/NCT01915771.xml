	<brief_title>Study to Determine the Intra-subject Variability of Pharmacokinetics of Lomitapide in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be a single centre, open-label, 2-way crossover study. It will comprise of 2 single oral doses with at least a 14-day washout between doses. Following the first dose subjects will be discharged from the unit for the remainder of the washout period. Subjects will be re-admitted to the unit on Day -1 (Period 2) and following an overnight fast they will be administered the second dose on Day 1 (Period 2). Subjects will be discharged from the unit following the 168 h PK blood draw.</detailed_description>
