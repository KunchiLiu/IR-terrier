	<brief_summary>The purpose of the transfusion of packed red blood cell is to overcome acute or chronic anemia cause tissue hypoxia. It increases hemoglobin concentration and consequently increase oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues. The perioperative period of major surgery is a field particularly favorable to the development of tissue hypoxia, which is associated with increased mortality and postoperative morbidity. Optimization of oxygen transport to tissues at the preoperative period is accompanied by a significant reduction of these major complications. Clinical complications (infectious or otherwise) related to transfusion of caps Red Blood cells Caps (RBC)are well known. Many studies seem to evidence the potentially deleterious effect of transfusion, especially in patients with poor condition, related to storage time. Indeed, during storage, impaired blood-related storage is created. It is metabolic, biochemical and molecular levels. Many studies, carried out in particular in cardiac surgery where patients are suitable for transfusion RBC, have focused on the effect of transfusions on consumption and the transport of oxygen to demonstrate the impact of conservation lesions on their role in vivo. In particular, a single-center retrospective American study showed reduction of postoperative complications in patients who received RBC under 14 days. However one of the confounding factors present is that all transfused RBCs are not leukoreduced (unlike the French transfusion policy). In addition, the greater part of the clinical studies are controversial. That is why we aim to assess, through a retrospective study of data, the impact of transfusion of red red blood cells within 14 days of post-operative morbidity and mortality, compared to the usual transfusion practice in cardiac surgery patients.</brief_summary>
