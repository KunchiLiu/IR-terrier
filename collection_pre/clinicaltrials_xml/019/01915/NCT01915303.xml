	<brief_title>Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Pasireotide s.c. +/- Cabergoline in Patients With Cushing's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is to assess whether pasireotide alone and combined with cabergoline will give reliefs on patients with recurrent, persistent and newly diagnosed Cushing's disease. The study will also assess study drug safety, the changes in Quality of Life and on clinical signs and symptoms of Cushing's disease. The study consists pasireotide-untreated patients at screening and patients currently treated with maximal tolerated doses of pasireotide. Core phase will consist of pasireotide-untreated patients at screening - this includes patients who have never received pasireotide or patients who have received pasireotide sometime in the past but it was not discontinued because of safety. These patients will start pasireotide at 0.6mg twice a day for 8 weeks. Should biochemical control not be achieved the dose will be increased to 0.9mg twice a day. If biochemical control is still not achieved, cabergoline at increasing dose will be added. Patients currently treated with maximal tolerated doses of pasireotide monotherapy for at least 8 weeks at 0.3mg twice a day, 0.6mg twice a day or 0.9mg twice a day, but still did not achieve biochemical control will add cabergoline at increasing dose. After 35 weeks of treatment at core phase, patients will have the option to continue study treatment in extension phase if pasireotide is not yet approved for commercial use and/or reimbursed - if country reimbursement is applicable.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Written informed consent obtaine prior to screening procedures 2. Adult patients with confirmed diagnosis of ACTHdependent Cushing's disease as evidenced by all of the following: 1. The mean of three 24hour urine samples collected within 2 weeks &gt; 1xULN with 2 out of 3 samples &gt;ULN 2. Morning plasma ACTH within the normal or above normal range 3. Either MRI confirmation of pituitary adenoma &gt; 6 mm, or inferior petrosal sinus gradient &gt;3 after CRH stimulation for those patients with a tumor less than or equal to 6 mm*. For patients who have had prior pituitary surgery, histopathology confirming an ACTH staining adenoma *If IPSS had previously been performed without CRH (e.g. with DDAVP), then a central to peripheral prestimulation gradient &gt; 2 is required. If IPSS had not previously been performed, IPSS with CRH stimulation is required. 3. Patients with de novo Cushing's disease can be included only if they are not considered candidates for pituitary surgery (e.g. poor surgical candidates, surgically unapproachable tumors, patients who refuse to have surgical treatment) 4. Male or female patients aged 18 years or greater 5. Karnofsky performance status ≥ 60 (i.e. requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for most of their personal needs) 6. Patients on medical treatment for Cushing's disease the following washout periods must be completed before screening assessments are performed Inhibitors of steroidogenesis (ketoconazole, metyrapone): 1 week Pituitary directed agents: Dopamine agonists (bromocriptine, cabergoline) and PPARγ agonists (rosiglitazone or pioglitazone): 4 weeks Octreotide LAR, Lanreotide SR and Lanreotide autogel: 14 weeks Octreotide (immediate release formulation): 1 week Progesterone receptor antagonist (mifepristone): 4 weeks 7. Patients can be considered to enter the trial if they meet any one of the following criteria: 1) They are naive to pasireotide 2) They have received pasireotide in the past and have been discontinued because of lack of efficacy (2 weeks for washout prior to screening for patients treated with pasireotide subcutaneously and 12 weeks of washout prior to screening for patients treated with pasireotide LAR) 3) Patients who are on maximal tolerated dose but have not achieved biochemical control 8. Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, if they are using highly effective methods of contraception during dosing and for 30 days after stopping study medication. 9. Male participants in the trial must agree to use a condom during intercourse, and not to father a child during the study and for the period of 30 days following stopping of the study treatment. Exclusion criteria: 1. Patients with compression of the optic chiasm causing any visual field defect that requires surgical intervention 2. Diabetic patients with poor glycemic control as evidenced by HbA1c &gt;8% 3. Patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes, i.e. patients with a baseline QTcF &gt;450 ms in males, and &gt; 460 ms in females. hypokalemia, hypomagnesaemia, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, family history of long QT syndrome, or concomitant medications known to prolong QT interval. 4. Patients with clinically significant valvular disease. 5. Patients with Cushing's syndrome due to ectopic ACTH secretion 6. Patients with hypercortisolism secondary to adrenal tumors or nodular (primary) bilateral adrenal hyperplasia 7. Patients who have congestive heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV), unstable angina, sustained ventricular tachycardia, clinically significant bradycardia, advanced heart block, history of acute MI less than one year prior to study entry or clinically significant impairment in cardiovascular function 8. Patients with liver disease such as cirrhosis, chronic active hepatitis, or chronic persistent hepatitis, or patients with ALT/AST &gt; 2 X ULN, serum bilirubin &gt;2.0 X ULN 9. Patients with serum creatinine &gt;2.0 X ULN 10. Patients with WBC &lt;3 X 10e9/L; Hb 90% &lt; LLN; PLT &lt;100 X 10e9/L 11. Patients with presence of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) 12. Patients with presence of Hepatitis C antibody test (antiHCV) 13. Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C) and hypersensitivity to pasireotide or cabergoline 14.

Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive hCG laboratory test (&gt; 5 mIU/ml) 16.
