	<brief_summary>Background: - Recent advances in cancer research have led to new therapies to treat the disease. It is important to continue these advances and discover new ones. To do that, researchers need tissue samples from solid tumors. This study will collect such samples from people already scheduled to have a procedure at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (NIHCC). Objectives: - To collect tissue samples for use in studying new ways to treat tumors. Eligibility: - Adults 18 years and older, with a precancerous or cancerous solid tumor who are scheduled to have surgery or a biopsy at the NIHCC. Design: - Before their procedure, participants will have a small blood sample taken. - Some participants will undergo leukapheresis. In this procedure, blood is removed through a tube in one arm and circulated through a machine that removes white blood cells. The blood, minus the white blood cells, is returned through a tube in the other arm. The procedure takes 3 4 hours. - For all participants, during the surgery or biopsy, pieces of the tumor and pieces of normal tissue near it will be removed for this study. The rest of the tumor or precancerous growth will be sent to a lab for analysis. - Participants will return to the clinic about 6 weeks after the operation for a routine checkup. Some may have to return for additional follow-up.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: - Recent advances and insights into the molecular pathogenesis of cancer have led to the development of novel molecular and biologic targeted therapies for the treatment of advanced cancer patients. A critical challenge in extending these studies involves the identification and validation of new therapeutic targets for future cancer therapies. - As Surgical Oncologists at the NCI, we have an interest in identifying novel molecular and biologic targets to facilitate the development of future cancer therapies. In addition, we have the primary responsibility for providing surgical consultative services to the NIH. As such, we are uniquely positioned to acquire and perform important studies on solid tumor tissue to help identify therapeutic targets that may have significant clinical ramifications. OBJECTIVES: - Primary Objective: To collect biologic samples from patients undergoing diagnostic, preventative, or therapeutic interventions for premalignant, primary or metastatic solid tumors for the purpose of identifying novel molecular and biologic therapeutic targets ELIGIBILITY: - Patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age with radiographic evidence or clinical suspicion of, genetic predisposition for, biochemical evidence of, or histologically/cytologically proven solid neoplasms who require diagnostic, preventative, or therapeutic intervention as a part of the diagnosis and /or treatment and/or follow up for their neoplasm - Patients without solid tumors in whom a diagnostic, preventative, or therapeutic intervention is being performed, but for whom surgical quality and safety outcomes data are generated. - Patients should have laboratory and physical examination parameters within acceptable limits by standard of practice guidelines prior to planned intervention DESIGN: - A tissue acquisition trial in which tissues will be obtained at the time of intervention - Tissue and blood will be processed at the time of collection, transferred to the Clinical Pharmacology program (CPP) for further processing. - No investigational therapy will be given. - It is anticipated that 1000 patients will be enrolled over a period of 10 years</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Patients must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age. Patients who have a premalignant, primary or metastatic solid tumors based upon either radiographic or clinical suspicion, biochemical testing, a genetic predisposition, or histological/cytological analysis that requires surgery or biopsy as part of the diagnosis, prevention, treatment and/or follow up Patients without solid tumors in whom a diagnostic, preventative, or therapeutic intervention is being performed, but for whom surgical quality and safety outcomes data are generated. Patients should have laboratory and physical examination parameters within acceptable limits prior to biopsy or surgery. Patients must be planning to undergo surgery or biopsy as part of their normal treatment plan.</criteria>
