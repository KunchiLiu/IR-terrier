	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to explore a mechanism that could potentially explain why women with a pregnancy complicated by pre-eclampsia are described as having an increased risk of cardiovascular disease later in life. If the hypothesis of this study turns out to be true, that is to say that women with pre-eclampsia have a higher level of oxidative stress than women with a normal pregnancy and that this difference persists after the delivery (6 months), a controlled randomized interventional study aiming to evaluate either therapeutic supplementation with antioxidant vitamins (Vit C and E) or modifications in diet could be envisaged.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients who have provided written informed consent Patients covered by a Health Insurance scheme Age &gt; 18 years Normal pregnancy or preeclampsia defined according to the following classical criteria: (i) de novo hypertension defined by arterial blood pressure of at least 140 mm Hg (systolic) or at least 90 mm Hg (diastolic) confirmed by at least two measurements separated by at least 46 h, occurring after the 20th week of gestation in a women known beforehand to have a normal blood pressure, (ii) proteinuria defined by urinary excretion of at least 300 mg of protein per 24 h. If 24hour urine is not available, proteinuria is defined as a concentration of urinary protein of 300 mg/L or more (or &gt;1 + on the urinary dip) in at least two samples of urine taken randomly, but at an interval of at least 46 h [7]. Preeclampsia is defined as severe if: persistent systolic BP &gt; 170 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP &gt; 110 mm Hg, and/or diuresis &lt; 30 ml/hour, and/or at least 2 of the following signs (headache, phosphenes, epigastric pain or vomiting, pyramidaltype patellar reflexes, papilledema, hepatic pain, thrombopenia &lt; 100x106 /l, ALT AST &gt; 70 UI/l and or hemolysis manifesting as haptoglobin &lt; 0.06 g/l, or a fall in LDH or the presence of schistocytes, the latter three signs define the HELLP syndrome) and/or seizures. Term&gt; 26 SA. Refusal to provide consent Context of patent infection. Premature rupture of the fetal membranes. preexisting or gestational diabetes. Vasculoplacental diseases other than preeclampsia: placental abruption or infarction, intrauterine growth retardation of in utero fetal death not occurring in a context of preeclampsia. Chronic or gestational AHT not meeting the criteria for preeclampsia. Twin/multiple pregnancies</criteria>
