	<brief_summary>The purpose of this observational study is to assess the risk of out-of-hospital Sudden Cardiac (heart) Death (SCD) associated with current use of domperidone compared to current use of a Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI), current use of metoclopramide, or non-use of any of these medications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Observational Study to Assess the Risk of Out-of-Hospital Sudden Cardiac Death in Users of Domperidone, Users of Proton Pump Inhibitors, and Users of Metoclopramide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a population-based, retrospective (a study in which the exposures and outcomes occurred before the study began), and nested case-control study (a study in which the patients with the study outcome [cases] and comparison patients without that outcome [controls] are observed to assess their exposure to the medication being studied [domperidone, PPI's and metoclopramide]). The data will come from the United Kingdom's Clinical Practice Research Datalink. The study will estimate the rate of SCD during periods of exposure to each of the study medications, and during periods of exposure to none of them; and the ratios of these rates. It will also use a "case-crossover" analysis (in which each case serves as his/her own control) to re-estimate these rate ratios in a manner that takes account of personal characteristics such as obesity or smoking that may affect the study findings and are incompletely recorded in the database.</detailed_description>
