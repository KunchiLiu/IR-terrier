	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well trametinib and protein kinase B (Akt) inhibitor GSK2141795 work in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Trametinib and Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trametinib and Akt Inhibitor GSK2141795 in Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the proportion of patients achieving complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete recovery of platelets (CRp) as best response within 4 cycles of therapy of trametinib in combination with GSK2141795 (Akt inhibitor GSK2141795) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with rat sarcoma (RAS) mutations. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the disease-free survival of patients achieving CR/CRp. II. To determine the duration of response of patients achieving CR/CRp. III. To determine the toxicity profile of trametinib in combination with GSK2141795 in this patient population. IV. To determine the biologic effects of trametinib in combination with GSK2141795 on leukemia cells. OUTLINE: Patients receive trametinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed AML, other than acute promyelocytic leukemia, as defined by the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria that have relapsed or refractory to standard chemotherapy; unsuitable for standard chemotherapy or unwilling to undergo standard chemotherapy; subjects &gt;= 60 years of age with newly diagnosed AML who are not candidates for or have refused standard chemotherapy are eligible Patients with prior autologous and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are eligible if patients are off immunosuppression for &gt; 1 month and have no evidence of active graft versus host disease (GVHD) except grade 1 skin GVHD Positive for RAS mutation (neuroblastoma RAS viral [vras] oncogene homolog [NRAS] codon 12, 13, 61 mutation or Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog [KRAS] codon 12, 13, 61 mutation) at a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)certified laboratory prior to study entry; mutational testing will be performed on bone marrow sample and/or peripheral blood; patients with previously known RAS mutations prior to study entry may be considered positive for RAS mutation for eligibility prior to a CLIAcertified laboratory confirmation of such a mutation at the discretion of the investigator; (appropriate blood and/or bone marrow samples must be taken for RAS determination and submitted to a CLIAcertified laboratory prior to study entry); however, if such a mutation is not confirmed by the M D Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC)/other center's CLIAcertified laboratory, the patient may be permitted to stay on the study if they wish and consent to do so but such patients' data will be analyzed separately Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt;

abstinence) prior to study entry, during the study participation, and for four months after the last dose of drug; women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to randomization and agree to use effective contraception throughout the treatment period and for 4 months after the last dose of study treatment; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document History of another malignancy; exception: patients who have been diseasefree for 3 years, or patients with a history of completely resected nonmelanoma skin cancer and/or patients with indolent secondary malignancies, are eligible;
