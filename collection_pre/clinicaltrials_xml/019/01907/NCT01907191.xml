	<brief_summary>This study is being undertaken to compare the pain control using either bupivacaine versus liposomal bupivacaine. Liposomal bupivacaine can potentially provide pain relief lasting up to 72 hours while regular bupivacaine can provide pain relief up to 12 hours</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound Guided Local Infiltration Analgesia for Hip Arthroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergoing hip arthroscopy experience moderate to severe postoperative pain. Effective pain control after surgery is an important component in the overall management of these patients. Good pain control encourages early participation in rehabilitation program, increases success of the surgery, and improves patient satisfaction. Typically, postoperative analgesia is provided to these patients either with nerve blocks or opioid medications. Both these methods provide good pain relief but nerve blocks are associated with weakness of lower extremity muscles which interferes with early ambulation and increase the risk of falls while narcotic medications increase the risk of nausea, vomiting, itching, constipation, ileus, urinary retention, sedation and respiratory depression.</detailed_description>
