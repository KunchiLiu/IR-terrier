BMI 18 34 kg/m2, at least 45 kg for females (Body Mass Index) 5. Signed and dated written informed consent Exclusion criteria: 1. Significant gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, immunological or hormonal disorders as judged by the investigator. 2. Relevant gastrointestinal tract surgery 3. Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy, seizures) or psychiatric disorders or relevant neurological disorders 4. History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts; systolic blood pressure &lt; 100 or &gt; 160 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure &lt; 60 or &gt; 100 mm Hg, pulse rate &lt; 50 or &gt; 100 1/min 5. Chronic or relevant acute infections 6. History of allergy/hypersensitivity (including drug allergies) that are deemed relevant to the trial as judged by the investigator 7. Use within 10 days prior to administration or during the trial of drugs which might reasonably influence the results of the trial based on the knowledge at the time of protocol preparation. Co medication known to inhibit or induce Pglycoprotein or CYP3A is not allowed. Inhibitors of Pglycoprotein or CYP3A (cytochrom P3A) are e.g. protease inhibitors, (e.g. ritonavir, lopinavir nelfinavir) azole antimycotics, (itraconazole, ketoconazole, miconazole) macrolid antibiotics, (clarithromycin, erythromycin) amiodarone, cimetidine, diltiazem, fluvoxamine, mibefradil, nefazodone, verapamil, tacrolimus, quinidine, reserpine, cyclosporine A Inducers of Pgp or CYP3A are e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin, St. John's wort, troglitazone. In dubious cases, a case by case decision will be made after consultation with the sponsor.</criteria>
