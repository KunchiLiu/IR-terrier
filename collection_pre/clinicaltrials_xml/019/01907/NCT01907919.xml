	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to compare the conventional and diode 808 nm laser-assisted techniques in direct pulp capping in permanent teeth .The present study was based on a series of ten clinical studies with pulp exposure caused by carious lesions.The hypothesis of this paper was laser supported direct pulp cap-ping has proven effectiveness by its capacity to stimulate reparative dentine formation by pulp cells, de-contamination ability of irradiated areas, its ability in the fast and better haemostatic, and pain reduction.</brief_summary>
