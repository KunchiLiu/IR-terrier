	<brief_summary>To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the use of transcystic biliary drainage tube (not transanastomotic) in comparison to the usual transanastomotic biliary drainage tube.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transcystic Versus Transanastomotic Tube Drainage in Right Lobe LDLT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>a biliary drainage tube is usually inserted into the biliary passage after choledocho-choledochostomy (bile duct to bile duct joining). A 4F or 5F biliary catheter (Marquat Genie biomedical, france) is used in all cases. the study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of 2 different placement techniques: 1. the usual trans-anastomotic position (the tube is placed across the anastomosis line with the tip inside the intrahepatic biliary branches) through an opening in the wall of the recipient's common bile duct 2. a transcystic non-anastomotic position (the tube is placed through the cystic duct opening into the distal common bile duct not passing through anastomosis)</detailed_description>
