	<brief_summary>Strenuous exercise or exercise involving eccentric muscle contractions can lead to muscle damage and changes in muscle function; this is known as exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD). It is known that brief, repeated periods of ischemia followed by reperfusion, known as Ischemic Preconditioning (IPC) cause a delay in cell injury in cardiac muscle as well as in various other organs. Therefore the purpose of this study is to: 1. Quantify the use of IPC in recovery following EIMD. 2. Identify any effect of IPC during recovery on muscle function</brief_summary>
