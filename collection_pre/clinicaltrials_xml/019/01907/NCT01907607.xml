	<brief_summary>The treatment of advanced GIST patients is based on imatinib followed with sunitinib in case of resistance/intolerance. However, the median progression-free survival (PFS) on sunitinib is frequently short, and after failure with both imatinib and sunitinib, treatment remains controversial. Previous studies on GISTs have linked 9p21 alterations to tumor progression (El-Rifai et al. 2000; Kim et al., 2000; Schneider-Stock et al., 2003; Schneider-Stock et al., 2005; Romeo et al. 2009; Haller et al., 2008) but the driver gene was not positively identified (CDKN2A, CDKN2B, or MTAP) (Astolfi et al., 2010; Belinsky et al., 2009; Perrone et al., 2005; Assamaki et al. 2007; Huang et al., 2009). A recent study has shown that homozygous 9p21 deletions target CDKN2A and more specifically p16INK4a 4. Most of the CINSARC genes are known to be under the transcriptional control of E2F. RB1 sequesters E2F, which is released from the complex upon RB1 phosphorylation by CDK4. CDK4 is, in turn, inhibited by p16INK4a. Hence, we hypothesize that alteration of the restriction point via deletion of p16INK4a (and more rarely of RB1: 20% of cases) gene in GISTs is likely to be a causative event that leads to the overexpression of CINSARC genes, which in turn induce chromosome instability and ultimately metastasis. Low p16INK4a expression was associated with response to PD-0332991 in several in vitro tumor model(Konecny et al. 2011; Katsumi et al. 2011; Finn et al. 2009). Considering our molecular data, we believed that PD-0332991 warrants clinical investigation in advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors with alteration of p16INK4a. This alteration is detectable by comparative genomic hybridization which is a technique highly manageable in the context of routine clinical care and clinical trial. Exploratory, one-arm, multicenter, phase II clinical trial based on twostage Simon's design To assess the antitumor activity of PD-0332991 in terms of non-progression at 16 weeks (after centralized review) in patients with documented disease progression while on therapy with imatinib and sunitinib for unresectable and/or metastatic GIST. This is a multicentre single-arm Phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of orally PD-0332991, 125 mg/day, 21 days on/7 days off, in patients with documented disease progression while on therapy with 2nd line sunitinib for unresectable and/or metastatic GIST. Indeed, the usual treatment for advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors Refractory to Imatinib and Sunitinib is best supportive care for which outcome data are already available (Demetri et al., 2012; Italiano et al., 2012). Sixty three patients will be included in 10 centres of the French Sarcoma Group over a period of 18 months of enrolment. Patients will be evaluated at scheduled visits in up to three study periods: - Pre-treatment (PRE TT): from signature of informed consent to the first treatment by PD-0332991. - Treatment (TT): from the first treatment by PD-0332991 to the first 28 days following the last PD-0332991 administration. - Follow-up (FUP): after treatment discontinuation, all patients must be followed up for 28 days after the last dose of the study drug for safety assessment (AEs and/or SAEs).</brief_summary>

A previously irradiated lesion is eligible to be considered as a measurable lesion provided that there is objective evidence of progression of the lesion prior to starting PD0332991. 6. A performance status of 0, 1 or 2 according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale(Appendix 1) 7.
