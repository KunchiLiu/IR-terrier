	<brief_title>Acute Renal Failure Post Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. To determine levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers in liver transplant patients during post-transplant period 2. To correlate changes in pro-inflammatory cytokines and markers of oxidative stress to acute renal failure and acute rejection 3. To determine the impact of using N-acetylcysteine on cytokines and markers of oxidative stress and the incidence of acute renal failure post liver transplantation</detailed_description>
