	<brief_summary>There was not any randomize trial to show what is the best type of incision in open rhinoplasty. So, we use both self-rating by patients ,independent physician observers Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and also a validated scar analysis to compare inverted V and stair step incisions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing the Aesthetic Results of Two Common Incisions in External Rhinoplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approaches to rhinoplasty can be separated into two broad categories: external and endonasal, which each of them their own proponent. However, the external approach provide better exposure, critics against this technique is often due to cosmetic deformity regarding the incision. Hence, over the recent years surgeons have modified the trans-columellar incision into two big categories: gull wing and stair steps. While each of them has its own proponents, there is no randomized trial, comparing their cosmetic results. There was not any randomize trial to show what is the best type of incision in open rhinoplasty. So, we use both self-rating by patients ,independent physician observers Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and also a validated scar analysis to compare inverted V and stair step incisions.</detailed_description>
