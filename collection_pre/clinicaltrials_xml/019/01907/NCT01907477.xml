	<brief_summary>The aim of the present work is to study the protein expressions profiles of neutropenic patients (with a high risk of invasive mycosis) who developed - versus who did not develop invasive mycosis (principally aspergillosis and candidosis) in order to identify biomarkers for the diagnosis, prognosis and /or prediction of invasive mycosis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Patients with malignant haemopathy who received chemotherapy likely to lead to severe neutropenia (PN&lt;500/mm3) for a foreseeable period of 10 days. Patients aged 14 years or older (no upper age limit) Patients with malignant haemopathy who received an autologous marrow graft. Patients with severe idiopathic medullar aplasia (PN&lt;500/mm3) who need to be hospitalised for at least 10 days consecutively (with or without immunosuppressant treatment). Patients who have provided written informed consent to participate in this study. Patients who received an allograft of marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (given that these patients carry a risk of aspergillosis, which in most cases appears after medullar recovery, they will not be included in the study). Patients who received an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (given that the duration of the neutropenia is often less than 10 days). Patients who do not meet the inclusion criteria Persons not covered by the national Health Insurance Agency</criteria>
