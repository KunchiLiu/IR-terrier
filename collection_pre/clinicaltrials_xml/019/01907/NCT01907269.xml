	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized trial of a tailored intervention designed to provide personalized feedback regarding patients' risk of subsequent fractures, customized information regarding osteoporosis care, and messaging to activate patients to become more engaged in improving osteoporosis treatment and doctor-patient communication. This novel content will use "story-telling" delivered via the Internet and digital video discs (DVDs). The content will be uniquely tailored to each person based on barriers to care, age and race/ethnicity. We will conduct a controlled, cluster-randomized trial of this intervention to determine differences in post-intervention rates of osteoporosis care between two randomization arms. We hypothesize that participants randomized to the intervention arm, compared to those randomized to a control arm, will receive more osteoporosis care at 6 months post-intervention, as evidenced by higher rates of: (H1) Prescription osteoporosis therapies, (H2) Non-prescription therapy with calcium and vitamin D, and (H3) Bone mineral density (BMD) testing.</brief_summary>
