	<brief_summary>Ebstein anomaly is a rare congenital heart disease. It encompasses abnormalities of the tricuspid valve, the right atrium and the right ventricle (RV). Currently, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered the method of choice for the assessment of RV volume and function. To evaluate the right heart function VentriPoint method was designed to assess the RV in a fraction of the time, resulting in better efficacy and lower costs. VentriPoint is approved for Tetralogy of Fallot patients as well as patients with systemic RV in d-transposition of the great arteries. This method uses 2 dimensional standard ultrasound views linked to a VentriPoint Medical Systems unit. After acquisition, the physician identifies anatomical landmarks with dots on a number of the 2D ultrasound views through the heart. With a sensor (magnetic tracking system: GPS) on the ultrasound probe we know where the 2D plane is in 3D space. In this way the precise anatomical landmark is located in 3D space. The aim of the present study is to assess the feasibility, reliability and accuracy of the echocardiographic knowledge-based 3D reconstruction method to measure RV volume and function in patients with Ebstein anomaly. The accuracy of the method will be assessed by comparison with measurements obtained by cardiac MRI. In addition to the right ventricle the investigators want to assess the left ventricular function in patients with Ebstein anomaly in this study. By using speckle tracking echocardiography the investigators would like to investigate on the left ventricular contractility, rotation and synchrony of the left ventricle together with the RV. Not seldom the left ventricle is neglected in a patient with Ebstein anomaly by impressive findings of the right ventricle. Changes in the myocardial left ventricular structure (non compaction) are also described and may have negative impact on the function. The investigators want to analyze 25-30 patients with Ebstein anomaly including children starting at 11 years of age.</brief_summary>
