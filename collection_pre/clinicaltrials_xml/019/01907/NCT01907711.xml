	<brief_title>Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Acupuncture as a Treatment in Patients Diagnosed With CFS.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Headline Goal. Evaluate the effectiveness of true acupuncture (AV) compared to placebo-acupuncture or sham acupuncture (AS) in improving symptoms of patients diagnosed with CFS. Specific objectives: - To assess whether, in patients diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, AV treatment, compared to AS, is associated with a reduction in fatigue as measured by the scale FIS (Fatigue impact Scale). - Check the reduction of pain in patients diagnosed with CFS, following treatment with AS versus AV as measured by the McGill. - To verify the decrease in the use of analgesics in patients diagnosed with CFS, after treatment with the AV versus AS, by counting these drugs. - Evaluate reducing anxiety in patients diagnosed with CFS, following treatment with AS AV against measured by HAD scale. - Assess whether, in patients diagnosed with CFS, treatment with AV compared to AS, is associated with a reduction in depressive symptoms, as measured by the HAD scale. - To assess the improvement in sleep quality in patients diagnosed with CFS, after treatment with AV compared to the AS, as measured by the Pittsburgh scale. - Check the quality improvement of health-related life (HRQOL) in patients diagnosed with CFS, after treatment with AV compared to the AS, as measured by the SF-36 (Short Form-36). Methodology. Design. Pilot clinical trial randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled simulated acupuncture, single-center, prospective, patient and assessor blind. 1:1 randomized trial, the principal investigator unknown randomization to the time the patient is randomized. Primary endpoint. Scores on the fatigue impact scale (FIS) after treatment with two acupuncture techniques. Study population and total number of patients. After signing the informed consent, we included 60 patients diagnosed with CFS, 30 in the intervention group (IG) of real acupuncture and 30 in the control group (CG) of sham acupuncture, applying an individualized treatment plan customized according energy assessment of each patient. Duration of treatment. 4 months. Relevance. This pilot study can demonstrate the effectiveness of acupuncture as a treatment for the symptoms of CFS. The reduction in fatigue, anxiety, depression, pain and reduction in the intake of analgesics with improved sleep quality, after treatment with real acupuncture technique, i results in increased quality of life for the patient suffering from CFS.
