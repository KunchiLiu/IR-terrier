	<brief_summary>The pilot study aims to conduct a randomized pilot trial in a sample of 40 incarcerated women with lifetime interpersonal violence who are 6-10 weeks away from release to demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of the proposed recruitment methods and research design, of the intervention training methods, of delivering the enhanced Women's Coop and nutrition control interventions. Per recent guidance from NIMH, the investigators will also examine 95% confidence intervals around differences between the proposed intervention and a dose-matched control condition (Nutrition Program), for the following outcomes through 8 months post prison release: reduced unprotected vaginal or anal sex occasions and fewer cases of vaginal trichomoniasis (primary); reduced interpersonal violence episodes, symptoms of PTSD and depression, and drug using/heavy drinking days (secondary); and increased affect management and social support (including effectiveness in obtaining substance use, mental health treatment and other resources) (tertiary).</brief_summary>
