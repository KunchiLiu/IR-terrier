	<brief_summary>This study is a non-randomized double cohort study evaluating the impact of social network-based water treatment education on sustained household water treatment behaviors over 12 months of follow up. A three-session curriculum was developed on the spread of water borne illness, water treatment methods, and the role of social support in water treatment. Participants in the intervention arm will receive this curriculum in a group setting, where group members are self-selected members of the study participants' social networks. Participants in the comparison arm will receive the same curriculum taught at the individual household level. All participants will receive CeraMaji ceramic filters for use in household water treatment after participating in the three sessions. Research staff will conduct surveys and water quality testing over a period of 12 months to determine whether participants continue to use the ceramic filters. Investigators hypothesize that social network-based training on household water treatment will result in a higher proportion of households using ceramic filters at 6- and 12-months as compared to households receiving individual training.</brief_summary>
