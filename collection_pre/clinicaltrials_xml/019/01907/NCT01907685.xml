	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT), the maximum administered dose (MAD) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AVE8062 and docetaxel in combination administered sequentially on D1 &amp; D2 respectively every 3 weeks in patients with advanced solid tumors. Secondary Objectives: - To define the overall safety profile of the combination. - To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of AVE8062 and docetaxel when administered in combination. - To evaluate anti-tumor activity of the combination. - To evaluate potential predictive biomarkers. The study includes a tumoral pharmacogenomic sub-study conducted in a subset of sites. The objective to analyse a set of biological biomarkers in order to identify a potential predictive signature of efficacy for AVE8062 in combination with docetaxel.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Escalation, Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study of AVE8062 Combined With Docetaxel in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The duration of study for each patient will include 4-week screening phase prior to first inclusion of study drug, 21-day study treatment cycles, end of treatment visit and follow-up phase. Each patient will be treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or other study discontinuation criteria.</detailed_description>
