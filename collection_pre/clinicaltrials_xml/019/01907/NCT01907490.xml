	<brief_title>Safety and PK Study of Ha44 Gel Under Maximal Use Conditions for Treatment of Head Lice Infestation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) study involving a single application of Ha44 Gel 0.74% administered under maximal use conditions. All participants must have an active head lice infestation (at least 3 live lice) and be 6 months to 17 years of age. The study will enroll approximately 36 pediatric subjects between the ages of 6 months and 17 years. Pediatric PK samples will be collected at 0 (predose), 30 and 60 mins and 2 and 8 hrs time points. More than one household member with an active lice infestation may participate in the study. Eligible subjects will be consented and screened for study eligibility on Day 0 (Visit 1). All subjects will return to the study site for three follow-up clinic visits at Days 1, 7 and 14. The maximum study duration for a subject is 16 days.</detailed_description>
