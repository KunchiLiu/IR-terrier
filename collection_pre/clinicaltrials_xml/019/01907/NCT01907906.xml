	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate radiolabeled recovery and survival of autologous red blood cells (RBC), derived from Mirasol-treated fresh whole blood (WB), stored as leukoreduced packed RBC (LR-pRBC), and re-infused in healthy adult subjects</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inactivation of Whole Blood With Mirasol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a feasibility level study conducted to assess the recovery and survival of autologous, radiolabeled leukoreduced packed red blood cells (LR-pRBC) derived from fresh whole blood (WB) units that have been treated with the Mirasol System for Whole Blood (Mirasol System) and stored for 21 days at 1-6°C.1</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Eligible whole blood donor Age ≥ 18 years, of either sex Able to commit to the study followup schedule Subjects must have adequate bilateral antecubital venous access for WB collection and followup blood draws Negative screening test panel for infectious diseases Subjects of childbearing potential (female or male) must agree to use effective contraceptive during the course of the study per site guidelines Subjects must agree to report adverse events (AEs) during the required reporting period Negative direct antiglobulin test (DAT) with subject's RBC Negative indirect antiglobulin test (IAT) with subject's serum Inclusion for radiolabeled reinfusion of LRpRBC on Day 21 (evaluated the day of, prior to, reinfusion): Maintenance of healthy status Negative direct antiglobulin test (DAT) with subject's RBC (fresh) Negative indirect antiglobulin test (IAT) with subject's serum (fresh) versus autologous stored LRpRBC Negative serum or urine pregnancy test in females Any serious medical illness and/or therapy, including: abnormal bleeding episodes, clotting or bleeding disorder, evidence of anemia, myocardial infarction, uncontrolled hypertension, heart disease, surgery with bleeding complications, epilepsy or any major surgery (with general or spinal anesthesia) within the last 6 months Pregnant or nursing females; For women of childbearing potential, negative serum or urine pregnancy tests at the time of WB donation and before the reinfusion are required Unable to give informed consent Participation currently, or within the last 12 months, in another investigational trial that would potentially interfere with the analysis of this investigation (e.g., pharmaceutical) Have received an accumulated radiation dose that would exclude them from the study according to the local radiation safety limits established by each institution Inability to comply with the protocol in the opinion of the investigator</criteria>
