	<brief_summary>Psychotic symptoms (hallucinations and delusions) are present in several psychiatric and neurological disorders as well as in the general population. Effective treatment strategies for these symptoms in all patients are lacking and treatment-response can presently not be predicted. To date, the exact pathophysiological mechanism of these symptoms remains unknown. By investigating (subtypes) of hallucinations and delusions in all populations, a common pathway may be found, leading to more effective treatment options. Alternatively, different subtypes may be associated with different pathophysiological mechanisms.</brief_summary>
