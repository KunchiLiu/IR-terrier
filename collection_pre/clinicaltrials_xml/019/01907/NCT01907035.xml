DESIGN: Clinical trial, multicenter, prospective, and randomized into two parallel groups. SCOPE AND SUBJECTS: We included a random sample of 246 patients anxious-depressive, mild / moderate, belonging to the target population of 41 doctors from several health centers. INTERVENTION: In the 246 patients randomly assigned to the intervention group, with a standardized program of cognitive behavioral therapy applied by psychologists, by the usual treatment or control group, which will be standard care. MEASUREMENTS: The main result will be changes in general health scores of the SF-36. It will also measure the change in frequency and intensity of anxiety-depressive symptoms on the scales HARS, HDRS, STAI and BDI at baseline and at 2, 6 and 12 months. In addition, also collected for drug use and health services. ANALYSIS: Analyses were performed by intention to treat, comparing the change obtained in both groups at the end of the 12 month follow up. Estimates of the effect attributable to the intervention by the difference in those changes, adjusting in addition to the baseline, the possible confounding covariates or effect modifiers of the intervention, using longitudinal mixed-effects models.</brief_summary>
