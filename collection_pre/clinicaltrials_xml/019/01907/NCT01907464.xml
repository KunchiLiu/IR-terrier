	<brief_summary>Nutritional deprivation of adolescent girls with anorexia nervosa (AN) reduces the bone mass acquisition. A better understanding of this process would improve the medical treatment of bone alteration and its long-term consequences. 160 patients (age &lt; 38 yr) with AN and 160 age-matched controls (CON) will be enrolled in this study. The areal bone mineral density (aBMD) will be determined using dual-X-ray absorptiometry. Calciotropic hormones, bone turnover markers will be concomitantly evaluated.</brief_summary>
