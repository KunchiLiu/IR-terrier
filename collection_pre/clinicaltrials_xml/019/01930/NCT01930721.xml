	<brief_summary>The angle at which an episiotomy can be made is a continuous variable. If the investigators consider midline to be 0 degrees and a lateral episiotomy (never used today) to be 90 degrees, then it is theoretically possible to choose any angle from 0 to 90 degrees.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Incision Angle of Mediolateral Episiotomy at 40 and 60 Degrees</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Episiotomy is a surgical incision to the perineum in order to enlarge the vaginal orifice during the second stage of labor. Although seven types of episiotomy have been described in the literature , the most frequently performed types are the mediolateral and median episiotomies, with the former being the most common one. Despite being a common obstetric practice, the exact definition of a "mediolateral" episiotomy is often unclear. Several studies and reports, however, stated that a significant proportion of the so-claimed mediolateral episiotomy were not actually mediolateral. The current trial compares two angles of mediolateral episiotomy , regarding the risk of third- and fourth-degree perineal tearing, episiotomy-related pain and dyspareunia in primiparous women at a large tertiary maternity center, namely Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital, Cairo, Egypt.</detailed_description>
