	<brief_summary>We are interested in studying whether and how medical problems other than primary cancer before hematopoietic cell transplantation would impact the profiles of quality of life and toxicities post-transplantation for patients with blood cancers. We want to see if by assessing comorbidities (such as diabetes) early on, we can identify those patients who will have more toxicities or limitations in their quality of life after transplant. The generated information could set the stage for future intervention studies aiming to improve quality of life for patients with blood cancers after transplantation.</brief_summary>
