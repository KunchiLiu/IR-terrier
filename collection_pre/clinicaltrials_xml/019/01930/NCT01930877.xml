	<brief_summary>Acute postoperative pain is an unpleasant, unwanted sensory and emotional experience for the patient. The investigators seek to determine if the addition of systemic lidocaine can improve the quality of recovery after spine surgery and reduce the requirement for opiate therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Perioperative Intravenous Lidocaine on Postoperative Quality of Recovery in Patients Undergoing Spine Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consented patients will be randomized to either saline group or lidocaine group. General anesthesia will be induced as it would normally be done in any patient undergoing spine surgery. Once the patient is positioned for the surgery bolus followed by the infusion of either the study drug or the placebo will be administered. The infusion will be stopped at the end of surgery and the patient will be transferred to the post anesthesia care unit. Post operative pain score will be evaluated for the first 24 hrs and also the amount of pain medications used will be recorded. At the end of 24 hours quality of recovery will be assessed using a qor-40 questionnaire.</detailed_description>
