	<brief_title>18F-NaF PET Imaging for Bone Scintigraphy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Technetium-99m (99mTc) is the most widely used radionuclide in diagnostic nuclear medicine studies. It is used in 20 million diagnostic procedures worldwide annually. It became popular as a radioisotope because of its easy availability from a 99Molybdenum (99Mo)/99mTc generator, historic low costs, and previous high availability. The National Research Universal (NRU) reactor at Chalk River Laboratories (Ontario, Canada) was shut down unexpectedly in May 2009 following a leak of heavy water. The NRU reactor supplied approximately a third of the world's demand of 99Mo for 99Mo/99mTc generators used diagnostic nuclear medicine tests. Given the fragility of 99Mo supply, alternative radiopharmaceuticals, such as 18F-Sodium Fluoride (18F-NaF), are attractive options to replace 99mTc bone scans. Several studies suggest that 18F-NaF may be more accurate and more sensitive in the detection of bone metastases than 99mTc bone scans.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All Subject Inclusion Criteria All subjects must have a WHO performance status 02. Subjects ≥ 18/19 years of age (depending on the age of majority in the province where the trial is conducted) For Prostate Cancer: Male subjects requiring a bone scan for evaluation of bone metastasis with one (or more) of the following criteria: Symptomatic subjects with clinically suspected bone metastases based on a history of nonjoint skeletal pain or nonjoint skeletal tenderness on physical examination. The physician must have a high index of suspicion based on history or physical examination, such as night time pain or new onset of pain unexplained by trauma. Such subjects must have a measurable PSA level ≥ 4 ng/mL. Subjects with findings on other examinations (such as plain xray, CT, MRI or bone scintigraphy and others) that are suspicious for bone metastases but not conclusively diagnostic of bone metastases. Asymptomatic subjects with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer[1] and biopsy Gleason sum 8 10 (e.g. scores 3+5, 5+3, 4+4, 4+5, 5+4 or 5+5) prior to treatment. Asymptomatic subjects with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer[1] and biopsy Gleason score (4+3) and either PSA level ≥ 20 or palpable disease (cT2b or greater) prior to treatment. Asymptomatic subjects with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer[1] with PSA level ≥ 20 and palpable disease (any cT2 or greater) prior to treatment. Asymptomatic subjects with a prior history of treated prostate cancer, and rising PSA, with a PSA doubling time &lt; 6 months, and a minimum PSA level ≥ 4 ng/mL Asymptomatic subjects with a prior history of treated prostate cancer, and rising PSA while under androgen deprivation therapy, with a clearly measurable PSA doubling time &lt; 6 months (treatment does not need to be discontinued for eligibility). Notes: [1] Subjects with newly diagnosed prostate cancer who receive androgen deprivation therapy, for a duration of &lt; 6 months at the time of enrolment, prior to radiation therapy or surgery, remain eligible to participate in this study if they meet these inclusion criteria. For Breast Cancer: Subjects (male or female) requiring a bone scan for evaluation of bone metastasis with one (or more) of the following criteria (1923): Symptomatic subjects with clinically suspected bone metastases based on a history of nonjoint skeletal pain or nonjoint skeletal tenderness on physical examination. The physician must have a high index of suspicion based on history or physical examination, such as night time pain or new onset of pain unexplained by trauma. Subjects with findings on other examinations (such as plain xray, CT, MRI or bone scintigraphy and others) that are suspicious for bone metastases but not conclusively diagnostic of bone metastases. Asymptomatic subjects with newly diagnosed extraskeletal metastatic breast cancer (stage IV). Asymptomatic subjects with elevated serum cancer antigen (CA) 15.3 or alkaline phosphatase and newly diagnosed locally advanced breast cancer (Stage III). Asymptomatic subjects with nodal or extraskeletal metastatic relapse during followup after curativeintent therapy. Asymptomatic subjects with new elevation of CA 15.3 or alkaline phosphatase during followup after curativeintent therapy. Subject Exclusion Criteria Pregnancy. Inability to lie supine for the duration of the imaging studies. Subjects previously known for bone metastasis diagnosed by imaging or biopsy.</criteria>
