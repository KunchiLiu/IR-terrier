The primary aim is to determine feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, and the secondary aim is to measure statistical trends on quality of life at 4 months after fracture in community dwelling older adults. In parallel, we will conduct a process evaluation to ascertain key features of the intervention via qualitative interviews of participants and health care professionals involved in delivery of the intervention.</detailed_description>
