	<brief_title>Transcutaneous Electrical Acupoint Stimulation(TEAS) for Hypotension After Spinal Anesthesia in Parturients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients were randomly assigned to 3 groups, receiving TEAS , non-acupoint stimulation or no-stimulation after spinal anesthesia respectively. 1.4 ml of bupivacaine mixed with 0.2ml of 50% glucose was given for spinal anesthesia under lateral position. Then the patient was switched to supine position and the OR table was tilted to the left for 15 degree. The sensory loss level was assessed. The blood pressure and heart rate every 2min were recorded for 30min after spinal anesthesia. The adverse events and use of ephedrine adverse events were recorded as well.</detailed_description>
