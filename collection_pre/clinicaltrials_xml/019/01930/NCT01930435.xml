	<brief_summary>This is a single arm study of the use of a personalized sterile humidification device for 12 weeks for head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy to determine if the usage of this humidification system will result in a decrease in severity in head and neck related quality of life as measured by the MDASI HN subscale following radiation therapy as compared with historical experience. In addition, we are exploring correlative measures using CRP, IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha level measurements as these are directly related to mucositis and presumably related to quality of life as indicated by the patient.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The patients complete MDASI at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. The MDASI is a validated instrument that measures symptom burden and we measure a subscale (HN) as our primary endpoint. The patients are asked to use a personal humidifier daily and complete a weekly diary showing compliance with the humidifier use.</detailed_description>
