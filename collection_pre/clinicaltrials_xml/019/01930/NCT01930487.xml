	<brief_summary>The objective is to evaluate the effects of an antioxidant formula versus placebo on ocular blood flow in a randomized double-blind, crossover design. Based upon preliminary data, it is hypothesized that a dietary supplement containing a variety of ingredients with antioxidant properties will, compared to placebo, increase ocular perfusion pressure, retrobulbar, retinal capillary and choroidal blood flow, and maintain these effects over the course of the treatment period.</brief_summary>

History of chronic or recurrent inflammatory eye diseases or signs of intraocular trauma and/or unreliable applanation tonometry. Severe, unstable or uncontrolled cardiovascular, renal or pulmonary disease History of/or current renal or hepatic impairment. History of/or current bronchial asthma, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sinus bradycardia, second or third degree atrioventricular block, or cardiogenic shock. Recent surgery or surgery planned near study timeline History of bleeding disorder Use of blood thinning medications Use of specified dietary supplements for three weeks prior to study entry and throughout study period.</criteria>
