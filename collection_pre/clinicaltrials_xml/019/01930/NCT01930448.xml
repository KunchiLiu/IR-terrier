	<brief_summary>Gastric bypass (GBP) and laparoscopic adjustable banding (AGB) are common procedures that can result in significant weight loss and significantly improve type 2 diabetes in 40-80% of cases. The mechanism and time course of these changes have not been well studied and are poorly understood. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the potential weight-independent mechanisms of diabetes remission after GBP, by comparing GBP and AGB subjects after similar weight loss.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanisms of Diabetes Control After Weight Loss Surgery, Sub-study #1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All participants will be tested before and then after 10 and 20-30% weight loss after either GBP or AGB surgery. Subjects will undergo an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) an isoglycemic intravenous glucose test (IVGT) to assess the incretin effect, a measure of insulin sensitivity by an intravenous insulin sensitivity test (IVGTT) and body composition measurements.</detailed_description>
