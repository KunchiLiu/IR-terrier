	<brief_summary>The study investigates whether a long-term 25% caloric restriction can prevent onset and/or progression of renal function deterioration, retinal involvement and cardiovascular complications in overweight/obese type 2 diabetic patients, trough the amelioration of concomitant metabolic abnormalities such as visceral obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension and inflammation. The main aim of the study is therefore to evaluate the role of calorie restriction (CR) on subjects at risk of nephropathy. Secondary aims are to better understand the relationship between CR and the following aspects: renal disease and its associated metabolic abnormalities, retinopathy and cardiovascular complications, quality of life and treatment cost.</brief_summary>
