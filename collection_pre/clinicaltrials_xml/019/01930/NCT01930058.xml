	<brief_summary>This adaptive design study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and effect on hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA levels of multiple doses of MK-8876 in participants with HCV infection. The study will consist of 4 parts evaluating participants infected with specific hepatitis C virus genotypes and up to 10 panels allowing for additional participants to enroll in each panel as specified in the study analysis. The hypothesis evaluated in the study is that a ≥2.5 log IU/mL reduction in HCV RNA from Baseline will accompany multiple dose administration of MK-8876 in participants with HCV infection.</brief_summary>
