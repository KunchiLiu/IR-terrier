	<brief_title>Early Routine Catheterisation After Alteplase Fibrinolysis vs. Primary PCI in Acute ST-elevation Myocardial Infarct</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the preferred reperfusion therapy for patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, most patients cannot receive it in a timely fashion as a result of delays associated with patient transfer or catheterization team mobilization. In China, many hospitals still lack PCI facilities nowadays. Even in some large cities, patients have a high chance of presenting to hospitals not providing around-the-clock staffing.In contrast, intravenous thrombolysis is administered to many eligible patients. The advantages of fibrinolysis include easy administration, wide-spread availability and early patency of the infarct-related artery (IRA).According to an investigation carried out from 2001 to 2004, 52.5% of patients with STEMI received thrombolytic therapy as the initial treatment in China. In previous trial, full-dose tenecteplase followed by angioplasty is safe and produces better and earlier myocardial perfusion than primary angioplasty, as demonstrated by the presence of higher rate ST-segment normalization immediately after coronary revascularization and better angiographic reperfusion parameters in this group.Pilot study(EARLY-PCI) of early routine PCI after alteplase fibrinolysis in acute myocardial infarction patients performed by investigator also demonstrated that the therapy of early routine PCI after recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rtPA) thrombolysis was a safe and effective treatment method for Chinese STEMI patients. Based on the results of these two studies, it implies that early routine PCI after rtPA thrombolysis may be an alternative choice for those patients who would have a time delay from medical contact to PCI. And to date, there is no evidence which compare the efficacy and safety of early PCI after alteplase fibrinolysis with primary PCI for these patients in China.For these reasons, we plan to carry out an open, controlled, randomized trial in patients with STEMI to assess whether routine early post alteplase fibrinolysis angioplasty leads to great degree of myocardial salvage and clinical outcomes compared with primary angioplasty among chinese patients with expected time delay of primary PCI.</detailed_description>
