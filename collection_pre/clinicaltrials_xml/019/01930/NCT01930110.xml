	<brief_summary>Closed-loop strategy is composed of three components: glucose sensor to read glucose levels, insulin pump to infuse insulin and a dosing mathematical algorithm to decide on the required insulin dosages based on the sensor's readings. A dual-hormone closed-loop system would regulate glucose levels through the infusion of two hormones: insulin and glucagon. The objective is to compare the efficacy of single-hormone closed-loop strategy and dual-hormone closed-loop strategy at regulating glucose levels during continuous exercise and interval exercise. The investigator hypothesized that dual-hormone closed-loop strategy is superior to single-hormone closed-loop strategy in regulating glucose levels during exercise periods.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Closed-loop Control of Glucose Levels (Artificial Pancreas) During Exercise in Adults With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Closed-loop strategy is composed of three components: glucose sensor to read glucose levels, insulin pump to infuse insulin and a dosing mathematical algorithm to decide on the required insulin dosages based on the sensor's readings. A dual-hormone closed-loop system would regulate glucose levels through the infusion of two hormones: insulin and glucagon. We aim to conduct a randomized two-way cross-over trial comparing single-hormone closed-loop strategy and dual-hormone closed-loop strategy to compare the two interventions during exercise periods in adults with type 1 diabetes. A moderate intensity exercise will be performed for 60 minutes at 60% of the maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max). A high intensity exercise will be 40 minutes of interval training. The interval training will be preceded by a 10 minutes warm-up and followed by a 10 minutes cool down.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males and females ≥ 18 years of old. Clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes for at least one year. The subject will have been on insulin pump therapy for at least 3 months. Last (less than 3 months) HbA1c ≤ 12%. Clinically significant microvascular complications: nephropathy (estimated glomerular filtration rate below 40 ml/min), neuropathy (especially diagnosed gastroparesis) or severe proliferative retinopathy as judged by the investigator. Recent (&lt; 3 months) acute macrovascular event e.g. acute coronary syndrome or cardiac surgery. Ongoing pregnancy. Severe hypoglycemic episode within two weeks of screening. Other serious medical illness likely to interfere with study participation or with the ability to complete the exercise periods by the judgment of the investigator (e.g. orthopedic limitation). Failure to comply with team's recommendations (e.g. not willing to eat snack, not willing to change pump parameters, etc). Problems with venous access</criteria>
