	<brief_summary>Background: After mechanical ventilation, 5-20% of patients with acute respiratory failure would depend on ventilator support more than 14 days because of critical-illness weakness and their underlying diseases such as heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Hypothesis: Electric muscle stimulation(EMS) will improve their muscle strength and shorten their ventilator days. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Adult patients with mechanical ventilation more than 14 days are eligible. EMS would be applied in experimental group 32 minutes/day on their bilateral thigh.</brief_summary>
