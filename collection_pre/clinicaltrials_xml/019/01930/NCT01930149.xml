	<brief_summary>Cholesterol screening is an important prerequisite for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment. Cholesterol screening is recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Since reminder systems have been shown to modestly improve the rates of preventive services, including in safety net settings, we will implement patient-directed reminders to health center patients who meet our eligibility criteria. The aim of this study is to determine if a mailed outreach message and facilitated ordering of screening lipid tests increases cholesterol screening test completion within 3 months among federally qualified community health center patients who are eligible for screening compared to usual care.</brief_summary>
