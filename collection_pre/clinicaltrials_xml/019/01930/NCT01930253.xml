	<brief_summary>Autoimmune cytopenias are a significant complication observed after hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) and carries a substantial rate of morbidity and mortality. This entity is usually challenging to treat, resulting in prolonged hospitalization and predisposes patients to complications either directly due to the specific cytopenia or due to the immune suppression that is part of its therapeutic management. One of the mediators of refractory autoimmune cytopenias are antibodies produced by plasma cells, which are historically challenging to target. The purpose of this study is to use a proteasome inhibitor called Bortezomib for the treatment of refractory autoimmune cytopenias after HCT, and monitor the clinical response. This is a pilot study which will enroll 5 patients over 2 years, prospectively. Our hypothesis is that bortezomib will effectively target plasma cells and successfully treat refractory autoimmune cytopenias. This will be a relevant study as it will be the first step in establishing a novel therapeutic modality and potentially reducing length of hospitalization and degree of immune suppression for refractory autoimmune cytopenias.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All patients, having undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation at our center. Should have failed at least 2 standard treatments for autoimmune cytopenias. Standard treatments include corticosteroids, rituximab, IVIG, plasmapheresis, withdrawal of cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide and MMF. Definition of "failed" treatment will be no response of cytopenia after 2 weeks of continued treatment OR requirement of daily GCSF at 10 mcgs/kg/day for autoimmune neutropenia despite 2 weeks of treatment, transfusions of packed red blood cells or platelets 3 times weekly for 2weeks despite continued treatment OR 5days/week plasmapheresis for 2 weeks and inability to wean the duration. Definition of autoimmune hemolytic anemia development of anemia, where there is a hemoglobin drop of &gt;2 g/dL/48 hours or an absolute value of hemoglobin &lt; 8 g/dL, and evidence of hemolysis by positive direct Coombs test with compatible peripheral blood cell morphology, reticulocyte count and bilirubin level. Definition of autoimmune neutropenia absolute neutrophil counts &lt; 500 for 2 weeks and presence of antineutrophil antibodies. Definition of autoimmune thrombocytopenia Platelet counts &lt; 20,000 cells/uL for 2 weeks and presence of antiplatelet antibodies. Ongoing life threatening infections Documented anaphylaxis to bortezomib Failed engraftment Relapse of primary malignancy â‰¥6/8 matched or haploidentical transplants</criteria>
