	<brief_summary>There are numerous reported ways to treat chronic subdural hematomas (CSDH) and practice is still differing considerably between departments. Except for a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) that found that postoperative subdural drainage was better than no drain, there is no higher level evidence. Another recent RCT did not replicate these findings, but the study was severely underpowered. Aim of this population based study is to compare clinical results (reoperation rates, complications, perioperative death, and survival) between neurosurgical departments treating CSDH with different treatment policies.</brief_summary>
