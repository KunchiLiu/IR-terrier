	<brief_title>Intervention to Promote Survivor Resilience and Adjustment: Efficacy Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To design effective resilience interventions, a treatment modality which is effective for traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors is needed. Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) researchers have had considerable success in the past several decades developing and evaluating interventions for neurobehavioral, cognitive, and vocational challenges after TBI. Researchers have demonstrated the utility of the curriculum-based (C-B) treatment structure in various settings. Additionally, the efficacy of the C-B structure, independent of postinjury timeframe, allows the flexibility necessary to address the unique consequences of TBI. The C-B treatment modality offers a promising strategy for the promotion of resilience postinjury. The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a structured, curriculum-based intervention to promote postinjury resilience and adjustment. Objectives include: 1. to evaluate the short and longer-term efficacy of a structured outpatient intervention program (The Resilience and Adjustment Intervention, RAI) to improve survivors' resilience 2. to evaluate the impact of treatment on emotional well-being and postinjury adjustment 3. to evaluate the impact of the intervention on abilities including problem solving, communication, and stress management 4. to examine the extent to which treatment benefits are sustained in the longer-term</detailed_description>
