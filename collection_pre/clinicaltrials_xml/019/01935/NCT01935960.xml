	<brief_title>Retinoid 9cUAB30 in Preventing Cancer in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the toxicities and recommended phase II dose of 9cUAB30 (retinoid 9cUAB30). II. To characterize the urine and plasma single dose and steady state pharmacokinetics of 9cUAB30 in normal volunteers. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To correlate the pharmacokinetics of 9cUAB30 with toxicity. II. To compare observed toxicity between placebo controls and each dose level. III. To assess for any change in single dose pharmacokinetics (PK) after repeat dosing (day 1 vs. day 36). OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Participants receive retinoid 9cUAB30 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1 and 8-36. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Participants receive a placebo PO QD on days 1 and 8-36. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 7 and 30 days.</detailed_description>
