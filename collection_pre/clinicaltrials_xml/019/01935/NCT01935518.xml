	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial of Safety and Efficacy of Fasudil in Subjects With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open labeled, single center clinical study with placebo of historical researches as control. 10 patients will be enrolled in the study. The basic treatment is riluzole, 50mg twice a day. For the procedure, patients will take fasudil treatment for 14 days (30mg twice a day, intravenous). 3 months later, patients will repeat the fasudil treatment. All the patients will be followed up for 6 months. The primary outcome was the decline rate of ALSFRS-R. The secondary outcomes are the survival time, endpoint time(death, tracheotomy and continuous ventilator-dependent), forced vital capacity (FVC), the short form health survey (SF-36), evaluation of cognitive function (verbal fluency and Frontal Behavioral Inventory Scale) and safety.</detailed_description>
