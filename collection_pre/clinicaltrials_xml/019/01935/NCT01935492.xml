	<brief_summary>An open randomized phase III study to compare 8 continuous cycles of chemotherapy with 8 cycles of intermittent (2 times 4 cycles) chemotherapy in first line treatment, in combination with bevacizumab, and second line treatment of patients with HER2/neu negative, incurable, metastatic or unresectable locally advanced breast cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary goal of this non-inferiority trial is to determine if the results obtained with a intermittent chemotherapy regimen (2 x 4 cycles of paclitaxel) are not inferior to the results of a continuous chemotherapy regimen (8 cycles of paclitaxel), both combined with bevacizumab in first line treatment of patients with HER2/neu negative, incurable, metastatic or unresectable locally advanced breast cancer.</detailed_description>

Significant vascular disease within 6 months prior to day 1. Any previous venous thromboembolism &gt; CTC Grade 3. History of haemoptysis History or evidence of inherited bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy with the risk of bleeding.
