	<brief_summary>Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and heart failure are highly influenced by the presence of systemic inflammation. Doxycycline is a FDA-approved drug to treat bacterial infections which also shows powerful anti-inflammatory effects. In this study we plan to determine the effects of Doxycycline in patients with stable heart failure and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy on peak of aerobic exercise capacity (peak V02) and ventilator efficiency measured with a cardiopulmonary test.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this study of Safety and Efficacy of Doxycycline in Patients with Non-Ischemic Cardiomyopathy Population, we will enroll 24 patients with a clinical diagnosis of heart failure and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (recent imaging study documenting LV ejection fraction &lt;50%, and no history of coronary or ischemic heart disease) in a single-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial with allocation 1:1:1 to Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily or Doxycycline 20 mg twice daily or Placebo for 2 weeks.</detailed_description>
