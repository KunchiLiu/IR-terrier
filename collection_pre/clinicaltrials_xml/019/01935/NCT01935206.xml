	<brief_summary>Recent studies have focused on the role of endogenous opioids on central sensitization. Central sensitization is known to be impaired or altered in chronic pain conditions, as fibromyalgia or chronic tension headache. Animal studies have shown reinstatement of mechanical hypersensitivity following naloxone administration after resolution of an injury. This suggests latent sensitization. In the present study, investigators hypothesize that naloxone (2 mg/kg) can reinstate secondary hyperalgesia 168 hours after a first-degree burn-injury. Investigators aim therefore to show that latent sensitization is present in humans and is modulated by endogenous opioids.</brief_summary>
