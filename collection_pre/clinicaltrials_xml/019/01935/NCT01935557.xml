	<brief_title>Randomized Comparison of Continuous and Intermittent Heparin Infusion During Catheter Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intravenous heparin was used during the procedure to prevent catheter-induced thrombosis. heparin is administered during the procedure to achieve recommended activation clotting times (ACT) values, typically &gt;300 seconds to prevent thromboemboli during the procedure. Most of the practitioners was that ACT level should be checked at 30- to 60-minute intervals and then have injected intermittently. intermittent heparin infusion, concentration is great changed because the heparin has 30minutes half-period. researchers postulate that a constant therapeutic concentrations would be beneficial to continuous infusion than intermittent infusion.</detailed_description>
