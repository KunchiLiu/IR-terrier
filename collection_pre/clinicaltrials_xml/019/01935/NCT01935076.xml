	<detailed_description>MicroRNA's are a class of non-coding RNA's that function as translational repressors and are thought to modulate tissue development, proliferation, differentiation and function. Differential expression of certain placental miRNA's has been associated with preeclampsia. The fetal origins of adult disease hypothesis suggests that risk factors from intrauterine environmental exposures affect the fetus' development during sensitive periods, and increases the risk of specific diseases in adult life. Our aim is to understand factors that predispose fetuses to fetal overgrowth in utero, especially in women with obesity. The objective of the study is to identify miRNA which are differentially expressed in the placenta and cord blood of pregnancies that are affected by fetal macrosomia to determine factors that may predispose fetuses to fetal overgrowth.</detailed_description>
