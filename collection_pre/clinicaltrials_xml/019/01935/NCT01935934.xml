	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well cabozantinib-s-malate works in treating patients with endometrial cancer that has come back (recurrent) or has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Cabozantinib-s-malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cabozantinib-S-Malate in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine efficacy of single agent cabozantinib-s-malate (cabozantinib) in women previously receiving one line of chemotherapy for metastatic endometrial cancer or with progression within 12 months of completing adjuvant therapy, with co-primary endpoints of objective response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and progression-free-survival at 12 weeks (PFS). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Correlation of clinical response with: baseline molecular status of archival tumor (hepatocyte growth factor receptor [c-met] amplification &amp; mutation status). OUTLINE: Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 weeks.</detailed_description>

patients must have radiographic evidence of disease progression following the most recent line of treatment Prior therapy: Eligible subjects must have had 1 line of systemic cytotoxic treatment; this may be adjuvant therapy with documented progression within 12 months of completion, or 1 line of cytotoxic therapy for metastatic disease;

women of childbearing potential include women who have experienced menarche and who have not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or are not postmenopausal; postmenopausal is defined as amenorrhea &gt;= 12 consecutive months; note: women who have been amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, antiestrogens, ovarian suppression or any other reversible reason Women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; sexually active subjects must agree to use medically accepted barrier methods of contraception (e.g., male or female condom) during the course of the study and for 4 months after the last dose of study drug(s), even if oral contraceptives are also used; all subjects of reproductive potential must agree to use both a barrier method and a second method of birth control during the course of the study and for 4 months after the last dose of study drug(s) Patients must consent to analysis on archival tissue;
