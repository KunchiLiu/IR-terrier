	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether HB-Vac Activated-DCs Combined With Peg-IFN or NAs has more efficacy than Peg-IFN or NAs alone in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B patients</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial on HB-Vac Activated-DCs Combined With Peg-IFN or NAs in CHB</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The 450 patients meeting the entry criteria are divided into 6 groups, the clinical trial procedure is divided into 3 parts, according to the following steps: Part1 (0-12W): 1. The research objects will be grouped according to the principle of a multicenter, randomized, open, parallel controlled clinical trial, 300 cases of cell therapy groups (100 cases with PEG-IFN treatment, LdT treatment for 100 cases, ETV treatment for 100 cases), 150 cases of control groups (PEG-IFN therapy in 50 cases, LdT therapy for 50 cases, ETV treatment for 50 cases). Part2 (12-36W): 2. Cell therapy groups: enter the HBsAg sensitized dendritic cells activated T cells (HBsAg Pulse DCs-T, HPDCs-T) immune therapy combined with interferon (IFN) or nucleoside analogues treatment (NAs), infusion of HPDC-T every 2 weeks for 1 time, total 12 times. 3. Control groups: antiviral therapy used only (IFN or NAs). Part3 (36-72W): 4. The observation stage: discontinuation of interferon in the treatment of 48 weeks; NAs cases will continue on treatment with NAs. HPDCs-T produced procedure: The first step: 1-7 days Monocytes will be isolated from peripheral blood of patients. The monocytes obtained will be then incubated in fresh serum-free AIM-V medium (Gibco) containing 800U/ml of GM-CSF and 400U/ml of IL-4 (Peprotech) for 5 days. After 5 days of culture in vitro, The DCs induced will be cultured with a commercially available hepatitis B vaccine containing 10 ug of HBsAg (GSK) for 2 days. The second step: 8-14 days The hepatitis B vaccine sensitized DCs (HPDCs) (from the first step) will be sub-cultured with patient's own PBMCs for 7 days: HBsAg can be efficiently presented to PBMCs by DCs, with producing HBV specific CTLs and HTLs (HPDCs-T). The third step: 15 days The PBMCs (the second step) containing enough HPDCs-T will be transfused back into the patient.</detailed_description>
