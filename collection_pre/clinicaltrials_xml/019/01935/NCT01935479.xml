	<brief_title>A Phase I Study of AK159 in Healthy Postmenopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consists of two parts: Part 1 and Part 2. The Part 1 is a single-center, randomized, 2-way crossover study that investigates the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of teriparatide after a single dose of AK159 (5 levels) and estimates the relative bioavailability of AK159 with subcutaneous teriparatide acetate in healthy post-menopausal women. The Part 2 is a multiple-center, randomized, double-blind, positive- and placebo-controlled, parallel study that compares the pharmacokinetics, bone makers, safety, and tolerability of teriparatide after a weekly doses of AK159 (4 levels) for 6 weeks with placebo and a weekly doses of subcutaneous teriparatide acetate in healthy post-menopausal women.</detailed_description>
