	<brief_summary>This clinical study is composed of two steps. The first step aims at validating the pharmacokinetic approach based on the magnesium concentration in erythrocyte and plasma. According to these results and if this pharmacokinetic approach is validated, the second step will set up. The second phase aims at comparing the relative bioavailability of magnesium administrated by two different drug formulations: ChronoMag Smart Tablet® (two tablets50mg) versus Mag2® (three tablets100mg).</brief_summary>
