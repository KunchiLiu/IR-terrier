	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to develop and pilot-test a guided cognitive-behavioral self-help program for mild-to-moderate depression in Parkinson's disease (dPD). We will pilot-test the guided self-help treatment on 20 people with PD and their caregivers. The manual will be revised based on participant feedback. Several feasibility measures regarding the guided self-help program (i.e., recruitment, retention, enjoyment, helpfulness, adherence) will also be assessed. Moreover, preliminary estimates of effect size for this guided self-help program will be calculated and used in future research. We hypothesize that people with PD will report decreases in depression, anxiety, and negative thoughts and improvements in quality life and sleep and that caregivers will report decreases in burden after participating in the guided self-help program</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To our knowledge, Cognitive-Behavioral self-help interventions remain unexplored for depression in PD to date. The results of this study will be used to support future treatment development efforts for depression and other psychiatric complications in PD that may improve the access to and quality of mental health care in this medical population.</detailed_description>
