	<brief_summary>The role of post surgery adjuvant chemotherapy is becoming more and more important in AGC (advance gastric cancer). S-1 and combined therapy of Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin are currently accepted as a standard therapy among the AGC patients who were performed gastrectomy from the D2 surgery. However, many improvements will be needed in stage IIIB and IV. Combined chemotherapy of Docetaxel, Capecitabine, and Oxaliplatin may be considered as one of the best treatments for IIB and IV(M0) stage AGC patients who were performed gastrectomy.</brief_summary>
