	<brief_title>Treatment With Rosuvastatin Versus Switching PI (Protease Inhibitor) in Patients HIV With High Cholesterol Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To compare the effects of rosuvastatin to protease inhibitor switching on: - Total cholesterol through week 12 - Safety parameters (HIV viral load, clinical adverse events, serious adverse events, laboratory adverse events, modifications to antiretroviral therapy) - Quality of life (SF-12) - Fasting LDL cholesterol (estimated with Friedewald equation unless triglycerides &gt;400mg/dL, in which case LDL-C would be measured directly), HDL cholesterol, total : HDL cholesterol ratio, LDL particles sizes, triglycerides - Fasting glucose and insulin - Framingham cardiovascular risk score - D:A:D 5-year estimated risk calculator</detailed_description>
