	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, randomized, evaluator and subject blinded, parallel-group, controlled study intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of treating obese patients with the placement of g-Cath EZ suture anchors followed by a structured diet and exercise plan as compared to a sham procedure followed by the same diet and exercise plan. Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to the treatment procedure followed by diet and exercise or the sham procedure followed by diet and exercise. After un-blinding at 12 months post-treatment, sham patients can choose to have the treatment procedure as well.</brief_summary>
