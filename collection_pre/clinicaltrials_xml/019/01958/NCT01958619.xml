	<brief_summary>A healthy volunteer study to characterise the exposure of the two study medications, following administration of OZ439 + TPGS granules with piperaquine phosphate granules (intended for children) and with piperaquine phosphate tablets (intended for adults). Ideally, to confirm the exposure demonstrated in an earlier bioavailability study.</brief_summary>
