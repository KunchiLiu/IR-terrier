	<brief_summary>In a double blinded, randomized, clinical trial of patients suffering from STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction) or non-STEMI (non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction)compare the effect of 3 months of dietary supplement with bilberry extract on a range of parameters with prognostic importance in cardiovascular disease: lipids, inflammation, oxidative stress and heart function. Following inclusion of 8 individuals and as of February 12, 2014: Due to intolerance to "bilberry placebo powder" we have amended to the protocoll that the trial design is changed from blinded to open and that the bilberry arm of the trial carries on in an open design and that the control group will receive no dietary supplement.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients with a diagnosis of STEMI as defined by chest pain suggestive for myocardial ischemia for at least 30 minutes before hospital admission, time from onset of symptoms of less than 24 hours, and an ECG with new STsegment elevation in two or more contiguous leads of ≥0.2 mV in leads V2V3 and/or ≥0.1 mV in other leads or a probable newonset left bundle branch block. Patients with a diagnosis of nonSTEMI as defined by a combination of; onset of symptoms such as central chest pain or an aggravated angina pectoris, with or without an ECG change with STsegment lowering or an inverted Twave, and at least two values with levels of troponinT or troponinI above the established margin of an MI.
