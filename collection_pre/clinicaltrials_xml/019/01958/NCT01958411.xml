	<brief_summary>- Vascular inflammation is a key factor in both the pathogenesis and outcome of atherosclerosis. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is a promising tool for identifying and quantifying vascular inflammation within atherosclerotic plaques. - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely associated with many cardiometabolic risk factors. NAFLD can be detected by measuring liver fat accumulation using computed tomography (CT). - Also epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) volume as determined by computed tomography (CT) is an independent marker of cardiovascular events in the general population. - Therefore, the purpose of this investigators study is to compare the NAFLD severity and EAT volume with FDG uptake measured by PET/CT.</brief_summary>
