	<brief_title>A Study of Adalimumab After Dose Escalation in Japanese Subjects With Crohn's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects who are confirmed to meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria during screening period (≤ 21 days) will be given subcutaneous injections of open-label adalimumab 80 mg eow from Week 0 to Week 50.

	<criteria>Subject ≥ 15 years of age at the time of informed consent. Subject with Crohn's disease who received induction treatment of commercially available Humira® (160 mg initially and 80 mg at 2 weeks after initial dose), achieved response after initial dose, and then lost response during maintenance treatment with Humira®. Subject with elevated Creactive Protein (CRP) at Screening. If female, subject is either not of childbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal for at least 1 year or surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy) or is of childbearing potential and is practicing an approved method of birth control throughout the study and for 150 days after the last dose of study drug. Subject has a negative tuberculosis (TB) screening assessment. If the subject has evidence of a latent TB infection; the subject must initiate and complete a minimum of 21 days of an ongoing TB prophylaxis (in such case, screening period can be prolonged until 21 days past after initiation of prophylaxis and study drug is administered) or have documented completion of a full course of TB prophylaxis, prior to Week 0.
