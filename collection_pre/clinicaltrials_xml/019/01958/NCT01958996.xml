	<brief_summary>R-CHOP with doxorubicin is the standard first line treatment of high grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In order to avoid central venous system insertion and reduce hospitalization time in elderly patients, we developed an oral chemotherapy treatment: " OROCIEP"trial. Nineteen patients were enrolled and 127 chemotherapy cycles were available for toxicities. The estimated two-years overall survival was 74%. The main haematological toxicity was neutropenia. This study is still ongoing to confirm recommended dose of oral anthracycline.</brief_summary>
