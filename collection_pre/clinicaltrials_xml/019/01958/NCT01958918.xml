	<brief_summary>This is a 12-month, phase IV, randomized, open label, multicenter study to compare efficacy of 0.5 mg ranibizumab pro re nata treatment versus 2 mg aflibercept bimonthly intravitreal injections on central retinal thickness (CRT) stability as measured by mean CRT fluctuations between month 3 and month 6 of treatment by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and explore functional outcomes up to month 12 in patients with neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Approximately 500 patients will be randomized in Europe.</brief_summary>
