	<brief_title>Regulation of Intestinal and Hepatic Lipoprotein Production by Glucagon Like Peptide 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study A: Using constant feeding with a nasoduodenal tube and stable isotope infusion, mathematical modelling will be utilised to measure lipoprotein production and clearance. The lipoproteins assessed will be apoB-100 from the liver and apoB-48 from the intestine. StudyB: Volunteers will be given a liquid meal with retinyl palmitate (vitamin A) to label chylomicrons made from the meal. 7 hours later they will be given GLP-2 or placebo. Measurements of plasma and TRL(triglyceride rich lipoprotein) triglyceride and TRL retinyl palmitate will be carried out to see whether GLP-2 increases these parameters.</detailed_description>
