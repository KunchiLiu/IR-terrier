	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and antiviral efficacy of sofosbuvir (SOF) with ribavirin (RBV) in participants with GT 1 and 3 and ledipasvir (LDV)/SOF in participants with genotype 1 and 4 HCV infection who have chronic renal insufficiency (impaired kidney function). Approximately 35 subjects with severe renal insufficiency (not on dialysis) will be enrolled in 3 cohorts. - Cohort 1 (GT 1 or 3): 10 subjects will receive SOF 200 mg + RBV 200 mg once daily for 24 weeks. - Cohort 2 (GT 1 or 3): Following review of safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics (PK) data through post-treatment Week 4 of Cohort 1, 10 additional subjects will receive SOF 400 mg + RBV 200 mg once daily for 24 weeks. - Cohort 3 (GT 1 or 4): Following review of safety and available PK data through Week 12 of Cohort 2, 15 additional subjects will receive LDV/SOF 90/400 mg once daily for 12 weeks.</brief_summary>
