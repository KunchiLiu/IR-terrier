	<brief_summary>So far, the liver has been the main target for cholesterol elimination. However, several recent studies performed in mice have described a new route of cholesterol excretion, the Trans-Intestinal Cholesterol Excretion or TICE. TICE allows direct elimination of plasma cholesterol in the feces directly via the intestine. Until now, only indirect evidence suggests that TICE is also active in humans, the goal of this proof of concept study is to provide the first proof of its existence in humans by using stable isotopes in patients with bile duct diversion.</brief_summary>
