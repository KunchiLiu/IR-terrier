	<brief_summary>We propose the additional technique of lingual traction or "tongue pulling" in conjunction with use of the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope for facilitating successful first attempts at and decreasing time to intubation of the difficult airway and rescuing otherwise failed intubation attempts. Induction of general anesthesia causes relaxation and approximation of the soft palate, base of the tongue, epiglottis, and posterior pharyngeal wall, creating unfavorable anatomic changes in the pharynx for successful intubation. The use of lingual traction can assist in diminishing these problems by clearing the tongue away from the soft palate and uvula and lifting the epiglottis from the posterior pharyngeal wall, especially in the unanticipated difficult airway patient.</brief_summary>
