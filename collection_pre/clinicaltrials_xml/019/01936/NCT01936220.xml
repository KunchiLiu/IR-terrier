	<brief_summary>Objective: to evaluate the effectiveness of specialised and sustained intervention with or without parent groups during the initial phase of schizophrenia or related disorders on relapse prevention Methods: A three conditions randomized trial with a duration of five years Participants: 200 consecutively referred patients aged 15-28 years with a first psychotic episode of schizophrenia or related disorder Treatment-conditions: Specialized Treatment of early schizophrenia (ST), ST including Parent groups (ST+P) and Treatment As Usual (TAU). Outcome-measures: cumulative relapse rates and time to first relapse after first remission. Secondary outcome measure: social functioning. Statistical analysis: cumulative relapse rates using life-table methods. The effect of the three interventions on time to first relapse after remission will be compared using Cox regression analysing intention to treat (ITT) grouping.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Relapse Prevention in First Episode Schizophrenia: a 5 Year Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evidence for optimal duration and necessary ingredients of early and sustained specialized treatment from first episode psychosis till the end of the initial phase schizophrenia is still insufficient. Randomized trials with a treatment duration of six months to two years with favorable symptomatic and psychosocial results disappeared at five year follow-up. Other studies suggest that specialized treatment should last 5 years in order to be able to prevent instead of only delaying clinical and psychosocial deteriorating. In this study we examine both the symptomatic (relapse) and psychosocial outcome of a three armed five year randomized trial in the initial phase of schizophrenia.</detailed_description>
