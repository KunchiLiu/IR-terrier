	<criteria>The female subject has a diagnosis of one of the following: a) lowgrade serous ovarian or peritoneal carcinoma, or grade 1 serous ovarian or peritoneal carcinoma or welldifferentiated serous ovarian or peritoneal carcinoma or b) serous borderline ovarian or peritoneal tumor, ovarian or peritoneal tumor of lowmalignant potential, ovarian or peritoneal atypical proliferative serous tumor that recurs as low grade serous carcinoma or has invasive peritoneal implants. The subject had at least one prior line of systemic therapy and has a tumor, which is not amenable to potentially curative surgical resection. The subject has measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. The subject is at least 18 years old. The subject has read and understood the written informed consent form (ICF) and is willing and able to give informed consent, fully understands the requirements of the trial and is willing to comply with all trial visits and assessments, including completion of patientreported measures. Consent must be given before any trial related activities. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at the screening visit. Women of childbearing potential must be willing to avoid pregnancy by using an adequate method of contraception for 2 weeks prior to screening, during and at least 3 months after the last dose of trial medication. Other protocol defined inclusion criteria may apply. The subject has previously been treated with a PI3K inhibitor and taken off treatment due to treatment related AEs. The subject has been previously treated with a Mitogenactivated protein/extracellular signalregulated kinase (MEK) inhibitor. Any anticancer therapy or treatment incorporating chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, or biologic therapy within 28 days of the start of trial treatment or within 5 times the half life of such treatment, whichever is shorter. Treatment with nitrosoureas or mitomycin C are exceptions to this for which a treatment interval of at least 6 weeks is required The subject has not recovered from toxicity due to prior therapy to Baseline level or National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE v4.0) Grade 1 or less (except alopecia). Residual chemotherapyinduced neuropathy grade less than equal to (&lt;=) 2 is permitted. The subject has poor organ and marrow function as defined in the protocol. The subject has creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation NCI CTCAE grade greater than equal to (&gt;=) 2, and/or a previous history of myositis or rhabdomyolysis. The subject has difficulty swallowing, malabsorption or other chronic gastrointestinal disease or conditions that may hamper compliance and/or absorption of the trial drug. Subjects requiring total parenteral nutrition are to be excluded. The subject has a history of delayed healing/open wounds or diabetic ulcers. The subject has a history of congestive heart failure, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac conduction abnormalities including Fridericia corrected QT interval (QTcF) prolongation of &gt; 480 milliseconds (ms) or a pacemaker, clinically relevant impaired cardiovascular function (New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV) or stroke within 3 months prior to enrollment. The subject has a history of retinal degenerative disease (hereditary retinal degeneration or agerelated macular degeneration), uveitis or retinal vein occlusion (RVO), or has other relevant abnormalities identified on screening opthalmologic examination, which may increase the risk of serous retinal detachment (SRD) or RVO. The subject has a history of uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to an active infection, hypertension, or uncontrolled diabetes (e.g. glycosylated hemoglobin &gt;= 8 percent [%]) that would limit compliance with treatment requirements. Any previous malignancy treated with curative intent and the subject has been disease free for less than 5 years prior to randomization, with exception of Carcinoma‐in‐situ of the cervix, Squamous carcinoma of the skin, Basal cell carcinoma of the skin. Other protocol defined exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
