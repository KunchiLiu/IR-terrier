	<criteria>1. Patients ≥ 18 years of age with histologically confirmed, recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer 2. Disease progression during or within 6 months of previous platinumbased chemotherapy including the following 4 categories: 1. Primary platinumrefractory: Previously untreated patients who do not achieve at least a partial response to platinumbased chemotherapy 2. Primary platinumresistant: Previously untreated patients who have achieved at least a partial response to platinumbased chemotherapy but experience a relapse within a period of 6 months of its conclusion 3. Secondary platinumrefractory: Previously treated patients have a relapse 6 months after the conclusion of chemotherapy, but fail to achieve at least a partial response 4. Secondary platinumresistant: Previously treated patients have a relapse 6 months after the conclusion of chemotherapy, achieve at least a partial response with platinumbased therapy as 2ndline therapy, but experience relapse within 6 months 3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score ≤ 2 and a life expectancy &gt;3 months. 4. Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1500 mm^3, platelet count ≥ 100×10^9 L, hemoglobin ≥ 8.5 g/dL 5. Serum creatinine ≤1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range, total bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL, AST/ALT ≤ 5 times the upper limit of normal range 6. No remaining grade 2 or higher toxicity from prior cancer therapies unless judged to be clinically insignificant by the Principal Investigator 7. At least three (3) weeks from prior chemotherapy 1. Inadequate renal function with a calculated creatinine clearance less than 51 mL/min 2. Uncontrolled cardiac disease, congestive heart failure, angina, or hypertension 3. Myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 2 months of treatment 4. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or chronic active Hepatitis B or C (patients are NOT required to be tested for the presence of such viruses prior to therapy on this protocol) 5. Thrombotic or embolic events such as a cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic attacks, pulmonary embolism within the past 6 months 6. Bleeding diathesis or significant coagulopathy 7. Pulmonary hemorrhage/bleeding event ≥ CTCAE Grade 2 within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug 8. Any other hemorrhage/bleeding event ≥ CTCAE Grade 3 within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug 9. History of fistula, GI perforation, or intrabdominal abscess 10. Serious nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture 11. clinical signs or symptoms of GI obstruction and/or requirement for parenteral hydration or nutrition 12. Known CNS disease except for treated brain metastasis 13. Known platinum drug allergy 14. Prior treatment with Platinum + Gemcitabine + Avastin, Gemcitabine + Avastin or Gemcitabine alone 15. Prior treatment with more than three (3) lines of chemotherapy including adjuvant chemotherapy 16. Major surgery, open biopsy or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks of first study drug 17. Inability to complete informed consent process and adhere to the protocol treatment plan and followup requirements 18. Concurrent severe illness such as active infection, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit safety and compliance with study requirements</criteria>
