	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare two models of substance abuse treatment in Vietnam, and how they each affect HIV care. In Vietnam, the current model for treating people with HIV who are also dependent on opioids is to refer them to methadone maintenance treatment centers. The new model the protocol will study is treatment of HIV and opioid dependence with buprenorphine/naloxone and counseling in the HIV clinic.</brief_summary>
