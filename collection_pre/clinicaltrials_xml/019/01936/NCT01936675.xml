	<brief_title>Myocardial Infarction Genes (MI-GENES) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to randomize patients to 2 arms. The first arm will receive the conventional Framingham risk score for coronary heart disease while the intervention arm will receive the genetics-informed risk for coronary artery disease. The investigators will assess baseline blood lipid levels and follow the 2 arms up to 6 months after randomization. Primary endpoint is change in LDL levels between the 2 arms. Secondary outcomes include blood pressure control, weight, smoking cessation, and other lifestyle modifications. This trial will help us understand whether coronary artery disease risk derived from genetic information would have a significant impact on patients' perception of coronary artery disease risk and motivate healthy lifestyle modifications that reduce their long term risk.</detailed_description>
