	<brief_summary>The investigators evaluate the effectiveness of the application of continuous passive motion device for hand rehabilitation in two classes of patients: with a residual active motion and without a residual active motion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Robot-assisted Rehabilitation of Hand by Paralysis of the Upper Limb After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will conduct a double blind clinical trial. A sample size calculation were performed to determine the necessary number of subjects needed for this study and was based upon the results of a previous pilot study. All patients had functional impairments of their upper extremities after the stroke. We hypothesized that the hand-rehabilitation oriented with robotics assistance, would improve edema by paralysis of the upper limb even in patient without sensory pathway recovery.</detailed_description>
