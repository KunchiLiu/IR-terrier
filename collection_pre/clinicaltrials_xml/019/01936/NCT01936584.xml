	<brief_summary>A multicenter observational study trial validating Quality of Life assessment using EuraHS Quality of Life score and Carolinas Comfort scale™ in patients before and after laparoscopic unilateral inguinal hernia repair. Depending on the treating physician patients will receive a TAPP or TEP repair for their inguinal hernia and a self-gripping mesh will be used for the repair (Parietex Progrip Mesh). Primary endpoint will be assessment by the EuraHS-QoL at 1 year after laparoscopic repair of an unilateral inguinal hernia using the Anatomic ProGrip™ Laparoscopic self-fixating mesh. Secondary endpoints are assessment of the QoL 3 preoperative, 3 weeks and 1 year postoperative, recurrence rate at 12 months, intra-operative and post-operative complications, post-operative hospital stay, operation time and time to place the mesh, VAS (Visual Analog Scale) for pain at several control points, VRS (Verbal Rating Score) for pain at 3 weeks and 12 months, pain medication needed.</brief_summary>
