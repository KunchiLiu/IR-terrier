	<brief_summary>Anakinra ADHF is a double-blind randomized clinical trial of anakinra, recombinant human interleukin-1 receptor blocker, or placebo in patients with acute decompensated heart failure with the aim to quench the acute inflammatory response, as measured by the area-under-the-curve for C reactive protein over 14 days.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All 5 criteria need to be met for enrollment of the patient in the study 1. Primary diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure within the last 24 hours as evidenced by both of the following: 1. dyspnea or respiratory distress or tachypnea at rest or with minimal exertion 2. evidence of elevated cardiac filling pressure or pulmonary congestion (at least one of the conditions must be met); i. pulmonary congestion/edema at physical exam OR chest xray; ii. plasma Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) levels ≥200 pg/mL; iii.invasive measurement of left ventricular enddiastolic pressure &gt;18 mmHg or of pulmonary artery occluding pressure (wedge) &gt;16 mmHg. 2. Left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF&lt;40%) during index hospitalization or prior 12 months. 3. Age ≥18 years old 4. Willing and able to provide written informed consent. 5. Screening plasma Creactive protein levels &gt;5 mg/L. Exclusion Criteria Subjects will not be eligible if they meet any of the following 15 exclusion criteria. 1. The primary diagnosis for admission is NOT decompensated heart failure, including diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes, hypertensive urgency/emergency, tachy or bradyarrhythmias. 2. Concomitant clinically significant comorbidities that would interfere with the execution or interpretation of the study including but not limited to acute coronary syndromes, uncontrolled hypertension or orthostatic hypotension, tachy or bradyarrhythmias, acute or chronic pulmonary disease or neuromuscular disorders affecting respiration. 3. Recent (previous 3 months) or planned cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), coronary artery revascularization procedures, or heart valve surgeries. 4. Previous or planned implantation of left ventricular assist devices or hearttransplant. 5. Chronic use of intravenous inotropes. 6. Recent (&lt;14 days) use of immunosuppressive or antiinflammatory drugs (not including NonSteroidal AntiInflammatory Drugs [NSAIDs]). 7. Chronic inflammatory disorder (including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus). 8. Active infection (of any type); 9. Chronic/recurrent infectious disease (including Hepatitis B virus [HBV], Hepatitis C virus [HCV], and HIV/AIDS). 10. Prior (within the past 10 years) or current malignancy. 11. Any comorbidity limiting survival or ability to complete the study. 12. End stage kidney disease requiring renal replacement therapy. 13. Neutropenia (&lt;2,000/mm3) or Thrombocytopenia (&lt;50,000/mm3). 14. Pregnancy. 15. Angina, arrhythmias, or electrocardiograph (ECG) changes that limit maximum exertion during cardiopulmonary exercise testing obtained during the baseline testing.</criteria>
