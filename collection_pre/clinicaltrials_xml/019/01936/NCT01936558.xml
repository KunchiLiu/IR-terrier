	<brief_title>The Origin of Phantom Limb Sensation and Phantom Limb Pain in Amputees</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project will investigate two main hypotheses based on our previous studies on phantom limb sensation and phantom limb pain. The first hypothesis states that phantom limb sensation and phantom limb pain both correlate with the 'phantom limb', while the second one maintains that the phantom limb can interact with the patient's body by means of the meridian system. With the far infrared ray applied to the 'phantom limbs' in amputees and the corresponding normal legs in healthy subjects, the sensation of (phantom) limb will be assessed for each subject using the techniques of fMRI and meridian response. By analyzing the data collected from both groups, the investigators expect both hypotheses will be supported by the results of experiments in this project.</detailed_description>
