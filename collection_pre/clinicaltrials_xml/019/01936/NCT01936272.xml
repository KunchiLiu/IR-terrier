	<brief_summary>Two treatment options exist for infant patients with hydrocephalus. Most patients are treated with a surgical procedure in which a shunt is inserted into the brain and abdomen. In recent years, however, another treatment has developed called Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy (ETV) with Choroid Plexus Cauterization (ETV/CPC).This research study is being done to measure the results of these procedures in children less than six months of age who have hydrocephalus as the result of a brain infection, called post-infectious hydrocephalus, or PIH. This study will evaluate patients in more detail to measure brain growth and development.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial of Shunt vs ETV/CPC for PIH in Ugandan Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>World over, infants with hydrocephalus are mainly treated using a shunt, which is a device made of soft plastic tubing that moves extra fluid from the brain to the abdomen. Surgery is required to insert a shunt into the brain and the abdomen. In recent years, we have developed another treatment called Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy (ETV) with Choroid Plexus Cauterization (ETV/CPC). This research study is being done to measure the results of these procedures in children less than six months of age who have hydrocephalus as the result of a brain infection, called post-infectious hydrocephalus, or PIH. This is the most common cause of hydrocephalus in Ugandan babies. This study will evaluate patients in more detail to measure brain growth and development. Children in the study will have special testing to measure developmental progress as well as special imaging to evaluate the progress of their brain growth.</detailed_description>
