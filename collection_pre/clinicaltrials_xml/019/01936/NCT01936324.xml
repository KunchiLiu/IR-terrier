	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of DRM01B topical in healthy volunteers. Following review of safety data, this study will determine the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of DRM01B Topical Gel in subjects with acne vulgaris</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety, Tolerability and Preliminary Efficacy Study of DRM01B Topical Gel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1/2a study enrolling 6 healthy volunteer subjects followed by 100 subjects with acne vulgaris. Safety data from the healthy volunteer stage will be reviewed prior to enrolling subjects with acne vulgaris. Phase 1 will be an open label study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of DRM01B Topical Gel. Six (6) healthy volunteers will be enrolled and apply DRM01B gel for 1 week to the face. Adverse events and local tolerability will be assessed at all study visits. Phase 2a will be a randomized, vehicle controlled, parallel group study designed to assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of DRM01B topical gel in subjects with acne vulgaris. Approximately 100 subjects will be enrolled and treated with study drug for 12 weeks. Safety will be assessed, at specified time points during the study, through adverse events, local skin responses, serum chemistry and hematology laboratory testing, physical examination and vital signs. Preliminary efficacy will be assessed through lesion counts (e.g., inflammatory, noninflammatory) and the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) for acne.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key 1. Signed informed consent 2. Willing to comply with the requirements of the protocol. 3. Male or nonpregnant, nonlactating females 4. Age ≥ 18 years 5. Clinical diagnosis of facial acne vulgaris defined as: At least 20 inflammatory lesions At least 20 noninflammatory lesions Investigator Global Assessment of 3 or greater 6. Willing to refrain from using any treatments, other than the investigational product, including antibiotics, for acne present on the face. Topical acne treatments that do not have significant or measurable systemic absorption (e.g., benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid) are allowed for treatment of acne of the back, shoulders and chest only. Key 1. Females who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant during the course of the study, or breastfeeding. 2. Any skin condition which may interfere with the evaluation of safety or of acne vulgaris (e.g., rosacea; seborrheic dermatitis; perioral dermatitis; corticosteroidinduced acne or folliculitis) 3. Excessive facial hair that would interfere with diagnosis or assessment of acne vulgaris. 4. Excessive sun exposure, in the opinion of the investigator or, use of tanning booths . 5. Active cystic acne or acne congoblata, acne fulminans, and secondary acne 6. Two or more active nodular lesions 7. Treatment with overthecounter topical medications for the treatment of acne vulgaris including benzoyl peroxide, topical antiinflammatory medications, corticosteroids, αhydroxy/glycolic acid on the face within 2 weeks prior to baseline. 8. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids (including intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids) within 4 weeks prior to baseline 9. Treatment with systemic antibiotics or systemic antiacne drugs or systemic antiinflammatory drugs within 4 weeks prior to baseline 10. Prescription topical retinoid use on the face within 4 weeks of baseline (e.g., tretinoin, tazarotene, adapalene). 11. Treatment with hormonal therapy or dose change to hormonal therapy within 12 weeks prior to baseline. Dose and frequency of use of any hormonal therapy started more than 12 weeks prior to baseline must remain unchanged throughout the study. Hormonal therapies include, but are not limited to, estrogenic and progestational agents such as birth control pills. 12. Use of androgen receptor blockers (such as spironolactone or flutamide) 13. Oral retinoid use (e.g., isotretinoin) within 12 months prior to baseline or vitamin A supplements greater than 10,000 units/day within 6 months of baseline. 14. Facial procedures (chemical or laser peel, microdermabrasion, etc.) within the past 8 weeks or during the study.</criteria>
