	<brief_summary>Optimal non surgical treatment of prostate cancer requires dose escalation which is frequently provided by adding a brachytherapy "boost" to a short course of external beam radiotherapy. The hypothesis in this randomized study is that a High Dose Rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost leads to equivalent or better Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) recurrence-free survival when compared to a Low Dose Rate (LDR) brachytherapy boost and that it is associated with a more favorable toxicity profile and improved quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Quality of Life After Prostate Brachytherapy: a Comparison of HDR and LDR Brachytherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Men with intermediate or high risk prostate cancer who are technically suitable for prostate brachytherapy based on prostate size and voiding function and who are interested in this modality of treatment will be approached for randomization between either high dose rate (single 15 Gray) or low dose rate permanent seed implant (110 Gray) brachytherapy. Baseline International Prostate Symptom score, Quality of Life Assessment and International Index of Erectile Function will be recorded and then every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months to 3 years. Androgen deprivation treatment is allowed for 6 or 12 months.</detailed_description>
