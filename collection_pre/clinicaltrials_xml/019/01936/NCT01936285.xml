	<brief_summary>- There is evidence that inflammatory processes may play detrimental role during the acute phase of myocardial infarction - The hypothesis of this study is that colchicine, by its anti-inflammatory action, may lead to reduction in infarct size, when administered during the acute phase of myocardial infarction</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The study will enroll patients 18 years old or older who present to the hospital within twelve (12) hours of the onset of chest pain and who had ST segment elevation &gt;1 mm in two contiguous limb leads or ST segment elevation &gt;2 mm in two consecutive precordial leads or new onset of left bundle branch block (LBBB) in a twelve lead electrocardiogram and for whom the decision was made to be taken to the cath lab to perform angioplasty of the coronary vessels. Excluded patients: &gt; 80 years old with active inflammatory diseases, infectious diseases or known malignancy under treatment with corticosteroids, antiinflammatory agents or disease modifying agents with known hypersensitivityallergy to colchicine under chronic treatment with colchicine with severe renal failure (eGFR &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73 m2) with hepatic failure (Child Pugh class B or C) presenting with cardiac arrest presenting with ventricular fibrillation presenting with cardiogenic shock with stent thrombosis with angina within 48 hours before infarction with previous myocardial infarction with occlusion of the left main or left circumflex coronary artery or with evidence of coronary collaterals to the region at risk on initial coronary angiography (at the time of admission) with metallic implants (ferromagnetic material)</criteria>
