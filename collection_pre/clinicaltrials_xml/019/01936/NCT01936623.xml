	<detailed_description>The study will enroll 80 adult primary care patients who have moderate risk drug use. Eligible participants (N = 80) will be randomly assigned to immediately receive a computerized brief intervention focused on drug use or to receive the same computerized brief intervention at 3-month follow-up. All participants will be assessed at three time points: baseline, and at 3 and 6 month follow-ups.</detailed_description>
