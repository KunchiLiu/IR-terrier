	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to compare Endoscopic Ultrasound and Fine Needle Aspirate with a standard 22-gauge needle using either "standard-suction" or "capillary suction" methods for solid pancreatic lesions. Investigators hope to discover the best technique for obtaining diagnostic material when patients with a pancreatic mass undergo endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspirate procedure. There are currently several techniques for obtaining tissue during endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspirate. The procedure will be performed by either the capillary suction technique or no suction technique.</brief_summary>
