	<brief_summary>Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a good alternative treatment for patients with severe aortic valve stenosis with similar mid-term success rates as compared to surgery. Periprosthetic aortic regurgitation (PAR) after TAVR remains an important limitation of this technique. Moderate to severe PAR occurs in 15-45% of the cases and it is an independent predictor of mortality after TAVR. Little is known about potential differences in severity of PAR among different types of aortic valve prosthesis. The current randomized study aims to evaluate potential differences between the Edwards SAPIEN bioprosthesis and the Medtronic CoreValve® system with main focus on PAR and additional focus on other clinical and imaging endpoints. Primary objective of this study is to investigate the difference in the severity of PAR, measured with 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (3DTEE), between patients undergoing the implantation of the Edwards SAPIEN bioprosthesis versus patients receiving the Medtronic CoreValve® bioprosthesis. Secondary objectives of this study include: investigating the value of different imaging modalities in evaluating periprosthetic regurgitation after TAVR and studying the difference in clinical endpoints according to VARC-2 definitions and quality of life after TAVR between two available aortic valve prostheses.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria In order to be eligible to participate in this study, subjects must meet all of the following criteria: Patient is ≥18 years of age and diagnosed with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, judged inoperable or at high surgical risk (EuroSCORE &gt; 15% or other criteria that make surgery high risk by a consensus among cardiologists and cardiac surgeons in the heart team) and deemed eligible for transfemoralTAVI. Aortic annulus diameter ≥ 18 and ≤ 29 mm as assessed with MSCT. No contraindications to study requirements such as MRI or TEE. Exclusion criteria Patients unable or unwilling to give informed consent. Patients who are excluded from this study because of the size of their aortic annulus diameter.</criteria>
