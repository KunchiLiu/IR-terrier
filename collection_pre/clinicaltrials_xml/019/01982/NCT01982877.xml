	<brief_title>The Four Supports Study: Family Support Intervention in Intensive Care Units</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One in four elderly Americans die in or shortly after discharge from an intensive care unit. An expanding body of literature documents that physician-family communication and end-of-life care is poor in intensive care units. These deficiencies are associated with high rates of adverse psychological outcomes among surrogates, physician-family conflict, and life support decisions that may be inconsistent with patients' goals and preferences. There is a lack of information on practical, generalizable interventions that effectively improve this important aspect of care for elderly patients and their families. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multifaceted communication intervention as compared to an educational control to improve psychological outcomes among family members of critically ill patients, using a randomized, controlled trial design. The trial's original sample size of 400 was chosen to maximize the ability to detect differences based on a secondary outcome measure (costs) that required a substantially larger sample size than the primary outcome. The trial was initially overpowered for the primary outcome. Even with the sample size of 400, the study had limited power to detect small but clinically important differences in the secondary outcome of costs. Since the original power calculations were conducted, new data were published which indicated that cost analysis in this context will require an even larger sample size based one effect modification from whether the patient lived or died. Enrollment was initially slow due to regional changes in admission patterns. Subsequently, the study team has added study ICUs and we have re-allocated resources to maximize screening and enrolling, which has come at a risk of compromising the quality of the data and other aspects of the study that are getting comparably less attention. With a sample size of 300, the study is well powered to detect small and clinically important differences in the primary outcome measure Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS). The Data and Safety Monitoring Board recommended decreasing the sample size based on the considerations outlined above.</detailed_description>
