	<brief_title>Functional Outcome of Urethral Reconstructive Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urethroplasty is the surgical repair of a urethral stricture. Depending on the location, severity and length of the stricture, various techniques can be performed. The first procedure consists of the excision of the stenotic segment and end-to-end anastomosis. Other procedures consist of widening the urethra with buccal mucosa as free graft or with vascularized (genital) skin flaps. The results of these techniques have been described in prospective cohort studies, but to date there is little good data about the functional outcome and quality-of-life with longer follow-up after this surgery. The purpose of this study is to prospectively follow patients for functional outcome parameters and quality-of-life to obtain long-term information concerning these surgeries.</detailed_description>
