	<brief_summary>Cataract is the leading cause of blindness worldwide and cataract surgery is the most frequent surgery performed in France. A new technology, the femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery, has to be compared with phacoemulsification alone, the conventional cataract surgery, to determine the economic impact of femtosecond laser-assisted process for the French healthcare insurance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Economic Evaluation of Femtosecond Laser Assisted Cataract Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An estimated 700,000 cataract procedures are performed every year in France, with this amount of surgeries predicted to climb as the population there, as well as around the world, ages. Currently, phacoemulsification alone is the conventional cataract surgery. The femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery has to be compared with the standard process to provide information on how it could benefit the patient population treated every year for cataract surgery. This economic study has received a grant from the French Ministry of Health to evaluate the economic impact of femtosecond laser-assisted process for the French healthcare system. For this goal, this prospective, randomized, parallel, multicenter and simple blind study will determine the incremental cost/effectiveness ratio for femtosecond laser-assisted process versus phacoemulsification surgery. Visual acuity results and intraoperative or postoperative complication rate will be compared between both groups. The learning curve of the femtosecond laser assisted cataract surgery will be also evaluated for each surgeon involved in the study.</detailed_description>
