	<brief_summary>Objectives: The aims were to measure one year change in caloric compensation (CC) and eating in the absence of hunger (EAH) in 3 to 6 year-old French children in their regular eating context and to link these change with individual characteristics (adiposity, age, gender) and maternal feeding practices. Three series of measurements of caloric compensation (CC) and eating in the absence of hunger (EAH) were conducted: at baseline, and 3 (FU3M) and 15 (FU15M) months later. Each serie of measurement was composed of three consecutive weeks an identical lunch was served in four preschool canteens reaching 236 children. The first lunch was a control session. For the CC situation (week 2), thirty minutes before the lunch children were offered a preload (137 kcal). For the EAH situation (week 3), ten minutes after lunch children were exposed to palatable foods (430 kcal). Food intake was measured at the individual level. Maternal eating behaviour and feeding practices were measured by questionnaires. Child's height and weight were measured by a medical doctor.</brief_summary>
