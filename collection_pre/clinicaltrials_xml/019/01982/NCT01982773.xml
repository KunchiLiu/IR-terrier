	<brief_summary>A hope box or self soothing kit is a therapeutic tool employed by clinicians with patients expressing suicidal ideation, significant distress, or otherwise at risk of suicidal or non-suicidal self harm. A "Virtual Hope Box" (VHB) takes the common hope box practice and uses smartphone features to enhance the experience. The rich multimedia features on a smartphone allow more varied options. Furthermore, these devices are already a common repository for user-generated and user-preferred media, which will allow for a highly personalized VHB that is highly portable and always available to a user in distress. We hypothesize that: 1. Patients in the (VHB) intervention condition will demonstrate pre-post reductions in 1) severity of suicidal ideation 2) ability to cope with stressors and 3) increases in perceived reasons for living 2. Patients in the intervention condition will demonstrate greater pre-post reductions in symptoms of suicidal ideation, ability to cope with stressors, and perceived reasons for living compared to patients in the (ETAU) control condition. 3. Patients and clinicians will find VHB to be beneficial and its use readily integrated into practice.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Virtual Hope Box - Effectiveness of a Smartphone App for Coping With Suicidal Ideation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our overall objective in the proposed study is to assess the impact of a virtual hope-box (VHB) smartphone app on suicidal ideation in veterans undergoing clinical therapy who have recently had suicidal ideation or behavior. We propose to conduct this study in two phases: Phase 1: Modifying the current VHB-Î² version of the app to accommodate feedback from pilot study participants. The result will be the VHB V1.0 to be tested in phase 2. This component of the study will be conducted by the T2 group located at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. Phase 2: Implementing a randomized controlled trial comparing the VHB intervention with enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU) in clinical practice. This component of the study will be conducted at the Portland VA Medical Center. This research project seeks to answer several essential questions: 1. Can a smartphone app containing the essential components of a hope box and associated elements of CT/DBT (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy) reduce severity of suicidal ideation, and increase perceptions of reasons for living and ability to cope, in a clinical sample of veterans? 2. Is a smartphone VHB app more effective in reducing severity of suicidal ideation, and increasing perceptions of reasons for living and ability to cope, compared to enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU)? In addition, we will gather important information about implementing and integrating VHB as a treatment component in mental health treatment</detailed_description>
