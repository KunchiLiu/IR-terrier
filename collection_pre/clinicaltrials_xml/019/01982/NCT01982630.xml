	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of MK-8521 given once daily compared to placebo and another diabetes drug in participants with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study was modified by a protocol amendment to a 2-part trial to further test the safety and tolerability of MK-8521 at higher doses and to compare MK-8521 pharmacokinetics between participants with T2DM and healthy participants. An additional cohort of T2DM participants and a cohort of non-diabetic obese participants have been added.</brief_summary>
