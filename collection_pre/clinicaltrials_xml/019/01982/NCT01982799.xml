	<brief_title>Local Anesthesia and Analgesics in Endodontic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients (n=220) presenting to the University of Minnesota Endodontic clinic, with moderate to severe pain from toothache requiring root canal treatment ,will be invited to participate in the study. The endodontic treatment is NOT part of the research. Patients will complete pain evaluation forms and take 2 doses of prescribed medication. Normally after a root canal procedure, patients will be suggested to take over-the-counter ibuprofen if needed, or prescribed an analgesic if they are having severe pain. We will be randomizing patients in double blind manner to receive regular or long acting local anesthesia and post-op medications (placebo or 1 of 3 analgesics), with the patient evaluating their pain before starting root canal (pre-treatment pain), after root canal, after analgesics and during the following day.</detailed_description>
