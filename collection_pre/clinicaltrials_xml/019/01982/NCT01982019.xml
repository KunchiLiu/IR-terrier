	<brief_summary>The 26RFa was recently discovered in the hypothalamus. In rodents it seems to be related to glucose metabolism and obesity. However, no data exists in obese patients or in patients with diabetes. Thus, the investigators planned to dose 26RFa level in obese patients before and after a sleeve gastrectomy in order to study the effect of a weight loss on its levels. The investigators will also dose 26RFa concentrations in obese patients with type 2 diabetes and in healthy volunteers with normal weight. Comparison of these different groups will permit us to better understand the 26RFa involvement in glucose concentration regulation and in obesity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence of Bariatric Surgery on Serum Levels of 26RFa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The 26RFa is an orexigenic neuropeptide of the Rfamides family, localized in two hypothalamic nuclei. Its increase induced obesity and it is elevated in obese rodents. In addition, in human, it is elevated in anorexic patients. However, no data exists in obese patients or in patients with diabetes. Thus, the investigators planned to measure 26RFa level in obese patients before and after a sleeve gastrectomy in order to study the effect of a weight loss on its levels. The investigators will also dose 26RFa concentrations in obese patients with type 2 diabetes and in healthy volunteers with normal weight. Comparison of these different groups will permit us to better understand the 26RFa involvement in glucose concentration regulation and in obesity. The investigators will also measure other hormones known to have a major role in glucose metabolism and obesity (ie. insulin, adiponectin). A meal test will be given to the volunteers in order to study the kinetics' of these molecules during and after food intake.</detailed_description>
