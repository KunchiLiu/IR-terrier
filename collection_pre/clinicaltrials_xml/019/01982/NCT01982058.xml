B. To determine whether relationship length, pre-intervention relationship satisfaction, and men's pre-intervention masculinity moderate the effects of IEC on couples' psychological and relationship outcomes Aim 2 A. To evaluate whether IEC has an effect on couples' communication and intimacy when compared with GHW and UC and to determine whether changes in relationship communication and intimacy mediate changes in couples' psychological and relationship outcomes. Exploratory Aim: A.
