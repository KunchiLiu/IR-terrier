	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesis is that using the micropulse laser in patient with Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC) will prompt resolution of CSC and will be effective in significantly minimizing visual recovery time from this disease as well as potentially preventing recurrences.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study on the Use of Micropulse Laser to Treat Central Serous Chorioretinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators hypothesize that application of 577nm micropulse laser in patients with CSC will prompt resolution of CSC as measured by ocular coherence tomography and best corrected visual acuity. This will be a pilot study to establish sound methods and provide some insights to the safety and efficacy of CSC treatment.</detailed_description>
