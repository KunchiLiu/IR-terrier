	<brief_title>Antacid Interaction Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, lesinurad and antacid will be administered in the fed state, antacid doses will be attenuated to reflect the more commonly used doses, baseline PD assessments will be performed both in presence and absence of antacid treatment, and the sequence of treatments (lesinurad +/- antacid) will be randomized.</detailed_description>
