	<brief_summary>This is a phase I study to evaluate the safety of a vaccine to protect against influenza viruses of the H2N2 subtype. A total of 40 adults will be enrolled and receive two doses of vaccine or placebo one month apart.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reactogenicity, Safety and Immunogenicity of a Live Monovalent A/17/CALIFORNIA/66/395 (H2N2) Influenza Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety profile of two intranasal doses of LAIV A/17/California/66/395 (H2N2) in healthy adults in Russia. A(H2N2) viruses which are antigenically similar to the pandemic strain A/Singapore/1/57, continue to circulate in domestic and wild bird populations, as confirmed by routine moni¬toring of avian influenza viruses. 40 adults aged 18-40 will be enrolled. They will be randomized to receive vaccine or placebo. Blood and urine will be collected during the week following each vaccination and before the next vaccination to monitor safety. Blood samples will also be collected at several timepoints to assess the volunteer's immune response to the vaccine. The total duration of the study is 16 weeks for each volunteer.</detailed_description>

Capable and willing to complete diary cards and willing to return for all followup visits Willing to comply with the rules of isolation unit (including willing and able to take oseltamivir influenza antiviral medication, should that be recommended by study physician). For females, willing to take reliable birth control measures through day 56. Participation in another clinical trial involving any therapy within the previous three months or planned enrollment in such a trial during trial period. Receipt of any nonstudy vaccine within four weeks prior to enrollment or refusal to postpone receipt of such vaccines until four weeks after study completion. Practice of nasal irrigation on a regular basis within the past six months or has engaged in nasal irrigation within two weeks prior to enrollment. Recent history of frequent nose bleeds (&gt;5 within the past year). Clinically relevant abnormal paranasal anatomy. Recent history (within the past month) of rhino or sinus surgery, or surgery for any traumatic injury of the nose. Current or recent (within two weeks of enrollment) acute respiratory illness with or without fever. Other acute illness at the time of study enrollment. Receipt of immune globulin or other blood products within three months prior to study enrollment or planned receipt during period of subject participation in the study. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 consecutivelyprescribed days) of immunosuppressants and/or other immunemodulating therapy within six months prior to study enrollment. Participation in any previous trial of any H2N2 containing influenza vaccine. History of asthma. Hypersensitivity after previous administration of any influenza vaccine. History of wheezing after past receipt of any live influenza vaccine. Other AE following immunization (body temperature more than 40°C, collapse, nonfebrile seizures, anaphylaxis), at least possibly related to previous receipt of any vaccine (not only influenza). Suspected or known hypersensitivity to any study vaccine components, including chicken or egg protein. Seasonal (autumnal) hypersensitivity to the natural environment Acute or chronic clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic, metabolic, neurologic, psychiatric or renal functional abnormality, as determined by medical history, physical examination or clinical laboratory screening tests, which in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with the study objectives. Subjects with physical examination findings or clinical laboratory screening results which would be graded 2 or higher on the AE severity grading scale (see Attachments) will be excluded from entry into the study and will be excluded from receipt of dose two of study vaccine or placebo. History of leukemia or any other blood or solid organ cancer. History of thrombocytopenic purpura or known bleeding disorder. History of seizures. Known or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition of any kind, including HIV infection. Known chronic HBV or HCV infection. Known tuberculosis infection or evidence of previous tuberculosis exposure. History of chronic alcohol abuse and/or illegal drug use. Claustrophobia or sociophobia. Pregnancy or lactation. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would increase the health risk to the subject if participates in the study or would interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives. Allergic, including anaphylactic, reactions to the introduction of any vaccines (not only influenza) in the subject's medical history</criteria>
