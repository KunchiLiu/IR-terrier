	<criteria>Key Body weight of â‰¤ 160 kg. Subjects with compensated CHF (NYHA Class II III) at time of screening with a prior documented history of chronic heart failure. NTproBNP &gt;300 pg/ml (according to central measurement) at visit 1. Subjects treated with appropriate and guidelineindicated CHF standard of care. Ability to comply with all requirements, including ability to receive at least a 48 hour infusion plus followup time required for each dosing visit. Key Current acute decompensated HF Any major solid organ transplant recipient or planned anticipated organ transplant within 1 year. Documented history of untreated ventricular arrhythmia with syncopal episodes, ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation without ICD (implantable cardioverter defibrillator) with significant hemodynamic consequences within the 3 months prior to screening. Presence of hemodynamically significant mitral and /or aortic valve disease, except mitral regurgitation secondary to left ventricular dilatation: including significant left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g., obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis) Subjects with severe renal impairment defined as prerandomization eGFR &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73m2 calculated using the sMDRD equation and/or those receiving current or planned dialysis or ultrafiltration</criteria>
