	<brief_summary>This research study seeks to explore the effects of massage techniques on pain and anxiety relief among patients with subarachnoid hemorrhages in the ICU setting in comparison to subarachnoid hemorrhagic patients using standard medical therapy. In addition, our aim is to decrease the overall medication use to treat pain and anxiety, and to determine the impact of massage on sleep duration, quality, and breathing. Our goal is to improve and promote comfort during the ICU stay as well as decrease the need for narcotic medication usage.</brief_summary>
