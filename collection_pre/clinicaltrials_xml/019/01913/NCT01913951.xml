	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of vosaroxin when given together with azacitidine in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vosaroxin and azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.</brief_summary>

Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately. Patients may have received up to 3 prior cycles of hypomethylator therapy (i.e. decitabine or azacitidine) prior to enrollment and may have received supportive care measures (growth factors, erythropoietin stimulating agents, transfusion, etc. Either enrolled in HRPO# 201011766 ("Tissue Acquisition for Analysis of Genetic Progression Factors in Hematologic Diseases"), which facilitates collection of blood, bone marrow, and skin for correlative studies, or consents to collection of blood, bone marrow, and skin as part of this protocol. Prior treatment with four or more cycles of hypomethylator therapy. Receiving concomitant chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy during the duration of treatment on protocol. Known seropositivity for or active viral infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Patients who are seropositive because of hepatitis B virus vaccine are eligible. Patients who are seropositive for HCV, but have a negative viral load are also eligible. Documentation that the patients have completed a course of therapy for HCV is required and will be obtained.
