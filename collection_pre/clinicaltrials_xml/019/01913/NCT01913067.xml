	<brief_summary>A phase II trial evaluating Cabazitaxel in patients with brain metastasis secondary to breast and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). OBJECTIVES: Primary: The purpose of this study is to determine if cabazitaxel can induce a reduction in the size brain metastasis in metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer and NSCLC with brain metastasis who were not previously treated with whole brain irradiation or require immediate brain irradiation. Secondary: - To determine the effect of cabazitaxel on the time to initiating whole brain irradiation or radiosurgery - To determine the effect of cabazitaxel on the time to developing neurological symptoms - To determine the effect of cabazitaxel on the time to disease progression in the brain - To determine the effect of cabazitaxel on the time to disease progression outside the brain. This will be evaluated separately for the breast and NSCLC cohorts To determine the objective extra-cranial response (if applicable). This will be evaluated separately in the breast and NSCLC cohorts - To determine the safety of cabazitaxel</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a single arm, prospective trial using a 2-stage Simon design, in which eligible patients will receive intravenous cabazitaxel for two cycles followed by response evaluation. Based on the pre-specified criteria of response (intra-cranial, patient will be allowed to continue on study drug.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Signed informed consent Age&gt;18, ECOG 01 Histologically confirmed 1) HER2negative invasive breast carcinoma or 2) NSCLC In patients with breast cancer, HER2negative status by FISH or immunohistochemistry (score 0, or +1). In patients with breast cancer, known estrogen and progesterone receptor status. Evidence of measurable disease in the brain (at least 1cm) Stable or decreasing dosage of steroids for 7 days prior to baseline MRI. No evidence of (cortical) cognitive impairment as defined by a MiniMental Status Exam (MMSE) score ≥ 25/30. No more than 4 prior lines of systemic chemotherapy in the metastatic setting Adequate hematopoietic function defined as: Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0g/dL Absolute neutrophilic count ≥ 1.5 x 109L Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109L Adequate hepatic function defined as: AST ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN Total bilirubin ≤ 1.0 x ULN Adequate renal function defined as serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN. If creatinine ranges from 1.0 1.5 x ULN, creatinine clearance determined by CKDEPI formula should be calculated and only patients with clearance &gt;60 mL/min are eligible Adequate contraceptive method in patients with childbearing potential. History of prior whole brain irradiation Progressive neurological symptoms requiring immediate brain irradiation Pregnancy or lactation History of hypersensitivity reaction to taxanes History of hypersensitivity to polysorbate 80 containing agents Current or planned treatment with strong inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450. Less than 3 weeks since the last treatment of chemotherapy, biological therapy, and/or immunotherapy Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis Contraindication to contrastenhanced MRI</criteria>
