	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, vehicle-controlled, multicenter, double blind study of Anucort HC TM (Hydrocortisone Acetate) 25mg Rectal Suppositories in subjects with symptomatic internal hemorrhoids. Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to Test product or Vehicle, respectively. Clinical evaluations will be performed at: Visit 1/Day -3 (-1 day) to Day 1 Screening Visit 2/Day 1 Randomization (Start of Treatment) Visit 3/Day 8 (-1/+3 days) Interim Visit 4/Day 15 (-1/+3 days) End of Treatment / Early Termination Visit 5/ Day 28 (-1/+3 days)* 2 Weeks Post-Treatment/Follow-Up Phone Contact Safety will be assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs) and clinically significant changes from Visit 1/Screening in laboratory values. Number of Sites: Approximately 31 sites in the United States.</detailed_description>
