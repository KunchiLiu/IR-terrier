[14C] is a naturally occurring radioactive form of the element carbon. This study will help understand how the drug appears in the blood, urine, and stool after it is administered. In addition, this study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of LY2835219 when given to healthy participants. Information about any side effects that may occur will also be collected. This study will last about 3 weeks for each participant, not including screening.</brief_summary>
