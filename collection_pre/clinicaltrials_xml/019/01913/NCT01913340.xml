	<brief_summary>Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), a condition of reduced blood and oxygen flow to a baby's brain near the time of birth, may cause death or neurologic disability. Cooling therapy (hypothermia) provides some protection, but about half of affected infants still have a poor outcome. This clinical trial will determine if the drug erythropoietin, given with hypothermia, is safe to use as a treatment that may further reduce the risk of neurologic deficits after HIE.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This phase I/II clinical trial is designed to demonstrate: 1. The feasibility of recruiting, enrolling and following 50 patients with moderate to severe HIE at 5 sites, while meeting specified recruitment and follow-up target goals. 2. The safety of high-dose Epo therapy in neonates with HIE with respect to systemic organ function and general growth parameters. 3. The value of brain MRI/MRS performed at 4-7 days of age as a biomarker of motor function at 12 months of age.</detailed_description>
