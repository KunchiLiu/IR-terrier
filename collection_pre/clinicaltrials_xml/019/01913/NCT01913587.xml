	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Acupuncture on Spinal Compression Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal compression fracture is mainly caused by trauma, furthermore, in old age, osteoporosis increases the risk of spinal compression fracture. Nerve block is effective for the management of pain from inflammation or nerve root stimulation from spinal compression fracture. As one of alternative interventions, acupuncture is effective for controlling spinal compression fracture. This study aims to investigate that combination with acupuncture and nerve block may relieve spinal compression fracture-related pain versus nerve block alone.</detailed_description>
