	<brief_summary>To find possible therapeutic targets to help prevent long-term brain and behavioural side effects in survivors of childhood leukemia that may have been caused by chemotherapy (Treatment-Related late Adverse Neuro-Cognitive Effects: TRANCE). The study hypothesis is that genetic variations of the elements in the folate-related cycles and methotrexate disposition networks are associated with the TRANCE phenotype of childhood leukemia survivors.</brief_summary>
