	<criteria>Body weight of at least 65.0 kg and no greater than 85.0 kg. Body Mass Index (BMI) of at least 18.5 and no greater than 30.0 kg/m2. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to MDV3100, itraconazole, gemfibrozil, any components of the formulations used, or any history of liver toxicity with other drugs. Confirmed CYP2C8 PM status based on genotyping analysis. Any of the liver function tests above the upper limit of normal. A retest to confirm the result may be performed once. History of seizure, including any febrile seizure, loss of consciousness, or transient ischemia attack within 12 months prior to enrollment (Day 1 visit), or any condition that may predispose to seizure (e.g., prior stroke, brain arteriovenous malformation, head trauma with loss of consciousness requiring hospitalization). Any clinically significant history of asthma, eczema, any other allergic condition or previous severe hypersensitivity to any drug (excluding nonactive hay fever). Abnormal pulse and/or blood pressure (BP) measurements at the prestudy visit as follows: Pulse &lt;40 or &gt;90 bpm; mean systolic BP &gt;140 mmHg ; mean diastolic BP &gt;90 mmHg (BP measurements taken in triplicate after subject has been resting in supine position for 5 min; pulse will be measured automatically). A QTc interval of &gt;430 ms after repeated measurements (consistently after duplicate measurements), a history of unexplained syncope, cardiac arrest, unexplained cardiac arrhythmias or torsades de pointes, structural heart disease, or a family history of Long QT Syndrome (LQTS). Regular use of any inducer of metabolism (e.g. barbiturates, rifampin) in the 3 months prior to admission to the Clinical Unit. Positive serology test for HBsAg, anti HAV (IgM), antiHCV or antiHIV 1+2.</criteria>
