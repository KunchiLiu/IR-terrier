	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Acupuncture to Treat the Upper Abdominal Pain of Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neurolytic celiac plexus block (NCPB) is a commonly performed procedure in patients with intractable pain due to malignancies involving the upper and mid abdomen. Recently, acupuncture is used as one of alternative interventions to treat cancer-related pains. This pilot study aims to investigate the effectiveness of pain-relief of acupuncture via comparing acupuncture plus NCPB with NCPB alone. Total 14 cancer patients with NCPB will be randomized into two groups of acupuncture and control.</detailed_description>
