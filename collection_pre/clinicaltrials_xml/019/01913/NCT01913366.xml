	<detailed_description>If you are eligible to participate in the study after completing the screening assessment, and if you choose to continue on, we will randomize you (like a flip of a coin) to receive either 12 weeks of case management combined with problem solving therapy (CM-PST) with a social worker or 12 weeks of self-guided problem solving therapy (SG-PST) with support from a senior peer counselor. As part of your participation in the study you will participate in three 1.5 hour assessment interviews of psychological and neuropsychological functioning (similar to your screening assessment) prior to your first week of treatment (baseline), two weeks after your final session (week 14), and three months after your final session (week 24). Additionally, you will participate in three shorter assessment interviews of psychological functioning, which will be conducted at weeks 3 and 6. These assessments will take approximately 30-45 minutes.</detailed_description>
