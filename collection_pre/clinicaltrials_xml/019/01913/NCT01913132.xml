	<brief_summary>The wound infection rate in the groin after vascular surgery has been denoted to be high since the wound surveillance register started in 2005. The current wound infection rate based on a validation study was 22.9% (24/105 patients with groin incision(s) between 1 March to 30 June in 2012). The Deep/superficial infection ratio was 7/17. To prove that PICO (negative wound pressure therapy) reduces the wound infection rate with Â½ standard deviation, 90% power at the 5% significance level, inclusion of 160 patients, 80 patients in the PICO Group and the standard dressing group are needed.</brief_summary>
