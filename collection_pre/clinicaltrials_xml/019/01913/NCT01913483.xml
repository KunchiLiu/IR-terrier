	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate that anticoagulation with bivalirudin results in fewer major bleeding complications compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH) in subjects undergoing peripheral endovascular interventions (PEI). The secondary objective is to identify potential benefits from bivalirudin therapy on other clinically important events such as death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and/or transient ischemic attack (TIA), amputation, unplanned repeat revascularization (URV), and minor bleeding, as well as potential economic benefits that may result from improved clinical outcomes.</brief_summary>
