	<brief_summary>For breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy regimens, the use of a validated emesis (nausea and vomiting) risk calculator will provide superior anti-emetic (nausea and vomiting) control compared with "standard" anti-emetic regimen. The risk calculator has the potential to provide more individualized anti-emetic regimen by decreasing the use of toxic/costly anti-emetics in patients at low risk and possibly more importantly enhancing the appropriate anti-emetic regimen in patients at high risk.</brief_summary>
