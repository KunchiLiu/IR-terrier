	<brief_summary>Prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, single-arm, open-label study to assess the safety and efficacy of the Resolute Integrity Stent for the treatment of de novo lesions in native coronary arteries with a reference vessel diameter (RVD) of 2.25 mm to 4.2 mm in patients who receive extended length stents (34 mm or 38 mm) referred to as the Extended Length Study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this postapproval study is to conduct a prospective, multi-center evaluation of the procedural and clinical outcomes of subjects that are treated with the commercially available 34 mm and 38 mm Medtronic Resolute Integrity Zotarolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System. Descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for clinically relevant variables as described in a separate statistical analysis plan.</detailed_description>
