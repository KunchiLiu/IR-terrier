	<brief_title>Effect of Ginseng on Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effect of ginseng on blood pressure control is controversial, originating from an early 1970s observational study, suggesting that ginseng may adversely effect blood pressure. Despite these early findings, extensive research has since suggested that ginseng may have a positive effect on blood pressure. The current study will help clarify present uncertainty on the effect of ginseng on blood pressure control. This systematic review and meta-analysis will follow The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be searched using appropriate search terms. Intervention trials that investigate the effect of ginseng on blood pressure in humans will be included.</detailed_description>
