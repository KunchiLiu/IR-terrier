	<brief_title>Mesenchymal Stem Cells to Treat Ischemic Cardiomyopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ischemic heart disease is a major public health problem in the industrialized and developing world. Current research is focusing on the development of cell-based therapies using stem cells to treat heart failure. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can differentiate into endothelial cells and participate in the development of new blood vessels in the heart damaged. Therefore, MSCs has shown promise for heart repair. The investigators study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of intracoronary injection of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to repair heart function in patients with myocardial ischemia.</detailed_description>
