	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of the NatroxTM Topical Oxygen device versus a placebo in patients with non-healing leg ulceration in conjunction with standard best practice.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Comparing NatroxTM Topical Oxygen Therapy to A Placebo in the Management of Non-Healing Leg Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be screened for two weeks before enrollment to assess whether their ulcers are "non-healing", defined as a reduction in wound surface of &lt; 25% after two weeks of standard best practice wound care . On enrolment and randomisation to active or placebo treatment the patient will be treated for six weeks or until 100% epithelialisation, whichever is the sooner, and then treatment will revert to standard best practice, defined as moist wound healing plus compression where appropriate. The reference ulcer will be followed up at two weeks and then at six weeks after the end of the active treatment period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with superficial venous and mixed aetiology leg ulcers on a flat plane in surface area between 450cm2 Patients with diabetes may be included providing they have good metabolic control Patients who understand the trial, agree to adhere to the treatment and are able to give consent Patients who can be followed by the same investigating team for the whole period of their participation in the study Patients who present with wounds which are clinically infected and require antimicrobial therapy. Patients who have been treated for a wound infection with antimicrobial therapy (systematically or topically) may be included providing the wound is no longer assessed as infected and there is a two week washout period after the last treatment before the patient is reassessed against the inclusion and exclusion criteria Patients with a known sensitivity to any of the components of the evaluation device Patients with known or suspected malignancy in the wound or surrounding tissue Patients whose wounds show a percentage decrease in surface area of &gt;25% during the two week screening period Patients who do not have the physical or mental capacity, or a significant other with the ability to change the NatroxTM battery pack on a daily basis Patients who present with more than 10% of the wound surface area covered in hard eschar Patients who are actively treated with immunosuppressive or corticosteroidal medication Patients who are participating in another clinical trial Patients with a known history or poor compliance with medical treatment Patients who have been in this trial previously and have withdrawn Patients who are unable to understand the aims of the trial and do not give informed consent</criteria>
