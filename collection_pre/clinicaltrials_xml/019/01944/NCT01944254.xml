	<brief_summary>The intention of this study is to determine whether the precision of the measure of cardiac output can be optimized by conducting the measurement while the participant is instructed to exhale slowly. This will be compared to measurements done at random to respiration and timed with the participant's spontaneous expiration.</brief_summary>
