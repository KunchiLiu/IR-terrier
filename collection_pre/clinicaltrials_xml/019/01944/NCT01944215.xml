	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Effect of Fasting and Exercise on Uptake of Tc-99m Sestamibi in Breast Tissue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to determine if exercise, fasting, or eating prior to a molecular breast imaging study will have an effect on the uptake of the radiotracer Tc-99m sestamibi in the breast tissue. Tc-99m sestamibi is primarily extracted by the liver. Changes in hepatic blood flow may therefore influence the amount of radiotracer available for uptake in the breast tissue.</detailed_description>
