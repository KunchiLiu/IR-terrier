	<brief_summary>To evaluate the clinical and economical benefits of a meropenem dosage strategy based on a population pharmacokinetic(PPK)-pharmacodynamic(PD) model in lower respiratory tract infection patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Meropenem Dosage Strategy Based on PPK Model</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Subjects:lower respiratory tract infection patients - Study design:randomized control study.The patients in study group will accept meropenem therapy with the regimen decided by a software developed from a PPK-PD model. The patients in control group will accept meropenem therapy with the regimen decided by attending physician. - Primary endpoint: clinical successful rate of meropenem therapy. The clinical efficiency of meropenem therapy will be evaluated one week later from stop of meropenem therapy. - Second endpoint: amount of used antibiotics and bacteriological successful rate.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Sixty years and older patients hospitalized at the Peking University Third Hospital with communityacquired or hospitalacquired lower respiratory tract infection. Bacilli was idolated from lower respiratory tract specimens within 48 hours prior to study enrollment. The pathogen was sensitive to meropenem. Received broadspectrum antibiotic therapy less than 24 hours, or no improvement after antibiotic therapy and pathogen was resistant to the used antibiotics. Had documented hypersensitivity to carbapenems. More than one pathogenic Gramnegative bacillus was isolated lower respiratory tract specimens. Positive HIV antibody titre. Had known or suspected tuberculosis or other infections caused by Grampositive cocci, viruses or fungi at baseline.</criteria>
