	<brief_summary>The hypothesis of the present study is the hydration of nulliparous women with 250ml/hour vs. 125ml/hrs would decrease the rate of primary cesarean section.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hydration and Rate of Cesarean Delivery Among Nulliparous</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For this non-blinded randomized clinical trial (RCT) we will recruit approximately 670 women which meet the inclusion criteria across three sites (Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS), University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) and Obstetrix Medical Group, in California). When the patient is being scheduled for induction by her physician or when she presents to L&amp;D for induction or in labor, but her cervical dilation on admission is less than 4 cm, the participants will be consented, and then randomized into a study intervention group. Both groups will receive maintenance IV hydration with Lactated Ringer's (LR) solution: Group I will receive LR at 125 ml/hr and group II will receive LR at 250ml/hr. Other than the rate of maintenance IV infusion, the two groups will receive routine intrapartum care.</detailed_description>
