	<brief_title>The Association With Peptic Ulcer Disease and Hepatic Vein Pressure Gradient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Retrospective case-control study - Investigators will analyze the medical records of hepatic vein pressure gradient (HVPG) and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) cases who had liver cirrhosis (LC) or chronic hepatitis in a single tertiary hospital (Chuncheon Sacred Heart hospital, Korea) within 2008~2012. - Portal hypertension is assessed using HVPG measurement via transjugular approach. - Peptic ulcer is evaluated through EGD within 3 months of HVPG measurement - The association of Peptic ulcer with LC, chronic hepatitis and total population (LC or chronic hepatitis) will be assessed by univariate and multivariate analysis - There is no specific time frame, because this study is retrospective observational study, however EGD data is enrolled if it was done within 3 month from HVPG measurement.</detailed_description>
