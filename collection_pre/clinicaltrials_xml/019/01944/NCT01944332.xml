	<brief_title>Gamete Treatment to Correct Fertilization Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The spermatozoa will be prepared in the standard fashion and utilized for injection after exposure to a membrane permeabilizing agent. The injected oocytes will be then exposed to the previously mentioned activating agents for the purpose of inducing embryo development. The successfully fertilized oocytes will be further kept in culture for up to 5 days as per standard IVF/ICSI. Results in terms of fertilization and embryo cleavage will be assessed and monitored for the remainder of the culture period. Developing embryos selected according to standard criteria will be replaced to the patient or will be cryopreserved. Because fertilization failure carries such a high emotional and financial toll on our patients, at the present time, the only method to generate an embryo for these cases is to perform assisted oocyte activation in conjunction with ICSI. The research intervention - assisted oocyte activation - is believed to help alleviate the failed fertilization by obtaining some zygotes for the patient. In these cases of complete failed fertilization, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) will be performed as a routine clinical treatment even if they are not enrolled in the study. After several failures, their reproductive physician may recommend the use of donor spermatozoa instead of the male partner's.</detailed_description>
