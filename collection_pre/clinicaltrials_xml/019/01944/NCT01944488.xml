	<brief_summary>The project aims to establish the normal LH and FSH response to a standardized GnRH dose in healthy girls below 6 years of age, and compares the normal GnRH response to the GnRH response in girls with early puberty development. The novel data may help to determine whether the girl is in early puberty or not. Healthy girls under 6 years of age attending routine examinations including an i.v. line for other causes are included in this study. Our examinations also include bone age determination, Tanner stage determination, and anthropometric measures (height and weight). 10 healthy girls in each of the following age groups: 7-12 months, 12-24 months, 24-36 months, 36-48 months, 48-60 months and 60-72 months are included.</brief_summary>
