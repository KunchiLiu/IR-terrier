	<brief_summary>Airway inflammation is partly driven by Th17 and Th17-polarizing cytokines that is steroid-resistant. Statins could suppress IL-17 cytokines in other diseases such as atherosclerosis and multiple sclerosis in mouse model. The investigators hypothesize that statins might provide anti-inflammatory benefit of suppressing IL-17 cytokines in COPD patients.</brief_summary>
