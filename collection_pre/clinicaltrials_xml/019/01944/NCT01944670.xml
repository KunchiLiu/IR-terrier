	<criteria>The subject is &gt;21 years of age. The subject is considered a candidate for the Internal Joint Stabilizer Elbow (IJSE) under one of the following indications: Subjects where either the elbow sublocates or dislocates after repairing the injured ligaments and/or bones The elbow has been subluxated or dislocated for more than 10 days prior to surgery The elbow subluxes or dislocates after surgical repair/reconstruction The subject has sufficient quantity or quality of bone. Specifically there is sufficient trochlea of the distal humerus and of sufficient quality that the axis pin of the IJSE has a secure hold as judged by the surgeon intraoperatively. Also, the screws placed in the ulna must be judged by the surgeon to have sufficient hold. The subject or legal guardian has been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to its provisions, and has provided informed written consent. The subject is willing to be available for the appropriate followup for the duration of the study. The subject has one of the following conditions: Presents with limited elbow motion as opposed to instability (subjects where instability is created through surgical release for chronic limitation of movement, soft tissue release, removal of adhesions and heterotopic ossification and/or fascial interposition will be excluded). Active infection, suspicion of colonization or quiescent infection Bacteremia Bone loss greater than 30% of the total articulation or involving an entire column of the distal humerus The subject has less than 50% of the height of the coronoid remaining, based on lateral xray view Osteoporosis to the degree that the screws that insert into the ulna loosen during implantation Material sensitivity to titanium or cobalt chrome The subject has imminent, known issues related to life expectancy. The subject is unable and/or unwilling to cooperate with study procedures, a rehabilitative program, or required followup visits. The subject has a condition that may interfere with the outcome or impede healing. The subject, in the opinion of the Clinical Investigator, has an existing condition that indicates he/she is not a good candidate for the study. The subject is unable or unwilling to give informed consent and/or who has no responsible family member willing to give consent. The subject is transient and has no fixed address. The subject is a prisoner. The subject is &lt;21 years of age, or &gt;21 years of age but skeletally immature.</criteria>
