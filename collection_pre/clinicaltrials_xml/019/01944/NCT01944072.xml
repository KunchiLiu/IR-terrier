	<brief_summary>Trial design: An equivalence/non-inferiority randomized controlled trial with parallel group design studied the effect of two aerobic exercise-training intensities in COPD patient-centered outcomes. Methods: Thirty-four COPD clinically stable patients stratified from mild to very severe GOLD stages, were blinded to 60 or 80%Wmax aerobic exercise training intensity in an outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program, between 2009-2010. Outcomes were assessed with St.George's respiratory questionnaire (primary outcome), Mahler dyspnea index, London Chest activity of daily living scale, 6-minute walk, constant load and incremental exercise tests. Patient's allocation sequence was computer-generated, with consignment in a safe deposit box.</brief_summary>
