	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Intravenous Infusion With Nemonoxacin Malate Sodium Chloride</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Community-acquired Pneumonia (CAP) remains a leading cause of death in both developing and developed countries. In the choice of antibacterial agents used to treat CAP, fluoroquinolones have received considerable attention because of their wide spectrum of bactericidal activity. TG-873870 (Nemonoxacin), a non-fluorinated quinolone (NFQ), is a selective bacterial topoisomerase inhibitor. This study will Evaluate the clinical efficacy, microbiological efficacy and safety of Intravenous Nemonoxacin compared with Intravenous Moxifloxacin in adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Besides, the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Nemonoxacin in adult patients with CAP after continuous IV Infusion and the pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD)are to be determined.</detailed_description>
