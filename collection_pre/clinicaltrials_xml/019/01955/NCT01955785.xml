	<brief_summary>Intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) is influenced by several factors of which one is arterial CO2 tension. Patient with TBI are often sedated and mechanically ventilated in order to secure a stable PaCO2. This study compares two ventilation modus; Pressure Controlled Ventilation (PC) and Pressure Regulated Volume Controlled ventilation (PRVC) in order to observe which of the two ventilation strategies results in a more stable ICP and arterial CO2 pressure (PaCO2).</brief_summary>
