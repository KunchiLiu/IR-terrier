	<brief_summary>Premature infants experience more respiratory problems after surgical procedures. The investigators aimed to compare general anesthesia with sedation on the need for post-operative mechanical ventilation in infants undergoing retinopathy of prematurity surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anesthesia for Retinopathy of Prematurity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>60 patients who underwent laser surgery due to retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) were included in the study. The sedation group (Group S, n=30), received 1 mg/kg ketamine and 1 mg/kg propofol as a bolus for induction. The patients then received an infusion of 100-150 mcg/kg/min propofol and 0.25mg/kg/h of ketamine for maintenance. In the general anesthesia group (Group G, n=30), anesthesia was induced using 8% sevoflurane by inhalation with 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen; endotracheal intubation was facilitated without use of a neuromuscular blocker agent. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane (2%) and 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Our primary objective was to evaluate the need for post-operative mechanical ventilation.</detailed_description>
