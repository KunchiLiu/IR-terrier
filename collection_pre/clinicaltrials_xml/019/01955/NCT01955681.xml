	<brief_title>A Retrospective, Non-interventional, Multicenter, Observational Chart Review Study to Explore the Clinical Benefits of Retreatment With TKI in the Real World.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to retrospectively review the medical and chemotherapy records of 300 patients with EGFR mutation positive adenocarcinoma NSCLC. Eligible patients are as follows: histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC, undergone EGFR-TKI retreatment sometime after the failure of the initial EGFR-TKI. After initial treatment, patients had been treated with chemotherapy and subsequently re-treated with EGFR-TKI will be identified. The target population will be derived from multicentre in Taiwan. The study aim is to evaluate clinical effect in re-administration of EGFR-TKI using retrospectively collected data from these eligible patients to provide valuable information.</detailed_description>
