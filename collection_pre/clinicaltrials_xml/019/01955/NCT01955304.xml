	<brief_title>Food Effect Study of Single Dose of Fruquintinib (HMPL-013) in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be an open-label, randomized, two-period, crossover PK food effect study of fruquintinib administered orally at 4mg. Subjects will be screened for eligibility up to 14 days prior to entry into the study. For each of 2 study periods, subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit (CRU) on the day before dosing and fast overnight (approximately 10 hours). On the morning of dosing for each of the 2 study periods, subjects will receive a single oral dose of 4 mg fruquintinib in either the fasted or fed state. Subjects will remain at the CRU for at least 120 hours after administration of study drug for collection of serial blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis and safety monitoring. Subjects will return to the CRU for safety assessment for up to 336 hours postdose.</detailed_description>
