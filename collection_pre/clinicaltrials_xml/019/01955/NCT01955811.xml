	<brief_summary>Patients with need of platelet transfusion for any reason will participate in this study. Directly before the start of infusion and one hour after the end of platelet transfusion blood samples will be drawn and treated with different concentrations of Fibrinogen (a blood clotting factor) in-vitro. Blood samples with and without Fibrinogen/platelet transfusion will be compared. The study hypothesis is that treatment with Fibrinogen results in a better stabilisation of blood coagulation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Reveal if Fibrinogen Treatment Effects Blood Clotting Better Than a Platelet Transfusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In total 300 patients with the need of platelet transfusion for whatever reason will be included when meeting the inclusion- and exclusion criteria. For all patients three visits are planned, where blood samples will be taken. The first blood samples will be taken directly before the start of platelet transfusion, the second 1 hour after the end of the platelet transfusion and the third after 24 hours. Untreated citrate and EDTA blood samples from Visit 1 will be serving as baseline for the coagulation testing. Further citrate blood samples from the first visit will be spiked with different concentrations of fibrinogen in vitro. Untreated citrate and EDTA blood samples will be taken 1 hour and 24 hours after platelet transfusion for comparison. Further citrate blood samples will be spiked with different concentrations of fibrinogen in vitro again 1 hour after platelet transfusion. In addition, randomly chosen samples will be analyzed using confocal microscopy. Routine coagulation analysis include activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time(PT), fibrinogen, blood coagulation factor thirteen (FXIII), thromboelastometry (ExTEM &amp; FibTEM) before and after platelet transfusion.</detailed_description>
