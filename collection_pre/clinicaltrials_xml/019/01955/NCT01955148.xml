	<brief_summary>This study is designed to determine if quantitative analysis of fetal Fibronectin (fFN) can be used to advance prediction of spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB). This will be a prospective observational multi-center study with approximately 15 to 20 US sites, and approximately 1210 subjects evaluating the clinical utility of the Rapid fFN 10Q system for preterm birth risk assessment. A single fFN specimen will be collected from each subject between 16 weeks, 0 days and 21 weeks, 6 days. The primary and secondary maternal outcome measures will be determined based on the date of delivery and the estimated date of confinement (EDC), which will be evaluated in a standardized manner.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>fFN Clinical Evaluation in Asymptomatic Women at High Risk for Preterm Birth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hologic has developed a quantitative test to assess the amount of fetal fibronectin (fFN) present in cervicovaginal secretions, and evaluate the clinical utility of the test in assessing spontaneous Pre-Term Bith risk in a high risk population. Identifying women at high risk of giving birth prematurely can be challenging. It is believed that higher levels of fFn measured in vaginal fluid suggest a woman is at a greater risk for delivering early. fFN testing is already approved for use in women from weeks 22 to 35 of pregnancy. The goal of this study is to evaluate the benefits of collecting fFN measurements from a vaginal fluid specimen taken during early pregnancy (from 16 weeks to 22 weeks) to assess the risk of pre-term birth.</detailed_description>
