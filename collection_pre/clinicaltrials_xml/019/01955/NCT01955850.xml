	<brief_summary>The object of this study is to compare internet-delivered treatment for insomnia to face-to-face treatment and a waiting-list. In this study participants are randomized to: 1) online cognitive-behavioral intervention; 2) face-to-face cognitive behavioral intervention; 3) waiting-list. Both the online and face-to-face interventions consist of: diary; psycho-education; relaxation exercises; stimulus control/sleep hygiene; sleep restriction; challenging the misconceptions about sleep; and paradoxical exercise. Adult persons with insomnia will be invited via a popular scientific website to fill out online questionnaires. Participants fill out questionnaires and a dairy at baseline post-test, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up. Participants on the waiting-list receive online treatment after the first post-test. The investigators expect that the online-delivered treatment and the face-to-face treatment are equally effective.</brief_summary>
