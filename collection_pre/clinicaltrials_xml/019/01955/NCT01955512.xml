	<brief_summary>In asthma, breathing in an allergen, such as house dust mite induces inflammation in the airways. This process appears to involve an interaction between two different sorts of blood cells, platelets and white blood cells via a receptor called the P2Y12 receptor. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the drug clopidogrel which blocks the P2Y12 receptor on platelets, reduces inflammation following breathing in house dust mite in people with mild asthma.</brief_summary>
