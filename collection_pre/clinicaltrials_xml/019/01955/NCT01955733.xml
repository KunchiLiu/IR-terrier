	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Must give written informed consent and be willing to follow this CTP. 2. Male or female patients, with moderately to severely active RA who have previously participated in the doubleblind randomized clinical Trial 1301.1. 3. Current treatment for RA on an outpatient basis: 1. Patients must continue to receive and tolerate oral or parenteral methotrexate (MTX) therapy at a dose of 1525 mg per week (dose may be as low as 10 mg per week if the patient is unable to tolerate a higher dose). 2. Patients must be willing to receive oral folic acid (at least 5 mg/week or as per local practice) or folinic acid (at least 1 mg per week or as per local practice) or equivalent during the entire trial. 3. If receiving current treatment with oral corticosteroids (other than intraarticular or parenteral), the dose must not exceed 10 mg/day prednisolone or equivalent. During the 4 weeks prior to Baseline (Day 1) the dose must remain stable. 4. Intraarticular and parenteral corticosteroids are not permitted throughout the trial, with the exception of IV administration of 100 mg methylprednisolone 30 to 60 minutes prior to each infusion as part of the trial procedures. 5. Any concomitant nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) must be stable throughout the trial. 6. Patients may be taking oral hydroxychloroquine provided that the dose is not greater than 400 mg/day, or chloroquine provided that the dose is not greater than 250 mg/day. These doses must have been stable for a minimum of 12 weeks prior to Day 1. The hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine treatment will need to be continued at a stable dose with the same formulation until the end of the trial. 4. For participants of reproductive potential (males and females), use of a medically acceptable method of contraception during the trial, i.e., a combination of 2 forms of effective contraception (defined as hormonal contraception, intrauterine device, condom with spermicide, etc.). Females of childbearing potential must also agree to use an acceptable method of contraception (see above) for 12 months following completion or discontinuation from the trial medication. Exclusion criteria: 1. Patients receiving current treatment with corticosteroids must not be receiving a dose exceeding 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent. 2. Serious underlying medical conditions, which, per the investigator¿s discretion, could impair the ability of the patient to participate in the trial (including but not limited to ongoing severe infection, severe immunosuppression, severe heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, gastric ulcers, active autoimmune disease). 3. Pregnancy or breast feeding. For women of childbearing potential, a positive serum pregnancy test at the Screening Visit. 4. Patients who have significant cardiac disease, including but not limited to congestive heart failure of Class III or IV of the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification; uncontrolled angina or arrhythmia; any uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease; or uncontrolled hypertension. 5. Treatment with IV or intramuscular corticosteroids. The only exception will be the administration of 100 mg IV methylprednisolone 30 to 60 minutes before each infusion as part of the trial procedures. 6. Any condition or treatment (including biologic therapies) that, in the opinion of the investigator, may place the patient at unacceptable risk during the trial. 7. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN). 8. Hemoglobin &lt;8.0 g/dL. 9. Levels of IgG &lt;5.0 g/L. 10. Absolute neutrophil count &lt;1500/µL. 11. Platelet count &lt;75000/µL.</criteria>
