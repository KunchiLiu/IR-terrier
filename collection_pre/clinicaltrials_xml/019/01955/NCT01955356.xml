	<brief_summary>Some studies have revealed that an induced endometrial injury could improve embryo human implantation in patients with implantation failure. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the induced endometrial injury could be beneficial for regular patients undergoing IVF</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Embryo Implantation After Induced Endometrial Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endometrial induced injury has been suggested that could improve embryo implantation in cases of patients with recurrent implantation failure. The mechanisms that induce that improvement remain unknown. We want to analyse if the endometrial induce injury could be useful in cases of standard patients who require assisted reproductive techniques. For that purpose we will start a randomized controlled trial with the ideal background in implantation in ART, the egg donation programme.</detailed_description>
