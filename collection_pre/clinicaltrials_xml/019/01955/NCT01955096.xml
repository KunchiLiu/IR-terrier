	<brief_title>Fast Track Surgery With Laparoscopic-assisted Gastrectomy for Advanced Gastric Cancer: a Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods: We designed a prospective randomized, controlled clinical trial then recruited 61 consecutive advanced gastric cancer patients. (Trial registration number: JLUFHC1722013) Further divide into a fast-track surgery group (n=30) and a conventional surgery group (n=31). Surgical technique in both groups is same laparoscopic-assisted gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy. Compare outcomes includes length of hospital stay, return to normal diet and postoperative complications.Results: Recovery parameters such as the length of time to return to normal diet; to the first defection; start of ambulation time ;the mean hospital stay will be all less in patients assigned to the fast track surgery protocol compared with those in the conventional care programme. Conclusion: We will consider fast-track rehabilitation to be safe and feasible in advanced gastric cancer patients. Moreover, it will result in decreased hospital stay.</detailed_description>
