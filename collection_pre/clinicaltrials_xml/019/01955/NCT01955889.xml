	<brief_summary>Persons with Parkinson Disease (PD) face significant declines in function resulting in greater disability. Function can improve through participation in exercise, yet many people with PD are physically inactive. Given that people with PD live long lifespans following diagnosis; it is essential to include routine exercise into their lives over the long-term. Physical therapy is effective in improving function in persons with PD. However, participation in on-going physical therapy indefinitely is not a realistic option due to limited healthcare resources. Interventions using mobile health technologies allow physical therapists to stay connected to patients over time potentially improving their ability to meet the changing needs of patients with PD. Innovative approaches using mobile health technology may improve outcome; however, the effectiveness of different approaches to improve function and reduce disability in PD is unknown. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two interventions to improve function and health-related quality of life in 65 people with PD. In one study group, participants receive a home exercise program, in written format, to continue on an independent basis. In the other study group, participants are instructed to continue with an exercise program, in their home, delivered using videos of the exercises on a computer tablet device. This use of mobile-Health technology allows the physical therapist to remotely monitor participants' progress and modify the exercise program to meet the changing needs of each patient. The long-term objective of this research is to determine the most efficient and effective way to improve function that can be widely disseminated to persons with PD.</brief_summary>
