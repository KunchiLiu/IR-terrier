	<criteria>Nonsmokers or former smokers, who stopped smoking 6 months prior to screening. Former smokers should not have a smoking history of more than 5 pack years (1 pack of 20 cigarettes per day over 5 years). Prebronchodilator (after abstaining from Short acting β2agonist for ≥8 hrs) Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1) ≥70% of the predicted normal value at the screening visit. Prebronchodilator (after abstaining from Short acting β2agonist for ≥8 hrs) Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1) ≥70% of the predicted normal value OR if less than 70% must be within +/ 12 % of screening FEV1 prior to randomization. History or diagnosis of asthma for at least 6 months prior to screening according to the Global Initiative in Asthma guidelines (GINA, 2012). Use of Short acting β2agonist therapy only (≤ 8 puffs per day) for at least 4 weeks prior to screening and prior to randomisation. Positive response to methacholine challenge (PC20 ≤ 8 mg/mL) at screening. Positive response to ATP challenge (PC20 ≤ 200 µmol/mL) at screening. Hospitalized or attended the emergency department for an asthma attack in the 12 months prior to screening. Exacerbation of asthma or lower respiratory tract infection during the 4 weeks before screening. Upper respiratory tract infection during the 4 weeks before screening or prior to randomization requiring treatment with antibiotics. Inhaled or systemic corticosteroids (oral, intravenous, intramuscular) within 4 weeks prior to screening. Shortacting or longacting antihistamines within 48hrs or 7 days, respectively, prior to screening.</criteria>
