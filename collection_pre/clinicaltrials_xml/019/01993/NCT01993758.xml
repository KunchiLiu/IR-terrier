	<brief_summary>This study aims to determine whether the lower tourniquet pressure, which is set by adding 120mmHg (millimeter of mercury) on the systolic blood pressure just before tourniquet inflation, are efficient and safe during total knee arthroplasty, compared with the conventional tourniquet pressure: 150mmHg above the systolic blood pressure before tourniquet inflation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Lower Tourniquet Pressure During Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will compare the two groups of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty, which the tourniquet pressure will be set differently: systolic blood pressure plus 120mmHg vs. systolic blood pressure plus 150mmHg, the conventional method, in terms of efficacy and safety.</detailed_description>
