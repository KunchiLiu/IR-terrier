	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn more about the brain circuits involved with effortful control in healthy adult participants. Study participants will be given either methylphenidate (also known as 'Ritalin')which is an FDA approved, most widely-used medication given to those diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)or a placebo, which is a sugar pill. Each participant will also perform some computer tasks that have been shown in previous studies to require effortful control while undergoing an fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) which takes a special kind of picture of the brain. Our goal is to learn more about the brain mechanisms by which methylphenidate improves effortful control.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study involves two total visits. All visits are scheduled at the Rachel Upjohn Building on East Medical Campus of the University of Michigan. Participation in this study will end once the participant has completed both study visits which are a total of 4 hours. The first visit will require one to complete various questionnaires regarding behavior and general health and takes about 1 hour to complete. The second visit will be scheduled approximately 2 to 7 days after the first study visit and includes the fMRI scanning session. The second visit will last about 3 hours.</detailed_description>
