	<brief_title>ICG Distribution Using NIF Imaging After IV Injection of ICG in Benign and Malignant Breast Cancer Tissue.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective: Definition of the histological distribution (intravascular, extra vascular, in specific cells) of ICG (pre-operatively intra-venously injected) at the level of tumoral and healthy tissues of breast cancer patients (and the potential of axillary lymph nodes found fluorescent). Secondary objectives: Evaluation of the ability of the fluorescence imaging to determine the tumor volume and, more specifically, the boundaries of tumor tissues which will be analyzed by the pathologist. Analysis of the correlation between fluorescence and "margins" as defined operatively as tumor (microscopically by the pathologist).</detailed_description>
