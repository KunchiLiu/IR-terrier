	<brief_title>Evaluation of HQ® Matrix Medical Wound Dressing for Healing of Donor Site Wounds</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HQ® Matrix Medical Wound Dressing is a transparent, non-porous, pliable, gas-permeable, and waterproof film dressing which is comprised of silk fibroin protein of the Bombyx mori (B. mori) silkworm. It is intended to provide a moist, gas-permeable and sterile environment to facilitate the normal wound healing process. It is used in the management of non-infected skin defects and various dermal wounds. Sidaiyi® wound dressing (Suzhou Soho Biomaterial Science and Technology Co., Ltd, Suzhou, China) is a CFDA approved (Su2012-2640182), silk fibroin-based, two-layered spongy dressing. Upon the silk fibroin spongy dressing layer is a membrane made of medical silicone. It is used in the management of partial- and full-thickness wounds, donor site wounds and burns. Currently, it is the sole silk fibroin biomaterial for wound healing that has received regulatory approval worldwide.</detailed_description>
