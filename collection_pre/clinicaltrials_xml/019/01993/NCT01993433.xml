	<brief_title>A Safety and Efficacy Study of DRM02 in Subjects With Plaque Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind, randomized, within-subject control, study enrolling 20 subjects with plaque psoriasis and designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of DRM02. Safety will be assessed during the study, through adverse events, local skin responses, urinalysis, serum chemistry and hematology laboratory testing, physical examination and vital signs. Preliminary efficacy will be assessed through the Physician's Lesion Assessment (PLA) and the Severity of Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) from only the two plaques identified at the baseline visit.</detailed_description>
