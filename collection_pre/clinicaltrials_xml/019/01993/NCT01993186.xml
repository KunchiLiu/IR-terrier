	<brief_summary>UX007 is more effective than placebo for the reduction of seizures in patients with Glut1 DS, as measured by the reduction from baseline in frequency of generalized or partial-onset seizures, including: Generalized Tonic-Clonic, Generalized Tonic, Generalized Clonic, Generalized Atonic, Partial/Focal with Secondary Generalization, Myoclonic, Myoclonic Atonic, Myoclonic Tonic, Complex Partial/Focal, Absence and Simple Partial/Focal Motor seizures</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study of Triheptanoin (UX007) for the Treatment of Glucose Transporter Type 1 Deficiency Syndrome (Glut1 DS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY: UX007G-CL201 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, study to assess the safety and efficacy of UX007 in Glut1 DS. The study will enroll pediatric, adolescent, and adult subjects who are currently not on, or not compliant with a ketogenic or other high fat diet. Enrolled subjects are otherwise able to maintain standard of care treatment with 1-3 AEDs throughout the duration of the study. Beginning with the screening visit, subjects will record seizure frequency during the 6-week Baseline Period. If the subject does not meet the seizure count criteria, the subject will be considered a screen failure and will not be randomized. At the end of the Baseline Period, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to either UX007 or placebo. Dosing will be initiated using a 2-week titration schedule until the subject has reached 35% of total daily calories from study drug (~1-4 g/kg/day depending on age). If a subject has not reached the target of 35% of total daily calories by the end of the 2-week titration period, dose titration should continue until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Phase 2 study will enroll approximately 40 subjects. After the initial 8-week double-blind Treatment Period, the open-label Extension Period will begin, wherein all subjects will be treated with UX007 through Week 52 of the study. A population-PK analysis at Week 26 will provide data on metabolite levels with all subjects on UX007. Following the Week 26 visit, approximately the first 40 subjects will participate in a 10-week Dose Exploration Period to assess the impact of UX007 dose level on seizure control, other clinical manifestations such as movement disorders and cognitive deficits, and tolerability. At the end of the Dose Exploration Period, the subject will continue in the open-label Extension period, maintained on the UX007 dose (as determined by the Investigator) that provided the maximum improvement in clinical status with acceptable tolerability, and continued on this dose for the duration of the study. Long term safety and maintenance of effect of UX007 will be assessed during the Extension Period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Diagnosis of Glut1 DS confirmed by SLC2A1 mutation 2. Males and females at least 1 of age at the time of informed consent 3. Average of at least 2 observable seizures (generalized or partialonset [simple partial motor, complex partial, absence, or secondarily generalized seizures) in 4 weeks over the last 24 weeks, by subject or caregiver report 4. At least 2 observable seizures (generalized or partialonset [simple partial motor, complex partial, or secondarily generalized seizures) in 4 weeks during the Baseline Period, with no 3week seizurefree period during the Baseline Period OR absence seizures documented on Screening EEG 5. Continuing to have seizures despite a prior or current use of at least 1 AED 6. Allowed to be on up to 3 concomitant AEDs that must have been stable in dose at least 2 weeks prior to the beginning of screening and anticipated to remain stable in dose through the end of the 8week, placebocontrolled Treatment Period 7. Not on, or not fully compliant with a prescribed diet plan (e.g. KD) 8. Plasma level of betahydroxybutyrate (BHB) â‰¤ 1 mmol/L (nonfasting) at Screening 9. Provide written or verbal assent (if possible) and written informed consent by a legally authorized representative after the nature of the study has been explained, and prior to any researchrelated procedures 10. Must, in the opinion of the investigator, be willing and able to complete all aspects of the study, comply with accurate completion of the seizures diary, and likely to complete the 8 week, placebocontrolled, Treatment Period 11. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening, be willing to use an acceptable method of contraception, and have additional pregnancy tests during the study. Females considered not of childbearing potential include those who have not reached menarche, had total hysterectomy, have been in menopause for at least two years, or have had tubal ligation at least one year prior to Screening. 1. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels exceeding 3X the upper limit of normal at Screening 2. Any known hypersensitivity to triheptanoin or safflower oil that, in the judgment of the investigator, places the subject at increased risk for adverse effects 3. Prior use of triheptanoin within 30 days prior to Screening 4. History of, or current suicidal ideation, behavior and/or attempts 5. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding an infant at Screening 6. Participants unwilling or unable to discontinue use of a prohibited medication or other substance that may confound study objectives 7. Use of any investigational product (drug or supplement, including medium chain triglyceride [MCT] oil) within 30 days prior to Screening, or at any time during the study 8. Has a condition of such severity and acuity, in the opinion of the investigator, that it warrants immediate surgical intervention or other treatment 9. Has a concurrent disease or condition, or laboratory abnormality that, in the view of the investigator, places the subject at high risk of poor treatment compliance or of not completing the study, or would interfere with study participation or introduces additional safety concerns (e.g., diabetes mellitus, other concurrent neurological or psychiatric disorders)</criteria>
