	<brief_summary>POUT is a multi-centred randomised controlled phase III trial. 345 patients who have undergone nephro-ureterectomy, are surgically staged pT2-pT4, N0-3 or are pT1 and node positive, and who are fit for adjuvant chemotherapy, will be randomised to four cycles of adjuvant platinum based chemotherapy (experimental group) or surveillance (control group). Participants will be followed up according to routine practice. Primary endpoint: Disease-free survival (DFS) Secondary endpoints: - Overall Survival - Metastasis free survival - Incidence of bladder second primary tumours - Incidence of contralateral primary tumours - Acute and late toxicity - Treatment compliance - Quality of life</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Written informed consent ≥18 years of age Post radical nephroureterectomy for upper tract tumour with predominant TCC component squamoid differentiation or mixed TCC/SCC is permitted. Histologically confirmed TCC staged pT2pT4 pN03 M0 or pTany N13 M0 (providing all grossly abnormal nodes are resected). Patients with microscopically positive margins on pathology may be entered (providing all grossly abnormal disease was resected). Satisfactory haematological profile (ANC&gt; 1.5 x 109/L, platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L) and liver function tests (bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN, AST and Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2.5 x ULN), Glomerular filtration rate ≥30 mls/min. Fit and willing to receive adjuvant chemotherapy with first cycle to be commenced within 90 days of radical nephroureterectomy if allocated WHO performance status 01. Available for longterm followup Evidence of distant metastases Pure adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma or small cell or other variant histology Unresected macroscopic nodal disease Concurrent muscle invasive bladder cancer (patients with concurrent Nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) will be eligible) GFR &lt;30 ml/minute. NB Gemcitabinecarboplatin can only be given for patients with suboptimal renal function for cisplatin i.e. for GFR 3049ml/min. Patients with poor performance status or comorbidities that would make them unfit for chemotherapy are ineligible for the trial Significant comorbid conditions that would interfere with administration of protocol treatment Pregnancy; lactating women or women of childbearing potential unwilling or unable to use adequate nonhormonal contraception (male patients should also use contraception if sexually active); Previous malignancy in the last 5 years except for previous NMIBC, adequately controlled non melanoma skin tumours, CIS of cervix or LCIS of breast or localised prostate cancer in patients who have a life expectancy of over 5 years upon trial entry.</criteria>
