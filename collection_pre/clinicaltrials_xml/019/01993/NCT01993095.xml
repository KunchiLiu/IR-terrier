	<detailed_description>Persons with MS are less likely to be active than their healthy counterparts, a statistic that is compounded by the symptom manifestations of MS. However, there is increasing evidence to support the importance of physical activity in MS. Unfortunately, structured, safe, and efficacious physical activity programs that are often conducted in medical or university settings are often not accessible to many older adults with or without MS. We propose to conduct a randomized controlled pilot trial testing the efficacy of a DVD-delivered physical activity intervention which targets factors that have the potential to reduce disability in older adults with MS. This DVD-based intervention has been previously approved by the IRB at the University of Illinois for a similar study with low-active, community-dwelling older adults (IRB Protocol Number: 09765). This novel intervention provides systematic, programmatic activities with alternative versions of each exercise that allow individuals of all capabilities to complete the program successfully. It focuses on improving flexibility, strength, and balance and has been demonstrated to be feasible, well-accepted, and efficacious in a large sample of older adults without MS. Importantly, intervention resulted in clinically significant improvements in the Short Physical Performance Battery, reliable determinant of disability, institutionalization, morbidity, and mortality. If such an intervention was equally successful in older persons with MS, this could have considerable public health impact.</detailed_description>
