	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the concentration of different adipocytokine (adiponectin, leptin, resistin, visfatin, osteopontin) and an inflammation classic markers as Interleukine 1 beta, tumor necrosis alfa, interleukine 6 and high sensibility reactive c protein in the synovial fluid of knee osteoarthritis patients, and compare with the inflammation detected with ultrasonography evaluation of the joint. In last years, some studies appeared focusing on the role of adipocytokines in osteoarthritis and they correlated adipocytokines with cartilage degradation and x-ray degree; in our study we will focused in the importance of adipocytokines in the inflammatory changes more than in joint destruction.</brief_summary>
