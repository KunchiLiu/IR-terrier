	<detailed_description>The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a yoga treatment for veterans with mild post-traumatic and chronic tension-type headaches. The yoga will be provided in the form of 6 weekly yoga sessions aimed at providing direct instruction and immediate feedback on postures, breathing, and relaxation techniques in a small group format. The sessions will be led by an experienced yoga instructor who is a part of the study team and have worked with medical patients. A post-yoga 2-month follow-up assessment of self-reported symptoms, mood, and quality of life will also be assessed. This is a feasibility study to determine if a yoga treatment is received favorably and can be successfully delivered to veterans seeking treatments for post-traumatic and chronic tension-type headaches. This study does not include a comparison group; therefore, we can only make conclusions based on pre to post differences in subjects who participate in the yoga. Our aim for this study is to collect data on the potential benefits of a targeted yoga treatment for symptoms experienced by these subjects, and to then utilize these data to implement a larger study with a comparison group.</detailed_description>
