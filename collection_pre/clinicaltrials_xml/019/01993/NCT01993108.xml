	<brief_summary>The goal of this research is to understand the functioning of 'regulatory circuits' in the brain. These are brain circuits which allow a person to regulate their attention, regulate their behavioral responses, and regulate their decision-making. We are also interested in how the stimulant medications methylphenidate and naltrexone affect these regulatory circuits. Methylphenidate is a widely-used, FDA approved medication used to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and is also known as Ritalin. Naltrexone is an FDA approved medication used to help treat alcohol and substance abuse. This research study will use a scanning technique known as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)which takes a special kind of picture of the brain that enables us to "see the brain at work". Adult participants will be given a one-time dose of either methylphenidate, naltrexone,or placebo before each fMRI scan session. There are three total fMRI scan sessions. Therefore, each participant will receive each possible medication/placebo only once. Thus, using the fMRI technique, our main purpose for this research is to better understand the functioning of regulatory circuits in conditions such as ADHD and alcohol dependence. This research may one day help us develop better treatments for these disorders.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To ensure the safety of every subject before administration of any drug compound, all subjects must first undergo a urine drug test and if female, a urine pregnancy test before ingestion of the drug compound. Concurrently, subjects with alcohol dependence must undergo a breathalyzer as well as the urine drug and pregnancy test (if female) before ingestion of the drug compounds and fMRI scanning sessions. Once subjects have been administered the drug compound at the Rachel Upjohn Building at the University of Michigan, the study coordinator or any other trained study personnel will ride with the subject in a taxi cab ride over to the scanner facility. For more detailed information regarding drug administration please see section. Once at the scanner facility, subjects will fill out an MRI Safety form before every scan to ensure that they are able to enter the magnet safely. After this form has been completed and signed, then the subject will undergo a practice session of the fMRI tasks in the private practice room designated for such activity at the scanner facility. Once tasks have been practiced the MRI technician will prep the subject making sure there is no metal on their person before entering the scanner. All subjects will be in the scanner for approximately 65 minutes performing the tasks which are listed in more detail in section. Post scan, the study coordinator or other trained study personnel will escort the subject back to the Rachel Upjohn Building at the University of Michigan via taxi for a study debriefing.</detailed_description>
