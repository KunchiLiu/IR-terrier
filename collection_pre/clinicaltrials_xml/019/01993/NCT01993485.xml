	<brief_summary>Degenerative aortic valve stenosis (AVS) is the leading cause of aortic valve morbidity with a prevalence of 2-7% at ages above 65 years, with ever-increasing incidence especially in the 8th decades. AVS is independently associated with atheroclerosis risk factors and clinically apparent CV disease indicating that the degeneration of the aortic valve may represent an atheroclerosis-like process involving both, the aortic valve as well as the vascular system, respectivel. It is still unknown whether the endothelial function is affected as an manifestation of the atherosclerotic process, changes in the driving mechanical forces as WSS downstream of the valve, or other factors beyond physical pressure effects. The investigators hypothesized that altered haemodynamics may at least partly be responsible for observed endothelial dysfunction in patients with AVS. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate whether the resolution of AVS by transaortic valve implacement (TAVI) affects WSS, improves endothelial dysfunction and decreases levels of circulating EMPs as markers of endothelial integrity.</brief_summary>
