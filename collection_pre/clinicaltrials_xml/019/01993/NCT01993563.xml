	<brief_title>Graded Motor Imagery for Patients Within a Year After Stroke.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Graded Motor Imagery is a graded approach recently proposed for treating chronic pain patients. It included three subsequent steps: 1. Implicit Motor Imagery training (IMI), using a body part laterality discrimination task 2. Explicit Motor Imagery training, using pictures and videos for improving patient's ability in imagining movements 3. Mirror box therapy, using a 35x40 cm mirror, We are transferring this approach into stroke rehabilitation in order to improve patients' upper limb motor functions. All the patients, in both groups, will be training 2 hours a day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks. The first hour is standard treatment, the clinician in charge will decide treatment's priorities and the aim(s) of the treatment for each specific patient. The second hour will be focused on patient's upper limb function. The treatment group will be treated accordingly to the GMI protocol. The control group will receive a second hour of standard treatment, centred on the upper limb. Standard treatments are decided by the interdisciplinary team and might include motor rehabilitation, bilateral arm training, virtual reality training or occupational therapy.</detailed_description>
