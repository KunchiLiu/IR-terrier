	<brief_summary>The consequences of alcohol dependence are severe and may range from physical diseases to neuropsychological deficits in several cognitive domains. Alcohol abuse has also been related to brain dysfunction specifically in the prefrontal cortex. To assess these deficits and the application of a novel approach of cognitive stimulation to alcoholics, we have carried out a neuropsychological intervention program with mobile health technology. Patients diagnosed with alcohol dependence syndrome were submitted to cognitive stimulation during four weeks in a three-day/week basis.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Only patients that scored higher than the cutoff values for their age on the Mini Mental Examination Test and with no clinical scores on the Symptoms Checklist Revised were included in the study. Patients with dependency from substances other than alcohol or with history of previous neurological disorders were excluded from the study. Patients were also screened for minimal computer literacy; no patients were excluded due to lack of this criterion.</criteria>
