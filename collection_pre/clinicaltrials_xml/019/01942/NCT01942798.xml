	<brief_summary>WiiNWALK is a 4 week physical activity, with the intervention of a WiiFit, targeted to improve walking capacity in individuals with either a unilateral below-knee or above-knee amputation. This is a randomized control trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the WiiNWALK program in older (50+ years) community living adults with lower limb amputations (LLA). Hypothesis: We expect the WiiNWALK intervention will have a treatment effect with improvement in functional walking capacity, compared to the control group who will only be playing cognitive games. Secondarily, a functional walking capacity will also include an improvement in lower extremity strength and balance, inter-limb gait symmetry, balance confidence along with participation in daily and social activities, locomotor capabilities and an increase in physical activities.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of WiiFit to Enhance Walking in Older Adult Amputees</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lower limb amputation (LLA) is prevalent among older Canadians. Estimates from 2003 suggest that &gt; 2 million individuals were living with LLA in North America with an annual estimated 150,000 incident cases. Over 50% of these procedures are considered major, with 28% of individuals having a transtibial (TT) or below knee amputation and 26% having a transfemoral (TF) or above knee amputation. The WiiNWalk is designed to evaluate whether this intervention does improve the walking capacity of older adults through a series of balancing and other physical activities using the Wii balance board. An improved walking capacity (ie: being able to walk a longer distance) may effect balance, strength, and fitness components that are critical to improve prosthetic walking. The ability to walk a longer distance may effect a person's lifestyle as it allows the individual to move around his/her environment independently which in turn impacts ones choice of daily and social activities and participation, and therefore providing them with more mobility, freedom and choice. This study focuses on older adults because, according to Canadian Institute of Health Information data, 50-74 year old were 17 times more likely to have a LLA and individuals aged â‰¥ 75 were 36 times more likely to have a LLA.The primary reason for this exponential age-related increased incidence is the late stage effects of chronic diseases such as diabetes and vascular disease that are common in older adults. If as anticipated, the WiiFit proves to increase walking capacity, it will provide a low cost method for those with LLA to have an accessible system that, due to the weight-shifting, balance and aerobic training nature of the Wii games, will serve as a therapeutic agent for rehabilitation.</detailed_description>
