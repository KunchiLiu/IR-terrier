	<brief_summary>This open-label, Phase IV prospective, observational study will evaluate patients, who have been diagnosed with Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration and have previously received either a standard intravitreal injection of ranibizumab or aflibercept, in order to get and compare information regarding post-injection inflammatory (irritation in the eye)2-3 days post-injection. Additionally, patients will be evaluated for visual acuity and pain 2-3 days post-injection.</brief_summary>
