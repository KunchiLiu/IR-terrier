	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria at Screening: The patient has a Major Depressive Episode (MDE) associated to Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), diagnosed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, Text Revision (DSMIVTR™). The current MDE should be confirmed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). The patient has an inadequate response to at least one antidepressant treatment (including the treatment the patient is taking at screening) in the current MDE, as documented by selfreport as less than a predefined response on the Massachusetts General Hospital Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (ATRQ). The patient has a predefined Montgomery Aasberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score, and a predefined Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness (CGIS) score at screening, and has had the current MDE for ≥10 weeks. The patient is currently treated for the current MDE with an adequate selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressant treatment for ≥6 weeks, at the same dosage for ≥2 weeks. The patient has sleep disturbances (difficulty falling asleep and/or difficulty staying asleep and/or problem waking up too early) confirmed by a predefined Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score. The patient agrees to protocoldefined use of effective contraception. Entry Criteria to Treatment Period (Baseline Visit): The patient still fulfils DSMIVTR™ criteria for MDE. The patient received the same SSRI or SNRI antidepressant treatment at adequate dose during the entire leadin period. The patient has a predefined MADRS total score. The patient's improvement in the MADRS total score is a predefined percentage compared to screening. The patient has a predefined Clinical Global Impression Global Improvement (CGII) score. The patient has sleep disturbances (difficulty falling asleep and/or difficulty staying asleep and/or problem waking up too early) confirmed by a predefined ISI score. The patient has sleep disturbances confirmed by predefined Latency to Persistent Sleep (LPS) and predefined Sleep Efficiency (SE). The patient is, in the investigator's opinion, unlikely to comply with the protocol or is unsuitable for any reason. Other inclusion and exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
