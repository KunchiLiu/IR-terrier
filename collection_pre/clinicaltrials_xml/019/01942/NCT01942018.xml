	<brief_title>Per Oral Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM) for Esophagogastric Junction Outflow Obstruction (EGOO)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with EGOO have difficulty swallowing and/or chest pain. Previously we were not able to distinguish this disease from achalasia. Achalasia is a disease which is characterized by a progressive difficulty with swallowing. It is caused by failure of relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (sphincter between esophagus and stomach) along with an essentially aperistaltic esophageal body. However, EGOO patients have abnormal lower esophageal sphincter relaxation with some preserved peristaltic activity. Because they have some peristalsis, these patients are not diagnosed with achalasia. Currently, a new diagnostic method, known as high-resolution manometry (HRM), can identify EGOO patients. EGOO patients usually do not respond well to medical treatment and surgery is required in most cases to reduce the pressure of lower esophageal sphincter muscles. This procedure is called "Heller myotomy". Recently, a new endoscopic method for reducing lower esophageal sphincter pressure has been developed. This method, per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is now being performed clinically throughout the world, including Johns Hopkins Hospital. The technique utilizes a flexible endoscope to tunnel beneath the esophageal surface layer and cutting muscle fibers of the lower esophagus and upper stomach. POEM is an alternative to invasive surgery with fewer complications. POEM is performed safely at Johns Hopkins Hospital for achalasia patients. Outcomes of POEM have been excellent with greater than 90% positively responding to endoscopic myotomy. Patients with EGOO are being diagnosed more often due to increased use of HRM. They respond poorly to endoscopic therapies but well to surgical myotomy. POEM is the endoscopic equivalent to surgical intervention and represents a less invasive approach to treating these patients.</detailed_description>
