	<brief_title>Monitoring Disease Activity Using Video Capsule Endoscopy (VCE) in Crohn's Disease (CD) Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multi-center (up to 15 sites) study which aims to assess the ability of VCE (Video capsule endoscopy) to detect change in the severity of the small bowel mucosal disease activity in CD subjects after 6 months . Up to 75 subjects will participate in this study. An interim analysis will be done after study completion with 20 subjects. All subjects to be enrolled in this study will be pediatric and\or adult subjects with known Crohn's disease</detailed_description>

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs including aspirin (twice weekly or more), not including aspirin up to 81mg daily, during the 4 weeks preceding enrollment 9. Suspected GI stricture, followed by PillCamÂ® Patency study or other imaging study that could not prove patency of the GI tract. 10. Subject is expected to undergo MRI examination within 7 days after ingestion of the capsule. 11. Subjects with known or suspected delayed gastric emptying 12. Subjects with known or suspected delayed Small bowel motility 13. Subject has any allergy or other known contraindication to the medications used in the study. 14.
