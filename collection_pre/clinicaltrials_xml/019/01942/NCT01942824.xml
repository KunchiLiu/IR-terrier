	<brief_summary>Influenza infection leads to on average 24,0000 deaths and 150,000 hospitalizations annually. While vaccination is the cornerstone of preventing influenza infection, vaccination coverage in adults is low with only 35% vaccinated by end of November. Latino adults have the lowest coverage rates. Text message reminders have been used successfully for improving influenza vaccination for children. This study will assess the use of text messaging to improve influenza vaccination coverage rates in a largely minority, publicly insured adult population.</brief_summary>
