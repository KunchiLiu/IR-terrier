	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if a special coating, applied to the surface of glasses can reduce the frequency and severity of migraine headaches in children and adolescents. This study is being conducted by researchers at Primary Children's Medical Center, The John Moran Eye Center, and the University of Utah Department of Electrical Engineering. The investigators have determined that a specific frequency of light is particularly bothersome to migraine patients. The coating they've developed is designed to block this frequency of light. Very few treatments are approved for the treatment of childhood migraine. The investigators hope that these glasses will provide a safe way to improve headaches in children.</brief_summary>
