	<brief_summary>Objective: The impact of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) on perinatal morbidity and long-term neurodevelopmental outcome has been published in numerous studies. Throughout this analysis, the influence of IUGR on the postnatal amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) in preterm infants below 30 weeks of gestation was assessed. The second concern was the correlation between the pattern of the aEEG in the first two weeks with neurodevelopmental outcome, comparing infants with and without IUGR. Methods: Routinely assessed aEEG data of preterm infants with IUGR born below 30 weeks of gestation in the years 2005 until 2007 were analysed retrospectively according to the aEEG score (combining occurrence of sleep-wake-cycles, background activity and suspected seizure activity). Neurodevelopmental outcome was evaluated at 24 months using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and standardized neurologic examination.</brief_summary>
