	<criteria>Inclusion criteria 1. Patients aged 618 years with diagnosed with ataxia, preferably AT will be included. The diagnosis of AT will be made based on the criteria: typical clinical picture plus one of the following: 1. a proven mutation in the ATM gene 2. Deficient ATM protein proven by Western blotting 3. Elevated Î±fetoprotein, cerebellar atrophy on MRI and immune deficiency/ chromosomal breakage/ T cell lymphoreticular malignancy. 2. Children aged 618 years with suspected AT (fulfilling partially the above criteria will be included) 3. Children aged 618 years with AT like disease, with or without proven mutation in the MRE11 gene will be included 4. Children aged 618 years of age with ataxia of other known or unknown etiologies might be included, but their total number should not exceed 20% of the cohort in each site</criteria>
