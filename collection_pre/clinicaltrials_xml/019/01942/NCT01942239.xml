	<brief_summary>Hypoglycemia is frequent in very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates and compromises their neurological outcome. The aim of this study was to compare real-time continuous glucose monitoring system (RT-CGMS) to standard method by intermittent capillary blood glucose testing in detecting and managing hypoglycemia. The investigators calculated a number of 48 neonates to be randomized between 2 ways of glucose level monitoring for their 3 first days of life : either by RT-CGMS (CGM-group), or by intermittent capillary glucose testing (IGM-group) associated with a blind-CGMS to detect retrospectively missed hypoglycemia. The investigators' hypothesis is that in the CGM group number and duration of hypoglycemia will be lower.</brief_summary>
