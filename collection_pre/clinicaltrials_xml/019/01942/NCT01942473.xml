	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators test the hypothesis that automated FiO2 adjustment increases the time of brain tissue oxygenation within the intended reference range. Furthermore, the investigators studied the change in workload during automated FiO2 adjustment as compared to manual adjustment by the nursing staff.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Automated Adjustment of FiO2 on Cerebral and Arterial Oxygenation in Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recorded data on brain tissue oxygenation will be compared with reference data obtained from other studies. Data from experimental mode (automated FiO2 control will be compared with manual FiO2 control).</detailed_description>
