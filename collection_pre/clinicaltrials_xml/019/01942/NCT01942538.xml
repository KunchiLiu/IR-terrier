	<brief_title>Efficiency of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) Sessions After a Successful 3 Week-treatment in Fibromyalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a previous pilot study, a 3 week treatment with rTMS in fibromyalgia subjects induced a 40% improvement of pain feeling. Three months later, the pain level was still significantly reduced in comparison with the beginning of the treatment, but the clinical improvement was less than at the end of the treatment. We thus propose to realize real or sham rTMS sessions at 3 weeks interval during 6 months with subjects presenting a significant clinical improvement after a 3 week-rTMS or sham treatment to evaluate the response maintenance.</detailed_description>
