	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine findings of positron emission tomography and diffusion weighted magnetic resonance in primary lesion and axillary metastasis of breast cancer and compare of two imaging modality in these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Prognostic Value of FDG PET/CT and Diffusion-weighed Imaging on Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We aimed that to correlate both primary lesion 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) with clinicopathological prognostic factors and compare the prognostic value of these indexes in breast cancer in this study. The evaluated and compared parameters are SUVmax and ADC according to age, tumour size, lymph node metastasis, receptor status, histologic grade, modified Nottingham prognostic index.</detailed_description>
