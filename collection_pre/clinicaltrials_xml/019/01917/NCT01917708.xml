	<brief_summary>This is a single arm phase I study to assess the tolerability of abatacept when combined with cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil as graft versus host disease prophylaxis in children undergoing unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplant for serious non-malignant diseases as well as to assess the immunological effects of abatacept.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BMT Abatacept for Non-Malignant Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) represents the only viable cure for children who suffer from a wide variety of rare, serious non-malignant diseases, such as Fanconi Anemia, Hurler syndrome, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. A major obstacle to the success of HSCT is morbidity and mortality from graft versus host disease (GVHD), driven by donor T cells recognizing and reacting against disparate host antigens. This trial is being conducted as a step toward testing the long-term hypothesis that the costimulation blockade agent abatacept can be added to a standard post-transplant GVHD prophylaxis regimen, cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil, to improve disease-free survival after unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using reduced intensity conditioning for children with non-malignant diseases (NMD). This study will have the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim #1: To conduct a multicenter pilot assessing the tolerability of abatacept (n=20). Patients will receive four doses (10 mg/kg IV on days -1, +5, +14 and +28), a schedule well tolerated by adolescents and adults with hematologic malignancies in a previous pilot. Abatacept will be combined with cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil. Specific Aim #2: To examine the immunological effects of abatacept in this setting. Three reduced intensity conditioning regimens that have been shown to be effective in achieving sustained engraftment in patients with non-malignant diseases are available for use, depending on the patient's disease: - Patients with Fanconi anemia will receive fludarabine, low dose cyclophosphamide, and anti-thymocyte globlulin. - Patients with severe aplastic anemia will receive low dose total body irradiation, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and anti-thymocyte globlulin. - Patients with other NMD will receive either the low dose total body irradiation regimen or an alemtuzmab, fludarabine, thiotepa, and melphalan regimen.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must be between the ages of 021 years at the time of admission for transplant. Must have one of the following diseases: 1. Glanzmann thrombasthenia 2. WiskottAldrich syndrome or other combined immune deficiency 3. Chronicgranulomatous disease 4. Severe congenital neutropenia (with resistance to GCSF or chronic requirement of GCSF doses â‰¥10 mcg/kg) 5. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency 6. ShwachmanDiamond syndrome 7. DiamondBlackfan anemia ((transfusion dependent, including steroid failure or inability to wean steroids) 8. Thalassemia major 9. Fanconi anemia 10. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (inherited or acquired refractory to therapy or with recurrent episodes of hyperinflammation) 11. Dyskeratosiscongenita 12. Hurler Syndrome 13. ChediakHigashi syndrome 14. Acquired (immune; noninherited, noncongenital) severe aplastic anemia 15. Other inherited or congenital marrow failure syndromes complicated by severe aplastic anemia 16. Other inherited or congenital red blood cell disorders requiring monthly chronic transfusion therapy. 17. Congenital platelet disorders requiring frequent platelet transfusions (patient must have received at least 10 transfusions in the last 3 years). 18. Other inherited or congenital granulocyte disorders resulting in at least three inpatient hospitalizations in the past three years for infection. 19. SCD (Hgb SS or SBeta 0 thalassemia) will be eligible between ages 3 and 9.99 and with severe disease. Patients who meet one of the following criteria will qualify as having severe SCD: (i) Previous clinical stroke, as evidenced by a neurological deficit lasting longer than 24 hours, which is accompanied by radiographic evidence of ischemic brain injury and cerebral vasculopathy. (ii) Asymptomatic cerebrovascular disease, as evidenced by one the following: 1. Progressive silent cerebral infarction, as evidenced by serial MRI scans that demonstrate the development of a succession of lesions (at least two temporally discreet lesions, each measuring at least 3 mm in greatest dimension on the most recent scan) or the enlargement of a single lesion, initially measuring at least 3 mm). Lesions must be visible on T2weighted MRI sequences. 2. Cerebral arteriopathy, as evidenced by abnormal TCD testing (confirmed elevated velocities in any single vessel of TAMMV &gt; 200 cm/sec for nonimaging TCD) or by significant vasculopathy on MRA (greater than 50% stenosis of &gt; 2 arterial segments or complete occlusion of any single arterial segment). (iii) Frequent (greater than or equal to 3 per year for preceding 2 years) painful vasoocclusive episodes (defined as episode lasting greater than or equal to 4 hours and requiring hospitalization or outpatient treatment with parenteral opioids). If patient is on hydroxurea and its use has been associated with a decrease in the frequency of episodes, the frequency should be gauged from the 2 years prior to the start of this drug. (iv) Recurrent (greater than or equal to 3 in lifetime) acute chest syndrome events which have necessitated erythtocyte transfusion therapy. (v) Any combination of greater than or equal to 3 acute chest syndrome episodes and vasoocclusive pain episodes (defined as above) yearly for 3 years. If patient is on hydroxurea and its use has been associated with a decrease in the frequency of episodes, the frequency should be gauged from the 3 years prior to the start of this drug.

Mismatches at the DRB1 locus may be at an antigen or allele level. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched related donor. Severe combined immune deficiency. Bridging (portal to portal) fibrosis or cirrhosis of the liver. Pulmonary: DLCO (corrected for hemoglobin), FEV1 or FVC &lt; 40% of predicted. In child unable to perform pulmonary function testing, a chronic need for supplemental oxygen will serve as the exclusionary criterion.
