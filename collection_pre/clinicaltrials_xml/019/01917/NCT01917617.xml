	<brief_title>Oral Rehydration Therapy for Short Hydration in Chemotherapy With CDDP Plus GEM for Biliary Tract Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A large amount of fluid infusion is required to load for the prevention of renal dysfunction by Cisplatin in combination of GC therapy. There is a problem infusion time is take a long time for this. In many institutions in Japan, GC therapy is performed over 3 hours or more, longer than original method in the ABC-002 trial. Oral rehydration therapy is a therapy that performs prevention or treatment of dehydration by the ingestion of oral rehydration solution, which is adjusted the concentration of the electrolyte and glucose to absorb good efficiency from the gastrointestinal tract. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is a therapy that performs prevention or treatment of dehydration by the ingestion of oral rehydration solution, which is adjusted the concentration of the electrolyte and glucose to absorb good efficiency from the gastrointestinal tract. Many reports suggest ORT may substitute for infusion therapy. Herein, the investigators planned the study to examine the safety of replacing the fluid infusion by oral rehydration expecting to shorten the time to drip.</detailed_description>
