	<brief_summary>Dengue virus serological reagent, included antigen and antiserum, is a serum test for identification of serum antibodies to dengue virus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Specimens Testing Program of Dengue Antigen Detection Reagents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The developed assay helps to diagnose diseases caused by this virus and to provide information on disease epidemiology. This virus is mainly transmitted by mosquito bites to people and will make flu-like symptoms, including fever, fatigue, cough and headache, which can cause severe hemorrhagic dengue.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A total of 95 cases and 100 controls (suspected cases(&gt;50 %) and normal subjects) are expected to enroll. 1. Case group: adults having a medical visit or admission due to dengue / dengue hemorrhagic fever / dengue shock syndrome, and medical care of by (defined by CDC). Any of the following positive test results for the case of 100 adults. 1. clinical specimens (blood) isolated and identified dengue virus. 2. clinical specimens positive for molecular detection of nucleic acids. 3. serological antigen (referring to nonstructural proteins of dengue virus nonstructural protein 1, NS1) testing positive (based on the test of BioRad DENGUE NS1 Ag STRIP). 4. paired serum (restored period and acute phase), the dengue virus specific immunoglobulin M or immunoglobulin G antibodies or negative or â‰§ 4 times increase. 2. Suspected cases: adults having medical visits or admissions due to infectious disease, but their NS1 (based on the test of BioRad DENGUE NS1 Ag STRIP), immunoglobulin G,immunoglobulin M, real timePolymerase chain reaction testing were negative. 3. Control group: adults without having medical visits or admissions due to Fever. nonadult case</criteria>
