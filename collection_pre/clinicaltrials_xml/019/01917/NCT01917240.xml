	<brief_summary>To evaluate the impact of two FDA approved culture media on potential of human embryos resulting from IVF (sequential &amp; monophasic media). Half of each patient's embryos will be randomly assigned to grow in monophasic media &amp; the other half in sequential media. All embryos will undergo Comprehensive Chromosome Screening (CCS) &amp; the best euploid embryo from each group will be transferred resulting in a double embryo transfer (DET). If there are only euploid embryos from one group, patient will have single embryo transfer (SET)(fresh or frozen).</brief_summary>
