	<brief_summary>The initial aim of this study will be to assess current methods of heart failure (HF) patient education in terms of patient satisfaction, level of preparedness for home, and care provider satisfaction. The second aim will be to design and create a "living with HF at home" simulation session. The third aim will test the hypothesis that hospitalized HF patients who receive education in a simulation room in addition to usual HF education will have improved qualitative and quantitative outcomes as compared to those who do not receive the additional education support.</brief_summary>
