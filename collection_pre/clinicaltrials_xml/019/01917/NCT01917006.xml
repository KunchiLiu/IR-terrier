	<brief_title>A Safety and Efficacy Study of BOTOX® in Premature Ejaculation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to assess a range of doses of BOTOX for the treatment of male patients with PE. Patients will attend a minimum of 6 or 7 clinic visits and also have 1 or 2 telephone visits. Partners will need to attend a clinic visit during the screening period to provide informed consent and to receive training on measurement and recording of the IELT. Patients will be enrolled in cohorts. Within the first 5 cohorts, 8 patients are to receive BOTOX and 2 patients to receive placebo. For cohort 6, 12 patients will receive BOTOX and 12 patients will receive placebo. Patients will receive a single treatment of study medication delivered bilaterally to the bulbospongiosus muscle. The initial BOTOX total dose in this dose escalation study will be 5 U and the maximum BOTOX total dose will be 100 U. Upon request and if eligible, patients in cohort 6, will have the option to receive a second injection of BOTOX (open label).</detailed_description>
