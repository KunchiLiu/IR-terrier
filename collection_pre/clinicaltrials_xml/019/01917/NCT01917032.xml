	<brief_summary>Objective: To acquire the local scientific evidence, to evaluate the effects of micronutrient Sprinkles™ powder, both the nutritional status and haematological values in the vulnerable preschool population, to corroborate the reported benefits of the experiences in other countries. Question: Will it improve the nutritional status and hematological levels after the home fortification with Sprinkles in children of two child care centres in the city of Medellin, in 2013? Hypothesis: At the end of intervention, hematologic levels and anthropometric indicators will be better in the intervention group with Sprinkles, compared with the placebo group. Design: Randomized clinical trial, triple-blind and placebo-controlled. Participants: Two groups of 50 children each, aged between 5 and 59 months, not anemic or with severe malnourished, full-time assistants to two children's centres that have the same alimentation menu. Intervention: The daily diet will be supplemented with sprinkles in one of the children's centres and will be compared anthropometric and hematological values before and after with a group receiving the same diet with placebo. Outcome measures: Nutritional status (anthropometric measures) and haematological values (hemoglobin, ferritin, transferrin and folate).</brief_summary>
