	<brief_summary>Various medications used in anesthesia have been implicated in the prolongation of QT interval. Recently, there has been an increase in the use of dexmedetomidine in patients presenting for surgeries given its beneficial sedative, anxiolytic, and analgesic properties. It has several desirable properties including minimal respiratory side effects as well as the ability to decrease intraoperative and postoperative analgesic requirements. In many of the patients who present for routine surgical procedures, dexmedetomidine is a common component of their anesthetic care. This is a study to assess the effects of dexmedetomidine on the QT interval in children presenting for surgery.</brief_summary>
