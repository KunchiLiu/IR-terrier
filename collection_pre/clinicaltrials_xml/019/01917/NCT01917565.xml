	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that when used by experienced anesthesiologists, Airtraq laryngoscope will increase the first-attempt success rate with shorter intubation times and more stable hemodynamic parameters.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use of Airtraq Laryngoscope Versus Macintosh Laryngoscope and Fiberoptic Bronchoscope by Experienced Anesthesiologists</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The special design of the Airtraq allows the direct exposure of the glottic opening without the necessity of optimal alignment of the oral, pharyngeal and laryngeal axes. The results of the meta-analysis comparing the Airtraq with the conventional Macintosh laryngoscope concluded that the use of Airtraq results in a rapid and accurate intubation. The main advantages of the fiberoptic bronchoscope are minimal airway trauma and minimal deterioration of the hemodynamic parameters. The purpose of this study is to compare the hemodynamic parameters, intubation times, complications during and after intubation and postoperative sore throat scores of the patients having normal airway anatomy, intubated with Airtraq, Macintosh laryngoscope or fiberoptic bronchoscope, by experienced anesthesiologists.</detailed_description>
