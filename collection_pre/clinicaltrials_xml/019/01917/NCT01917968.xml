	<brief_title>Multi-center Study of Uphold LITE Versus Native Tissue for the Treatment of Women With Anterior/Apical Pelvic Organ Prolapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to evaluate clinical effectiveness of transvaginal repair with mesh (Uphold LITE) against traditional native tissue repair in women surgically treated for anterior and/or apical pelvic organ prolapse. Secondary objectives are to evaluate Uphold LITE-related complications and subject reported outcomes. The primary endpoint of the study is to achieve superiority of transvaginal repair with mesh (Uphold LITE) over native tissue repair at 36 months as compared to baseline. Success will be based on a composite of objective and subjective measures. Additionally, a co-primary endpoint of the study is to achieve non-inferiority of transvaginal repair with mesh (Uphold LITE) to native tissue repair for safety by comparing rates of serious device or serious procedure related complications between baseline and the 36 month time point. The secondary endpoints of the study include assessments of complications and subject reported outcomes.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subject is female 2. Subject is ≥18 years of age 3. Subject has pelvic organ prolapse with the leading edge at or beyond the hymen. At or beyond the hymen is defined as POPQ scores of Ba≥0 or (for prolapse of the anterior compartment alone) C≥0 (for prolapse of the apical compartment alone) or C≥1/2 TVL and Ba≥0 (for a multicompartment prolapse that includes the anterior and apical compartments). 4. Subject reports of a bothersome bulge they can see or feel per PFDI20, question 3 response of 2 or higher (i.e. responses of "somewhat", "moderately" or "quite a bit") 5. Subject or subject's legally authorized representative must be willing to provide written informed consent 6. Subject is willing and able to comply with the followup regimen 1. Subject has an active or chronic systemic infection including any gynecologic infection, untreated urinary tract infection (UTI) or tissue necrosis 2. Subject has history of pelvic organ cancer (e.g. uterine, ovarian, bladder, colorectal or cervical) 3. Subject has had prior or is currently undergoing radiation, laser therapy, or chemotherapy in the pelvic area 4. Subject has taken systemic steroids (within the last month) or immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatment (within the last 3 months) 5. Subject has systemic connective tissue disease (e.g. scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Marfans syndrome, Ehlers Danlos collagenosis, polymyositis polymyalgia rheumatica) 6. Subject has a known neurologic or medical condition affecting bladder function (e.g. multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, or stroke with residual neurologic deficit) 7. Subject is seeking obliterative vaginal surgery as treatment for pelvic organ prolapse (colpocleisis) 8. Subject has a previous prolapse repair with mesh in the target compartment 9. Subject is planning to undergo a concomitant repair with use of mesh in the nontarget compartment 10. Subject is not able to conform to the modified dorsal lithotomy position 11. Subject has chronic systemic pain that includes the pelvic area or chronic focal pain that includes the pelvis 12. Subject has uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM) 13. Subject is currently participating in or plans to participate in another device or drug study during this study 14. Subject has a known hypersensitivity to polypropylene mesh 15. Subject is pregnant or intends to become pregnant during the study</criteria>
