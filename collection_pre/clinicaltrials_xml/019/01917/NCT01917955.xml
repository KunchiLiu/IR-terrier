	<brief_summary>The purpose of this prospective single-center trial is to compare the safety and diagnostic value of contrast medium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and transesophageal echocardiography in patients with acute ischemic stroke.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiac MRI in Ischemic Stroke Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary safety objective: Contrast medium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is safe in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Primary outcome: The diagnostic value of contrast medium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is comparable to transesophageal echocardiography in patients with acute ischemic stroke.</detailed_description>
