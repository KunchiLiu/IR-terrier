	<brief_title>VEGF Signaling Promotes Cell Growth and Metastasis in Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma in a VEGF Receptor Mediated Pathway</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several studies have documented the elevated expression of VEGF and its receptors in ICC cell lines and tumor tissues. Another study observed that the elevation of VEGF promotes the growth. Clinical analyses have discovered the high expression of VEGF is correlated with tumor progression, vascular invasion, distal metastasis and poor prognosis. However, few studies have been conducted to investigate the VEGF signaling in ICC cells and its possible mechanism in regulating ICC growth.Therefore,we try to clarify the mechanism of VEGF signal in ICC growth,proliferation and apoptosis.</detailed_description>
