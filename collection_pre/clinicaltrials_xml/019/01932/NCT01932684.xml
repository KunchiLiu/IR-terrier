Methods: This is a study of cross-over. The study investigated 14 patients with mild to moderate PD. The subjects performed the technique Breath-Stacking, incentive spirometry volume and participated in a phase control according to randomization. The volunteers were evaluated by opto-electronic plethysmography in four stages: before, immediately after fifteen and thirty minutes after the completion of the techniques.
