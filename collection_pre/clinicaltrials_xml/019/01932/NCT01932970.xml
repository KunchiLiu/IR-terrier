	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Subject is 18 years of age or older at the time of informed consent. Subject must be receiving maintenance hemodialysis 3 times weekly for at least 8 weeks. Subject must have SHPT as defined by having a mean of 3 consecutive central laboratory screening predialysis serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) values ≥ 200 pg/mL, with measurements obtained from 3 different calendar weeks in the 4week screening period while receiving cinacalcet. Subject must have a mean of 3 consecutive central laboratory screening predialysis serum corrected calcium (cCa) values ≥ 7.5 mg/dL, with measurements obtained from 3 different calendar weeks in the 4week screening period while receiving cinacalcet. Subject must be on a stable dose of cinacalcet before screening (defined as no dose change within the 4 weeks prior to screening). Other Inclusion Criteria may apply. Exclusion Criteria Currently receiving treatment in another investigational device or drug study, or less than 30 days since ending treatment on another investigational device or drug study(s). Subject has received AMG 416 in a prior clinical trial of AMG 416 (also known as KAI4169). Subject has known sensitivity to any of the products or components of AMG 416 to be administered during dosing. Subject is unwilling to use effective contraception during the study, and for women, up to a period of up to 3 months after the last dose of AMG 416. Subject is pregnant or nursing. Anticipated or scheduled parathyroidectomy during the study period. Subject has received a parathyroidectomy within 6 months prior to dosing. Other Exclusion Criteria may apply.</criteria>
