	<brief_summary>Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a major public health problem that has no proven effective treatment. This study assessed the effects of acute nitrite administration on resting and exercise hemodynamics in patients with HFpEF.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute Effects of Inorganic Nitrite on Cardiovascular Hemodynamics in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects were studied on their long-term medications in the post-absorptive state and supine position. Right heart catheterization was performed with simultaneous expired gas analysis at rest and during supine exercise at a 20 Watts workload for 5 minutes. After the first exercise phase (before any drug administration) and after return to steady-state baseline hemodynamic values, subjects were randomized. Study drug or placebo was infused for 5 minutes. After a 10 minute observation period, hemodynamic measurements were repeated at rest, followed by repeat supine exercise at a 20 Watts workload for 5 minutes, identical to the study's first phase. Arterial and venous blood samples and hemodynamic and expired gas data were acquired during each stage of the protocol.</detailed_description>
