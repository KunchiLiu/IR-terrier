	<brief_summary>Gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma is commonly treated with chemotherapy before and after surgery. The chemotherapy regimen used in our institution, called DCF (docetaxel,cisplatic, 5-fluorouracil) is active, resulting in tumor reduction and dysphagia relief. however, it is toxic, causing approximately half of patients severe inflammation of the mucosa (lining) of the mouth and gut. This results, in turn, in mouth sores, vomiting and diarrhea. Similar regimen called FLOT (5-FU, oxaliplatin,docetaxel) appears to be at least equally active, but less toxic. Our ultimate plan is to perform a randomized comparison of DCF and FLOT. Before embarking upon this, we are conducting this pilot trial in 10 subjects with the FLOT regimen. If less than 5 patients develop severe mouth sores, vomiting or diarrhea, plans will be made to proceed with the next trial, a randomized comparison of DCF and FLOT</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the stomach, gastroesophageal junction (GEJ), or lower third of the esophagus. The tumor must be deemed by the team to be potentially resectable. This includes imaging studies (detailed below) to clinically stage the tumor and rule out the presence of metastatic disease, and includes a preoperative laparoscopic evaluation. Stage IB (T1N1 only), II, IIIA, IIIB, and IV (T4N1 only) Life expectancy greater than 3 months ECOG performance status of 02 (i.e. restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light house work, office work). Adequate hematologic reserve: Platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000 microlitre, WBC greater than or equal to 2000 microlitre, Creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 30 ml/min, AST &amp; ALT less than or equal to 2 ULN, Alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to 2.5 ULN, bilirubin less than or equal ULN Prior systemic therapy for gastric cancer Prior docetaxelcontaining chemotherapy Preexisting medical conditions precluding treatment, including any contraindication for major surgery Pregnancy or lactating mothers. Women of childbearing age must use contraception during and for 3 months following treatment Inability to give informed consent Inability to maintain nutrition by oral consumption of food alone must have additional enteral feeding. Macroscopic disease noted at laparoscopy ECOG peformance status of 3 or higher Unwillingness to undergo investigations and/or treatment as outlined on the study</criteria>
