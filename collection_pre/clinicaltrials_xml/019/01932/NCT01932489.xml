	<brief_summary>Prior to the use of genomic tests for patient inclusion in clinical trials, it is essential for the Jules Bordet Institute (JBI) to pilot the logistical and technical aspects by examining the feasibility and turnaround time of performing and obtaining data from a few key molecular assays. Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer or melanoma will be enrolled. Biopsie from metastatic lesions will be performed. A targeted cancer gene screen assay will be performed using DNA sequencing. Results will be discussed during a molecular screening tumor board.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Written informed consent for all study procedures according to local regulatory requirements prior to enrollment into the study. Age â‰¥ 18 years. Histologically proven metastatic or locally recurrent CRC, NSCLC or melanoma. Tumor tissue (FFPE and frozen) from recurrent or metastatic lesions available for research purposes. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status &gt;2. The biopsy procedure is estimated to be too risky for the patient. Any antiVEGF or antiVEGFR treatment administered less than 3 weeks before new biopsy procedure. No appropriate washout period for patients on anticoagulation therapy.</criteria>
