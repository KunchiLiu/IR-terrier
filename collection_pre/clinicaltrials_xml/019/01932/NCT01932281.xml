	<detailed_description>This is a double blind, crossover, pilot study that will examine the effect of SierraSil supplementation on the determinants of human performance. Anaerobic capacity, muscle fatigue, the severity of delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and markers of inflammation will be measured before and after 3 weeks of supplementation with SierraSil or placebo. There will be a 3 week washout period prior to the crossover to ensure SierraSil supplementation has no residual effect.</detailed_description>
