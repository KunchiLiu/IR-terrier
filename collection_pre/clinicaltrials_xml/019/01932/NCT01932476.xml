	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the immune response causing celiac disease is related to the autoimmune response causing type-1 diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gluten Immunity and Islet Autoimmunity in Type-1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants meeting eligibility criteria will have blood collected before and after a three-day oral gluten challenge. This blood will be tested for biomarkers associated with islet autoimmunity and gluten-specific cellular immunity.</detailed_description>
