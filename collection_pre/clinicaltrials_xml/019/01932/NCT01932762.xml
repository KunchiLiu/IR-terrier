	<brief_summary>This is a multi-site, open-label trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of 100 mg of grazoprevir (MK-5172) used in combination with or without 50 mg of elbasvir (MK-8742) and/or ribavirin (RBV) in treating non-cirrhotic treatment-naïve participants with chronic genotype (GT) 2, 4, 5, and 6 hepatitis C infection. In Part A there is no randomization or stratification; all GT2 participants will be assigned to arm A1. In Part B, all GT2 participants will be assigned to Arm B1 and all participants with GT4, GT5 and GT6 will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either Arm 3 or Arm 4 with stratification by genotype.</brief_summary>
