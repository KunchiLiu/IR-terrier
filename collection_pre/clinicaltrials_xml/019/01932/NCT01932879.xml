	<brief_summary>Studies in animals have suggested that berry preparations or anthocyanin-rich berry extracts can reduce body fatness. Previous studies with tea catechins, which belong to the flavonoid class of chemicals as do anthocyanins, suggest that these compounds can alter fat oxidation, and this may be the mechanism by which body fatness is influenced by anthocyanin intake. Well-controlled studies in humans are lacking.</brief_summary>
