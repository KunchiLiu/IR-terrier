The present study was carried out to compare the effects of white rice, brown rice, and black rice on postprandial glucose and lipid profiles in healthy human subjects, using a white bread as a positive control.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of White Rice, Brown Rice, and Black Rice on Postprandial Glucose and Lipid Profiles in Healthy Korean Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After a 12-hour fast, oral glucose and meal tolerance was measured with blood samples drawn at times 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes and TG was at time 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 hours. 1. Serum levels of glucose, insulin, and TG were analyzed by biochemical autoanalyzer. The area under the curve (AUC) changes in blood glucose, TG were computed by the trapezoidal method. 2. Glycemic index(GI): the area under the glucose response curve after consumption of a test food divided by the area under the curve after consumption of a control food containing the same amount of carbohydrate and calculated using 50 g glucose as the reference.</detailed_description>
