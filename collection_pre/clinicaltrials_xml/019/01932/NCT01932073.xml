	<brief_summary>Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) is a form of phototherapy which involves the application of light to injuries and lesions to promote tissue regeneration. It is a noninvasive treatment modality based on the photochemical effect of light on tissues, which modulates various metabolic processes. LLLT has been used for a wide range of conditions, in particular in dermatology, to promote wound healing, reduce inflammation and oedema, and relieve pain. In this study, we intend to assess the efficacy of LLLT to manage radiotherapy-induced skin reactions (or radiation dermatitis), a very common and distressing side effect of cancer treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of noninvasive (Stage 0) or invasive (Stages 1, 2 or 3A) breast adenocarcinoma Treatment with primary breastsparing surgery (lumpectomy) and/ or neoadjuvant (preoperative) or adjuvant (postoperative) chemotherapy or hormonal treatment Scheduled for postoperative radiotherapy with standard technique (isocentric) and fractionation regime (i.e., 25 daily fractions to the whole breast followed by a boost of 8 fractions to the tumor bed, 2 Gy per fraction, five times per week) Provide signed informed consent Previous irradiation to the same breast Metastatic disease Mastectomy surgery Concurrent chemoradiotherapy Required use of bolus material to deliver radiation therapy (i.e., material placed on the tobeirradiated zone to modulate the delivered dose in order to ensure an optimal distribution of the radiation dose)</criteria>
