	<brief_summary>The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of caspofungin as compared with amphotericin B deoxycholate in the treatment of invasive candidiasis in neonates and infants. The primary hypothesis to be tested in the study is that caspofungin will be superior to amphotericin B deoxycholate with regard to the proportion of participants with fungal-free survival at the 2-week posttherapy follow-up visit.</brief_summary>
