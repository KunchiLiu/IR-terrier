	<brief_summary>This research intends to evaluate if inspiratory muscle training (IMT) reduces inspiratory muscle metaboreflex through the decrease of calf vascular resistance and increase of calf blood flow in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IMT in Ventilatory Muscle Metaboreflex in COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be selected from the Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre's COPD ambulatory, by convenience. Afterwards, patients will be submitted to pulmonary function test (spirometry) and cardiopulmonary exercise tests (incremental and submaximal), maximal inspiratory pressure evaluation and induction of the inspiratory muscle metaboreflex through venous occlusion plethysmography. Disease specific health related quality of life questionnaire (Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire) and daily life dyspnea questionnaire (Baseline Dyspnea Index and Transitional Dyspnea Index) will be administered at the first and last visit of each subject. Patients will undergo inspiratory muscle training for 30 minutes per day, 7 times a week, for 8 weeks, with Inspiratory Muscle Trainer device (PowerBreath Inc.). There will be a weekly follow up at the institution's Clinical Research Center, where maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax) and inspiratory training techniques will be reevaluated. After this period, tests of pulmonary function, questionnaires exercise tolerance and induction of the inspiratory muscle metaboreflex will be reevaluated.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Selection of subjects will be made through the Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre Pneumology Service's COPD ambulatory. The inclusion criteria consist of patients with COPD with functional confirmation through spirometry as by previously defined criteria. Those selected must be classified as GOLD IIIV, with moderate to severe expiratory flow obstruction. Patients will be considered ineligible for this study if they develop COPD exacerbation 8 weeks prior to recruitment if systemic corticosteroids are utilized (in the last three months) if there is history of acute myocardial infarction (in the last three months) if there is presence of neuromuscular disease history of cardiovascular disease or active smoking (in the last 6 months) clinical history of peripheral vascular disease and if age is equal or superior to 85 years</criteria>
