	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with alogliptin (Nesina) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who responded inadequately to diet therapy and exercise therapy alone, or a combination of diet therapy, exercise therapy, and α-glucosidase inhibitor. In addition, examining the safety and efficacy of alogliptin in patients with renal impairment, information on the appropriate dosage of alogliptin according to the severity of impaired renal function should be collected.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A special drug use surveillance is planned to examine the safety and efficacy of long-term use of alogliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus under the daily clinical use conditions. Participants of this surveillance will be patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who failed to respond adequately to diet therapy and exercise therapy alone or to a combination of diet therapy, exercise therapy, and α-glucosidase inhibitor. The planned sample size is 3,000 subjects. The usual adult dosage for oral use is 1 alogliptin tablet (25 mg) once daily.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have not adequately responded to any one of the following therapies: 1. Diet therapy and exercise therapy alone 2. In addition to diet therapy and exercise therapy, use of αglucosidase inhibitor Patients contraindicated for Nesina 1. Patients with severe ketosis, diabetic coma or precoma, or type 1 diabetes mellitus (these patients require prompt adjustment of hyperglycemia by fluid infusion and insulin, and hence use of Nesina is not appropriate.) 2. Patients with severe infection, pre or postoperative patients, or patients with serious traumatic injury (blood glucose control by insulin injection is desirable for these patients, and hence use of Nesina is not appropriate.) 3. Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any ingredient of Nesina</criteria>
