	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to estimate the difference in the efficacy between a 16-week treatment regimen of boceprevir (BOC) in combination with peg-intron alpha 2b (P) plus ribavirin (R) (BOC + PR) and a 28-week treatment regimen of BOC + PR in previously untreated participants with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 1 in Asia who achieve undetectable hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA).</brief_summary>
