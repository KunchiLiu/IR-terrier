	<brief_summary>The posterior subthalamic area holds promise as a target region for deep brain stimulation in tremor and Parkinson's disease. Using the magnetic resonance-directed implantable guide tube surgical technique, subregions of the posterior subthalamic area can be individually targetted on a single electrode lead trajectory. The hypothesis is that the caudal zona incerta may provide improved control of movement disorder symptoms than the more commonly stimulated dorsal zona incerta.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomised Crossover Trial of Deep Brain Stimulation of Differential Posterior Subthalamic Area Regions in Parkinson's Disease and Tremor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomisation between two treatment locations each programmed up to 3 milliamps in amplitude for 3 months: (1) caudal zona incerta and (2) dorsal zona incerta. This 6-month-long randomised phase is followed by 6 months of unblinded individualised empirically optimised settings programmed by a neurologist. Each of the three treatment periods ends with a full clinical, functional and quality of life assessment.</detailed_description>
