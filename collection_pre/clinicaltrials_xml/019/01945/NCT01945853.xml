	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study to identify the degree of grey and white matter involvement in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) utilizing non-invasive techniques. The imaging to be utilized will be the 7 Tesla (7T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. These results will be correlated to the ALS Functional Rating Scale - Revised (ALSFRS-R) score to assess if any changes in MRI can be predictive in the disability of the ALS patients at baseline and at 6 month intervals. The participants will be asked to return every 6 months for a neurological examination, ALSFRS-R assessment, measurement of the vital capacity and MRI as outlined above to monitor progression of the disease.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Males and Females who are 18 80 years old. The participants will meet the standard diagnostic criteria for possible or probable ALS (based on El Escorial criteria). They will have been diagnosed by a Johns Hopkins Neurologist. Healthy controls will be recruited by their interest in assisting the ALS population. Forced vital capacity less than 60 % of predicted value. Documented orthopnea on ALSFRSR or otherwise unable to lie flat in an MRI scanner for the duration of the study. Presence of pacemakers, aneurysm clips, shrapnel or otherwise disallowed implanted metallic devices for obtaining an MRI scan. Pregnant or lactating females Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 60 History of: encephalitis, extensive white matter disease, intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral palsy, allergy to dye and/or IV drug abuse.</criteria>
