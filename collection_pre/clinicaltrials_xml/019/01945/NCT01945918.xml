	<brief_title>Comparing Strategies for Translating Self-management Support Into Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aims of the proposed study are: - Primary Specific Aims 1. To conduct a cluster randomized trial to examine the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance (RE-AIM) of Connection to Health (CTH) for patients with type 2 diabetes in primary care practice settings. Primary effectiveness outcomes will include hemoglobin A1c, BMI, blood pressure and LDL cholesterol. 2. To determine the incremental benefit, using the RE-AIM framework, of brief targeted practice coaching on the implementation of CTH in diverse primary care practices. - Secondary Specific Aims 1. To identify key practice characteristics (e.g., practice size, organization, setting, and level of experience with practice redesign efforts) that impact CTH RE-AIM. These results will inform dissemination of the CTH intervention. 2. To determine the relative costs associated with implementing CTH and practice coaching to further inform dissemination efforts.</detailed_description>
