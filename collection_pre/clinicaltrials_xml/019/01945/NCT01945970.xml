	<brief_summary>Epidemiological studies indicate that regular consumption of three cups of black tea per day reduces the risk of stroke or myocardial infarction. In a number of previous nutrition intervention studies tea has been shown to improve vascular function as assessed by Flow Mediated Dilation (FMD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Black Tea on Vascular Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study tests a specific Black tea extract against a placebo in population that has previously show to be sensitive to the effect of black tea on Flow Mediated dilation. A tea extract that has previously been shown to improve FMD is included as the positive control.</detailed_description>
