	<brief_summary>In a clinical trial of 19 patients, 44 single-rooted teeth will be randomly assigned to one of four groups for: 1) no treatment, 2) manual root planing with curettes; 3) root planing with piezoelectric ultrasonic scraper [PU]; or 4) root planing with vertically oscillating ultrasonic device [VOU]. Post-treatment, the teeth will be extracted and their topography analyzed in 124 observations with white light confocal microscopy, measuring the roughness parameters Rp, Rv, Rt, Ra, Rq, Rku, and Rsk.</brief_summary>
