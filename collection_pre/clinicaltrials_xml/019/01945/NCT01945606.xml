	<brief_summary>This is a study to investigate the safety and tolerability of the partial A1 agonist BAY1067197 in patients with chronic heart failure. BAY1067197 will be applied as a single dose of 30 mg in addition to standard therapy including a beta-blocker. The aim of the study is to assess if a single oral dose of 30 mg BAY1067197 is well tolerated when given on top of standard therapy for heart failure, particularly ß-blocker treatment.</brief_summary>
