	<brief_title>Closed Loop Insulin Pump Therapy After Islet Auto-Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES AND HYPOTHESES The main objective of this study is to determine if a closed loop insulin system can successfully achieve tighter blood sugar control than the current multiple daily injection regimen. The investigators hypothesize that the average blood glucose will be lower in the closed loop group than the control group, there will be less glucose variability in the closed loop group than the control group, and there will be less total time spent in hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia in the closed loop group than in the control group. The investigators also will investigate insulin requirements and islet function in the first 6 months post-transplant in the closed loop group The investigators hypothesize that the insulin requirements will be lower and the C-peptide levels higher in the closed loop group than in the control group.</detailed_description>
