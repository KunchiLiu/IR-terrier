	<brief_summary>1. Study objective To evaluate the effect of robotic-assisted gait training combined with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) as compared to that of robotic-assisted gait training on gait function of chronic stroke patients 2. Subjects chronic stroke patients with gait impairment 3. Methods - Group 1: Robotic-assisted gait training with anodal tDCS (45 min) - Group 2: Robotic-assisted gait training with sham tDCS (45 min) - Duration of treatment: 2 weeks, 5 times a week - Evaluation: Baseline, 1 day after the treatment, 4 weeks after the treatment</brief_summary>
