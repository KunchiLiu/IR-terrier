	<brief_title>The Value of Short-term Pain Relief for the Prediction of Long-term Outcome After Cervical or Lumbar Nerve Root Infiltration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective, observational study examines the response to routine infiltration therapy in patients suffering from disc herniations of the spine. Using health-related quality of life questionnaires (SF-12 and Neck Pain and Disability Scale and Oswestry Disability Index) and the visual analogue scale the patients will be categorized into ultra-early-, early-, mid-term-, late-responders and non-responders. A two year follow-up of up to 250 patients is planned. With the anonymized participation of this study no patient will experience a change in his treatment plan. Valuable therapeutic management considerations might be drawn from the published results of this study for future patients.</detailed_description>
