	<brief_summary>Background: There is scarce evidence regarding the necessity of antibiotic prophylaxis in manual revision of the uterus after labor in cases of residual placenta. Methods: a randomized control trial in which parturients for which the placenta was not separated or there is a suspected residual placenta will be divided randomly to two groups: (1) Revision of uterus or Manual lysis without antibiotic prophylaxis; (2) Revision of uterus or Manual lysis with antibiotic prophylaxis as following: 24 hours coverage with Ampicillin 2 grams*4, Gentamycin 240 mg*1, Clindamycin 600 mg*3. In cases of allergy to Penicillin the antibiotic regimen will be: Gentamycin 240 mg*1, Clindamycin 600 mg*3. Outcomes: Puerperal fever, endometritis, length of hospitalization after labor, recurrent hospitalization in the first 2 weeks after discharge.</brief_summary>
