	<brief_summary>In current clinical practice, an acceptable standard treatment for locally advanced prostate cancer is radiation therapy in combination with hormone therapy (called Treatment B or Group B in this study). However, despite our best treatments, there is a risk that the prostate cancer may eventually return. As well, the hormonal therapy that is given to treat the prostate cancer is known to cause some harmful effects, with some patients using the hormones gaining weight, developing diabetes, having increased cholesterol levels, having increased blood pressure, and/or heart problems. This study is looking at whether Metformin, a drug that is commonly used to treat diabetes, can prevent patients from developing some of the harmful effects of the hormonal therapy. In treating diabetes, Metformin is known to decrease patients' sugar levels and also prevents patients from gaining weight, decreases their cholesterol levels, decreases the number of heart problems and allows patients to live longer. As a result, the researchers in this study are hopeful that Metformin will also be beneficial for men with prostate cancer on hormonal therapy by preventing them from developing these problems.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention of Metabolic Syndrome and Increased Weight Using Metformin Concurrent to Androgen Deprivation Therapy and Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will examine the role of Metformin as a means to prevent increases in weight as well as the prevalence and severity of metabolic syndrome, with their associated morbidity, amongst men with locally advanced, biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate (PCa) that are planned to receive curative intent therapy with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to the prostate. Males of any age with biopsy confirmed high tier intermediate risk PCa (Gleason score 7 and PSA 10-20) or high risk PCa (any T3; and/or Gleason Score ≥ 8.0; and/or PSA ≥ 20 ng/mL) ECOG 0 to 1, non-diabetic with no evidence of metastatic PCa will be randomized to either: Group A: Metformin 500mg PO TID x 30-36 months total, with neoadjuvant and adjuvant ADT x18-36 months and EBRT of 46 Gy/23# to pelvic lymph nodes (optional); plus prostate boost to 78 Gy/39# or brachytherapy boost (110-115 Gy) OR Group B: Identical placebo TID x 20-36 months total, with neoadjuvant and adjuvant ADT x18-36 months and EBRT of 46 Gy/23# to pelvic lymph nodes (optional); plus prostate boost to 78 Gy/39# or brachytherapy boost (110-115 Gy) A planned sample size of 104 patients will provide 97% power for a 2-tailed α of 0.05 to detect 4 kg difference in weight at 12 months of follow-up.</detailed_description>

Plasma Glucose level of ≥ 11.1 mmol/L 2 hours following a 75g oral glucose load, if known, within past 28 days; or 4. Random Plasma Glucose level of ≥ 11.1 mmol/L, if known, within past 28 days 4. Patient who currently take metformin or those who have taken metformin within the past 12 months. 5. History of lactic acidosis or conditions that predispose to lactic acidosis including32: a. Impaired Renal Function (eGFR &lt; 30); or b. Liver disease, including alcoholic liver disease, as demonstrated by any of the following parameters: i. AST &gt;1.8 x the upper limit of normal ii. ALT &gt; 1.8 x the upper limit of normal iii. Alkaline Phosphatase &gt; 2x the upper limit of normal iv. Serum total bilirubin ≥ upper limit of normal c. Alcohol abuse (habitual intake of ≥3 alcoholic beverages per day) sufficient to cause hepatic toxicity d. Severe infection 6. Patients with prior bilateral orchiectomy. 7. Patients with prior prostatectomy 8. Patients who are unable to provide informed consent 9. Prior history of malignancy (with exception of adequately treated nonmelanomatous skin cancer or other solid tumors treated curatively with no evidence of disease for ≥ 5 years). 10. Patients on hormonal therapy for more than 3 months prior to registration in the trial.</criteria>
