	<brief_title>Functional Jejunal Interposition Improve Nutritional Status After Total Gastrectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgery is the only curative way for gastric cancer to date. Methods of Resection and reconstruction are closely related to prognosis and nutritional status. Therefore, it is essential to choose. At present, more and more clinical centers tend to choose Roux-en-Y (RY) reconstruction after total gastrectomy, which are prone to a variety of complications, and seriously affects the quality of life, such as malnutrition. There is argument over whether functional jejunal interposition is better than those with Roux-en-Y After total gastrectomy for gastric cancer. How to improve the nutritional status of the patients following total gastrectomy with gastrointestinal reconstruction arouses people's attention. The purpose of this study was to evaluate differences of the nutritional status in patients undergoing functional jejunal interposition and Roux-en-Y after total gastrectomy.</detailed_description>
