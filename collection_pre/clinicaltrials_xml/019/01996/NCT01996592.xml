	<brief_summary>Many factors influence the development of persistent pain after CS (chronic pain) as well as post-partum depression. We are attempting to use trajectory pain methods in an attempt to identify those at risk for the development of persistent pain post delivery using a daily method of contact for the determination of pain scores. Assessments are also done evaluating satisfaction of pain management and maternal/infant bonding opportunities. Physical activity is monitored by subject's wearing a Fitbit with correlation being done with pain scores obtained over 60 days postop with eligible subjects..</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Persistent Pain After CS Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects are contacted on a daily basis after having a cesarean delivery to determine current pain, current pain unpleasantness, worst pain, worst pain unpleasantness, average pain, and average pain unpleaseantness. Preoperatively subjects complete a psycho-social/depressive screening questionnaire. Pain treatments/satisfaction assessments are captured for the first 24 hours. Mother/baby outcomes are also captured. Physical activity and pain scores are also correlated with the subject's wearing of a Fitbit physical activity bracelet with eligible subjects for 60 days post-delivery.</detailed_description>
