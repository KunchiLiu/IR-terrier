	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate baseline uptake on a FDG PET/CT scan in patients with breast cancer that has spread to the bones. A repeat FDG PET/CT scan will be done 4 weeks after the start of new breast cancer hormone treatment and again at 12 weeks after treatment start. The baseline uptake and change in uptake after the repeat scans will be compared to clinical long term outcomes such as time to progression and overall survival. In addition the uptake will be compared to the incidence of skeletal related events that are common occurrences in patients with cancer that has spread to the bones.</brief_summary>
