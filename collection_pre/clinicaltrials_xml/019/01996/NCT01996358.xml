	<brief_summary>Succinylcholine is commonly used for neuromuscular relaxation for short procedures such as rigid bronchoscopy. A more modern alternative is the application aof rocuronium, reversed by sugammadex. The investigators compare the intubating conditions, incidence of postoperative myalgia (POM) as well as patient satisfaction for these two muscle relaxants.</brief_summary>
