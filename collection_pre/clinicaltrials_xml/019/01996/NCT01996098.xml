	<brief_title>Icotinib Following Chemotherapy Versus Chemotherapy as Adjuvant Therapy in Stage IIA-IIIA NSCLC With EGFR Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended for routine use in patients with fully resected stage IIA-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) show great efficacy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutation. Icotinib is a novel EGFR-TKI developed by a group of Chinese scientists. In the phase III ICOGEN trial, icotinib had non-inferiority efficacy to gefitinib with better safety. In phase II trial, chemotherapy followed by 6-month gefitinib as adjuvant therapy can confer longer disease-free survival compared with chemotherapy alone in patients with resected stage IIIA-N2 non-small cell lung cancer harboring EGFR mutations. This study is to studying 6-month or 12-month icotinib following chemotherapy to see how well it works compared to chemotherapy in treating patients with resected stage IIA-IIIA NSCLC harboring EGFR mutation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written informed consent provided. Aged 1875 years. Had completely resected pathological confirmed stage IIAIIIA NSCLC. EGFR activating mutation in exon 19 or 21. Had completed four cycles of platinumbased adjuvant chemotherapy. Able to start the investigational therapy within 4 weeks after the completion of four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. ECOG performance status of 01. Had a life expectancy of 12 weeks or more. Adequate hematological function, adequate liver function and renal function. Able to comply with the required protocol and followup procedures, and able to receive oral medications. Female patients, except those who are postmenopausal or surgically sterilized, must have a negative prestudy serum or urine pregnancy test. Had had previous chemotherapy besides four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or agents directed at the HER axis (e.g. erlotinib, gefitinib, cetuximab, trastuzumab). Had a history another malignancy in the last 5 years with the exception of cured basal cell carcinoma of the skin, cured in situ carcinoma of the uterine cervix and cured epithelial carcinoma of the bladder. Any evidence confirmed tumor recurrence before investigational therapy. Known severe hypersensitivity to icotinib or any of the excipients of this product. Evidence of clinically active interstitial lung disease. Eye inflammation not fully controlled or conditions predisposing the subject to this. Any unstable systemic disease (including active infection, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within the previous 6 months, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication, hepatic, renal, or metabolic disease). Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Pregnancy or breastfeeding women. Ingredients mixed with small cell lung cancer patients. History of neurologic or psychiatric disorders.</criteria>
