	<brief_summary>This study is to determine how cognitive deficits (e.g.,verbal fluency deficit) in patients with Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) relate to specific aspects of brain and function. The study team will assess whether the "brain signatures" associated with specific cognitive deficits differ in older adults with and without AMD.</brief_summary>
