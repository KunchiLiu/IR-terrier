	<brief_summary>Shoulder arthroscopy is one of the most commonly performed orthopaedic procedures and it is often done with the patient in the upright, or beach chair position (BCP). There have been multiple reported complications associated with the BCP, including cerebral ischemia, loss of vision, ophthalmoplegia, stroke, and even death. It has been reported that patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 34 or greater are as much as 12 times more likely to experience cerebral desaturation events (CDEs) compared to non-obese patients. CDEs in the upright position are hypothesized to be partially related to reduced cardiac preload due to venous pooling in the lower extremities which is exaggerated in obese patients. This prospective observational study aims to determine if the use of compression stockings in obese patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy in the BCP can reduce the incidence, frequency, or magnitude of CDEs experienced by the patient. We predict that compression hose will help to reduce cerebral desaturation events.</brief_summary>
