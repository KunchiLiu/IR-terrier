	<brief_summary>We hypothesized that FA in a TV program watched during a meal, would block satiety responses to pre-meal energy consumption and delay satiation in OW/OB but not in NW boys and girls. Food intake was measured at 30 min following a glucose (1 g of glucose/kg body weight) or sweetened noncaloric beverage with or without the presence of food advertisements. Subjective appetite will be measured as well.</brief_summary>
