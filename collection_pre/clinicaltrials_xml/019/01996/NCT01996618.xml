	<brief_summary>Investigate whether ranolazine, a novel anti-anginal agent with antiarrhythmic properties, has a role in the management of symptomatic ventricular premature beats.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Reduce Symptoms of Premature Beats With Ranolazine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective is to compare the effect of ranolazine versus placebo on premature ventricular beats (using 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring) for subjects with symptomatic palpitations. Subject population will consist of seventy-two adult subjects of both sexes who have greater than 1,000 premature ventricular beats during initial monitoring.</detailed_description>
