	<brief_summary>For many years, it is known that asthmatics have more often dysphonia. However, no study has so far analyzed the reality of dysphonia in asthmatic by making phoniatric tests. The etiology of dysphonia in asthmatic remains controversial. Indeed, for a long time, inhaled corticosteroids have been considered as responsible for organic abnormalities of the vocal cords. We hypothesized that women with asthma have more often dysphonia, and that dysphonia is rather functional origin.</brief_summary>
