	<brief_summary>The goal of the pilot study is to determine if a multicenter prospective cohort study of cancer patients with blood clots associated with catheters is feasible. Cancer patients with catheter-related thrombosis treated with one month of anticoagulation will be evaluated for for post-thrombotic syndrome. Laboratory biomarkers will be evaluated as predictors of recurrent thrombosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post-thrombotic Syndrome &amp; Predictors of Recurrence in Catheter-related Thrombosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants may be referred for screening at Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) in two possible mechanisms: participant contact study staff from information on Clinical Trials Science Institute (CTSI) FACT website or referral from treating Hematologist or Oncologist. At MCW, an EPIC report will be generated to identify people with catheter related thrombosis (CRT). The treating provider would then be contacted to determine if referral to the study was appropriate. At University of Minnesota (UMN), referral will be through treating Hematologist or Oncologist. Subjects at Ohio State University (OSU) will be referred from the treating Hematologist or Oncologist. A report generated in Epic will be used to identify people with CRT. The treating provider would then be contacted to determine if referral to the study was appropriate. Participants will be given printed information about the study or verbal explanation using the informational flyer. Verbal consent will be obtained to be screened for participation and contacted by study personnel. Screening will be completed by BloodCenter of Wisconsin (BCW) nurse coordinator. We aim to consent and enroll patients after diagnosis of catheter-related thrombosis and prior to catheter removal. Consent and enrollment (Visit 1) must occur prior to discontinuation of anticoagulation. Enrollment will be limited to patients undergoing anticoagulation with enoxaparin due to decreased recurrent thrombosis rates in cancer patients treated with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) compared to warfarin. Additionally, enoxaparin is the only FDA approved LMWH for the treatment of venous thrombosis. The study will follow patients treated with anticoagulation for one month after catheter removal. Prior to discontinuation of anticoagulation, patients will be contacted via telephone to review study protocol, assess for bleeding, and arrange for Visit 2 in the following 1-2 weeks. Visits 3 and 4 will occur 3 and 6 months after catheter removal, respectively. At visits 3 &amp; 4, Medical history, cancer history, and medications will be updated. At each visit, participants will be assessed for post-thrombotic syndrome using the modified Villalta scale and functional limitation using the DASH questionnaire. At MCW, surveys will be administered by the Translational Research Unit (TRU) staff and physical examination will be completed by BCW nurse coordinator. At UMN, surveys will be administered by CTSI staff and physical examinations will be completed by UMN nurse coordinator. At OSU, surveys will be administered by research coordinators and physical examination will be administered by research nurse coordinator. Laboratory samples will be obtained for MCW participants only.</detailed_description>
