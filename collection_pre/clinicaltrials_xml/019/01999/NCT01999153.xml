	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to Evaluate of the analgesic effect of ropivacaine in topical use at the thin skin graft donor site. For Patient needing a thin skin graft &lt; 320 cm2, randomization will be done in 2 groups, one receiving the standard treatment (20 mL of physiologic serum) during the surgical intervention in topical use to recover an alginate dressing (Algosteril)and the other receive 20 mL of Naropein during the surgical intervention on alginate dressing. The hypothesis of the study is the administration of ropivacaine will decrease the post-operative pain compared to physiologic serum</brief_summary>
