	<brief_summary>Despite the success of anti-angiogenic therapy in multiple treatment settings, a fraction of patients are refractory to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor treatment, while the majority of patients will eventually develop evasive resistance. It is proposed that mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-MET) and its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF or scatter factor) contribute to VEGF inhibitor resistance, such that combining a c-MET inhibitor with a VEGF inhibitor will provide additional clinical activity compared to VEGF inhibitor alone. This hypothesis will be tested using the cMET/ALK inhibitor, crizotinib, in combination with the VEGF inhibitor, axitinib.Since this will be the first study of axitinib given in combination with crizotinib, the study will primarily assess the safety and tolerability of the combination regimen.</brief_summary>
