	<brief_summary>In the proposed research study, we are investigating the feasibility of integrating automated planning tools to MR images acquired using a novel MR-guided linac, for on-line adaptive radiation treatment. However, these on-line automation tools require further technical refinement and clinical validation. The goal of this research proposal is to develop an on-line MR-guided radiation therapy process for adapting breast IMRT treatment. Such an approach will provide early stage breast cancer patients timely access to high-quality adaptive treatments without exposure to additional ionizing radiation.</brief_summary>
