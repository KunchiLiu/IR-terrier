	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to obtain high quality specimens for molecular studies for the identification and characterization of genetic mutations involved in the pathogenesis of familial myeloid malignancies. Specimens obtained will be de-identified, linked to basic clinical data, and sent to Washington University (Division of Oncology, St. Louis, MO) for molecular analyses. Some specimens sent to Washington University may also be used for quality control analyses.</brief_summary>
