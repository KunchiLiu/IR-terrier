	<brief_summary>Volunteers were randomly assigned by gender to follow of two 12 weeks experimental periods: intervention (I) and control (C) in different order (I/C or C/I). Both periods were separated by a 4 weeks wash-out interval during which subjects returned to their usual diet: During the I period, volunteers weekly consumed three 150g/serving Functional Meat (FM) products (cooked Ham and Turkey breast). It was firmly recommended that all other meats and meat derivatives had to be excluded from the diet. During the C period, volunteers consumed identical amounts of meat products that did not include functional ingredients (Control Meat (CM)). Functional meat (FM) products (Functional cooked Ham (FH) and Functional cooked Turkey breast (FT)), were manufactured mixing the meats with the patented formula® (P200402755.2004). The amount of supercritical rosemary extract, deodorized salmon oil and vitamin E used was respectively, 0.02% w/w, 0.6% w/w, and 0.001% w/w. Control meat (CM) products (Control cooked Ham (CH) and Control cooked Turkey (CT), were prepared without addition of the functional ingredients.</brief_summary>
