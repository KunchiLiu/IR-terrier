	<brief_summary>The participants are twelve small or middle-sized companies. Baseline information about the company's practices and employees' physical activity is collected in November 2013 with questionnaires and accelerometers. A team is nominated in each company to develop company's practices in relation to promoting physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior among employees. The teams are supported with materials and meetings and the opportunity to obtain physical activity services from the regional offices of the Finnish Sports Confederation. The development process is carried out in Fall 2013 and the actions to promote physical activity and to reduce sedentary behavior are implemented in the companies during spring and fall 2014. The follow-up evaluation with the same measures as at baseline will be conducted in November 2014 and depending on financing possibly also in November to assess the maintenance of the actions.</brief_summary>
