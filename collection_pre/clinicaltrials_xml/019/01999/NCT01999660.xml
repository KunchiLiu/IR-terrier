	<brief_summary>A treatment with SpaceOAR™ hydrogel does reduce late toxicity Grad 2 and Grad 3 of radiation therapy in prostate cancer patients</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post-marketing Surveillance Regarding Efficacy and Safety of SpaceOAR™</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The degradable SpaceOAR™ hydrogel establishes for the time of radiotherapy a distance between the prostate and the rectum</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patient is suffering from pathologically confirmed T1T2, N0, M0 prostate adenocarcinoma. Patient is intended to receive radiation therapy (3Dcomputerized radiotherapy, intensitymodulated radiotherapy, and/or brachytherapy) and this will be the first prostate or pelvic radiation therapy. Patient is intended to receive SpaceOAR™ Gel therapy. The patient is official patient of the clinical investigator in the study centre. Patient agrees to fully participate in the clinical trial and give informed consent in writing. Anatomic abnormality, physical or pathological condition precluding the implantation. Failure in the wall of the perineum room (with the risk that the hydrogel escapes). History of prostate surgery or local prostate cancer therapy. Rectal injury before implantation of SpaceOAR™ Gel or history of or active inflammatory rectal disease such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. History of or current perirectal or anal disease or surgery such as prolapsed or bleeding haemorrhoids or fistula. Compromised immune system (e.g., HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, auto¬immune disease or immunosuppressive therapy). Platelet count, partial thromboplastin time, or white blood cell count out of normal laboratory range. Contraindication for safe MRI and CT scans. Patient is not able to fully participate in this study including the followup (e.g. for mental or geographical reasons, or patient is intravenous drug user or has strong potential for noncompliance to medical regimes). Patient is mentally unable to understand the nature, aims, or possible consequences of the clinical investigation. Patient has restricted legal capacity. Patient did participate in another clinical investigation during the last 3 months. Patient has revoked the consent.</criteria>
