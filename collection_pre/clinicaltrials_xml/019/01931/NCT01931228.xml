	<brief_summary>Respiratory failure after extubation is a relevant consequence of poor airway clearance due to respiratory muscle weakness and respiratory failure after extubation and reintubation is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. the study will evaluate the contribution of Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation (MI-E) in Preventing Respiratory Failure After Extubation as compared manually assisted coughing</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation in Preventing Post Extubation Respiratory Failure in Patient With Critical Care Neuromyopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Critical Care Neuromyopathy (CCN) occur in 25% of patient in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Respiratory failure after extubation is a relevant consequences of poor airway clearance due to respiratory muscle weakness. Respiratory failure is a major cause for reintubation which increase severity of illness, this is an independent risk factor for nosocomial pneumonia, increased hospital stay and mortality. Currently, respiratory physiotherapy includes, manual expiration assist often associated with nasotracheal aspiration. Despite of this care, respiratory failure occur in 30% of patients within 48 after planned extubation. MI-E has been evaluated for neuromuscular disease patient, and increase peak cough flow and the airway clearance. So the beneficials effects of MI-E should be confirmed in a trial in this specific population. We planned to conduct a study evaluating the efficacy of MI-E in the prevention of extubation failure and mortality in these patients. If no signs of respiratory failure appeared after 120 min of a spontaneous breathing trial, patients will be extubated and randomly allocated after extubation to MI-E group or control group. The clinical follow-up will be as follow: the incidence of extubation failure, the reintubation, the ICU or 28-day survival,90-day survival, ICU length of stay.</detailed_description>
