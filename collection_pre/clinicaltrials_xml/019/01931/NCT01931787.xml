	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies CPI-613 (6,8-bis[benzylthio]octanoic acid) in treating patients with relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer. CPI-613 may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and may be an effective treatment for small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CPI-613 in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety and anti-cancer activities in patients with relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer (SCLC) who have failed 1 or 2 lines of chemotherapy. OUTLINE: Patients receive CPI-613 intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1 and 4 of weeks 1-3. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months.</detailed_description>
