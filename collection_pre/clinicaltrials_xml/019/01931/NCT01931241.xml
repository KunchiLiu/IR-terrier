	<brief_title>Safety Study of Bile Acid to Treat Hypercholesteremia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>4 sequential dosing cohorts, each cohort beginning with single dose (SDD), single day exposure, followed by one week of multiple daily dosing (MDD) with bid exposure, a 4 day drug honeymoon, then one week of MDD utilizing tid exposure. Each subsequent cohort utilizes the same SDD/MDD design, starting with SDD higher than prior SDD but a SDD significantly lower than prior tid MDD cohort just completed, the overall goal being to provide gradually increasing dose exposure contingent on satisfactory safety and tolerability of lower doses in the previous groups. Cohort 4 (MDD) utilizes best dose determined by Cohorts 1, 2 &amp; 3 for 21 days. Estimated Duration of Subject Participation: 8-9 weeks Under Protocol Amendment Version 5.0, an additional cohort, Cohort 5, will concomitantly enroll 48 volunteers randomized to receive either AHRO-001 or placebo. Volunteers included in the study may be either currently receiving or not receiving a statin treatment. The 48 volunteers in Cohort 5 will thus be allocated to 3 treatment groups with 16 volunteers enrolled per group: Group A: AHRO-001 alone Group B: Statin + AHRO-001 Group C: Placebo SUBJECT POPULATION: Healthy volunteers, both males &amp; infertile females, with asymptomatic mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia</detailed_description>
