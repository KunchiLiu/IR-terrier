	<brief_summary>Attending morning rounds take place at teaching hospitals every day. They are the primary mechanism for patient care delivery, supervision and education of trainees, and communication with patients, families, and staff. However, they are done with little standardization or widely recognized best practices. The objective of this quality improvement (QI) initiative is to evaluate the adherence to and impact of implementing standardized attending morning rounds on medicine teams at our institution. A standardized rounding intervention has been developed which includes specific guidance on completing the following activities during morning rounds: (1) Pre-rounds discretion; (2) Pre-rounds huddle; (3) Bedside registered nurse (RN) integration; (4) Patient-centered rounding; (5) Real-time order writing. This trial will randomize half of the investigators' medicine teams at University of California San Francisco to this rounding intervention whilst the other half will be randomized to continue with usual unstandardized rounding practices. The investigators will compare medicine teams randomized to undertake standardized rounding to those teams undertaking usual practice. Outcomes assessed will relate to the patient (e.g. satisfaction), providers (e.g. satisfaction), efficiency (e.g. total morning round time) as well as adherence to the intervention . The investigators' study hypotheses are that patient satisfaction scores will be higher for those patients receiving standardized bedside rounds compared to the usual care group. The investigators also hypothesize that total attending morning rounds time and interns length of workday will be shorter and that the number of consultations ordered before noon will increase for those teams undertaking standardized bedside. Further, the investigator hypothesize higher levels of nurse participation, physician and medical student satisfaction with standardized bedside rounding.</brief_summary>
