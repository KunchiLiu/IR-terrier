	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study was to investigate whether regular moderate- or high-intensity interval training can change the DNA methylation in a long-lasting state, and whether these changes affect the gene expression. In addition, the investigators will determine whether the intensity of the training could be an affecting factor of the possible DNA-methylation change as well. The null hypothesis was that no such exercise-induced changes occur.</brief_summary>
