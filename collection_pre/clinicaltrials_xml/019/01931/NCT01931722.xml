	<brief_summary>Likely, branched chain amino acid (BCAA) requirements are increased in older strength-trained (ST) individuals. If so, supplementation in this group will maximize muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and minimize loss of muscle with age (sarcopenia).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise and Branched Chain Amino Acids (BCAA)Requirements in Older Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize that the dietary requirement for the branched chain amino acids (BCAA) in an older strength-trained (ST) population will be greater than the current recommendation (RDA). If so, a greater intake of BCAA together with ST is necessary if one aims to maximize muscle protein synthesis (MPS). Currently, the BCAA requirement in the ST older population (55-65 y) is unknown. This is critical information especially given the value of ST for overall health.</detailed_description>
