	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn more about what is the effect of uric acid on oxidative stress and on the way the body metabolizes sugar in obese people. Understanding this may lead to better diseases such as diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Reducing Uric Acid on Insulin Sensitivity and Oxidative Status</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It has been hypothesized that oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance associated with obesity. Circulating uric acid (UA) is the body's major endogenous plasma antioxidant. Therefore, the investigators evaluated whether alterations in serum UA concentration affect: 1) systemic and skeletal muscle oxidative stress, 2) total antioxidant capacity, and 4) skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp.</detailed_description>
