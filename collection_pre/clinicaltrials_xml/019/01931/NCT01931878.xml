	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of local injections of botulinum toxin A (XeominÂ®) to an inactive test substance (placebo) in a medical condition called Restless Leg Syndrome. This study has a double blind cross over design. Cross over means that you will have two sets of injections. The first set of injections can be either Xeomin or placebo. The order of injection will be reversed at the three month point following the first injection. Double blind means neither the investigators nor you know which one of the two (Xeomin or placebo) you received.</brief_summary>
