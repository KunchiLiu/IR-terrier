	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine safety and characterize pharmacokinetics of higher doses of intravenous baclofen in healthy subjects. This study is a non-randomized dose escalation study. Three subjects will receive 10 mg doses of IV baclofen, two or more days later the next three subjects will receive 15 mg baclofen intravenously, and two or more days later the last three subjects will receive 20 mg IV baclofen. The pharmacokinetic and tolerability information gained from this study will support the development of further studies to assess the use of IV baclofen to prevent or treat baclofen withdrawal syndrome.</brief_summary>

Female subjects must be postmenopausal for at least 1 year, or surgically incapable of bearing children, or practicing at least one or more of the following methods of contraception for three months prior to, and during the study: hormonal, intrauterine device (IUD), or barrier method in combination with a spermicide. 4.

Subject has a history of intolerance to IV administration of medication. 4. Subject has a known hypersensitivity to baclofen. 5. Subject has a significant history of cardiac, neurologic, psychiatric, oncologic, endocrine, metabolic, renal or hepatic disease 6. Subject has taken or used any investigational drug or device in the 30 days prior to screening. 7. Subject has taken either prescribed or over the counter medication for 48 hours prior to baclofen administration on either of the study days, other than hormonal birth control. 8. Subject reveals clinically significant abnormalities on screening laboratory tests. 9. Subject is a nonEnglish speaker, such that ability to ascertain neurological status would require an interpreter. 10.
