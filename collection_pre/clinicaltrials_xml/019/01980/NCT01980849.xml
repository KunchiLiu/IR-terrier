	<brief_title>Prophylaxis of Venous Thromboembolism in Advanced Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized and controlled study. Advanced lung cancer patients without venous thromboembolism(VTE) are included. The selected patients were randomized into A and B groups. Group A: Nadroparin given during hospitalization, 0.4mL, subcutaneously, qid; Group B: Nadroparin given by long-term, 0.4mL, subcutaneously, qid. The incidence of VTE , the risks of bleeding and overall survival in two groups of patients are studied at different time points.</detailed_description>
