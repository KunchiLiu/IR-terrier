	<brief_summary>In pre-clinical study we found that the thioredoxin reductase activity of serum harbours huge difference between cancer patients and non-cancer patients, the enzyme activity elevated remarkably among cancer patients, and after any kind of treatment serum thioredoxin reductase activity declined remarkably, so we hypothesis that serum thioredoxin reductase activity could be a warning marker for early progression of first-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tumor Relapsed Study of Serum Trxr Activity in Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a cooperative research project involving patients in Medical Oncology Department of Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Xiangya School of Medicine Central South University, and the State Key Laboratory for Natural Medicine and Biomimetic Drugs Perking University. The primary objective is to measure the thioredoxin reductase activity using blood in subjects received platinum based chemotherapy, to study the warning progression ability of thioredoxin reductase in blood. The secondary objective is to compare the warning progression activity of blood thioredoxin reductase reductase activity with carcinoembryonic antigen in subjects received platinum based first-line chemotherapy. Blood will be collected before chemotherapy, after every 2 cycles of chemotherapy, every 3 months after all first-line chemotherapy till 2 years, then every 6 months till 3 years, or collect blood till tumor progression, evaluation CT results every time collecting blood samples.</detailed_description>
