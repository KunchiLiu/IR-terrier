	<brief_summary>In China, S-1 is an novel oral fluoropyrimidine with demonstrated high efficacy on gastrointestinal cancer. The new regimen with oxaliplatin and leucovorin is expected to achieve more encouraging efficacy on gastric cancer. This study is aimed to evaluate the feasibility of the SOL regimen on efficacy and tolerability on Chinese patients with advanced gastric cancer.</brief_summary>
