	<brief_summary>Wire-crossing of a chronic total coronary occlusion (CTO) is time-consuming and limited by the amount of contrast agent and time of radiation exposure. Magnetic wire navigation might accelerate wire-crossing by maintaining a coaxial vessel orientation. This study compares magnetic with conventional wire navigation for recanalization of CTOs.</brief_summary>
