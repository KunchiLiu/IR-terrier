	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Plus Bevacizumab in Elderly Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CRITERIOS INCLUSION - Written informed consent confirming that the patient understands the study objective and the procedures required. - Patients must be able to accomplish with the study protocol. - Men and women ≥70 years old. - Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR gen mutational status negative or non-determinable. - Patients with stage IV disease. - Patients who have not received first-line treatment - Patients with ECOG performance status 0 or 1. - Adequate bone marrow function, defined as: - Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.500/mm3 or ≥1.5x109/L; - Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL. - Platelet count ≥ 100.000/mm3. - Adequate renal function, defined as: - Creatinine clearance ≥ 40 ml/min, according to MDRD formula. - Urine dipstick proteinuria &lt;2+. If urine dipstick for proteinuria ≥2+ 24 hours urine must be collected within 24 hours, and proteins must be less than 1 g. - Fertile males must use an effective contraceptive method (error rate per year &lt;1%) during the trial and until 6 months after the last study treatment dose, such as sexual abstinence, previous vasectomy and/or having a partner using any of following methods: implantables, injections, combined oral contraceptives and/or intrauterine device (hormonal only). CRITERIOS EXCLUSION - Previous chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC. - History of haemoptysis grade ≥ 2 (defined as at least 2.5 mL of bright red blood) in the 3 months before inclusion. - Major surgery (including open biopsy), significant traumatic injuries in the 28 days before inclusion or anticipation of the need of major surgical procedure during the treatment period - Minor surgery, including permanent catheter insertion, in the 24 hours before bevacizumab infusion. - Untreated brain metastases. Patients with CNS metastases treated with radiotherapy or surgery may be included if there is no evidence of progression after treatment - Radiological evidence of a tumor that invades or is adjacent to a main blood vessel (e.g. lung artery or superior cava venous). - Radiotherapy, in any lesion and for any reason, within 28 days before inclusion. Palliative radiotherapy for bone lesions within 14 days before inclusion is allowed. - Treatment with aspirin (&gt;325 mg/day) or clopidogrel (&gt;75 mg/day) within 10 days prior to bevacizumab first dose. Use of full dose of oral or parenteral anticoagulants or thrombolytic agents in therapeutic doses. Prophylactic use of anticoagulant therapy is allowed. - Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP &gt;140 mmHg, diastolic BP &gt;90mmHg) in the 28 days previous to inclusion or history of hypertensive crisis, or hypertensive encephalopathy. - Clinically significant cardiovascular disease (i.e. cerebrovascular accident (CVA), myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to inclusion, unstable angina, congestive cardiac insufficiency NYHA ≥ II, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;50% or serious cardiac arrhytmia), not responding to treatment or that can interfere with trial treatment administration. - Not healed wounds, active peptic ulcer or untreated bone fracture. - Hypersensibility to any of the active ingredients of the study treatment (bevacizumab, carboplatine and paclitaxel) or any of its excipients. - Serious cognitive impairment that limits the patient to understand and answer the study questionnaires. - Inability to comply with the study protocol and/or follow-up procedures due to psychological, familiar, social or geographical problems - Patients with an ADL score &lt;5 at the screening. - Patients with dementia: 9-12 points in the Folstein MMS at the screening. - Patients accomplishing fragility Balducci criteria at the screening: - Age ≥ 85 years old - Dependence in 1 or more ADL - &gt;3 comorbilities - &gt;1 geriatric syndrome OBJETIVOS To assess the toxicity of the treatment in elderly patients (≥70 years) with NSC lung cancer who meet inclusion criteria for bevacizumab and selected based on a geriatric evaluation. Determine predictive factors of toxicity in the elderly population (≥70 years). Determine objective response rate Determine disease control rate Determine progression free survival Determine overall survival Determine safety of the treatment combination VARIABLES Primary endpoint: Rate of grade 3-4 neutropenia defined according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria version 4.0 (NCI-CTC v4.0). Secondary endpoints: - Items of the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) scale as predictive factors for toxicity end-points. - Objective response according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). - Progression-free survival. - Overall survival.</detailed_description>
