	<brief_summary>The primary study hypotheses are that, without increasing doses of breakthrough medications or device intolerance, the Nometex™ device worn for 5-days beginning with the day of chemotherapy administration in women with ovarian or advanced endometrial or cervical cancer will, as an adjunct to standard-of-care anti-emetics, reduce vomiting episodes, and reduce the severity of nausea. The secondary hypotheses are that the Nometex™ device reduces acute (Day 1) emetic episodes, day 1 and days 2-5 severity of nausea, and delayed (days 2-5) emetic episodes without increasing doses of breakthrough medications or device intolerance.</brief_summary>
