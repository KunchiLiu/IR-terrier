	<brief_summary>Argatroban is a selective thrombin inhibitor, and previous study had suggested that argatroban use post percutaneous coronary intervention could potentially prevent reocclusion. But there has no study on large sample of argatroban treated restenosis vertebral artery stenting. This study will test the safety and efficacy of the argatroban on prevent Occlusion and Restenosis in patients with Extracranial vertebral Artery Stenting.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Argatroban for Preventing Occlusion and Restenosis After Extracranial Vertebral Artery Stenting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The risk of restenosis post intracranial and extracranial artery stenting is 20-40%, therefore, in the past, aspirin and clopidogrel were performed as anticoagulant therapy post stenting.But this treatment had limited effectiveness upon restenosis. Argatroban is a selective thrombin inhibitor, and previous study had suggested that argatroban use post PCI could potentially prevent reocclusion. But there has no study on large sample of argatroban treated Occlusion and Restenosis Extracranial vertebral Artery Stenting. This study will test the safety and efficacy of the argatroban on prevent Occlusion and Restenosis in patients with Extracranial vertebral Artery Stenting.</detailed_description>
