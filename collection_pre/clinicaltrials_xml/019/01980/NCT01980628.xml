	<brief_title>Study of the Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor in Subjects With Relapsed/Refractory Marginal Zone Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ibrutinib is a first-in-class, potent, orally administered covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). Inhibition of BTK blocks downstream B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathways and thus prevents B-cell proliferation. In vitro, ibrutinib inhibits purified BTK and selected members of the kinase family with 10-fold specificity compared with non-BTK kinases. Phase 1 and 2 studies of ibrutinib in B-cell malignancies demonstrate modest toxicity and significant single agent activity in a variety of B-cell malignancies, including NHL.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key Inclusion criteria: Histologically documented marginal zone lymphoma including splenic, nodal, and extranodal subtypes; subjects with splenic MZL must have an additional measurable lesion, nodal or extranodal, as described in inclusion criteria 5 Previously received one or more lines of therapy including at least one CD20directed regimen (either as monotherapy or as chemoimmunotherapy) with documented failure to achieve at least PR or documented PD after, the most recent systemic treatment regimen Men and women ≥18 years of age ECOG performance status of ≤2 ≥1 measurable lesion site on CT scan (&gt;1.5 cm in longest dimension). Lesions in anatomical locations (such as extremities or soft tissue lesions) that are not well visualized by CT may be measured by MRI instead. (Subjects with spleenonly disease are considered as not having measurable disease.) Life expectancy of &gt;3 months, in the opinion of the investigator Key Exclusion criteria: Medically apparent CNS lymphoma or leptomeningeal disease History of other malignancies except adequately treated non melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated insitu cancer, or other solid tumors curatively treated with no evidence of disease for ≥2 years History of allogeneic stemcell (or other organ) transplantation Any chemotherapy, anticancer antibodies, or other systemic anticancer therapy within 21 days of the first dose of study drug Any external beam radiation therapy within 6 weeks prior to the first dose of the study drug Concurrent use of warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists Concurrent use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor. Subjects who have received a strong CYP3A inhibitor prior to entering the study must have discontinued therapy for at least 5 half lives of the prohibited medication. Recent infection requiring IV antiinfective treatment that was completed ≤14 days before the first dose of study drug Unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy, defined as having not resolved to CTCAE Grade 0 or 1, or to the levels dictated in the eligibility criteria with the exception of alopecia Inadequate organ function as defined on laboratory tests</criteria>
