	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I, Randomized, Double-Blind Within Device, Single-Dose, Four-Period, Six-Treatment, Cross-Over Study Evaluating the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Three Doses of Budesonide, Glycopyrronium, and Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation Aerosol (BGF MDI), One Dose of Glycopyrronium and Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation Aerosol (GFF MDI), and Two Doses of SymbicortÂ® Inhalation Aerosol in Healthy Volunteers. The primary objective of the study is to determine a dose of budesonide that when formulated with glycopyrronium and formoterol fumarate in BGF MDI provides comparable systemic exposure [pharmacokinetics (PK)] to budesonide following administration of Symbicort MDI.</brief_summary>
