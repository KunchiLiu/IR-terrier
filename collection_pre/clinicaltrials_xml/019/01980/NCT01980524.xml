	<brief_summary>There is evidence that inhibition of FFA-release by acipimox is associated with a significant decrease in myocardial lipid content (MYCL) as well as the ejection fraction (as a marker of systolic left ventricular function) in healthy subjects, indicating, that the heart is dependent on a constant supply of free fatty acids in order to guarantee normal cardiac function, and it further indicates, that the heart is not able to cover its energy demand by switching to glucose oxidation. Since that phenomenon, better known as "metabolic inflexibility" has been mainly described in patients with diabetes, we aim to investigate the impact of FFA-inhibition on MYCL and cardiac function in patients with overt type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
