	<brief_summary>The NeuroVISION Study will characterize the incidence, impact, and risk factors of covert stroke in adults undergoing noncardiac surgery. We will determine the incidence of acute covert stroke using an MRI study of the brain in the days following noncardiac surgery. We will characterize the epidemiology and the impact of covert stroke in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, and its association with cerebral deoxygenation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At the University of Wisconsin a planned sub study of NeuroVISION is being conducted aiming to enroll 100 patients with additional cognitive testing, MRI sequences and a preoperative MRI scan. At Hamilton Juravinski Hospital, Hamilton General Hospital, Auckland City Hospital and Prince of Wales Hospital a planned sub study of NeuroVISION (PAFS - Perioperative Atrial Fibrillation and Postoperative Stroke) is being conducted aiming to enroll 400 participants. The purpose of this sub-study is to determine the prevalence of AF(Atrial Fibrillation) before surgery (i.e. "background" AF), as well of the incidence of AF after surgery using the Icentia CardioSTAT "patch-like" single lead heart rhythm monitor.</detailed_description>
