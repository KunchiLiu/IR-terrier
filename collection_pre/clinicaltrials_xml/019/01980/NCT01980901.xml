	<brief_summary>The Post-Approval Study (PAS) will evaluate the "real world" data on the Ovation™/Ovation Prime™ Abdominal Stent Graft System along with the long-term data collected from the IDE cohort to monitor the long-term safety and effectiveness of the device.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post-Approval Study of the Ovation™/Ovation Prime™ Abdominal Stent Graft System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the long term safety and effectiveness of the Ovation™/Ovation Prime™ Abdominal Stent Graft System for the endovascular treatment of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms in a post-approval environment. The clinical objective of the study is to evaluate the long term safety and effectiveness of the Ovation™/Ovation Prime™ Abdominal Stent Graft System assessed at 5 years through freedom from Aneurysm-Related Mortality. Additionally, this study will evaluate the physician training program for modifications based on IDE and post-approval experience.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patient is &gt; 18 years of age. 2. Patients who are male or nonpregnant female (females of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to enrollment into the study). 3. Patient has signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved Informed Consent Form. 4. Patient is considered by the treating physician to be a candidate for elective open surgical repair of the AAA (i.e., category I, II, or III per American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) classification; refer to Appendix III: ASA Classification System). ASA category IV patients may be enrolled provided their life expectancy is greater than 1 year. 5. Patient has an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm that meets at least one of the following: Abdominal aortic aneurysm &gt;5.0 cm in diameter Aneurysm has increased in size by 0.5 cm in last 6 months. Maximum diameter of aneurysm exceeds 1.5 times the transverse dimension of an adjacent nonaneurysmal aortic segment 6. Patient has patent iliac or femoral arteries that allow endovascular access with the TriVascular Ovation/Ovation Prime Abdominal Stent Graft System. 7. Patient has a suitable nonaneurysmal proximal aortic neck length of ≥ 7 mm inferior to the most distal renal artery ostium. 8. Patient has a suitable nonaneurysmal distal iliac artery length (seal zone) of ≥10 mm. The resultant repair should preserve patency in at least one hypogastric artery. 9. Patient has a suitable nonaneurysmal proximal aortic neck luminal diameter between 16 and 30 mm. 10. Patient has suitable nonaneurysmal distal iliac luminal diameters between 8 and 20 mm. 11. Patient meets the following anatomic criteria: the distance from the most distal renal artery to most superior internal iliac artery measurement is at least 13 cm. 12. Patient has juxtarenal aortic neck angulation ≤ 60º if proximal neck is ≥10 mm and ≤ 45º if proximal neck is &lt;10 mm. Patient must be willing to comply with all required followup exams. 13. Patient must be willing to comply with all required followup exams. 1. Patient has a dissecting aneurysm. 2. Patient has an acutely ruptured aneurysm. 3. Patient has an acute vascular injury. 4. Patient has a need for emergent surgery. 5. Patient has a known thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. 6. Patient has a mycotic aneurysm or has an active systemic infection. 7. Patient has unstable angina (defined as angina with a progressive increase in symptoms, new onset at rest or nocturnal angina, or onset of prolonged angina). 8. Patient has had a myocardial infarction (MI) and/or stroke (CVA) within the past 6 months. 9. Patient has a major surgical or interventional procedure planned ≤30 days of the AAA repair. 10. Patient has history of connective tissue disease (e.g., Marfan's or Ehler'sDanlos syndrome). 11. Patient has history of bleeding disorders or refuses blood transfusions. 12. Patient has dialysis dependent renal failure or baseline serum creatinine level &gt;2.0 mg/dl 13. Patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to anticoagulation or contrast media that is not amenable to pretreatment. 14. Patient has a known allergy or intolerance to polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), PEGbased polymers, fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) or nitinol. 15. Patient has a body habitus that would inhibit Xray visualization of the aorta 16. Patient has a limited life expectancy of less than 1 year 17. Patient is currently participating in an investigational device or drug clinical trial. 18. Patient has other medical, social or psychological conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, preclude them from receiving the pretreatment, required treatment, and posttreatment procedures and evaluations.</criteria>
