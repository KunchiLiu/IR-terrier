	<brief_summary>Background. Cognitive, communication and physical weakness combined with environmental changes frequently cause changes in roles, routines and daily occupations. The educational intervention combines the best choice for teaching new behaviours since it involves the active participation of the patient in learning. Methods. Design. Randomized clinical trial. Participants. Total sample: 80 adults who have suffered a stroke with moderate severity and who have been discharged to their homes.Outcome variables. BI, FIM, MMSE, CNS, SIS-16, TCT, MRS, MSPSS, QLSF, FRT, RT, TUG, TST, a portable dynamometer and a sociodemographic questionnaire. Data analysis. Descriptive analyses will include mean and 95% CI of the values for each variable. The Kolmogov-Smirnov (KS) test and a 2x2 mixed model ANOVA will be used. Intergroup effect sizes will be calculated (Cohen's d).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background. Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of long-term neurological disability in the world. Cognitive, communication and physical weakness combined with environmental changes frequently cause changes in roles, routines and daily occupations. The educational intervention combines didactic and interactive intervention, which combines the best choice for teaching new behaviours since it involves the active participation of the patient in learning. Nowadays there are many types of intervention or means to increase adherence to treatment. Methods. Design. This study is a randomized clinical trial. Participants. The total sample will consist of 60 adults who have suffered a stroke with moderate severity and who have been discharged to their homes in the 3 months prior to recruitment to the study. Outcome variables. Barthel Index, the Functional Independence Measure, the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Canadian Neurological Scale, the Stroke Impact Scale-16, the Trunk Control Test, the Modified Rankin Scale, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, the Quality of Life Scale for Stroke, the Functional Reach test, the Romberg test, the Time Up and Go, the Timed-Stands Test, a portable dynamometer and a sociodemographic questionnaire. Data analysis. Descriptive analyses will include mean and 95% confidence intervals of the values for each variable. The Kolmogov-Smirnov (KS) test and a 2x2 mixed model ANOVA will be used. Intergroup effect sizes will be calculated (Cohen's d).</detailed_description>
