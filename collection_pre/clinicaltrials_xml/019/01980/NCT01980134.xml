	<brief_summary>To demonstrate the use of WavSTAT4 system during colonoscopy in identifying diminutive colorectal lesions (e.g. hyperplastic polyps) that can be resected and discarded (or even left in-situ) without adverse clinical impact.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The MORDIS Study Clinical Investigational Plan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To demonstrate the performance of the WavSTAT4 Optical Biopsy System when used at multiple centers. Endpoint targets are based on the ASGE PIVI recommendations on real-time endoscopic assessment of the histology of diminutive colorectal polyps. - Primary endpoint: To demonstrate potential of the WavSTAT4 Optical Biopsy System to predict adenomatous histology with a NPV &gt; = 90% for diminutive colorectal lesions. - Secondary Endpoint: To show that use of the WavSTAT4 system used to determine histology of colorectal polyps ≤5 mm in size, when combined with the histo- pathologic assessment of polyps &gt;5 mm in size, provides a ≥ 90% agreement in assignment of post-polypectomy surveillance intervals when compared to decisions based on pathology assessment of all identified polyps.</detailed_description>
