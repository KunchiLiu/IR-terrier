	<brief_summary>This study concerns women diagnosed with postpartum hemorrhage and requiring sulprostone therapy. Included patients are randomized to two arms: the "Sulprostone + Bakri balloon" arm versus the "Sulprostone alone" arm. The main objective of this study is to compare the efficiency of a care strategy including the Bakri balloon to that of routine care without the Bakri balloon via a cost-consequence study juxtaposing costs and the necessity of invasive procedures (arterial embolization, ligation of arteries, hysterectomy, intrauterine sutures) for controlling postpartum hemorrhage.</brief_summary>
