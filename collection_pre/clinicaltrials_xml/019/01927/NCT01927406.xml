	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential secondary beneficial effect of prostaglandin analogues (PA) treatment in thyroid eye disease (TED) patients. This study aims to determine if PA would change the course of the orbitopathy in TED patients by altering the progression of the common features of TED, including fatty hypertrophy, proptosis, eyelid retraction and optic nerve compression. The eyes with thyroid eye disease and elevated intraocular pressure will be randomised to the PA treatment and the other eye will serve as a control eye and will be treated with Timolol.</brief_summary>
