	<brief_title>Evaluating the Safety and Immune Response to Two HIV Vaccine Regimens in Healthy, HIV-Uninfected Adults in the United States and South Africa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immune response to two different vaccine schedules of a prime with either DNA HIV vaccine (DNA-HIV-PT123), or NYVAC HIV vaccine (NYVAC-HIV-PT1 and NYVAC-HIV-PT4) followed by a boost combination of NYVAC HIV vaccine (PT1 &amp; PT4) and AIDSVAX B/E. Study researchers will also evaluate whether body mass index (BMI) and/or sex impact the immunogenicity of the vaccine regimens in participants from South Africa, and look at regional differences in immunologic responses between United States and South African participants. The study will enroll 264 healthy, HIV-uninfected people, ages 18-50, in the United States and South Africa. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups and receive either one of the vaccine regimens or placebo. Participants will receive injections according to their assigned group schedule at study entry (Month 0) and Months 1, 3, and 6. Participants will remain in the clinic for 30 minutes after receiving the vaccines for observation and monitoring. For 7 days after receiving the vaccines, participants will record their symptoms and report them to study researchers. Study visits will occur at study entry, and Months 1, 1.5, 3, 3.5, 6, 6.5, 9, and 12. All study visits will include a physical examination, HIV risk reduction counseling, and interviews and/or questionnaires. Select study visits will include urine collection, an electrocardiogram (ECG), blood collection, a pregnancy test for female participants, and HIV testing. At some visits, some participants may also provide samples of cervical fluid, rectal fluid, and/or semen. Study researchers will contact participants by telephone or e-mail once a year for 3 years following the first vaccination for follow-up health monitoring.</detailed_description>

NonU.S. sites may use locally available assays that have been approved by HVTN Laboratory Operations. Negative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) Negative antihepatitis C virus antibodies (antiHCV), or negative HCV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if the antiHCV is positive Normal urine: 1. Negative urine glucose, and 2. Negative or trace urine protein, and 3. Negative or trace urine hemoglobin (if trace hemoglobin is present on dipstick, a microscopic urinalysis with red blood cells levels within institutional normal range). Participants who were born female: negative serum or urine beta human chorionic gonadotropin (Î²HCG) pregnancy test performed prior to vaccination on the day of initial vaccination Reproductive status: a participant who was born female must agree to consistently use effective contraception for sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy from at least 21 days prior to enrollment through the last required protocol clinic visit. More information on this criterion can be found in the protocol. Participants who were born female must also agree not to seek pregnancy through alternative methods, such as artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization until after the last required protocol clinic visit Blood products received within 120 days before first vaccination Investigational research agents received within 30 days before first vaccination Body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 40; or BMI greater than or equal to 35 with 2 or more of the following: age greater than 45, systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg, or known hyperlipidemia Intent to participate in another study of an investigational research agent during the planned duration of this study Pregnant or breastfeeding HIV vaccine(s) received in a prior HIV vaccine trial. For participants who have received control/placebo in an HIV vaccine trial, the HVTN 101 Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT) will determine eligibility on a casebycase basis. NonHIV experimental vaccine(s) received within the last 5 years in a prior vaccine trial. Exceptions may be made for vaccines that have subsequently undergone licensure by the FDA or (South Africa) Medicines Control Council (MCC). For participants who have received control/placebo in an experimental vaccine trial, the HVTN 101 PSRT will determine eligibility on a casebycase basis. For participants who have received an experimental vaccine(s) greater than 5 years ago, eligibility for enrollment will be determined by the HVTN 101 PSRT on a casebycase basis.
