	<brief_summary>Internet-based cognitive behavioural self-help (iCBT) has become increasingly popular to provide psychotherapy. For several psychological and psychosomatic disorders, treatment efficacy was shown. Previously, iCBT has also been applied to patients suffering from tinnitus and results show significant and long-term stable improvements in tinnitus distress. However, the role of therapeutic support in iCBT has not been thoroughly investigated. Previous results suggest that iCBT without therapeutic support is less effective and leads to higher dropout rates than therapist-guided iCBT. The aim of the randomized controlled trial is thus to investigate the role of therapeutic support in an iCBT for tinnitus sufferers.</brief_summary>
