	<brief_summary>This is a double-blind prospective randomized control trial. The primary hypothesis is that the preservation of motor function is superior in distal forearm blocks compared to supraclavicular block. The secondary outcomes include patient satisfaction, surgeon's satisfaction, rate of block success, onset and duration of block.</brief_summary>
