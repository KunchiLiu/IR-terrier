	<brief_summary>The study is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel, dose-finding study with healthy volunteers. A total of 100 male and female volunteers will be included. The volunteers will be randomized into one of 10 groups, each of 10 participants, consuming either active product in various mixes and doses (9 groups) or placebo product (1 group) for 2 weeks. The 9 groups receiving active product will receive either one of two Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs) alone or in combination at different doses. The primary purpose of the study is establishing the effects of various compositions and doses of HMOs on the faecal flora and on gastrointestinal symptoms in health adults.</brief_summary>
