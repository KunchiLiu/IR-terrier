	<brief_summary>Long-standing diabetes is often complicated by retinopathy. The mechanisms that induce the development of diabetic retinopathy are incompletely understood and include alterations in bone marrow derived vasculogenic cells called "endothelial progenitor cells". Fenofibrate is a PPAR-alpha agonist used for the treatment of mixed dislipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia. In a trial conducted in type 2 diabetic patients, the drug fenofibrate has reduced retinopathy-related endpoints suggesting a direct effect of the drug on the mechanisms that drive the development of this complication. Herein, the investigators hypothesize that fenofibrate treatment can increase circulating EPC levels in diabetic patients with retinopathy, compared to placebo.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Long-standing diabetes is often complicated by retinopathy. The mechanisms that induce the development of diabetic retinopathy are incompletely understood and include alterations in bone marrow derived vasculogenic cells called "endothelial progenitor cells". Fenofibrate is a PPAR-alpha agonist used for the treatment of mixed dislipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia. In addition to lowering triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, PPAR-alpha agonism with fenofibrate has several additional molecular benefit on the vessel wall, such as reduction of inflammation. In a trial conducted in type 2 diabetic patients, the drug fenofibrate has reduced retinopathy-related endpoints suggesting a direct effect of the drug on the mechanisms that drive the development of this complication. Preliminary data of ours on the effects of fenofibrate on cultured EPC show that this drug has the potential to improve EPC and, consequently, may benefit patients with retinopathy. Herein, the investigators hypothesize that fenofibrate treatment can increase circulating EPC levels in diabetic patients with retinopathy, compared to placebo.</detailed_description>
