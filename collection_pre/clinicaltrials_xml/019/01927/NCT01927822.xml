	<brief_title>Factors Influencing the Abortion Interval of Second-trimester Termination of Pregnancy Using Misoprostol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Misoprostol is the primary drug of choice for medical termination. It is not only cheap, but also stable at room temperature and easily available worldwide. It is indicated for the treatment of gastritis, but is widely used off-label for a variety of indications in the practice of obstetrics and gynecology, including medication abortion, induction of labor, and the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage. The optimal dosage and route of administration have not been well defined and vary with physicians. The potency of misoprostol's effect varies with dosage, route of administration and dosing interval; both maternal and fetal factors may, to certain extent, affect the abortion interval. This study aims to analyze the factors influencing the abortion interval of second-trimester termination of pregnancy using misoprostol.</detailed_description>
