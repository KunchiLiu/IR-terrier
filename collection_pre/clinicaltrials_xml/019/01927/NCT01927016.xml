	<brief_summary>Background - Esophageal carcinoma is the sixth leading cause of cancer -related mortality and the eighth most common cancer worldwide - The incidence is increasing rapidly - The overall 5-year survival ranges from 15% to 25% in the literature and poor outcomes are related to diagnosis at advanced stages. - Surgery used to be the cornerstone of treatment of resectable esophageal cancer, but treatment of esophageal carcinoma remains challenging and need to be considered through a multimodal approach. However the modalities and the impact of this multimodal approach at a national level are unknown Primary objective: To identify predictors of recurrence after esophageal cancer surgery Secondary objectives : - 5-year recurrence free survival - 5-year overall survival - Predictors of postoperative mortality and morbidity after surgery - Impact of pCR on recurrence and survival - Impact of neoadjuvant treatments on recurrence and survival - Impact of patient preconditioning (such as nutritional support, esophageal prosthesis, mini-invasive approachâ€¦) on outcomes Methodology : European French-speaking retrospective multicentric study Inclusion criteria: All consecutive patients operated on, for a histologically proven carcinoma of the esophagus, the oesophago-gastric junction (Siewert type I and II), in surgical investigator centers between January 2000 and December 2010 Exclusion criteria: Siewert III type carcinoma of the oesophago-gastric junction , non surgical treatment of esophageal carcinoma Planned study period: The data will be collected over a 11-year period from January 2000 to December 2010. Follow up will be ascertained in May 2013.</brief_summary>
