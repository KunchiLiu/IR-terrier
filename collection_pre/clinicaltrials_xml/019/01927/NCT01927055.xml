Any major surgical procedure within 30 days prior to the Baseline visit (Visit 2); 15. Previously treated with droxidopa within 30 days prior to the Baseline visit (Visit 2); 16. Currently receiving any other investigational drug or have received an investigational drug within 30 days prior to the Baseline visit (Visit 2); 17. Any condition or laboratory test result, which in the Investigator's judgment, might result in an increased risk to the patient, or would affect their participation in the study; 18. The Investigator has the ability to exclude a patient if for any reason they feel the subject is not a good candidate for the study or will not be able to follow study procedures.</criteria>
