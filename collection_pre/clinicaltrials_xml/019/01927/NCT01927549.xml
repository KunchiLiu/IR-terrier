	<brief_summary>The study compares the therapies of instant multivessel balloon angioplasty plus stent implantation or the balloon angioplasty plus stent implantation of the infarct artery alone with any possible graduated later treatment of the other vessels in patients with acute myocardial infarction with cardioganic shock. The main study hypothesis is to explore if culprit vessel only PCI with potentially subsequent staged revascularization in comparison to immediate multivessel revascularization by PCI in patients with cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction reduces the incidence of 30- day mortality and/or severe renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy.</brief_summary>
