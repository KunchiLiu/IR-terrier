	<brief_summary>The investigators are testing a Light-emiting Diode (LED) flashlight from First-Lightâ„¢ USA called the Tomahawk MC Tactical Light to determine the range of colors people are able to see with these flashlights at night. The flashlight has been designed to reduce visibility of the user and uses a combination of green and red LED lamps to achieve this. In this study investigators wish to determine how well a subject can differentiate colors at night in a quantifiable manner. Investigators will use the Farnsworth Munsell 100 hue test which requires the user to put shades of red, green, blue and yellow into progressive color order which is scored according to the manufactures specifications.</brief_summary>
