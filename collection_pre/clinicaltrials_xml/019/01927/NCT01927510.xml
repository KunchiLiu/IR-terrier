	<brief_summary>Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) traditionally receive bed rest as part of their care. They develop muscle weaknesses even after only a few days of mechanical ventilation that may prolong their time in ICU and in hospital, delay functional recovery and delay their return home and to work. Weakness may be avoided with simple strategies of early exercise in ICU. This pilot study aims to test the hypothesis that early mobilisation may improve functional recovery in this patient group and gather pilot data to support a larger randomised trial across Australia and New Zealand.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TEAM: A Trial of Early Activity and Mobility in ICU</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients who are admitted and treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) generally have potentially reversible critical illness. While many patients survive, substantial proportions of patients fail to recover completely and do not return to their pre-morbid level of health. Critically ill patients receive mechanical ventilation, as a lifesaving intervention, but this is routinely managed with deep sedation and immobility, which results in prolonged periods of bed rest. Severe muscle weakness, termed ICUAW, is common and associated with prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay in the ICU, as well as poor recovery of physical function. Early mobilisation, exercising patients while they are still receiving mechanical ventilation, has been proposed as a candidate intervention to prevent ICU acquired weakness (ICUAW). Observational studies indicate that early mobilisation is not used routinely in critically ill patients in Australia and New Zealand. TEAM is a pilot RCT designed to obtain data to assist in the planning of an adequately powered RCT that will test the hypothesis that early mobilisation of critically ill patients improves one or more functional outcomes, quality of survival, and proportion of patients who survive.</detailed_description>

Proven or suspected actue brain injury such as stroke, subarachnoid haemorrhage, encephalitis, or moderate to severe traumatic brain injury 3. Proven or suspected actue spinal cord injury 4. Proven or suspected GuillainBarre Syndrome 5. Second or subsequent ICU admission during a single hospital admission 6. Unable to follow simple verbal commands in English 7. Death inevitable and imminent 8. Inability to walk without assistance of another person prior to onset of acute illness necessitating ICU admission 9. Cognitive impairment prior to current acute illness 10. Agitation which int he opinion of the treating clinician precludes safe implementation of EGDM 11. Written rest in bed orders due to documented injury or process the precludes mobilisation such as suspected or proven instability of spine or pelvis 12. In the opinion of the treating clinician it is unsafe to commence EGDM 13. Has met all the inclusion criteria with no concomitant exclusion criteria for a period of more than 48 hours</criteria>
