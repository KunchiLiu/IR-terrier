	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of Minnelide™ and to establish the dose of Minnelide™ recommended for future phase 2 protocol</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Minnelide™ in Patients With Advanced GI Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1, open label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of Minnelide™ Minnelide™ will be given as a single agent intravenously as a 30-minute infusion daily x 21 days followed by a 7-day rest period. One cycle will equal 28 days. Dose escalation will follow a modified Fibonacci design.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: 1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed gastrointestinal (GI) carcinoma, which has progressed on standard therapies (surgery, radiotherapy, endocrine therapy, chemotherapy), for which effective therapy is not available or for which patients are not a candidate for or intolerant of such therapies. 2. Have one or more metastatic tumors measurable on CT scan or locally advanced measurable disease that has clearly progressed after prior treatment per RECIST criteria. 3. Male and female patients at least 18 years of age 4. Laboratory data as specified: Hematology: ANC &gt;1500 cells/mm3, platelet count &gt; 150,000 cells/mm3 and Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL Hepatic: Direct bilirubin ≤1.5 X ULN; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 X ULN. For patients with known liver metastases or liver neoplasms, then ALT or AST ≤ 5.0 X ULN is allowed Renal: serum creatinine WNL or calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal Urinalysis: No clinically significant abnormalities Coagulation: INR within normal limits, PTT within normal limits 5. Estimated life expectancy of at least 3 months 6. Karnofsky Performance ≥ 70% 7. A negative serum pregnancy test (if female) 8. For men and women of childproducing potential willingness to employ appropriate contraceptive methods (including abstinence) during the study. 9. Ability to understand the requirements of the study, provide written informed consent and authorization of use and disclosure of protected health information, and agree to abide by the study restrictions and to return for the required assessments. 1. Women who are pregnant or nursing. NOTE: Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; or abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. 2. New York Heart Association Class III or IV, cardiac disease, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, unstable arrhythmia, or evidence of ischemia on ECG. 3. Baseline QTc exceeding 450 msec (470 msec for females) using the Bazetts formula and/or patients receiving class 1A or class III antiarrythmic agents. 4. Active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, requiring systemic therapy. 5. Treatment with radiotherapy, chemotherapy or investigational therapy within 1 month (or 5 half lifes for cytotoxics) prior to study entry (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or Mitomycin C). 6. Known HIV, Hepatitis A, B or Hepatitis C infection 7. Serious nonmalignant disease (e.g., hydronephrosis, liver failure, or other conditions) that could compromise protocol objectives in the opinion of the investigator and/or the sponsor. 8. Participation in concurrent study of an investigational agent or device. 9. Unwillingness or inability to comply with procedures required in this protocol. 10. Any other condition including but not limited to major comorbidities, which in the opinion of the investigator would render the patient ineligible.</criteria>
