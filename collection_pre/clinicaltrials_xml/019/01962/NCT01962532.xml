	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of JNJ-42756493 in Patients With Advanced or Refractory Solid Tumors or Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known), multicenter, 2-part, Phase 1 dose escalation/expansion to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (study of what the body does to a drug), pharmacodynamics (study of what a drug does to the body) and clinical activity of JNJ-42756493 administered orally once daily in 21-day cycles or 28 days cycles of intermittent dosing regimen (7 days on/7 days off) to Japanese and Asian participants &gt;=20 years of age with advanced or refractory solid tumors or lymphoma who are not candidates for approved or available therapies. Approximately 40 participants will be enrolled. In Part 1 Participants will be required to be hospitalized after the first dose on Day 1 of Cycle 1 until Day 2 of Cycle 2 (for daily continuous dosing) or until Day 14 of Cycle 1 (for intermittent dosing), however extension of hospitalization will be allowed until Day 2 of Cycle 2 according to investigators clinical judgment. The Part 1 dose-escalation phase is designed to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) based on safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic data of JNJ-42756493. Participants will be enrolled in sequential cohorts based on the 3+3 dose-escalation scheme; the first cohort will receive the starting dose and subsequent cohorts will receive increased doses of JNJ-42756493. After the last participants in each cohort completes Cycle 1, the Safety Evaluation Team (SET) will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic data according to protocol-defined criteria and make the decision whether to escalate the dose in a new cohort. To determine the recommended Phase 2 dose, the SET will review all safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic data from Part 1 before initiation of Part 2. The total number of participants enrolled in Part 1 will depend on the dose level at which the recommended Phase 2 dose is established. After the recommended Phase 2 dose is established, the Part 2 dose-expansion phase will be opened. Part 2 study will be done in a molecularly-defined subset of Participants with gastric adenocarcinoma including gastroesophageal junctions at the RP2D. In Part2, Participants can be hospitalized until Day 8 of Cycle 1 as needed. In addition, extension of hospitalization will be allowed until Day 15 of Cycle 1 according to investigator's clinical judgment. In Part 2, approximately 25 participants will be treated at the recommended Phase 2 dose as 28 days cycles of intermittent dosing regimen in order to evaluate fibroblast growth factor receptor target modulation in tumor, to further elaborate safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of JNJ-42756493, as well as to evaluate preliminary clinical responses. Participants who are tolerating study drug treatment and achieve clinical responses or stable disease will continue to receive study drug at the same dose until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Serial pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic samples will be collected, and safety and efficacy will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
