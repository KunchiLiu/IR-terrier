	<brief_summary>A number of studies have shown that short duration, high intensity interval training can improve health-related outcomes, such as insulin sensitivity and cardiorespiratory fitness. However, these often use specialized equipment, such as cycle ergometers, which makes it difficult to roll these interventions out for wide-scale use in the general population. This study aims evaluate the effects of a high intensity shuttle running intervention on insulin sensitivity, fitness and related cardiometabolic risk factors in men who are currently inactive. Participants will be randomized into intervention (4 weeks of shuttle running) and control groups. We hypothesize that the shuttle running programme will result in improved insulin sensitivity, fitness and increased fat oxidation at rest compared with the control group.</brief_summary>
