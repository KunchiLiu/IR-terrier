	<brief_summary>This study is designed to compare the short term effects of two different thoracic spine thrust manipulation techniques on neck range of motion, pain, and self-reported disability in a sample of dental students experiencing neck pain. The hypothesis of the study is that there will be a difference between the two thoracic spine thrust manipulation techniques for short term effects on neck range of motion, pain, and self-reported disability in a sample of dental students experiencing neck pain.</brief_summary>
