	<brief_summary>This clinical trial aims at preventing visual dysfunction and optic nerve degeneration associated with autoimmune optic neuritis by systemic i.v. administration of 33.000 IU erythropoietin over 3 days. The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of erythropoietin compared to placebo given as add-on to methylprednisolone as assessed by measurements of retinal nerve fibre layer thickness and low contrast visual acuity 6 months after acute optic neuritis.</brief_summary>
