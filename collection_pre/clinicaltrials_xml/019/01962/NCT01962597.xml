	<brief_summary>Study Hypothesis: The combination of aerobic and resistance exercise training will improve walking speed compared to either individual intervention. Brief Summary: Sixty hemodialysis participants who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized to 20 weeks of supervised exercise, using either: (i) on-dialysis aerobic exercise using a bike ergometer; (ii) pre-dialysis leg strength training using weights; or (iii) both. The primary outcome is walking speed over 4-metres. Secondary outcomes will include: (i) short physical performance battery; (ii) health-related quality of life [EuroQOL-5D-5L]; (iii) Dialysis recovery time; (iv) Nottingham extended activities of daily living (EADL) index; (v) Leg strength; (vi) body composition and anthropometry.</brief_summary>
