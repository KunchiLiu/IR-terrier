	<brief_summary>This study is a double-blind crossover study in female healthy volunteers to compare the pharmacokinetics and safety of either 1 or 6 days of dosing with two different formulations of Proellex for vaginal administration. Each formulation will be designated as either Treatment A or Treatment B. A total of 8 subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized to receive either Treatment A or Treatment B as their first assigned treatment. Subjects will receive a single dose of Treatment A or daily dosing with Treatment B for 6 days. After a 7-day washout period subjects will receive the alternative treatment. On the day of treatment with Treatment A and on the first and last days of treatment with Treatment B subjects will remain in the clinic overnight and undergo 32-hour pharmacokinetic assessment at the following time points: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28 and 32 hours after administration of study drug. For Treatment B study drug will be administered in the clinic each day after a trough blood sample has been drawn.</brief_summary>
