	<brief_title>Crossover Study to Compare PK of Once Daily LCP-Tacro Tablets to Generic Tacrolimus Capsules Twice Daily.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is open label, prospective, single-center, randomized, two sequence, three period crossover study to compare the steady state pharmacokinetics of once daily dosing of LCP-Tacro tablets to tacrolimus capsules administered twice daily in stable African American kidney transplant patients. Approximately 72 male and female African American renal transplant patients on table immunosuppression regimens will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of two sequences: Sequence 1: (n=36) 18 patients requiring less than 0.15 mg/kg/day and 18 patients requiring equal to or greater than 0.15 mg/kg/day. Patients will continue on generic tacrolimus capsules on days 1-7 (24 hours PK profile on day 7) then patients are switched to LCP-Tacro tablets (at 15% lower dose of twice daily generic tacrolimus) on day 8. Sequence 2: (n=36) 18 patients requiring less than 0.15 mg/kg/day and 18 patients requiring equal to or greater than 0.15 mg/kg/day. Patients will receive LCP-Tacro tablets (at 15% lower dose than generic tacrolimus twice daily formulation) on days 1-7 (24 hour PK profile on day 7) patients are switched back to twice daily generic tacrolimus treatment beginning on day 8.</detailed_description>
