	<brief_title>Coconut Oil in Cardiovascular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The universe of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) has been increasing steadily worldwide. And associated intimately with certain cardiovascular risk factors such as dyslipidemia , decreased HDL-C , hypertension , diabetes mellitus and obesity. The quality of the fat in the diet influences the incidence of obesity and dyslipidemia. A high intake of saturated fat in different populations is associated with elevated serum cholesterol concentration and cardiovascular mortality. However, studies have shown that extra virgin coconut oil (Cocos nucifera L.) despite being characterized by its high content of saturated fat was not associated with obesity and dyslipidemia in populations that had their high consumption . And this is due to the high proportion of medium chain triglycerides , especially lauric acid in proportions ranging from 45-50 % , and the presence of factors antioxidants like vitamin E and polyphenols. Our hypothesis is that extra virgin coconut oil associated with a nutritional treatment has an effect on weight reduction and control of dyslipidemia contributes to control in secondary prevention in patients with coronary artery disease. All participants will be informed about the research and they must sign a consent form . Volunteers will be divided into two groups : a group receiving dietary treatment for 6 months and the other beyond the dietary treatment during the 6 months starts to receive supplementation with coconut oil extra virgin from 3 months, both groups evaluated monthly . At each visit , weight assessment , compliance with diet and blood pressure measurement is performed. In addition , the blood will also be collected for determination of glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol , HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides , apolipoprotein A and B. The results will be analyzed by the statistical program.It is expected that the results obtained, the extra virgin coconut oil can be used as a coupled secondary prevention in patients with coronary artery disease.Our hypothesis is that extra virgin coconut oil associated with nutritional treatment has an effect on weight reduction and control of dyslipidemia contributes to control in secondary prevention in patients with coronary artery disease.</detailed_description>
