	<brief_title>Identifying Characteristic Signature of Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Ritalin Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study we try to identify the signature of brain activity in the EEG of attention deficit disorder (ADHD) patients compared to healthy subjects under different doses of Ritalin (methylphenidate) treatment. All subjects will undergo 1-4 EEG sessions. In each session we will use a different dose of Ritalin or placebo. A detailed neuropsychological tests will be done during the EEG recording. A powerful machine-learning techniques will be used in order to find a specific signature of ADHD and Ritalin treatment in the EEG recording.</detailed_description>
