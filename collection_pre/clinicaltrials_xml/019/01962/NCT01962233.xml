	<brief_title>Umbilical Cord Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Therapy in Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To date,hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy is refractory, including after carbon monoxide poisoning, cardiopulmonary resuscitation,hemorrhagic shock and cerebral infarction etc. We used Mesenchymal Stem Cells via portal vein infusion method to treat hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. With different durations of follow-up, we cleared therapeutic effect, the quality of life and prognostic implications of the cord blood stem cell infusion on hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, and evaluated the adverse reactions, through the neurological function score (NIHSS，Barthel Index), cognitive score (MoCA, MMSE),and the international uniform Parkinson Rating Scale score (UPDRS). Here, we seek new means for the treatment of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, and provide the basis for clinical for further application of umbilical cord blood derived Mesenchymal stem cells. On the basis of conventional therapy, at the same time, selected patients were given by intravenous infusion of umbilical cord blood stem cells 100-800 million. All patients before treatment, after treatment for 15days, 90days and 180 days were evaluated respectively the curative effect. The neurological function score (NIHSS score, Barthel Index) was observed in patients with the ability to live independently and prognosis; MoCA, MMSE were used in the evaluation of cognitive function ；UPDRS was used in the evaluation of extrapyramidal tract function.</detailed_description>
