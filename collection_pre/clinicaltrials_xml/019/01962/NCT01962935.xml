	<criteria>1.Provision of signed and dated, written informed consent prior to any study specific procedures. 2.Healthy male and/or female Caucasian (neither Black/African American nor Japanese) volunteers aged 18 to 50 years with suitable veins for cannulation or repeated venipuncture. ("Healthy" is as determined by medical history and physical examination, clinical laboratory parameters, and ECG and performed before first dose administration.). 3.Healthy volunteers should have a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m2 (inclusive) and weigh at least 50 kg and no more than 100 kg (inclusive). 1. Pyrexial with a body temperature higher than 37.7Â°C at Day 1 (Visit 2), or as judged by the investigator. 2. Screening blood neutrophil counts (taken in the morning) not within the laboratory reference range (Visit 1). 3. Other latent or chronic infections (eg, recurrent sinusitis, genital or ocular herpes, urinary tract infection) or at risk of infection (surgery, trauma, or significant infection) in the previous 90 days, or history of skin abscesses within the previous 90 days. 4. Clinically significant lower respiratory tract infection not resolved within 4 weeks prior to screening (Visit 1), as determined by the investigator.</criteria>
