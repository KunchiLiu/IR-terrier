	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical trial is to study an experimental drug called PTP-01 that is being used as an imaging agent to diagnosis pancreatic cancer. Currently, pancreatic cancer is diagnosed using CT or MRI scans which miss small pancreatic cancers, particularly early stage disease. Researchers at the University of Virginia have identified a biomarker for pancreatic cancer called plectin, which is very specific for pancreatic cancer and not other, non-cancerous conditions involving the pancreas. These researchers have also developed PTP-01, an experimental drug that may be used with SPECT imaging to detect pancreatic cancer cells in humans.</brief_summary>
