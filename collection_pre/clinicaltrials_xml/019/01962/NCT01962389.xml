	<brief_title>First in Human Study of Winsor Laser Catheter: A Prospective Registry to Evaluate The Safety and Performance of the Winsor Laser Catheter in the Treatment of In-Stent Restenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. Patient age â‰¥ 18 years. 2. Rutherford Category 24. 3. Subject has been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to participate and has signed an Ethics Committee approved informed consent form. 4. Documentation of significant ISR defined as &gt;50% stenosis and &gt;5 cm in length determined by diagnostic angiogram or duplex ultrasound. 5. A previously deployed bare nitinol stent(s) in the femoropopliteal segment extending from the ostium of the SFA to 1 cm above the tibioperoneal trunk. A guidewire has successfully traversed the target treatment segment, or is able to cross using standard support catheter crossing techniques, is angiographically documented to be within true lumen and not placed through stent struts. Guidewire access may obtained via contralateral, ipsilateral or retrograde approach. If a retrograde guidewire approach is used to cross the target lesion, guidewire exchange and an antegrade approach is required prior to treatment with the Winsor Laser Catheter. 6. One or more patent tibial vessel(s) defined as &lt;50% stenosis thoughout the segment with outflow to the foot. 7. Successful treatment of any inflow lesion(s) defined as final residual stenosis &lt;30%. 1. Patient is pregnant. 2. Has known uncontrollable hypercoagulable condition, or refuses blood transfusion. 3. Any comorbid condition that in the judgment of the physician precludes safe percutaneous intervention. 4. Crossing devices other than guidewire support catheters. 5. Type 4 or 5 stent fracture as assessed by angiography. 6. Target lesion is located within a covered stent. 7. Acute limb ischemia</criteria>
