	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of using a reduced-intensity condition regimen with UCBT, double cord UCBT, matched unrelated donor (MUD) bone marrow transplant (BMT) or peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) in patients with non-malignant disorders that are amenable to treatment with HSCT. After transplant, subjects will be followed for late effects and for ongoing graft success.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reduced Intensity Conditioning in Patients Aged ≤35 With Non-Malignant Disorders Undergoing UCBT, BMT, or PBSCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative therapy for many pediatric malignant and non-malignant disorders (NMD), the latter of which includes primary immunodeficiencies (PID), hemoglobinopathies, inherited metabolic disorders, and bone marrow failure syndromes. These NMD often have significant morbidity and risk for premature mortality, and HSCT can be curative by either replacement of defective hematopoietic cells with healthy donor cells or by the production of deficient enzyme by donor cells. HSCT in patients with NMD differs from that in malignant disorders for two important reasons- first, that these patients are typically naïve to chemotherapy and immunosuppression potentially leading to difficulties with engraftment, and second, that in the absence of malignancy, reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) with subsequent bone marrow chimerism may be curative and result in decreased transplant-related mortality (TRM). In this research study, instead of using the standard myeloablative conditioning, the study doctor is using reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC), in which lower doses of chemotherapy will be used. Although the lower doses may not eradicate every single stem cell in the bone marrow, nevertheless in the presented combination it still intends to eliminate already formed immune cells, paving the way to successful engraftment of donor cord blood cells. Engrafting cord blood cells can outcompete and reject the patients' few surviving stem cells. With reduced-intensity conditioning, the side effects on brain, heart, lung, liver, and other organ functions are usually less severe, and the patients can have a better long-term recovery. There is also realistic hope that after lower doses of chemotherapy many patients will avoid becoming sterile. The purpose of this study is to collect data from the patients undergoing reduced-intensity conditioning before HSCT, so that the study doctor can compare it to the standard myeloablative conditioning with the expectation that there will be full therapeutic benefits paired with better survival rate and improved quality of life following the reduced intensity approach compared to myeloablative regimen. The subjects will be stratified according to type of primary disease and degree of immune competence each of the three strata will use a different amount of alemtuzumab prior to transplant. Male and female subjects aged 2 months to 35 years (inclusive) who meet all of the eligibility criteria will be considered for this study. Non-malignant disease populations amenable to stem cell treatment, listed in the eligibility section, will be considered appropriate for this study. A full list of eligibility criteria appears later in this record.</detailed_description>
