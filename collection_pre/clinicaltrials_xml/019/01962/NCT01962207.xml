	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term antibody persistence 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 years after receiving a primary vaccination of meningococcal conjugate vaccine MenACWY-TT versus Meningitec™ or Mencevax™ ACWY, and the safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of MenACWY-TT administered 10 years after the primary vaccination. All subjects received a primary vaccination at 1 to 10 years of age in study 108658 (NCT00427908). No new subjects will be enrolled in this booster study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Evaluate the Antibody Persistence 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 Years After Administration of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' MenACWY-TT Vaccine (GSK134612) Versus Meningitec or Mencevax ACWY as Well as Safety and Immunogenicity of a Booster Dose of MenACWY-TT Vaccine 10 Years Post Primary Vaccination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study aims to evaluate the antibody persistence post primary vaccination with active control, safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose uncontrolled post primary vaccination during different phases: Persistence phase: Long-term persistence 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 years after primary vaccination with MenACWY-TT or Meningitec or Mencevax ACWY, in study MenACWY-TT-027. Booster phase: One month post booster vaccination with MenACWY-TT vaccine ten years after primary vaccination. The subjects in this study will be allocated to the same groups as in the vaccination study MenACWY-TT-027 (NCT00427908).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects and/or subjects' parent(s)/Legally Acceptable Representative(s) (LARs) who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. A male or female who has received a primary vaccination with the MenACWYTT, Meningitec or Mencevax ACWY vaccines in study MenACWYTT027 (NCT00427908). In alignment with local laws and regulations, written informed consent obtained from parents/LAR(s) of the subject and written informed assent obtained from the subject if the subject is less than 15 years of age, or written informed consent obtained from the subject if the subject has achieved the 15th birthday. The subjects ≥15 years of age at the time of enrollment will sign the informed consent form, even if the parent/ LAR previously signed the ICF before the subject reached the legal age of consent. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and historydirected physical examination before entering into the study. All subjects must satisfy the following additional criteria prior to entry of the booster phase: Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential may be enrolled in the study. Nonchildbearing potential is defined as premenarche, current tubal ligation, hysterectomy or ovariectomy. Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject: has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series. Child in care. Previous vaccination with meningococcal polysaccharide or conjugate vaccine outside of study MenACWYTT027. Note: Subjects who were revaccinated with a monovalent MenC conjugate vaccine because of suboptimal response during the persistence phase of the MenACWYTT027 study (i.e. MenACWYTT028, 029, 030, 031 and 032) are allowed to participate as they will be followed for the persistence of MenA, MenW135 and MenY. History of meningococcal disease due to serogroup A, C, W135 or Y. Previous vaccination with meningococcal B vaccine. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition (congenital or secondary), including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required). Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness. History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse. Subjects who withdrew consent to be contacted for followup studies. Additional exclusion criteria for booster phase at Month 126 study entry (to be checked at Month 126) for all subjects: Use of any investigational or nonregistered product other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the booster dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the followup period. Administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol in the period starting 30 days before the booster dose of study vaccine or planned administration within 30 days after vaccination, with the exception of a licensed inactivated influenza vaccine. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the booster vaccine dose . Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the booster vaccination or planned administration during the followup period. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational vaccine/product . History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccines. History of any neurological disorders or seizures, including GuillainBarré syndrome (GBS). History of a simple, single febrile seizure is permitted. Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrollment. Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C for oral, axillary, tympanic, or ≥38.0°C for rectal route. The preferred route for recording temperature in this study will be oral. Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever may, be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator. Pregnant or lactating female. Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions.</criteria>
