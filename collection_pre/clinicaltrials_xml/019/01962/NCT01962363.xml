	<brief_title>EPI-743 in Friedreich's Ataxia Point Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether treatment with EPI-743 has a discernible impact on visual functionâ€”including visual acuity, visual fields and color vision as well as on any of a number of functional and subject/clinician-rated scales relevant in the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia, and to determine the safety of treatment with EPI-743.</detailed_description>
