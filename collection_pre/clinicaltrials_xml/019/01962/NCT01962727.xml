	<brief_summary>Study Design: Clinical measurement (cross-sectional) Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the reliability and validity of the novel scapular dyskinesis classification test. Background: A visual-based clinical assessment with sufficient reliability and validity to identify scapular dyskinesis provides information for rehabilitation treatment. Methods: A visual-based palpation method was evaluated by two independent physiotherapists in 60 subjects with unilateral shoulder pain to test reliability. This method classified the scapular movements during arm raising/lowing movements in scapular plane as single abnormal scapular patterns (inferior angle/ medial border/ superior border of scapula prominence and abnormal scapulohumeral rhythm) or mixed abnormal scapular patterns. Different patterns of scapular dyskinesis were also validated by corresponding alternation of the scapular kinematics and muscular activities assessed by electromagnetic motion-capturing system and surface electromyography (EMG).</brief_summary>
