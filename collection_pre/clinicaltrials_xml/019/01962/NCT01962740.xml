	<brief_summary>The study is proposed as a 48-patient randomized-controlled pilot study that will use Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging to compare stent strut coverage and malapposition of three second-generation Drug Eluting Stents (DES) [Xience EES (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA), Resolute Integrity ZES (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) and Promus Element EES (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA)] at 6 weeks post implantation. Study Hypothesis is that the rates of stent strut coverage and malapposition of the Xience EES, Promus EES and will be similar to each other and improved (higher rates of stent strut coverage and lower rates of malapposition) compared to the Resolute ZES at 6 weeks post-implantation.</brief_summary>
