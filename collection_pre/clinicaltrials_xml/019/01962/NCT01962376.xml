	<brief_summary>The investigators assessed whether the addition of a preoperative regimen of Bevacizumab regimen to improves R0 resection rate and survival among patients with potentially resectable gastric cancer with liver metastasis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative Chemotherapy With Bevacizumab For Potentially Resectable Gastric Cancer With Liver Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Groups 1:Capecitabine Plus Oxaliplatin With Bevacizumab in Patients With Potentially Resectable Gastric Cancer With Liver Metastasis. Groups 2:Capecitabine Plus Oxaliplatin With placebo in Patients With Potentially Resectable Gastric Cancer With Liver Metastasis. Group 1 compare with Group 2 in disease-free survival time. Stage I：Preoperative therapy Capecitabine Plus Oxaliplatin With Bevacizumab is superior to Capecitabine Plus Oxaliplatin alines. Stage II: therapy after surgery Capecitabine Plus Oxaliplatin With Bevacizumab is superior to Capecitabine Plus Oxaliplatin alones after surgery for over 6 months in all.</detailed_description>
