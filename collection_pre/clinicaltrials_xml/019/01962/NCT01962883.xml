	<brief_summary>The proposed study is a randomized clinical trial with the purpose of determining the efficacy of osteopathic treatment on vestibular symptoms of the post concussed vestibular disturbed athlete as determined by the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS). Of secondary interest, this study will evaluate the osteopathic assessment findings of this population and side effects, positive and negative, associated with the osteopathic treatment provided. Primary Hypothesis 1. Osteopathic treatment will have no effect on the symptoms of dizziness of the vestibular disturbed post concussed athlete using the Dizziness Handicap Inventory 2. Osteopathic treatment will have no effect on the balance recovery of the vestibular disturbed post concussed athlete using Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) Secondary Hypothesis 3. To determine the side effects of osteopathic treatment of the vestibular disturbed post concussed athlete</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The proposed study is a randomized clinical trial with the purpose of determining the efficacy of osteopathic treatment on vestibular symptoms of the post concussed vestibular disturbed athlete as determined by the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS). Of secondary interest, this study will evaluate the osteopathic assessment findings of this population and side effects, positive and negative, associated with the osteopathic treatment provided. The study will focus on Athletes between the ages of 18-40 who have received a concussion and continue to suffer the sequela of symptoms, including vestibular disturbances, a minimum of 1-month and maximum of 1-year post concussion. A sports medicine physician will screen potential participants for inclusion and exclusion criteria and referred to the project as appropriate. All subjects will receive an initial osteopathic evaluation and baseline BESS and DHI. There will be a total of 7 balance tests performed each week for the first 5 weeks and then the final at the 8-week mark. Dizziness inventories will be completed daily for the duration of the 8-week project. The control group will receive the standard of care, rest, whereas the experimental group will receive four osteopathic treatments in addition to rest. The experimental group, in addition to completing BESS testing and DHI forms will also account for any side effects associated with osteopathic treatments daily following treatments.</detailed_description>
