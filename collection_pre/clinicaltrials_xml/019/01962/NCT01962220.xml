	<brief_summary>Linking HIV-infected pregnant women into prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) services and keeping them in care is important in ensuring that both mother and infant beneﬁt from interventions that improve maternal health and decrease HIV transmission to infants. We propose an evaluation of strategies to link newly diagnosed HIV-infected women to care and keep them in care during pregnancy and after delivery in our study called MIR4HEALTH. The study will be conducted in Nyanza Province, Kenya. All participants will provide informed consent and will be randomized to receive the intervention, including individualized patient education, adherence support and phone call/Short Message Service (SMS) reminders for clinic appointments, or the standard of care (no additional intervention services).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mother Infant Retention for Health: MIR4Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mother Infant Retention for Health (MIR4HEALTH) is an innovative implementation science study focused on testing an effective multicomponent strategy to improve linkage and retention of newly identified HIV‐infected pregnant women accessing maternal child health (MCH) services in Nyanza Province, Kenya. MIR4HEALTH is distinguished by several innovations including the recognition that newly identified HIV-infected pregnant woman are especially vulnerable to poor retention within PMTCT services and that both mother and child must be retained in care to ensure optimal health outcomes. The study is a randomized trial to compare the effectiveness of a novel strategy using Active Patient Follow-Up (APFU) to the current standard of care (SOC) routinely provided for the retention of women and their exposed infants postpartum. The proposed APFU includes a package of evidence-based interventions including health education, provision of phone and short message service (SMS) appointment reminders, active tracking of patients for linkage and retention, and individualized retention and adherence support. Patients enrolled in the APFU intervention arm will complete three antenatal study visits after enrollment as well as two postnatal study visits with their infants at 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum. Laboratory blood specimens will be collected from mothers and infants at two separate visits to assess viral load and and drug levels. Additionally, all staff will be offered a chance to participate in an interview assessing the feasibility and acceptability of APFU. Study participants will be recruited from various clinics in the Nyanza Province in Kenya. This study will enroll pregnant women who test positive for HIV during their first antenatal visit and have no prior HIV diagnosis. Upon live birth, the infants of participating women will also be included in the study. The study will enroll 214 newly-infected pregnant women, with 107 participants in the APFU arm (intervention) and 107 participants in the SOC arm. Infants born to women enrolled in the study will also be included so there will be a total of 214 mother-infant pairs, totaling 428 participants.</detailed_description>
