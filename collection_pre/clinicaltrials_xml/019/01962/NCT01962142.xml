	<brief_summary>Limitation of activity is one of the main item used by composites scores designed to assess the level of asthma control. Since this item is systematically subjectively assessed by the patient, the investigators would like to know if these subjective data are correlated with objective data. Aims of this study are: 1) To describe what means "limitation of activity" for asthma patients and how they deal with; 2) To describe the objective exercise capacity and characteristics of daily activity in two situations (on exacerbation, out of an exacerbation).</brief_summary>
