	<brief_summary>This study is a 12-week randomized-controlled trial of memantine hydrochloride (Namenda) for the treatment for social impairment in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The investigators will also conduct pre- and post-treatment neuroimaging (fMRI and HMRS) to assess neural functional deficits in adolescents with ASD compared to healthy volunteer adolescents and to assess any effects of memantine therapy on neural function in adolescents with ASD. The investigators hypothesize that short-term memantine monotherapy will be safe, well-tolerated, and effective in improving the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder in adolescents with ASD. Additionally, the investigators hypothesize that following memantine therapy, ASD subjects will exhibit a decrease in glutamate (Glu) concentration in the anterior-cingulate cortex (ACC) and a change towards normalization in altered functional connectivity of the ACC and medial temporal lobes, consistent with improvement in social impairments in ASD. The investigators hypothesize that compared to healthy volunteer subjects, ASD subjects will significantly differ on neuroimaging measures at baseline but that following memantine therapy, the difference between ASD and healthy volunteer neuroimaging data will decrease.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria (all participants) 1. Male &amp; female subjects ages 817 years (inclusive). Participants with ASD 3. DSM5 ASD diagnostic criteria as established by clinical diagnostic interview 4. At least moderate severity of social impairment as measured by a total raw score of ≥85 on the parent/guardiancompleted Social Responsiveness ScaleSecond Edition (SRS2) and a score of ≥4 on the clinicianadministered Clinical Global ImpressionSeverity scale (CGIS). Healthy Control Participants 3. Age, sex, &amp; IQmatched. 4. No Axis I diagnoses as established by the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia—Epidemiological Version (KSADSE) &amp; confirmed by clinical diagnostic interview. 5.

Subjects currently treated with the following medications (known to impact glutamate levels): 1. Lamotrigine 2. Amantadine 3. Nacetylcysteine 4. Dcycloserine 4. Subjects treated with a psychotropic medication not listed above on a dose that has not been stable for at least 4 weeks prior to study baseline. 5. Coadministration of drugs that compete with memantine for renal elimination using the same renal cationic system, including hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, metformin, cimetidine, ranitidine, quinidine, and nicotine 6. Initiation of a new psychosocial intervention within 30 days prior to randomization. 7. Contraindications to MR scanning (claustrophobia, braces, metal in the body, etc.) 8. Subjects who are pregnant and/or nursing. 9. Subjects with a history of nonfebrile seizures without a clear and resolved etiology. 10. Subjects with a history of or a current liver or kidney disease. 11. Clinically unstable psychiatric conditions or judged to be at serious suicidal risk. 12. History of substance use (except caffeine) within past 3 months 13. Serious, stable or unstable systemic illness including hepatic, renal, gastroenterological, respiratory, cardiovascular (including ischemic heart disease), endocrinologic, neurologic, immunologic, or hematologic disease. 14. Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (LFTs &gt; 3 times ULN). 15. Subjects with genitourinary conditions that raise urine pH (e.g., renal tubular acidosis, severe infection of the urinary tract). 16. Known hypersensitivity to memantine. 17. Severe allergies or multiple adverse drug reactions. 18. A nonresponder or history of intolerance to memantine, after treatment at adequate doses as determined by the clinician. 19. Investigator and his/her immediate family defined as the investigator's spouse, parent, child, grandparent, or grandchild.</criteria>
