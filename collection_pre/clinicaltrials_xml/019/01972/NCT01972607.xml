	<brief_summary>This study has been designed in order to know the effect of 12 weeks of aerobic exercise training for migraine prevention. We hypothesized that the exercise training could reduce the number of days with migraine and the number of attacks per month in the treated group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Aerobic Exercise Training for Migraine Prevention.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will cover 20 weeks. The first 8 weeks has been designed as "baseline" period, to assess the migraine status and classification, colect blood exam, perform a cardiopulmonary exercise test to determine the maximal oxygen uptake, and fill psychometric questionnaires. The remaining 12 weeks will be the "intervention" period, where participants after randomization will be allocated to perform an aerobic exercise training (on treadmill) performed on a 3 times per week-based program of 40-min duration each session, or will wait for the equal period to repeat all the assessments, then begin the same exercise protocol.</detailed_description>
