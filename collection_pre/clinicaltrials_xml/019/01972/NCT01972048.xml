	<brief_summary>Korean American (KA) women have among the highest breast cancer mortality rates and lowest breast cancer screening rates of U.S. American women across racial/ethical groups. This innovative project seeks to harness mobile phone technology as a means to take preventative health care to a new level among this population. Using the Fogg Behavioral Model this study proposes to develop a mobile phone-based intervention designed to motivate KA women to undergo an annual mammogram (mMammogram). The overall study aim is to develop and assess the feasibility and effectiveness of a 7-day long mMammogram intervention designed to persuade KA women to undergo breast cancer screening.</brief_summary>
