	<brief_title>Foot/Hand Neuromodulation for Overactive Bladder (OAB)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Foot neuromodulation is designed to treat OAB conditions by electrically stimulating the somatic afferent nerves in the foot using skin surface electrodes. The foot stimulation is non-invasive, can be performed at home, and has no adverse effects. Foot neuromodulation therapy will likely be accepted by more patients and have the potential to make a broader impact on the improvement of OAB conditions.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Urinary Bladder, Overactive</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. 18 year old men and women and older 2. Currently having overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms, i.e. urgency, frequency, or incontinence 3. No evidence of neurological disorder or urinary tract infection, i.e. clinically diagnosed as idiopathic OAB 1. Pregnant women in their late pregnancy phase will be excluded because the increasing size of the baby/uterus may cause overactive bladder. 2. Patients with implanted electrical stimulators such as pacemaker will be excluded for potential interference with the TENS stimulator. 3. Patients who are allergic to Cipro or Bactrim will be excluded from the CMG study.</criteria>
