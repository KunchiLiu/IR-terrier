	<brief_summary>1. Women with operable breast cancer with a 2-8 week preoperative waiting period will accept preoperative therapy trials and specifically taking a standard drug for breast cancer such as anastrozole in this study 2. Short term anastrozole treatment will induce measurable changes in biomarker levels (ER, PR, Her2, Ki67) within the tumor. 3. Degree of response to short term anastrozole varies with a) duration of treatment and b) breast cancer subtype (based on initial pre-treatment biomarker status)</brief_summary>
