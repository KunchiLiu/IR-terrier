	<brief_summary>This study is to test the use of simulation training to improve 9-1-1 telecommunicators' call processing and response. Training sessions will expose 9-1-1 telecommunicators to several realistic emergency situations through mock 9-1-1 calls with a trained actor playing the part of a reporting party, followed immediately by feedback on call handling provided by a trained call observer. Investigators hypothesize that simulation followed by trained observer-directed feedback will increase correct triage of medical emergency and delivery of pre-arrival instructions during simulated calls and in actual 9-1-1 calls.</brief_summary>
