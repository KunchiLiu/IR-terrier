	<brief_summary>The undercarboxylated fractions of the two vitamin K-dependent proteins osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein have been shown to play key roles in type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (at least in mouse models). Clinical trials are needed to isolate the effects of vitamin K manipulation on carboxylation of these two proteins (osteocalcin and matrix GLA protein) and their subsequent effects on markers of diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk. The purpose of this pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in children is to estimate the effective dose of vitamin K2 (menaquinone-7) supplementation (to improve carboxylation of both osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein), and whether it can have an effect on markers associated with diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk.</brief_summary>
