	<brief_summary>The WATCHMAN LAA Closure Technology is designed to prevent embolization of thrombi that may form in the LAA, thereby preventing the occurrence of ischemic stroke and systemic thromboembolism. The objectives of this observational, prospective, non-randomized multicenter study are (1) to compile real-world clinical outcomes data for WATCHMAN LAA (left atrial appendage) Close Technology in patients who are implanted with the WATCHMAN device in a commercial clinical setting and (2) to collect real-world usage data that may be needed for reimbursement of WATCHMAN technology in certain countries.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Approximately 1000 subjects will be enrolled in the study. To reduce the impact of individual center bias, each site may include up to 45 subjects and each country may include a maximum of 500 patients. Up to 70 sites (international, outside of US) will participate in the study. Primary analyses may include, but will not be limited to, the following: procedural complications, incidence of stroke and death. Descriptive statistics will be used for baseline, procedure and follow-up data collected through the study. Each patient will be followed for a period of two years after enrollment according to the schedule and standard practice at the enrolling centers. There will be no additional visits, nor procedures, for subjects who participate in the study. Subjects are expected to be followed at implant, then at one post-implant visit (typically between 1-3 months of implant), and then annually through 2 years post implant. An intermediate visit may be scheduled in a number of patients, per physician discretion. In order to reliably capture patient status at study end, a follow-up window of 24 +/- 3 months will be considered acceptable for scheduling the last visit. For subjects who are not scheduled to visit the clinic for a follow-up, a subject contact (e.g. phone call) will ensure capture of the endpoint related information; however, it is recommended to perform an in-office visit for at least the first annual visit. Enrollment is expected to be completed in 21 months; therefore, the total study duration is estimated to be 48 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients who are eligible for a WATCHMAN device according to current international and local guidelines (and future revisions) and per physician discretion; Patient who are willing and capable of providing informed consent, participating in all testing associated with this clinical investigation at an approved clinical investigational center; Patients whose age is 18 years or above, or of legal age to give informed consent specific to state and national law. Patient who are currently enrolled in another investigational study or registry that would directly interfere with the current study, except when the patient is participating in a mandatory governmental registry, or a purely observational registry with no associated treatments. Each instance should be brought to the attention of the sponsor to determine eligibility; Women of childbearing potential who are, or plan to become, pregnant during the time of the study (method of assessment upon physician's discretion); The subject is unable or not willing to complete followup visits and examination for the duration of the study.</criteria>
