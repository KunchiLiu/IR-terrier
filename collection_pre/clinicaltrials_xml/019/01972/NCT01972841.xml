	<criteria>Subject is willing and able to complete the micturition diary and questionnaires correctly and able to measure his/her vital signs at home at stipulated time points, using the device provided by the study personnel, and to adequately record the readings; Subject has symptoms of "wet" OAB (urinary frequency and urgency with incontinence) for at least 3 months; Subject has significant PVR volume (&gt; 150 mL); Subject has a neurological cause for detrusor overactivity (e.g. neurogenic bladder, diabetic neuropathy with autonomic component or bladder involvement, or systemic or central neurological disease such as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease with autonomic component or bladder involvement). An autonomic component can be inferred when autonomic functions are affected, including heart rate, blood pressure, perspiration and digestion. Subject has an indwelling catheter or practices intermittent self catheterization. Subject has chronic inflammation such as bladder pain syndrome /interstitial cystitis, symptomatic bladder stones or any previous or current radiation cystitis. Subject has received intravesical treatment in the past 12 months with e.g., botulinum toxin, resiniferatoxin, capsaicin. Subject has moderate to severe hepatic impairment Subject has severe renal impairment Subject has a clinically significant abnormal ECG Subject has a concurrent malignancy or history of cancer (except noninvasive skin cancer) within the last 5 years prior to screening. Subject has an average QTcF interval &gt; 450 ms for males or &gt; 470 ms for females based on the triplicate ECGs completed at Screening or is at risk of QT prolongation (e.g., family history of long QT syndrome, hypokalaemia). Subject has severe hypertension, which is defined as a sitting average systolic blood pressure ≥ 180 mmHg and/or average diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mmHg.</criteria>
