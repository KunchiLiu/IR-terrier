	<brief_summary>ZYD1 is a novel GLP-1 receptor agonist. The ZYD1 exhibits increased stability to proteolytic cleavage, especially against dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-IV). ZYD1 is a potent antidiabetic agent without gastrointestinal side-effects. A first in human (FIH) Phase I study intends to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ZYD1 in normal healthy adult volunteers.</brief_summary>
