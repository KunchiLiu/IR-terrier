	<detailed_description>The anal fistula is a granulation tissue-lined tract, we thought of a way to ablate this granulation tissue using a chemical agent, which would eventually induce healing with fibrosis and closure of the tract without any surgical intervention. Aiming to reduce the surgery related complications; we investigated the effectiveness of silver nitrate solution as a chemical agent in the treatment of anal fistula.</detailed_description>
