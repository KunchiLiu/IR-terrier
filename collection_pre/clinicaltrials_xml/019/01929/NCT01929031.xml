	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of a combination product containing ibuprofen 400 mg and caffeine 100 mg versus either ingredient alone as well as placebo for the treatment of post-surgical dental pain over an eight-hour period followed by a single dose of study medication (study stage 1). A secondary objective is to evaluate efficacy of multiple doses of the combination in comparison to ibuprofen alone over a 5-day post-surgical period (study stage 2).</brief_summary>

The two mandibular third molars may be partial bony impactions or full bony impactions (as long as the trauma rating is not severe and the surgeons do not feel the subject will have extreme postsurgical pain) OR there may be a combination of one full bony impaction with the second mandibular being a soft tissue impaction or partial bony impaction. Maxillary third molars (or supernumerary teeth) of any type can be extracted; Use of only the following preoperative medication(s)/ anesthetic(s): topical benzocaine, shortacting local anesthetic (mepivacaine or lidocaine) with or without vasoconstrictor and/or nitrous oxide; Reliable, cooperative, and of adequate intelligence to record the requested information on the analgesic questionnaire form; Examined by the attending oral surgeon or physician and medically cleared to participate in the study; Scheduled to undergo a qualifying surgical procedure; In good general health, with a BMI of 30 or less, and have no contraindications to any of the study medications or anesthetic drugs; Subjects have at least a categorical pain score of moderate and a numerical rating scale (NRS) score of 5 or greater within 4.5 hours from the time of the last suture. Exclusion criteria: Presence of a serious medical condition (e.g., poorly controlled hypertension, poorly controlled diabetes, significantly impaired cardiac, renal or hepatic function, hyper or hypothyroidism); Use of a prescription or nonprescription drug with which the administration of ibuprofen or any other non steroidal anti inflammatory or caffeine is contraindicated; Acute local infection at the time of surgery that could confound the postsurgical evaluation; Females who are pregnant, lactating, of childbearing potential, or postmenopausal for less than 2 years and not using a medically approved method of contraception (i.e., oral, transdermal, intravaginal or implanted contraceptives, intrauterine device, diaphragm, condom, abstinence, or surgical sterility), or females who test positive on a urinebased pregnancy test; Presence or history (within 2 years of enrollment) of bleeding disorder(s) or peptic ulcer disease; History of alcoholism or substance abuse within the last year, or is currently abusing alcohol or other moodaltering drugs (e.g., cannabis). Subjects who are taking central nervous system or other psychotropic drugs (including St. Johns Wort, or any other nutritional supplement known to have psychotropic effects) may be enrolled if they have been on stable doses of medication for at least 2 months, will maintain this dose throughout the study, and their condition is judged by the Principal Investigator to be wellcontrolled; Habituation to analgesic drugs or caffeine (i.e., routine use of oral analgesics 5 or more times per week or ingestion of 4 or more caffeinecontaining drinks daily); use of "high energy" drinks more than once per week; Use of any type of systemic corticosteroid within the past 30 days or a history of current or previous use of anabolic steroids; History of allergic reaction (e.g., asthma, rhinitis, swelling, shock, or hives) to acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin, celecoxib, or any other non steroidal anti inflammatory or caffeine; Prior use of any type of analgesic or non steroidal anti inflammatory within 5 halflives of that drug before surgery, except for preanesthetic medication and anesthesia for the procedure; Ingestion of any caffeinecontaining beverages, chocolate, or alcohol 6 hours or less before surgery; Has impaired liver function, e.g., serum Alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, or Gammaglutamyltransferase greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal, or blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, or bilirubin greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal without a known benign explanation; Has known history of a positive HIV antibody test or known HIV infection; Has a known history of Hepatitis B or C; Has a clinically significant abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) at screening as determined by the Investigator: Has taken an investigational product within the past 30 days; Has previously been entered into this study; The subject is a member of the study site staff either directly involved with the study, an employee of the Sponsor, or a relative of study site personnel directly involved with the study or Sponsor.</criteria>
