	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the relative bioavailability of ASP015K under fasting conditions after single-dose administration between a test-tablet formulation and a reference-tablet formulation. This study will also evaluate the food effect on bioavailability of the test formulation, and evaluate the safety and tolerability after single-dose administration of the test- and reference-tablet formulations.</brief_summary>
