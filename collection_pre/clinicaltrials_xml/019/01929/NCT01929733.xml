	<brief_summary>Percutaneous closure is one of the methods used to treat, among other congenital heart disorder, Persistent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) in children and adults. During the years 1998-2013 four hundred and fifty patients were catheterized in the department of pediatric cardiology and congenital heart diseases in Rambam health care campus, using various devices. In this retrospective research, the investigators analyze data from patients' medical files, to estimate and define the correlation between the patients' demographic and morphologic data to the type and size of chosen closure device. Aim of study: To create an algorithm that can be used to choose the proper device for percutaneous closure of the PDA, based on the characteristics of the patient and the PDA type.</brief_summary>
