	<brief_summary>Aim: Patient Perception: This aim broadly intends to use traditional script versus a brief video education vignette to determine understanding and preferences among general emergency department patients of rescue access techniques. A challenge of emergency care is providing patient education surrounding procedures in a standardized and patient-oriented manner. This data would provide insight on a patient's understanding of the risks and benefits of rescue access, assess patient preference, and potentially influence what rescue technique is employed in the future. This information may also give us insight onto why DIVA patients might refuse randomization.</brief_summary>
