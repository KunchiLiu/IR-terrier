	<brief_summary>The specific aim of this study is to test whether oxytocin (OT) boosts the positive emotion yield of a new wellness behavior (Lovingkindness meditation or Mindfulness meditation) and thereby increases nonconscious motives that shape daily behavioral decisions to repeat it, which in turn foster positive emotions that further augment nonconscious motives in an upward spiral dynamic. The proposed research targets three hypotheses: (1) Oxytocin manipulation magnifies (i.e., moderates) the positive emotion yield of Lovingkindness meditation; (2) The positive emotion yield of meditation, which varies by experimental condition, increases the nonconscious incentive salience of Wellness Behavior-related cues; and (3) Behavioral decisions predict positive emotions, sparking the relationships among OT manipulation, positive emotion yield, and nonconscious incentive salience of Wellness Behavior-related cues.</brief_summary>
