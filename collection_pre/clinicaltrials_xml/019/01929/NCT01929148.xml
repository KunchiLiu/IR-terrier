	<brief_summary>We already demonstrated that the addiction of PBS to Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (TLH) has no negative effects in term of ovarian function, evaluated by anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Antral Follicle Count (AFC), mean ovarian diameters and Peak Systolic Velocity (PSV). In addition, in our experience, no negative surgical outcomes (in terms of operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative hospital stay, postoperative return to normal activity and complication rate) are related to PBS step in TLH. Although the good statistical reliability of our retrospective data, we want to prospectively confirm our results. Moreover we aim to refine PBS safety demonstration by collecting also 3D ultrasound parameters [AFC, ovarian volume (OV), Vascularization Index (VI), Flow Index (FI) and Vascularization Flow Index (VFI)]. Hormonal and ultrasonographic parameters may possibly be unified into a new diagnostic algorithm (already at an advanced stage of production in UMG Department) able to estimate the ovarian function both in term of reproductive ability that in term of distance from menopause.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We will enroll the first 77 patients who will agree to implement PBS to laparoscopic myomectomy (LM) (study group), starting from September 1, 2013. Other 77 patients who will ask us to undergo LM without the addiction of PBS will constitute the control group. For each patient, ovarian reserve modification before and after surgery will be recorded as the primary outcome. Specifically, one month before and three months after laparoscopy, on day 1 to 4 of menstrual cycles serum AMH, FSH and E2 will be evaluated and a transvaginal ultrasound examination (Voluson E8 Expert or Voluson-i - GE Healthcare Ultrasound) to assess AFC, OV, VI, FI and VFI, will be carried out by the same experienced ultrasonographist responsible for the ambulatory of ovarian reserve in each Unit. Ovarian reserve modification will be defined as the difference (expressed as Δ) between post-operative and pre-operative values of AMH, FSH, AFC, OV, VI, FI and VFI. For each surgical procedure, moreover, operative time, variation of hemoglobin level, postoperative hospital stay, postoperative return to normal activity and complication rate will be recorded as secondary outcomes.</detailed_description>
