	<brief_title>Postoperative Analgesic Effect Of Dexmedetomidine Administration in Wound Infiltration for Total Abdominal Hysterectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abdominal hysterectomy is associated with moderate to severe postoperative pain, effective analgesia after hysterectomy essential and several techniques are used such as administration of opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and wound infiltration of local anaesthetics. Different local anaesthetics can be used for the wound infiltration techniques.Ifiltration of the surgical wound with bupivacaine following outpatient provides pain relief in the postoperative period , allows the early discharge from the outpatient surgical units.There has been increased interest in administration of analgesic prior to surgical injury. Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist with sedative , anxiolytic, analgesic, sympatholytic and antihypertensive effects.Dexmedetomidine has been used intravenously before initiation of anaesthesia and it has shown to provide some analgesic effect after surgery but there were some adverse hemodynamic effects. Surgical wound administration of dexmedetomidine may be useful to avoid the adverse haemodynamic effects of intravenous administration while still providing the postoperative analgesia.</detailed_description>
