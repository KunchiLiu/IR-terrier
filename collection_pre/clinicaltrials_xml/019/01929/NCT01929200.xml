	<brief_title>Icotinib as Adjuvant Therapy in Treating Non-small-cell Lung Cancer Patients With Positive EGFR Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adjuvant therapy has been proved effective in treating stage II-IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer. However, few data on the treating time of adjuvant therapy is available. Here we conduct a randomized, prospective study to compare the recurrence-free survival after 1-year or 2-year treatment with icotinib in EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer patients.</detailed_description>
