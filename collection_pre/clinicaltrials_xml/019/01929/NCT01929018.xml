	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to examine the feasibility of using a collaborative-care, home-based rehabilitation program to improve functional outcomes for people recovering from lower limb amputation caused by vascular problems and/or diabetes complications. The primary hypothesis is that the rehabilitation program will result in greater improvements in performance-based and participant-reported measures of physical function, compared to standard of care after outpatient rehabilitation.</brief_summary>
