	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate safety, pharmacokinetics, effect of regulatory T cell depletion with Mogamulizumab for advanced or recurrent cancer patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase Ia/Ib Multicenter Trial of Mogamulizumab for Advanced or Recurrent Cancer.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consists of phase Ia and Ib portions for patients with solid tumors. Phase Ia portion is the standard 3+3 dose-escalation design with 0.1mg/kg, 0.5mg/kg and 1.0mg/kg of Mogamulizumab. Phase Ib portion is the randomized study comparing 0.1mg/kg and tolerated dose of Mogamulizumab based on the phase Ia portion to pursue safer and immunologically more efficient dose.</detailed_description>
