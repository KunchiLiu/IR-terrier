	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the response of acne patients and healthy control patients to the P. acnes bacteria. Half a tube of blood will be drawn from all participants to determine whether or not they have antibodies to the P. acnes bacterium. Anywhere from 1 to 4 skin biopsies of acne pimples or normal control skin will be taken from all subjects for further analysis in the lab to determine whether the inflammation in these pimples can be reduced using anti-P.acnes antibodies.</brief_summary>
