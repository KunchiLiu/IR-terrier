	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to prospectively evaluate pregnancy outcomes in women with multiple sclerosis who were exposed to a Registry-specified Biogen Multiple Sclerosis product during the eligibility window for that product. The Registry-specified Biogen MS products being studied are dimethyl fumarate, Pegylated human interferon beta-1a, and Dalclizumab High Yield Process (DAC HYP).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Biogen Multiple Sclerosis Pregnancy Exposure Registry is a prospective, observational registry designed to evaluate pregnancy outcomes in women with multiple sclerosis (MS) who were exposed to a Registry-specified Biogen Multiple Sclerosis product during the eligibility window for that product. Women of childbearing potential are a considerable segment of the patient population affected by MS and are likely to be exposed to a Registry-specified Biogen MS product around the time of conception and during pregnancy. Biogen completed pregnancy registries for Avonex and Tysabri; however, formal studies in pregnant women have not been conducted. Therefore, it is important to evaluate, in a global Pregnancy Registry, how exposure to a marketed Biogen MS product specified in this Pregnancy Registry may affect pregnancy and infant outcomes. Data will be collected on prospective pregnancies (i.e. enrollment prior to knowledge of outcome) at time of enrollment, 6 to 7 months gestation, and approximately 4,12, and 52 weeks after estimated date of delivery. The prevalence of spontaneous abortions, birth defects, and other pregnancy and infant outcomes will be calculated and compared to background rates from external sources such as the European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key Patient consent Patient has a diagnosis of MS. Documentation that the patient was exposed to a Registryspecified Biogen MS product during the eligibility window for that product. DMF: Exposure since the first day of her last menstrual period (LMP) prior to conception or at any time during pregnancy. Peginterferon beta1a: Exposure since 14 days prior to the first day of her LMP prior to conception or at any time during pregnancy. DAC HYP: Exposure since 90 days prior to the first day of her LMP prior to conception or at any time during pregnancy Patient agrees to sign the Release of Medical Information Form, thereby permitting the Registry to contact her health care provider (HCP(s)) and the pediatric HCP for medical information. Key The outcome of the pregnancy (i.e., pregnancy loss or live birth) must not be known at the time of enrollment. NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/ Exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
