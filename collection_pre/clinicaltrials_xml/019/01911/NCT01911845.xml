	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ABT-450/ritonavir/ABT-267 (ABT-450/r/ABT-267; ABT-450 also known as paritaprevir; ABT-267 also known as ombitasvir) and ABT-333 (also known as dasabuvir) coadministered with ribavirin (RBV) in hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1-infected adults taking methadone or buprenorphine ± naloxone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open-label, Single Arm, Phase 2 Study to Evaluate ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333 With Ribavirin (RBV) in Adults With Genotype 1 HCV Infection Taking Methadone or Buprenorphine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consisted of 2 periods: a 12-week treatment period and a 48-week post-treatment period (for all participants who received study drugs). All participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug were to be followed for 48 weeks post-treatment to monitor for safety, HCV RNA, the emergence and/or persistence of resistant viral variants, and assessment of patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments.</detailed_description>
