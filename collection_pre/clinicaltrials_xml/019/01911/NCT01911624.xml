	<brief_summary>Safety and efficacy of direct thrombin inhibitors versus enoxaparin in patients with staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia. The study hypothesizes that inhibition of the coagulase-activity of S. aureus by direct thrombin inhibitors is safe and translates into a better outcome of patients with S. aureus bacteremia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Direct Thrombin Inhibitors Versus LMWH in Staphylococcus Aureus Bacteraemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single center randomized controlled trial of direct thrombin inhibitors versus standard enoxaparin. - Feasibility: proportion of patients eligible for randomization; clinically attained concentration of DTI and resulting staphylothrombin inhibition - Safety: bleeding events (major/ clinically relevant non-major) - Efficacy: thrombotic events during the thromboprophylactic treatment + 3 days - Secondary outcome measures - Coagulation parameters: evolution of D-dimers from day 0-4; other lab parameters of coagulation (PT/APTT/fibrinogen/platelet count) - Inflammatory parameters: CRP, white blood cell count, neutrophilia - Clinical outcomes: metastatic infections, assessed clinically or by PET/CT; relapse of S. aureus bacteremia; defervescence; persistent positive blood cultures; hospital stay, mortality.</detailed_description>
