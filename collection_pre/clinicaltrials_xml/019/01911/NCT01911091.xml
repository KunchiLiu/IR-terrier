	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to collect data to help researchers identify factors, such as certain proteins or genetic codes, that are secreted from muscle that are associated with the beneficial effects of exercise.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identification of Novel Skeletal Muscle-derived Factors That Promote Lipid Oxidation (Columbus)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Objectives: 1. To identify specific changes in messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)/micro ribonucleic acid (miRNA) expression in muscle associated with higher or lower relative measures of mitochondrial capacity and fat oxidation. 2. To identify secreted factors/miRNAs that specifically relate to the metabolic response of muscle and that are present after a single initial bout of exercise. 3. To collect the appropriate clinical samples (muscle and adipose tissue, plasma/serum) to enable validation of myokines associated with changes in oxygen consumption/mitochondrial content via in vivo and in vitro discovery efforts.</detailed_description>
