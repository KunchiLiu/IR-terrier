	<brief_title>Exercise Resistance in Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES/ENDPOINTS 1. The primary endpoint of the study is the maximal capacity for mitochondrial ATP synthesis measured using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). 2. The principal secondary endpoint is the relationship between exercise-induced changes in mitochondrial function in vivo and exercise mimetic-induced changes in mitochondrial function in vitro. 3. The principal tertiary endpoint is the relationship between the basal promoter methylation status of key genes involved in fuel metabolism and known to be activated by exercise in skeletal muscle tissue and cells and the exercise-induced response in mitochondrial function. As exercise has an array of metabolic effects, and we are well positioned with our cutting-edge methodologies here at the Translational Research Institute (TRI), we will also measure whole body insulin sensitivity and metabolic flexibility by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, substrate oxidation and energy expenditure in the whole room calorimeter/metabolic chamber and intramyocellular lipid content.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Type 2 Diabetes Inclusion Criteria (Group 1) Age 30 to 65 years. Male Hispanic or NonHispanic Caucasian Type 2 diabetes determined by selfreport or by a fasting glucose &gt; 126mg/dl POCT HbA1c result is 5.78.8 HbA1c between 6.0% and 8.5%, if a participant misses the screening HbA1c by a small margin (HbA1c ± 0.1%), the HbA1c can be repeated once. Not involved in regular exercise program Willing to exercise every day for the study period If applicable, those currently taking antidiabetic medication are taking metformin, a sulfonylurea, DPP IV inhibitor, alphaglucosidase inhibitor, a meglitinide, colesevelam, cycloset or a SGLT2 inhibitor. Those taking 2 of these medications may proceed. If applicable, willing to cease antidiabetic medication use for the duration of the intervention.
