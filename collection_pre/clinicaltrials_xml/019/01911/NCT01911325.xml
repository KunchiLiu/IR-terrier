	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, open-label Phase Ib dose escalation part followed by a randomized double-blinded placebo controlled Phase II part. The Phase Ib part will determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)/Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of buparlisib in combination with docetaxel. Subsequently the MTD/RP2D will be investigated in a Phase II randomized trial in patients with advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Buparlisib + Docetaxel in Advanced or Metastatic Squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based on an overall review of safety and preliminary efficacy data done on 01-Dec-2014 showing marginal anti-tumor activity and newly emerged treatment options, a decision was taken to stop further development of this combination in patients with advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC and Phase II of the study was not conducted.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient is an adult ≥ 18 years old at the time of informed consent Patient has histologically and/or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous NSCLC. Diagnosis of mixed squamous and nonsquamous or adenosquamous NSCLC will be acceptable for enrollment. Patient has received one prior approved regimen of platinumbased chemotherapy (excluding a docetaxelcontaining regimen) for advanced or metastatic (Stage IIIb or Stage IV) squamous NSCLC, followed by disease progression. A drug provided as maintenance therapy following cytotoxic chemotherapy will be considered to be part of that regimen. Note: Patients who received paclitaxel therapy are eligible for this trial. •Patient has adequate tumor tissue (either archival or new tumor biopsy) for the analysis of PI3Krelated biomarkers. Enrollment in the Phase II part of the study is contingent on the central laboratory confirming receipt of an adequate amount of tissue including sufficient DNA for analysis. •Patient has measurable or nonmeasurable disease according to RECIST version 1.1 criteria. Phase II only: Patient must have at least one measurable lesion as per RECIST criteria. Patient has an ECOG performance status ≤ 1 Patient has adequate bone marrow and organ function Patient has received previous treatment with a PI3K or AKT inhibitor Patient has symptomatic Central Nervous System (CNS) metastases Patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases may participate in this trial. The patient must have completed prior local treatment, if any, for CNS metastases ≥ 28 days prior to the start of study treatment (including radiotherapy and/or surgery, or ≥ 14 days for stereotactic radiosurgery). Patient has a score ≥ 12 on the PHQ9 questionnaire. Patient selects a response of "1, 2 or 3" to question number 9 on the PHQ9 questionnaire regarding potential for suicidal thoughts or ideation (independent of the total score of the PHQ9). Patient has a GAD7 mood scale score ≥ 15. Patient has a medically documented history of or active major depressive episode, bipolar disorder (I or II), obsessivecompulsive disorder, schizophrenia, a history of suicidal attempt or ideation, or homicidal ideation or patients with active severe personality disorders. Patient has ≥ CTCAE grade 3 anxiety</criteria>
