	<brief_summary>This study will examine the efficacy of Botulinum Toxin Type A ("Botox") in treating Allodynic-type neuropathic pain in people with spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis. Neuropathic pain is pain initiated or caused by injury to or disease of the nervous system, and is common in spinal cord injury patients or people with multiple sclerosis. Allodynia is a type of neuropathic pain caused by something that normally would not cause pain, such as light touch, pressure from clothing, or bed sheets brushing against the skin. Botox has been used to treat the muscle overactivity that causes spasticity in spinal cord injured patients. It has been noticed to exert some analgesic(pain relieving) effect, and has recently been studied as a treatment for neuropathic pain. We want to see if Botox, injected intradermally, will relieve the symptoms of allodynic-type neuropathic pain. 24 volunteers are to be enrolled, with 16 receiving active treatment, and 8 "controls" receiving placebo.</brief_summary>
