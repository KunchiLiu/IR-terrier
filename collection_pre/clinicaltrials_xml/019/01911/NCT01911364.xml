	<detailed_description>A 52-WEEK, DOUBLE BLIND, DOUBLE DUMMY, RANDOMIZED, 3-ARM PARALLEL GROUP, ACTIVE CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL OF FIXED COMBINATION OF BECLOMETASONE DIPROPIONATE PLUS FORMOTEROL FUMARATE PLUS GLYCOPYRROLATE BROMIDE ADMINISTERED VIA PMDI (CHF 5993) VERSUS TIOTROPIUM BROMIDE AND VERSUS FIXED COMBINATION OF BECLOMETASONE DIPROPIONATE PLUS FORMOTEROL FUMARATE ADMINISTERED VIA PMDI AND TIOTROPIUM BROMIDE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE A total of 8 clinic visits (V0 to V7) will be performed during the study, as follows: - A pre-screening visit (V0) to obtain the written informed consent from the patient - A screening visit (V1) to establish the eligibility of patients, followed by a 2-week open-label run-in under Tiotropium - After the randomisation (V2), patients will be assessed after 4, 12, 26, 40 and 52 weeks of treatment (V3 to V7) The assessments performed at visits include routine haematology and blood chemistry, medical history, physical examination, a 12-lead ECG, spirometric parameters, vital signs). During the run-in and the randomised treatment periods, patients use an e-diary to record symptoms, rescue medication use and compliance to the study medications daily. AEs/SAEs and COPD exacerbations will be monitored.</detailed_description>
