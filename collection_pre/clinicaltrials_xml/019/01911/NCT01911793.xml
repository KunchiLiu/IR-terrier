	<brief_summary>Postoperative ileus is common after colorectal surgery, occurring in up to 20% of patients. Stomas are frequently created in conjunction with major colorectal surgery. Obstruction at the level of the stoma is a common cause of bowel obstruction or ileus. This is often manifested by decrease or delay in stoma output and is often attributed to edema at the level of the stoma. Thus, a temporary tube (red robinson catheter) is placed into the stoma at bedside, which often relieves the obstruction until the edema at the level of the stoma resolves and stoma function occurs around the temporary tube. At this time, the tube is removed and the stoma continues to function normally. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a stoma tube (red-robinson catheter) placed at the time of stoma creation would reduce the incidence of postoperative ileus in patients undergoing major colorectal surgery with creation of a stoma.</brief_summary>
