	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of the study is to explore whether treatment with PF-03446962 and best supportive care is better than placebo plus best supportive care in prolonging survival of patients affected by recurrent liver cancer. In addition, the study will explore if adding PF-03446962 to best supportive care is safe, how PF-03446962 is metabolized, if there are patients' characteristics (biomarkers) that may predict response to PF-03446962, and if PF-03446962 has any effect on the patients' quality of life.</brief_summary>
