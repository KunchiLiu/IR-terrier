	<brief_summary>This is a phase I, open-label, dose-escalation trial of defactinib (VS-6063), a focal adhesion kinase inhibitor, in Japanese patients with non-hematologic malignancies. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety (including the recommended phase 2 dose), the pharmacokinetics, and the anti-cancer activity of defactinib (VS-6063).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Able to provide signed and dated informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures. Age ≥ 20 years. Subject must be of Japanese descent. Subjects must have a histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of a nonhematologic malignancy. Subjects must have no further standard of care options or have refused standard therapy. All persistent clinically significant toxicities from prior chemotherapy must be ≤ Grade 1. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, measured within 72 hours before the start of treatment. Predicted life expectancy of ≥ 3 months. Adequate renal function [creatinine ≤ 1.5x ULN (upper limit of normal)] or GFR of ≥ 50mL/min. Adequate hepatic function (total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x ULN for the institution; AST [aspartate transaminase] and ALT [alanine transaminase] ≤ 3x ULN, or ≤ 5x ULN if due to liver involvement by tumor). Adequate bone marrow function (hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL; platelets ≥ 100 x109 cells/L; absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5x109 cells/L). Corrected QT interval (QTc) &lt; 470 ms (as calculated by the Fridericia correction formula). Negative pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential. (A woman of childbearing potential is defined as one who is biologically capable of becoming pregnant except for women who have undergone permanent contraceptive surgery or are postmenopausal (defined as the absence of menstruation for at least 12 months without other medical reasons). Men and women of child bearing potential must agree to use adequate birth control throughout their participation in the study and for 90 days following the last study treatment. Willing and able to participate in the trial and comply with all trial requirements. Gastrointestinal (GI) condition which could interfere with the swallowing or absorption of study medication. Uncontrolled or severe concurrent medical condition (including uncontrolled brain metastases). Stable brain metastases either treated or being treated with a stable dose of steroids/ anticonvulsants, with no dose change within 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug, will be allowed. History of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, ulceration, or perforation within 12 months prior to the first dose of study drug. Known history of stroke or cerebrovascular accident within 6 months prior to the first dose of study drug. Subjects with known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) (testing not required). Subjects with known Hepatitis B or C (Including known seropositivity Hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV antibody). Subjects being actively treated for a secondary malignancy. Cancerdirected therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, biologic or immunotherapy, etc.) within 28 days of the first dose of study drug or 5 halflives, whichever is shorter. Major surgery within 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Use of an investigational drug within 28 days or 5 halflives (whichever is shorter) prior to the first dose of study drug. A minimum of 10 days between termination of the investigational drug and administration of the study treatment is required. In addition, any drugrelated toxicity except alopecia should have recovered to grade 1 or less. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Any evidence of serious active infections. Uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease, including myocardial infarct or unstable angina within 6 months prior to study treatment, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II or greater congestive heart failure, serious arrhythmias requiring medication for treatment, clinically significant pericardial disease, or cardiac amyloidosis. Known history of malignant hypertension Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including symptomatic congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.</criteria>
