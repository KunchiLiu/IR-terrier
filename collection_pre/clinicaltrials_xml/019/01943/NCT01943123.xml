	<brief_title>Effect of Probiotic Drink on Number of Salivary Mutans Streptococci in School Going Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Probiotic bacteria are thought to reduce the risk of diseases in oral cavity, namely dental caries. Studies have suggested that oral cavity can benefit immensely from these friendly bacteria, although more clinical trials are needed to establish concrete results. Hence, this study was undertaken as a 6 month clinical trial to assess the effects of probiotic on the most frequent resident of oral micro flora- the mutans streptococci. Method- Design: parallel arm design Sample size: 60 subjects (30 subjects in each group) Duration: 6 months Material used- Intervention/manipulation: 50ml commercially available probiotic drink for one group (30 subjects in study group) and 50 ml of plain, unsweetened and unflavored milk to control group (30 subjects in control group)for a period of 6 months. Indices used: plaque index- Turskey Gilmore-Glikman modification of Quigley-Hein, Plaque Index (1970) Gingival Index-Loe.H and Silness P. gingival index (1963) Both the indices were used twice, at the start of the study, that is, to collect base line data and at the end of the intervention period (6 months)as final data collected. Sample collection: stimulated saliva was collected (5ml) and analyzed for CFU of streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli at the start of the study and after 6 months, at the end of the intervention. Statistical analysis: students t test, fisher exact test and chi-square test were used to compare the baseline data with the final data collected at the end of the intervention.</detailed_description>
