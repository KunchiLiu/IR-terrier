	<brief_title>Novel Auto-continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) Validation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Auto-CPAP devices change therapeutic pressure based on the needs of the patient. Algorithms differ from machine to machine. This single-blind randomised crossover trial aims to compare the efficacy of SPAP (a novel Auto-CPAP algorithm) to conventional CPAP. Up to 50 patients will be recruited from an OSA population, aged over 18. Participants will consist of male and female patients diagnosed with moderate−severe OSA (Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) greater than or equal to 15 per hour. Eligible participants, according to the protocol approved by the Northern X Region Ethics Committee, providing written informed consent will be enrolled into the study. Patients will be enrolled sequentially according to the randomisation list. Patients will be randomised to CPAP or SPAP. The therapeutic pressure will be based on the most recent titration night of each patient. Comparisons between data will be made using a one-tailed t-test for non-inferiority of the SPAP algorithm compared with conventional CPAP therapy.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Sleep Apnea, Obstructive</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Aged ≥18 years with mildtosevere OSA (Apnea Hypopnea Index equal to or greater than 5 per hour). Any medical condition which contraindicates (see Appendix A) the use of CPAP or AutoCPAP. Unstable cardiovascular disease (untreated or resistant hypertension acceptable). Unstable psychiatric disease. Other significant sleep disorder. Inability to tolerate CPAP due to nasal obstruction or claustrophobia, as determined by the investigation investigator. Any known factor or disease that might interfere with treatment compliance, investigation conduct or interpretation of the results such as psychiatric disease, history of non compliance to medical regimens, or unwillingness to comply with investigational requirements.
