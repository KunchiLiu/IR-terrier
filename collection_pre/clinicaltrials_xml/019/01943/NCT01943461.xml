Shortterm administration of steroids (that is, for allergic reactions or the management of immunerelated adverse events [irAE]) is allowed Previous malignant disease within the last 5 years with the exception of adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer, in situ cancer, or other cancer Nononcology vaccine therapies for prevention of infection disease (e.g. seasonal flu vaccine, human papilloma virus vaccine) within 4 weeks of study drug administration. Vaccination while on study is also prohibited except for administration of the inactivated influenza vaccine. Pregnancy or lactation period Known alcohol or drug abuse Clinically significant (that is, active) cardiovascular disease All other significant diseases (for example, inflammatory bowel disease), which, in the opinion of the investigator, might impair the subject's tolerance of trial treatment Any psychiatric condition that would prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed consent Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity Other protocol defined exclusion criteria could apply</criteria>
