	<brief_summary>A study in ADHD and neuro-typical children to assess EVO game play over 29 days.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cognitive ADHD Videogame Exploratory Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A study in children ages 8 to 12 to assess EVO cognitive game play. The study examines two populations, children diagnosed with ADHD (ADHD and not on medication) and neuro-typical children. The investigators plan to evaluate 80 subjects (N = 40 per group) in three site locations over a 29 day study period. The 29 day study period includes 2 in-clinic sessions and 27 days of out-patient game play. During the 27 days of out-patient game play, the subjects will be instructed to play EVO 5 days per week for typically 30 minutes per day The investigators' hypothesis is that EVO will be playable and interesting to ADHD children and cognitive measures, as captured by EVO, will show a difference between ADHD children and age-matched neuro-typical children.</detailed_description>
