	<brief_summary>Imagio is a multi-modality device, comprised of opto-acoustic (OA) imaging co-registered with diagnostic grey-scale (B mode) ultrasound, that has been designed to concurrently collect OA images in conjunction with diagnostic grey-scale (B-mode) ultrasound. Imagio is expected to identify two functional hallmarks of a potential malignancy: the presence of abnormal blood vessels (angiogenesis); and the relative reduction in oxygen content of hemoglobin. The technology is non-invasive and does not require any contrast agent or radio-isotope, which is required for other modalities such as MRI or PET. This is a prospective, single arm, controlled, multi-center, observational study that will compare Imagio versus conventional diagnostic ultrasound (CDU) for the visualization of suspicious masses.</brief_summary>
