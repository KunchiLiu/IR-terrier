	<brief_summary>This is an open-label repeat dose, multicenter, 2-part study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for GSK525762 given once-daily (OD) orally and twice daily (BID) orally. Part 1 of the study is a dose escalation phase to select the recommended Part 2 dose (RP2D) based on the safety, PK, and PD profiles observed after oral administration of GSK525762. Eligible subjects with relapsed refractory hematological malignancies will be enrolled in the OD and/or BID dosing cohorts until a MTD is established. Subjects may continue treatment in the study until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Part 2 will explore clinical activity at the MTD or RP2D; separate expansion cohorts will be planned for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL, including an exploratory sub-cohort of subjects with myc and B-Cell Leukemia (BCL)2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements/overexpression [double- and triple-hit lymphoma]), and multiple myeloma (MM). This is the first study of this agent to be conducted in subjects with these relapsed and/or refractory hematological malignancies for which no standard therapies are anticipated to result in a durable remission.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Dose Escalation Study to Investigate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics (PK), Pharmacodynamics (PD) and Clinical Activity of GSK525762 in Subjects With Relapsed, Refractory Hematologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Inclusion criteria Written informed consent provided. Males and females 18 years old or older. In Part 1, subjects must have relapsed and/or refractory hematologic malignancies (leukemias, myeloproliferative neoplasms, lymphomas, and myelomas) for which no standard therapies are available or anticipated to result in remission. In Part 2, subjects must have AML, MM, or NHL. Subjects with AML (Part 1 and Part 2), are eligible if they • have relapsed and/or refractory disease, OR are&gt;=65 years of age and not candidates for or have refused standard chemotherapy. In Part 2, the NHL cohort will separately enrol subjects with double and triple hit lymphoma, so that a minimum of 10 subjects with this subset of disease will be enrolled. To be eligible for this subcohort, tumor sample from the subject must demonstrate rearrangement and/or overexpression of MYC and either BCL2 and/or BCL6 genes. Evaluation of double or triplehit status may be performed via appropriate local testing, and the determination of double or triplehit diagnosis will be at the discretion of the investigator and GSK Medical Monitor. Subjects with a prior history of stem cell transplant (autologous and/or allogeneic) are allowed if At least 3 months has elapsed from the time of transplant and the subject has recovered from transplantassociated toxicities prior to the first dose of GSK525762, and For subjects with a prior history of allogeneic transplant, the subject has been off systemic immunosuppressive medications (including but not limited to: cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, or corticosteroids) for at least 1 month prior to the first dose of GSK525762. Topical steroids are permitted there are no signs or symptoms of graft versus host disease, other than Grade 1 skin involvement. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of &lt;=1. Subject must be stable enough to be expected to complete dosing through the DLT observation period as assessed by the investigator. Able to swallow and retain orally administered medication and does not have any clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter absorption such as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases, a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 milliInternational units per milliliter and estradiol &lt; 40 picograms per milliliter (&lt; 140 picomole per liter) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods defined in protocol if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least two to four weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method; Childbearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until at least 7 months after the last dose of study medication; Negative serum pregnancy test ≤ 7 days prior to first study drug dose; Female subjects who are lactating must discontinue nursing prior to the first dose of study treatment and must refrain from nursing throughout the treatment period and for 5 halflives of GSK525762 or at least 28 days (whichever is longer) following the last dose of study treatment. Male subjects must agree to use one of the methods of contraception specified. This method must be used from the time of the first dose of study medication until 16 weeks after the last dose of study medication. In addition, male subjects whose partners are or become pregnant while on study medication must continue to use condoms for 7 days after stopping study medication. Adequate organ system function. Ability to comply with dietary and tobacco/alcohol abstinence requirements. Exclusion Criteria Haematological malignancy associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or solid organ transplant or history of known Hepatitis B Antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody (confirmed by Recombinant ImmunoBlot Assay [RIBA], if available or alternately confirmed by Hepatitis C Virus [HCV] Ribonucleic acid [RNA]). History or concurrent malignancy of solid tumours, except for below. Exception: Subjects who have been diseasefree for 5 years, or subjects with a history of completely resected nonmelanoma skin cancer or successfully treated in situ carcinoma are eligible. Subjects with second malignancies that are indolent or definitively treated may be enrolled even if less than 5 years have elapsed since treatment. Consult the GSK Medical Monitor if unsure whether second malignancies meet requirements specified above.
