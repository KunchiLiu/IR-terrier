	<brief_summary>This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects and best way to give stereotactic body radiation therapy and T-cell infusion in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer. Giving total body irradiation before a T-cell infusion stops the growth of cancer cells by stopping them from dividing or killing them. After treatment, stem cells are collected from the patient's blood and stored. Chemotherapy is given to prepare the bone marrow for the stem cell transplant. The stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed by the radiation therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and T-Cell Infusion in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Conduct a safety and feasibility study of stereotactic radiotherapy with autologous T-cell infusion for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the progression free survival at one year. II. Determine the overall survival at one year. OUTLINE: STEREOTACTIC BODY RADIATION THERAPY (SBRT): Patients undergo standard of care SBRT over 1-2 weeks according to tumor volume and location. LYMPHODEPLETION: Beginning 3 weeks later, patients receive cyclophosphamide orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 3 days. REINFUSION OF PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS (PBMC): Within 3-14 days of completing lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide, patients undergo autologous PBMC infusion. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 week, 4 weeks, and monthly thereafter.</detailed_description>
