	<criteria>Aged 2180 years Female MSK histologically confirmed earlystage operable breast cancer (patients with HER2 negative or HER2 positive breast cancer are eligible) Estrogen receptor positive (patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy only) Scheduled to receive dosedense doxorubicin (A) and cyclophosphamide (C) followed by dosedense or weekly paclitaxel (T) (i.e., ACT chemotherapy) in the neoadjvuant or adjuvant setting ECOG status of 0 or 1 Weight of &lt;205 kg Performing less than 150 minutes of structured moderateintensity or strenuous intensity exercise per week If a female of childbearing potential, must not be pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the study. a. Women &lt; 50 years old must have a negative pregnancy test (urine HCG or serum βHCG) within 2 weeks of beginning chemotherapy. Able to complete an acceptable baseline cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), in the absence of high risk ECG findings or other inappropriate response to exercise as determined by the investigator. Able to achieve an acceptable peak baseline CPET, as defined by any of the following criteria: Achieving a plateau in oxygen consumption, concurrent with an increase in power output; A respiratory exchange ratio ≥ 1.10; Attainment of maximal predicted heart rate (HRmax) (i.e., within 10 bpm of agepredicted HRmax [HRmax = 220Age[years]); Volitional exhaustion, as measured by a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) ≥ 18 on the BORG scale. Willingness to be randomized to one of the study arms Presence of any other concurrent, actively treated malignancy History of any other malignancy treated within the past 3 years (other than nonmelanoma skin cancer) Presence of metastatic disease Any of the following contraindications to cardiopulmonary exercise testing: Acute myocardial infarction within 35 days of any planned study procedures) Unstable angina Uncontrolled arrhythmia causing symptoms or hemodynamic compromise; Recurrent syncope Active endocarditis Acute myocarditis or pericarditis Symptomatic severe aortic stenosis Uncontrolled heart failure Acute pulmonary embolus or pulmonary infarction within 3 months of any planned study procedures; Thrombosis of lower extremities Suspected dissecting aneurysm Uncontrolled asthma Pulmonary edema Respiratory failure Acute noncardiopulmonary disorders that may affect exercise performance or be aggravated by exercise (i.e., infection, renal failure, thyrotoxicosis) or Room air desaturation at rest ≤ 85% Mental impairment leading to inability to cooperate. Any other condition or intercurrent illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, makes the participant a poor candidate for the trial</criteria>
