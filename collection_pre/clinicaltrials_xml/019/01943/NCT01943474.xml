	<brief_summary>The study will test a hypothesis that the AccuCath™ System will have a higher rate of successful first attempt peripheral intravenous (IV) placement, higher completion of therapy, fewer complications, longer dwell times, and higher user satisfaction compared to conventional IV catheters.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AccuCath Guidewire Intravenous (IV) Device Versus Conventional IV Catheter In General Nursing Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to evaluate user/physician preference as it relates to use of a 510(k) cleared vascular access and catheter device compared with conventional needle/catheter vascular access devices, in terms of first stick success rates, dwell time, device-related vascular complications and adverse events and overall user and patient satisfaction. As noted above, the study is designed to formally test the hypothesis that the AccuCath™ System will exhibit superiority in terms of the rate of successful first attempt peripheral IV placement, higher completion of therapy, fewer complications, longer dwell times and higher user satisfaction compared to conventional intravenous catheters.</detailed_description>
