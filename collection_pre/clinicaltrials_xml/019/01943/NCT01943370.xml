	<brief_summary>Nasal saline is a common treatment adjunct in the post-operative setting for endoscopic sinus surgery. However, the ideal timing and quantity of irrigation in the early post-operative period remains unknown. Proposed benefits of early, large volume irrigation include removal and softening of crusts, resulting in improved mucociliary clearance. The potential benefit of early large volume saline irrigation on post-operative day three to ease or reduce the need for early post-operative debridement has not been studied.</brief_summary>
