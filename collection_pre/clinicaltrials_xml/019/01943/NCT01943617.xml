	<brief_summary>Six hundreds patients with chronic hepatitis B clinically diagnosed as compensated liver cirrhosis are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio. One arm is entecavir alone for 2 years; the other is entecavir alone for the first 0.5 year, entecavir plus thymosin-α for 1 year, entecavir for another additional 0.5 year.Patients will be assessed at baseline, at every six months for blood cell count, liver function test, HBVDNA, AFP, prothrombin time, liver ultrasonography, and Fibroscan;</brief_summary>
