	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to monitor outcomes of total hip arthroplasties performed with E-MAX polyethylene and BIOLOX Delta Ceramic head. Polyethylene has been used as a bearing surface in total joint replacements for half of a century. Radiation, the most common form of sterilization, unfortunately it results in the creation of free radicals (atoms or molecules that cause chemical reactions with other substances) within the materials which cause the breakdown of the polyethylene. Second generation antioxidant polyethylene, Renovis E-MAX, mechanically blends in Vitamin E as an antioxidant. This helps eliminate free radicals while maintaining mechanical strength. The theory is that E-MAX will be a safe and long lasting bearing surface in total hip arthroplasty that meets or exceeds current wear rates after being placed in a patient.</brief_summary>
