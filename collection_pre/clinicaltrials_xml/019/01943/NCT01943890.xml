	<brief_summary>Background Nebulised hypertonic saline (HS) is an established basic airway clearance treatment in Cystic Fibrosis (CF). However, there is scarce evidence regarding the practical implementation and administration of different HS volumes, including physiotherapy and aspects of breathing pattern. The aim of the study was to implement standardised and age-adjusted nebulised volumes of hypertonic saline in cystic fibrosis patients, included in physiotherapy and lung drainage techniques.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Volumes of Hypertonic Saline and Chest Physiotherapy in CF Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims: To establish a safe, efficient routine for implementation of HS in daily treatment and to investigate the efficiency and tolerance of high volumes of HS integrated with chest physiotherapy. HS was given twice daily with volumes of 4,5 ml in children aged 0-5 years, 6 ml at age 6-16 years and 9 ml at age &gt; 16 years. The protocol included guidance of standardized breathing pattern, upright and sideways positioning and voluntary cough.</detailed_description>
