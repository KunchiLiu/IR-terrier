	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to evaluate a compressed dosing schedule and the immunologic effects of co-administration of a flavivirus with JE vaccine. Primary Objectives: - To describe and compare the humoral immune response to each of the 4 parental dengue virus serotypes at baseline and 28 days after each CYD dengue vaccine dose. - To describe the persistence of the humoral immune response to each of the 4 parental dengue virus serotypes 6 months after CYD dengue vaccine Dose 3, irrespective of whether or not JE vaccine has been previously administered. Secondary Objectives: - To describe the safety profile after each injection of CYD dengue vaccine. - To describe the humoral immune response to each of the 4 parental dengue virus serotypes at baseline and 28 days after each CYD dengue vaccine dose when administered with or after JE virus vaccine. - To describe the persistence of the humoral immune response to each of the 4 parental dengue virus serotypes at six months post-Dose 3 in all four groups and at 12 months post dose 3 in Groups 1 and 3 with the compressed schedule. - To describe the JE humoral immune response 28 days after each injection of CYD dengue vaccine.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Aged ≥ 18 to ≤ 45 years on the day of inclusion Informed consent form has been signed and dated Able to attend all scheduled visits and to comply with all trial procedures Subject in good health, based on medical history and physical examination. Subject is pregnant, or lactating, or of childbearing potential (to be considered of nonchildbearing potential, a female must be post menopausal for at least 1 year, surgically sterile, or using an effective method of contraception or abstinence from at least 4 weeks prior to the first vaccination and until at least 4 weeks after the last vaccination) Participation in the 4 weeks preceding the first trial vaccination, or planned participation during the present trial period, in another clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical procedure Receipt or planned receipt of any vaccine, outside the study protocol in the 4 weeks preceding or following trial vaccinations. (If influenza activity warrants vaccination of healthy young adults, influenza vaccination will be encouraged and will not lead to study exclusion.) Any history of flavivirus (FV) vaccination, or planned FV vaccination during the trial period. Previous residence (&gt;12 months) in, or travel in the last 30 days to dengue endemic regions. Receipt of immune globulins, blood or bloodderived products in the 3 months prior to first vaccination or planned use during the study period Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy such as anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the preceding 6 months; or longterm systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months) Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components (including protamine sulfate), or history of a lifethreatening reaction to the vaccine(s) used in the trial or to a vaccine containing any of the same substances, including dry natural latex Deprived of freedom by an administrative or court order, or in an emergency setting, or hospitalized involuntarily Excessive alcohol consumption or drug addiction Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, is at a stage where it might interfere with trial conduct or completion Identified as an employee of the Investigator or study center, with direct involvement in the proposed study or other studies under the direction of that Investigator or study center, as well as family members (i.e., immediate, husband, wife and their children, adopted or natural) of the employee or the Investigator Temporary Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to Investigator judgment) on the day of vaccination or febrile illness (temperature ≥ 38.0°C [≥ 100.4°F]). A prospective subject should not be included in the study until the condition has resolved or the febrile event has subsided. If the delay for the febrile illness exceeds the window between screening and vaccination, or if deemed necessary by the Investigator, a prospective subject may be rescreened once the fever has resolved.</criteria>
