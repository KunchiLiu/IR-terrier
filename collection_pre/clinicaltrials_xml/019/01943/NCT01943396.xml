	<brief_summary>In this research rheohemapheresis will be used for the treatment of patients with high-risk dry form of age-related macular degeneration. Correction of rheologic parameters and activation of retinal functional reserves after the therapy will positively influence functional condition of retina. The newest special electrophysiologic methods will be used to determine retinal changes in time. The investigators will also evaluate some important immunologic factors and complement changes as well as define indication criteria more precisely.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of AMD With Rheohemapheresis /RHF/</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With optimized therapeutic protocol we would prevent progression of the dry form of AMD into its devastating wet form and stabilize the situation. We suppose that retinal morphologic and functional conditions would improve in a high percentage of patients. Also possible technical and economic savings would not be less important with our own therapeutic protocol, especially, when blindness could be prevented.</detailed_description>
