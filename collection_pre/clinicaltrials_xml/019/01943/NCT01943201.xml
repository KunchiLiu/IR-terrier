	<brief_summary>Introduction: It is known that people with spinal cord injury (SCI) bear a considerably increased risk of developing pressure ulcer, whereby frictional forces and shear forces are recognized as risk factors. It was the aim of the study to examine the effects of a specially developed low-friction hospital bed sheet on skin physiology as well as it's acceptance by patients with SCI. Method: Prospective, randomised crossover study. Patients with a subacute spinal cord injury will be recruited. Each patient spends five consecutive nights on the new, respectively, conventional bed sheet. After the five nights, patients are asked to complete a linear questionnaire (VAS) concerning well-being, odour, perspiration and wrinkling. In addition, the patients are examined daily while still fasting, for skin redness, skin moisture, skin elasticity and skin blood circulation in the parasacral region.</brief_summary>
