The investigators will also examine 1) symptoms (fatigue, sleep, low blood sugar symptoms, depression, shortness of breath), 2) healthy behaviors (blood sugar monitoring; taking medications as prescribed; getting eye, foot, kidney and cholesterol exams; and activity), 3) the use of health care services. This project is a translational study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the intervention in the context of a major insurer.</brief_summary>
