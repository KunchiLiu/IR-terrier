	<brief_summary>Headache is the most common complaint to neurologists. In the 80Â´s and 90's few papers, with limited number of patients, have proposed the association between nasal septum contact and headache. The International Classification of Headaches Disorders proposed specific diagnostic criteria for this entity. With the major use of CT scans, the contact between nasal mucosa and septum is daily observed in many patients without complaint of headache. The purpose of this study is to determine if there is any correlation between nasal and septum mucosa contact and the prevalence of headache. The investigators hypothesized that no correlation will be found using CT scans in a large series of patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Every patient older than 18 years old whom underwent sinuses or facial computed tomography will be asked to answer a questionnaire, where he will be able to describe his headache features (if present) . This information will be correlated with patient images findings, which are going to be evaluated by head and neck radiologists blinded for clinical information. Logistic regression model will be used to verify this association; the presence of sinusitis and fever will used be as covariates.</detailed_description>
