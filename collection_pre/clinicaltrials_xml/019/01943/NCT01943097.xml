	<brief_summary>Neuroblastic tumors are childhood neoplasms that possess amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) activity and Meta-iodobenzylguanidine(MIBG), they can theoretically be imaged by (18)F-fluorodihydroxyphenylalanine ((18)F-FDOPA) and (123)I-Meta-iodobenzylguanidine((123)I-MIBG) PET, they are new and specific diagnostic and follow-up tools for neuroendocrine tumors. In this study, we explored the accuracy and clinical role of (18)F-FDOPA and (123)I-MIBG PET in neuroblastic tumors. METHODS: Patients with tissue-proven neuroblastic tumors receiving (18)F-FDOPA PET or (123)I-MIBG at initial diagnosis or during follow-ups were enrolled. The sensitivity and specificity of (18)F-FDOPA or (123)I-MIBG PET were compared to each other and compared to(18)F-FDG PET, using tumor histology as the standard.</brief_summary>
