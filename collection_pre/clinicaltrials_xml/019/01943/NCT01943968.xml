	<brief_summary>The aim of our study is to find a biomarker for fibrosis or vasculopathy in systemic sclerosis. We will evaluate a possible correlation between semaphorin 7a, semaphorin 3a and lysyl oxidase and fibrosis (lung and skin) or vasculopathy in patients with systemic sclerosis. The results obtained may help us diagnose these complications of systemic sclerosis and hopefully even monitor patient treatment.</brief_summary>
