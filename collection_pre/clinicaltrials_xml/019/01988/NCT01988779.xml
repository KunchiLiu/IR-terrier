	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to treat patients with a diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and a history of bilateral endoscopic sinus surgery during times of worsening symptoms and signs of acute infection on nasal endoscopy with one of two treatments: (1) oral antibiotics and twice daily intranasal saline irrigations or (2) oral placebo and twice daily intranasal antibiotic irrigations. The two treatments will be compared to see if there is any difference in patient outcomes. This will help guide treatment strategies for patients with CRS in the future.</brief_summary>
