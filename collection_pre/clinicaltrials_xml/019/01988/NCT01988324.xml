	<brief_summary>Knowledge of breast cancer estrogen receptor (ER) expression is of major importance in treatment-decision making. Patients with ER-positive tumors can be treated with anti-oestrogen therapy, which has relatively few side effects compared to chemotherapy. Whole-body tumor ER-expression can be visualized by 18F-fluoroestradiol PET imaging (FES-PET). In addition to ER, the androgen receptor (AR) is a potential new target in breast cancer. PET imaging with 18F-fluorodihydrotestosterone (18F-FDHT) may allow visualization of tumor AR-expression. In the current study we will perform FES-PET and FDHT-PET in metastatic breast cancer patients and evaluate the concordance with concurrent biopsies. Molecular imaging of tumor AR- and ER-expression may well be of value for future treatment decision-making.</brief_summary>
