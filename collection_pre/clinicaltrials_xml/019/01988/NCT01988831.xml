	<brief_summary>Melanoma's incidence is increasing worldwide. The efforts made in melanoma screening led to an earlier detection of the primary tumour and a better prognosis, but melanoma remains an aggressive cancer when it comes to its metastatic stage. Three recent retrospective studies compared groups of patients diagnosed with primary melanoma and treated with betablockers for another indication to patients who never received betablockers. In these three studies, the outcome of the disease is significantly better for people under betablocker treatment with a decreased rate of recurrence and a better 5 years survival rate. Here we want to investigate the efficacy and the tolerability of an adjuvant treatment with propranolol for patients suffering from a primary melanoma with a high risk of recurrence.</brief_summary>
