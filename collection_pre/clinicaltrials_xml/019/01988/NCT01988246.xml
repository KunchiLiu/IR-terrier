	<brief_title>Prevention of Macular Edema In Patients With Diabetic Retinopathy Undergoing Cataract Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic retinopathy patients who are at risk of developing macular edema (defined as ≥ 30 % increase from pre-operative baseline in central subfield macular thickness) within 90 days following cataract surgery. Diabetic patients are defined as those who have either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. The patients must have either mild, moderate, or severe non proliferative retinopathy or treated proliferative retinopathy. Patients must be 18 years of age and older, of any race and either sex, requiring cataract extraction with planned implantation of a posterior chamber intraocular lens into the lens capsule.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A patient must meet the following criteria to be eligible for inclusion in the study: 1. Must be 18 years of age and older, of any race and either sex, who have a cataract, and are planning to undergo cataract extraction by phacoemulsification with the implantation of a posterior chamber intraocular lens into the lens capsule 2. History of Type I or Type II diabetes 3. NPDR: nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (mild, moderate, or severe) or inactive proliferative disease in the study eye as defined by the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Disease Severity Scale 4. Willing and able to comply with clinic visits and studyrelated procedures 5. Patients must be able to understand and sign an informed consent that has been approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) 6. Central subfield macular thickness ≤ 320 μm in the study eye prior to cataract surgery as determined by SDOCT and confirmed by the reading center 7. Absence of clinically significant macular edema (CSME) in the study eye as detected by clinical exam 8. Patients must have visual acuity of 20/2020/200 A patient who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study: 1. Signs of vitreomacular traction or epiretinal membrane in the study eye as detected by reading center or investigator 2. Current or previous ocular disease in the study eye that in the opinion of the investigator may confound assessment of the macula, the retina, or central vision other that diabetic retinopathy 3. Active proliferative diabetic retinopathy in the study eye 4. Planned multiple procedures for study eye during the cataract/IOL implantation surgery (e.g., trabeculectomy, corneal transplant) 5. Patients who have received corneal transplants in the study eye 6. Patients with current or history of chronic or recurrent ocular infections or inflammation in the study eye 7. Patients with a visually nonfunctional fellow eye based upon the assessment by the investigator 8. Patients who are immunocompromised (e.g., patients receiving chemotherapy irradiation therapy, patients with AIDS, leukemia, or cachexia) or patients receiving dialysis 9. Use of medications known to affect the macula, including hydroxychloroquinine (Plaquenil) and phenothiozines (e.g., thioridazine [Mellaril], chloropromazine [Thorazine]) or supplemental niacin ≥3 grams/day 10. Use of systemic steroids, NSAIDS (nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs), antiVEGF agents within 7 days prior to surgery (through study exit). Daily doses of aspirin, up to 325 mg, will be permitted. 11. Use of topical ocular NSAIDS and steroids, in the study eye, within 7 days prior to surgery 12. Treatment with intraocular or periocular steroids in the study eye within 3 months prior to surgery 13. Focal photocoagulation for the treatment of diabetic macular edema in the study eye within 6 months of the preoperative baseline visit (Note: peripheral retina treatment for retinal tear or lattice degeneration is permitted) 14. Intravitreal antiVEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) treatment in the study eye within 6 months of the preoperative baseline visit 15. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to NSAIDs or steroids or any component of the study medication. 16. Use of a topical ophthalmic prostaglandin (e.g., TRAVATAN, XALATAN) within 4 days of surgery through study exit 17. Any concurrent intraocular condition in the study eye that, in the opinion of the investigator, could require either medical or surgical intervention during the 90 day study period. 18. Any concurrent ocular condition in the study eye which, in the opinion of the investigator, could either increase the risk to the patient beyond what is to be expected from standard procedures of intraocular injection, or which otherwise may interfere with the injection procedure or with evaluation of efficacy or safety. 19.
