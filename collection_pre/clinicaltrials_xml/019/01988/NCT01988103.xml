Psoriasis flare within 4 weeks of screening. Topical therapy within 2 weeks prior to randomization or systemic therapy for psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis within 4 weeks prior to randomization. Use of etretinate within 2 years prior to randomization for females of child bearing potential (FCBP) or within 6 months for males, and within 4 weeks prior to randomization for nonFCBP.
