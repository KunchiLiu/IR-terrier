	<brief_summary>The finding that ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) is increased in pre-eclamptic pregnancy suggests a role for IMA as a potential biomarker for abnormal placental development related to miscarriage.This study was undertaken to evaluate IMA levels in women with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Markers of Oxidative Stress in a Early Week Miscarriage: Ischemia of Modified Albumin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) measured by the albumin cobalt binding test is a relatively new biomarker in the identification of myocardial ischemia. Experimental studies have shown that pregnancies normally develop in a relatively hypoxic intrauterine environment, and the subsequent reperfusion and oxidative stress is important for physiological trophoblast development. The finding that maternal serum IMA levels are raised so early in pregnancy provides further support for IMA as a potential marker for abnormal placental development that may be related to early pregnancy loss. In this study, we aimed to evaluate maternal circulating IMA levels in women with RPL by comparing them with healthy controls.</detailed_description>
