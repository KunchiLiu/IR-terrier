	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the psychometric properties of the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Beliefs about Atrial Fibrillation Survey (KABAFS) and to generate critical, practical knowledge about the feasibility of conducting a randomized trial to test the effect of the Alert for Atrial Fibrillation program on treatment-seeking for symptoms of Atrial Fibrillation (AF).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Testing of the Alert for Atrial Fibrillation Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the proposed research is to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Beliefs about Atrial Fibrillation Survey (KABAFS), which is an instrument designed to tailor the delivery of the Alert for Atrial Fibrillation program. The proposed research will also test the feasibility of studying the effect of the Alert for Atrial Fibrillation program on treatment-seeking for symptoms of AF in a larger, randomized trial. This research is significant, because current research suggests that treatment seeking for AF is hindered when people do not recognize symptoms that represent AF, attribute those symptoms to alternative causes, or do not believe symptoms are serious enough to require medical evaluation. Interventions tailored to modify patient-specific knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs that hinder early treatment-seeking are critically needed in order to improve early detection of AF. The long term goal of this research is to improve health outcomes of those at risk for developing AF.</detailed_description>
