	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: Specific Aim 1: To determine if Atorvastatin(Lipitor) administration preserves LVEF 24 months after initiation of Anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy for adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. Specific Aim 2: To determine if baseline to 6-month differences in LVEF predict baseline to 24-month differences in LVEF after Anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy and concomitant atorvastatin therapy. To achieve these aims, we will perform a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of 0 or 40 mg of atorvastatin/day in 250 women scheduled to receive Anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy for treatment of adjuvant breast cancer. We will use innovative noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures to accurately measure LVEF. In addition, we will measure LV volumes, myocardial strain, fibrosis, aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and wall thickness, all factors that can influence LVEF by altering LV pre-load, after-load, and contractility.19,20 Advanced serum biomarkers will be measured that assess for the presence of oxidative/nitrosative stress, systemic inflammation and circulating neurohormones that also may influence LVEF. This study will test a new clinical paradigm to manage breast cancer: primary prevention of Anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy-related LV dysfunction using pre-treatment with low-cost statins. In addition, this trial will be the first systematic collection of data regarding the mechanism(s) and time course by which LV dysfunction and subsequent CHF evolve in women given Anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy for adjuvant breast cancer. These data will be useful to physicians trying to determine the optimal cardiac protection strategies when administering adjuvant chemotherapeutic regimens to their breast cancer patients. The objective of this research is to use inexpensive medications to preserve CV health and thereby improve overall survival in the growing number of breast cancer patients. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES Specific Aim 1: To document the effect of Atorvastatin (Lipitor) on cognitive function using a battery of neurocognitive tests (HVLT, Rey-Osterreith Figure, COWA, Trail-making Parts A and B, Digit Span and Grooved Pegboard) in breast cancer patients receiving an anthracycline. Specific Aim 2: To document the effect of Atorvastatin(Lipitor) on self-reported quality of life using validated questionnaires (PROMIS including: General form, Cog Concerns, Cog Abilities, Fatigue, Pain intensity and interference, Sleep Disturbance, Physical Functioning and Social Functioning) in breast cancer patients receiving an anthracycline.</detailed_description>
