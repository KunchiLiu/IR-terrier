	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of GSK Biologicals' combined reduced-antigen-content diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (dTpa) vaccine, Boostrix™ when given as a single injection to 6-10 year old children. Data that are available globally on the age group from four to six years of age will be used to bridge the age gap in this study and aid in the registration of the vaccine for children from the age of four years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety of a Booster Dose of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' Boostrix™ Vaccine in Healthy Vietnamese Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A phase III, single-group, open-label study of GSK Biologicals' vaccine BoostrixTM administered as a booster vaccine dose in healthy Vietnamese children aged 6-10 years. A single booster dose of BoostrixTM will be administered at Visit 1 (Day 0) and subjects will be observed until Visit 2 (Day 30). Safety will be assessed in terms of solicited adverse events (during 4 days post vaccination), unsolicited adverse events (during 31 days post vaccination) and serious adverse event (during the trial period). This protocol summary was updated following an administrative change of adding the EudraCT number to this study.</detailed_description>

Administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 days prior to the booster vaccine dose, or planned administration during the study period. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding Visit 1 or planned administration during the study period. Occurrence of transient thrombocytopenia or neurological complications following an earlier immunisation against diphtheria and/or tetanus. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product. A history of previous or intercurrent diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis disease. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine.
