	<brief_summary>To proof patients' benefit of minimally invasive surgery in the dorsal cervical spine an apparatus to examine head-neck-coordination was constructed. Two different surgical techniques will be compared: Laminoplasty: open approach vs minimally invasive surgery (MIS)-approach; Foraminotomy: open approach vs MIS-approach. Each patient will be tested before surgery, postoperative as well as 3 and 12 month follow-up. Hypothesis is that patients after MIS-approaches perform better in their head-neck-coordination as patients with open approaches.</brief_summary>
