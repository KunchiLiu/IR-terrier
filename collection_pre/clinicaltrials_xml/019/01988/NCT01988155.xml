	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine if AstymÂ® treatment is an effective treatment for patients with Achilles pain. The usual treatment for this condition is a specific exercise program that has been previously shown to be effective. The research team is trying to determine if combining Astym with the exercise program is more effective than exercise program only. The main hypothesis for this study is that Astym plus eccentric exercise will be more effective than eccentric exercise alone at improving pain and function in patients with insertional Achilles tendinopathy.</brief_summary>
