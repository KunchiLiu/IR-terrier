	<brief_summary>TRANSREG will assess the safety and biological efficacy of low-dose IL2 as a Treg inducer in a set of 12 autoimmune and auto-inflammatory diseases, with the aim to select diseases in which further therapeutic development will be performed. Extensive biological- and immune-monitoring pre- and post-IL2 will contribute (i) to define the common or distinct processes responsible for the breakdown of immunological tolerance in these pathologies and (ii) to discover potential biomarkers of the IL2 response.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Induction of Regulatory t Cells by Low Dose il2 in Autoimmune and Inflammatory Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Protocol: TRANSREG is a multicentric, uncontrolled, open-label study, comparing biological and clinical responses to the administration of low doses IL2 across 12 selected pathologies: rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, Behcet's disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, Takayasu's disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, autoimmune hepatitis, sclerosing cholangitis and Gougerot-sjögren. Methods: Each patient will receive 1MUI /day of IL2 from Day-1 to Day-5 (the induction period), and then every 2 weeks (except systemic lupus erythematosus's patients will received every week) from Day-15 to Day-180 (the maintenance period). Patients will thereafter be followed up for 12 months (Day-181-Day-540). For each pathology, 6 patients will be included at Pitié-Salpêtrière, Cochin, Saint Antoine and Paul Brousse hospitals in Paris. An interim analysis will be performed in each pathology group when the first six patients have received at least 3 months of treatment. In those pathology groups in which a Treg response will be documented, six additional patients will be included. In total, a minimum of 72 patients and up to 132 patients will be enrolled in this study. Primary efficacy endpoint is the Treg response at Day-8. Secondary endpoints are:- the Treg response during the maintenance period,- the changes in markers of inflammation - the clinical response, evaluated by means of global generic scales [Clinical Global Impression severity scale (CGI-sev) and Clinical Global Impression efficacy index (CGI-eff)] as well as specific clinical and biological evaluations for each disease, - the frequency of relapses, - the assessment of quality of life (scale EuroQL-5).Expected Results: TRANSREG will define which patients respond to IL2, whether per pathology or according to pre-treatment phenomics, allowing to guide further clinical development of low dose IL2 in autoimmune and auto-inflammatory diseases.</detailed_description>
