	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the usefulness of neuroscience-guided cognitive training combined with community-based supported employment for people with schizophrenia. The investigators will examine the effectiveness of moving our study of neuroplasticity-based restorative targeted cognitive training out of the laboratory and into the community setting; and the investigators will also investigate its utility in enhancing functional outcome in chronically mentally ill adults who are participating in supported employment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neurocognitive functioning will be assessed at baseline (study entry), after cognitive training (6 months), and at 12 month follow-up, using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). The investigators will assess the following six constructs identified by MATRICS as separable, fundamental dimensions of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, with a likely sensitivity to intervention [26]: 1) Speed of Processing, 2) Attention/Vigilance, 3) Working Memory, 4) Verbal Learning and Memory, 5) Visual Learning and Memory, and 6) Reasoning and Problem Solving (executive functioning). The investigators will also administer the delayed memory trials of HVLT and BVMT, Trails B, and D-KEFS Color-Word Interference Test [27], and will make one modification to the MCCB in utilizing BACS Tower of London [28] in place of NAB Mazes.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder(DSMIV criteria) between the ages of 1865 English as primary language (learned before age 12) no major medical or neurological disorder that precludes participation in the study We will not exclude subjects with substance abuse or dependence as we wish to investigate the realworld effectiveness of this cognitive remediation approach when combined with SE. As per the clinical policy at Community Services, however, patients will not be permitted to attend the SE program or to participate in the study if they are acutely intoxicated. Subjects who miss 5 consecutive days of participation due to intoxication will be dropped and a replacement subject will be recruited.</criteria>
