	<brief_summary>Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a major cause of maternal mortality and morbidity, especially in developing countries. Postpartum hypertension can be related to persistence of gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, or preexisting chronic hypertension, or it could develop de novo secondary to other causes. The available data in the medical literature have primarily focused on antenatal and peripartum management. There are few data regarding the evaluation in women who are diagnosis with postpartum hypertension. Some medications that cause vasoconstriction are often used for pain relief, in women having perineal lacerations, episiotomy, or cesarean delivery. Such women usually require large doses of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs that are associated with vasoconstriction and sodium and water retention, this drugs can result in severe hypertension. The purpose of this study is to evaluate maternal postpartum hypertension in women with severe preeclampsia treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or acetaminophen.</brief_summary>
