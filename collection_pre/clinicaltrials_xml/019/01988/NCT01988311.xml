	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study to finalize methods for a larger study being planned for the future. This research is being done to characterize performance of tasks, brain functioning, and the effects of psilocybin in individuals with a long-term meditation practice. There are three different parts of the pilot study: 1. Effects of psilocybin on psychological function: This version of the pilot study will involve 1 or 2 day-long psilocybin sessions, and several meetings and data assessment visits. You will make a total of about 5 to 10 visits to our research unit (the BPRU on the Johns Hopkins Bayview Campus). 2. Performance on behavioral and cognitive tasks: This version of the pilot study will involve completing various behavioral and cognitive tasks at our research unit. You will make a total of about 1-10 visits to our research unit (the BPRU on the Johns Hopkins Bayview Campus). 3. Brain functioning: This version of the study will involve 1 to 3 brain imaging (MRI) measurements. You will make a total of about 2 to 5 visits to our research unit (the BPRU on the Johns Hopkins Bayview Campus). The MRI measurements will be taken at the F.M. Kirby Research Center at the Kennedy Krieger Institute (across the street from the Johns Hopkins Hospital). People who are between the ages of 25 and 80 years old, who have a current, regular meditation practice, and who meet the medical requirements may join.</brief_summary>

If the participant does not routinely consume caffeinated beverages, he/she must agree not to do so on session days. Agree to refrain from using any psychoactive drugs, including alcoholic beverages and nicotine, within 24 hours of each drug administration. The exception is caffeine. Participants will be required to be nonsmokers.

Agree that for one week before each drug session, he/she will refrain from taking any nonprescription medication, nutritional supplement, or herbal supplement except when approved by the study investigators. Exceptions will be evaluated by the study investigators and will include acetaminophen, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and common doses of vitamins and minerals. Women who are pregnant (as indicated by a positive urine pregnancy test assessed at intake and before each drug session) or nursing; women who are of childbearing potential and sexually active who are not practicing an effective means of birth control.

For individuals who have intermittent or PRN use of such medications, psilocybin sessions will not be conducted until at least 5 halflives of the agent have elapsed after the last dose.
