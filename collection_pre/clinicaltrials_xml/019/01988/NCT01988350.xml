	<brief_summary>Pancreatic insufficiency is a condition in which there is a decrease in the production and release of enzymes made in the pancreas, which causes nutrient malabsorption. There are many chronic diseases that can lead to pancreatic insufficiency. In the early stages of this disease, a patient may not experience any symptoms, and the prevalence of pancreatic insufficiency may be underestimated. Smoking has long been recognized as a cause of disease in many organs in the body. Cigarette smoke causes inflammation and damages tissue, including the pancreas. Studies have shown that smoking is an independent risk factor for pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. It has also been shown that the more a person smokes, the worse his disease will be. Additionally, there are studies that show that smokers have nutritional deficiencies. There are observational and retrospective studies that suggest that pancreatic insufficiency may also be caused by smoking. However, this has not been established, and the relationship has not been examined in a controlled manner. This study examines the relationship between smoking and pancreatic insufficiency in patients who do not have other pancreatic diseases.</brief_summary>
