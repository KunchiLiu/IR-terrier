	<brief_summary>Currently, about one third of all women entering pregnancy are obese. The prevalence of metabolic disorders during pregnancy has increased concurrently with the rise in maternal obesity. Although dietary interventions are used routinely to reduce metabolic disease in non-pregnant obese individuals, no specific dietary advice is provided to obese, pregnant women unless they develop gestational diabetes mellitus. In this study, the investigators will specifically assess the effect of replacing dairy fats with almonds in a breakfast meal on the postprandial metabolic response. This cross-over, randomized control trial will examine the postprandial metabolic response to 0 or 2 oz of almonds in standardized test meals in pregnant Hispanic women with prepregnancy BMI between 25 and 40. Hispanics are at higher risk for gestational diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. The investigators hypothesize that consuming almonds in place of dairy fat reduces the glycemic response and improves the postprandial lipid profile in these high-risk women.</brief_summary>
