	<brief_title>Study on the Carcinogenesis of SOX-9 in Oral Cancer, and Chemopreventive Possibility for the Treatment of Oral Cancer.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To find out if there is prognostic value which to the performance of SOX-9 of oral cancer in Taiwan and provide some reference for future treatment. We anticipate to enroll 40 persons with normal oral mucosa, 65 persons with oral dysplasia and 150 persons with oral cancer and collect the tissue which was stained for pathological sections over a 3 year period. We also collect the blood and saliva samples from patients and the results along with patient-specific information such as tumor phases, tumor size, lymph node metastasis, cancer metastasis, prognosis and betel nut chewing, smoking and drinking habits and other parameters are statistically analyzed.</detailed_description>
