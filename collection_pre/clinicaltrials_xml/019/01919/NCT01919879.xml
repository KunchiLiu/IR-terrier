	<brief_summary>This is a multicentric, phase II and open label study.75 patients are expected to be randomized in 35 centers. The main objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of Afatinib -cetuximab combo versus cetuximab alone in treatment of patients with refractory wtKRAS metastatic colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dual Targeting of EGFR With Cetuximab and Afatinib to Treat Refractory wtKRAS Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients who will sign the inform consent will be enrolled into one of two groups. Group A will receive Afatinib ( 40mg per day) and Cetuximab (500mg/m2)every two weeks until progression. Group B will receive Cetuximab (500mg/m2) alone every two weeks until progression and after progression,patients from group B will receive afatinib (group A treatment) until progression. The criteria for evaluation will be tumor response and progression documented by CT scan and according to RECIST criteria version 1.1. Patient will also sign a inform consent before participating in biological study. The aim of this translational study is to collect tumor and blood sample in order to determine, the biological factors which are predictive of the response to treatment.</detailed_description>
