	<brief_title>Tongxinluo Capsule in Ischemic Stroke Patients（TISS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multi-center trial. We aim to enroll a total of 1968 individuals(984 cases in each group) with acute ischemic stroke less than 72 hours after onset. Participants will be randomized into Tongxinluo capsule treatment group with the capsule administration of 4 granules tid. for 90 days, while the patients in the control group receive placebo capsule. NIH Stroke Score of the subjects is 4-22 at randomization. Evaluations of efficacy and safety will be taken at baseline, 7 days, discharge date and 90 days. Neuroimaging [magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans] will be obtained at baseline and 90 days after therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤1 at 90 days.</detailed_description>
