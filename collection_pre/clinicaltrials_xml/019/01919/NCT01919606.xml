	<brief_title>EXPAREL Administered Into the TAP for Analgesia in Subjects Undergoing Open Total Abdominal Hysterectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, open-label, non-randomized study with two treatment groups differing only in the volume of EXPAREL infiltrated into the TAP. All subjects will undergo an open total abdominal hysterectomy. The dose of EXPAREL for the TAPs will be the same for all 20 subjects, 133 mg on the right side of the abdomen and 133 mg on the left side of the abdomen.</detailed_description>
