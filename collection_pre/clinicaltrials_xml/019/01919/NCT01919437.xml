	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to develop the technology infrastructure for a mobile Web-based cognitive and neuropsychological assessment of substance abusers, and to perform a pilot trial using neurocognitive tasks designed to demonstrate that our system is statistically comparable to current clinical practice. The primary hypotheses are that results collected using a web-based data collection platform will be comparable (but not necessarily equivalent) to data collected under controlled laboratory conditions, that methamphetamine (MA) dependent participants will have worsened neurocognitive performance compared to healthy volunteers, and the platform will be acceptable to participants.</brief_summary>
