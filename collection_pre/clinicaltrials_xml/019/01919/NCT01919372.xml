	<brief_summary>This project is based on the contribution that could offer a technological system for a continuous monitoring, individualized treatment of obesity and prevention of cardiometabolic complications in high risk population. The main objective of PREDIRCAM study is to evaluate the benefits obtained with the use in high cardiometabolic risk individuals of a telemedical platform integrating applications for monitoring and providing recommendations to improve lifestyle habits (diet and physical activity) in a healthier way. The study population are obese subjects (type I or II) aged between 25 and 65 years with a 12 month follow-up. In this population it will be analysed the cost-effectiveness of a telemedic assistance with a technological system and its ability to modify lifestyle habits, reduce weight and cardiovascular risk associated parameters. Previously to the clinical implementation, a pilot study for testing the telemedical system will be made. Efficacy and security variables will be evaluated along the study.</brief_summary>
