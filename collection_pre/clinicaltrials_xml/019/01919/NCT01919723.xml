	<brief_summary>This purpose of this study is to measure platelet response to ticagrelor and eptifibatide bolus-only compared with ticagrelor and eptifibatide bolus plus 2-hour infusion administrated after cardiac catheterization in patients undergoing non-emergent percutaneous coronary intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ticagrelor and Eptifibatide Bolus-Only Versus Ticagrelor and Eptifibatide Bolus Plus Abbreviated Infusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, 70 patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome who are undergoing non-emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) will be randomized to ticagrelor loading dose and eptifibatide bolus-only versus ticagrelor loading dose and eptifibatide bolus plus 2 hour infusion administrated after cardiac catheterization, but before PCI. Platelet function testing will be performed at baseline and follow-up.</detailed_description>
