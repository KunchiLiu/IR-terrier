	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the consistency of quantitative peak stress myocardial blood flow and myocardial blood flow reserve following a 10 second, 1 minute, 2 minute or 4 minute delay in beginning the rubidium-82 infusion post-Lexiscan (regadenoson) injection. It is anticipated that there will be no or minimal difference between the four delay times.</brief_summary>
