	<brief_summary>This study has two purposes: firstly, a better understanding of the neurobiological processes underlying episodic memory and, secondly, the development of useful clinical applications for epileptic patients, in particular the prediction of postoperative memory deficits and the development of cognitive remediation therapies. Memory performances during a fMRI experiment will be assessed in controls and epileptic patients before and after the surgery.</brief_summary>
