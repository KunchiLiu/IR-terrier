	<brief_summary>Study Purpose The purpose of this PAS is to confirm that patients implanted with the temporary Total Artificial Heart (TAH-t) and supported with the Companion 2 Driver System have outcomes similar to those patients implanted with the TAH-t and supported with the CSS Console. The data collection mechanism for this study is the INTERMACS Registry. Study Objectives Primary Objective 1: To confirm that patients implanted with the TAH-t and supported by the Companion 2 Driver System have outcomes similar to those patients implanted with the TAH-t and supported by the CSS Console. Primary Objective 2: To compare positive outcome rates for all TAH-t patients entered in the Intermacs Registry initially supported with the Companion 2 Driver System to positive outcome rates for all TAH-t patients initially supported by the CSS Console. Primary Objective 3: To review additional data (patient survival, adverse event rates and bridge to transplant rates) to support the conclusion that the use of an artificial heart is reasonable and necessary for the treatment of irreversible biventricular failure in Medicare/Medicaid patients. Secondary Objective: - To evaluate the incidence of adverse events (AEs). The AEs will follow the definitions in the INTERMACS Registry. Study Hypothesis: Primary Objective 1 The primary hypothesis is that the positive outcome rate (defined as transplant , transfer to the Freedom Driver System support, or continuing on implant driver support, whichever occurs first; assessed at three and six months post-implant) for patients supported with the Companion 2 Driver System is non-inferior to the survival rate for patients supported with the Circulatory Support System (CSS) Console. Data Collection The data will be collected as defined in the INTERMACS Protocol and the patients will be followed at one week, one month, three months and six months or until their study endpoint is reached. Data Analysis Primary Objective 1: Data analysis will provide descriptive statistics on enrollment, adverse events, and outcomes for TAH-t patients who were implanted while supported with the Companion 2 Driver System compared to TAH-t patients who were implanted while supported with the CSS Console. Primary Objective 2: Data analysis will provide descriptive statistics on enrollment, adverse events, and outcomes for all TAH-t patients enrolled in the INTERMACS Registry.</brief_summary>
