	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) to an attention control psycho-educational support group in treating cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in early-stage (0-III) post-treatment cancer survivors with clinically-significant CRF. The study will collect, store, and later analyze blood and urine samples for several biomarkers that may be linked to persistent CRF in cancer survivors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment for Persistently Fatigued Cancer Survivors: A Randomized Controlled Trial With Biomarker Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, attention control clinical trial to compare MBSR to support and education on biobehavioral outcomes in early-stage (0-III) post-treatment cancer survivors with clinically-significant CRF. The study will use quantitative and qualitative methods to evaluate the following: Primary Aim 1: Determine effect size estimates of MBSR compared to attention control in reducing fatigue interference and the severity of several cancer-related symptoms immediately post-intervention and at 6-month follow-up. Exploratory Aim 1: To identify potential moderators of intervention effects in breast cancer survivors (BCS) and colorectal cancer survivors (CRCS), such as demographic, clinical/disease characteristics, personality traits, and baseline mindfulness level. Exploratory Aim 2: To compare levels of a number of anti- and pro-inflammatory proteins present in blood and urine between MBSR and attention control groups immediately post-intervention and 6-month follow-up, and between fatigued and non-fatigued breast cancer survivors at baseline.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria for breast cancer participants: be age 18 or older live in the Indianapolis region have an established firsttime diagnosis of nonmetastatic (stages 0III) breast cancer treated with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy be in good general health (selfreport) have clinicallysignificant CRF (Fatigue Symptom Inventory [FSI severity composite ≥ 4]) that has persisted for the previous 8 weeks or longer. Inclusion Criteria for colorectal cancer participants: be age 18 or older live in the Indianapolis region have an established diagnosis of colorectal cancer (any stage) in treatment currently or previously with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy have clinicallysignificant CRF (Fatigue Symptom Inventory [FSI severity composite ≥ 4) that has persisted for the previous 8 weeks or longer. Exclusion Criteria for breast cancer participants: cancer treatment (chemotherapy, biologic response modifiers, radiation therapy, or surgery) in prior 3 months or &gt; 5 years ago (endocrine therapy for breast cancer is allowed) enrollment in hospice care severe depression (PHQ8 ≥ 20) past participation in a mindfulness meditation class and/or having an established/ongoing meditation practice Exclusion Criteria for colorectal cancer participants: enrollment in hospice care severe depression (PHQ8 ≥ 20) past participation in a mindfulness meditation class and/or having an established/ongoing meditation practice A nonfatigued group of posttreatment BCS will also be enrolled in order to compare baseline levels of all biomarkers and all selfreported psychosocial measures between fatigued and nonfatigued BCS. Inclusion criteria for nonfatigued BCS participants being age 18 or older having an established firsttime diagnosis of nonmetastatic (stage 0III) breast cancer being in good general health (selfreported) having FSI severity composite scores of ≤ 2 Exclusion criteria for nonfatigued BCS participants cancer treatment (chemotherapy, biologic response modifiers, radiation therapy, or surgery) in prior 3 months or &gt; 5 years ago (endocrine therapy for breast cancer is allowed) enrollment in hospice care severe depression (PHQ8 ≥ 20)</criteria>
