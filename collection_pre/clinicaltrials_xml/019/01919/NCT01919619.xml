	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to study the safety of REVLIMID® (lenalidomide) when given with YERVOY® (ipilimumab) after a stem cell transplant. Researchers also want to find out if lenalidomide given with ipilimumab may help to control leukemia and lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide and Ipilimumab Post Allo or Auto Stem Cell Transplantation (SCT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups: If you agree to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose level of lenalidomide based on when you join this study and whether any intolerable side effects were seen in previous participants. Two (2) dose levels of lenalidomide will be tested. The first group of 3 participants will receive the higher dose level of lenalidomide. If intolerable side effects are seen in the first 3 participants, the remaining participants will receive a lower dose of lenalidomide. All participants will receive the same dose of ipilimumab. Study Drug Administration Lenalidomide On Days 1-21 of Cycles 1, 3, 5, and 7, you will take lenalidomide by mouth once a day. You should take lenalidomide at the same time each day. You should swallow the lenalidomide capsules whole with water. Do not open, crush, or break the lenalidomide capsules. If you touch a broken lenalidomide capsule, wash the area of your body with soap and water. If you miss a dose of lenalidomide, and it has been less than 12 hours since your regular dose time, take it as soon as you remember. If it has been more than 12 hours, just skip your missed dose. Do not take 2 doses at the same time. If you take too much lenalidomide, call your healthcare provider right away. If you vomit after any dose, do not take another dose. Ipilimumab: About 1 to 3 days after your last dose of lenalidomide in Cycles 1, 3, 5, and 7, you will receive ipilimumab by vein over 90 minutes. About 4 weeks after each ipilimumab infusion, you will start taking lenalidomide as described above. You will be given a study drug diary. You will use this diary to write down what time you take each dose of lenalidomide. You need to bring the study drug diary to every study visit so the study staff can review it. You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks. Study Visits: Before Cycles 1, 3, 5, and 7: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your kidney and liver function. On about Day 14 of Cycles 1, 3, 5, and 7, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. Before Cycles 2, 4, 6, and 8: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your adrenal gland, pituitary gland, kidney, liver, and thyroid function. - You will have an eye exam to check for side effects, if your doctor thinks it is needed. - If you received an allogeneic stem cell transplant, you will be checked for signs of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). You were told about GVHD at the time of being prepared for transplant. GVHD may cause skin rashes, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and/or damage to the liver, lung, eyes, mouth, skin, joints, gastrointestinal tract, and/or muscles. It may result in jaundice (yellowing of the skin and/or eyes). Pregnancy Tests: If you can become pregnant, you will have pregnancy counseling and testing as long as you are taking lenalidomide. Blood (about ½ teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a pregnancy test at the following times: - around 10-14 days before your first dose of lenalidomide. - up to 24 hours before your first dose of lenalidomide during Cycles 1, 3, 5, and 7. - one (1) time a week for the first 4 weeks that you take lenalidomide. - one (1) time every 4 weeks during the rest of treatment if you have a regular menstrual cycle or no cycle within 24 months, or every 2 weeks if you have an irregular menstrual cycle. If your periods are irregular, blood (about ½ teaspoon) will be drawn for a pregnancy test 2 weeks after your first dose of lenalidomide and again 28 days after your last dose of lenalidomide. Length of Study: You may continue taking the study drugs for up to 8 cycles. You may be taken off the study drugs early if the disease gets worse, if you have any intolerable side effects, if you are unable to follow study directions, if your doctor thinks it is in your best interest, or if the study is stopped. Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits. Follow-up Visits: After your last dose of ipilimumab, and then about 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months later: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your adrenal gland, pituitary gland, kidney, and liver function. - If you received an allogeneic stem cell transplant, you will be checked for signs of GVHD. - You will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to check the status of your disease, if your doctor thinks it is needed. To collect a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate, an area of the hip or chest bone is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone and bone marrow is withdrawn through a large needle. - You will have a positron emission tomography - computed tomography (PET-CT) scan and/or a CT scan, if your doctor thinks it is needed. A PET-CT is CT scan taken after a small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein to find cancer cells in the body. The above tests/procedures may be performed more often, if your doctor thinks it is needed. If you can become pregnant, blood (up to ½ teaspoon) will be drawn for a pregnancy test on the following schedule: - when you stop lenalidomide therapy and then 28 days later (if you have regular or no menstrual cycles) - when you stop lenalidomide therapy and then 14 and 28 days later (if you have irregular menstrual cycles) This is an investigational study. Ipilimumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of melanoma. Lenalidomide is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of myeloma. The use of ipilimumab in combination with lenalidomide after a stem cell transplant for leukemia and lymphoma is considered investigational and is being used for research purposes only. Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
