	<brief_summary>Autism spectrum disorders affect as many as 1 out of 88 children and are related to significant impairment in social, adaptive, and school functioning. Co-occurring conditions, such as anxiety, are common and may cause substantial distress and impairment beyond that caused by the autism diagnosis. Accordingly, we are proposing a randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy relative to treatment as usual (TAU) in 50 youth ages 6-12 with autism spectrum disorders and comorbid anxiety.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Autism spectrum disorders affect as many as 1 out of 88 children and are related to significant impairment in social, adaptive, and school functioning. Co-occurring conditions, such as anxiety, are common and may cause substantial distress and impairment beyond that caused by the autism diagnosis. Many children with anxiety disorders, especially those on the autism spectrum, do not receive evidence based treatment, which has fueled the development and evaluation of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Accordingly, we are proposing a randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of exposure based CBT that heavily incorporates parents (EF-CBT) relative to a TAU condition (TAU) in 50 youth ages 6-12 years with ASD and comorbid anxiety disorder(s).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Outpatient children with an autism spectrum disorder between the ages 612 years. Meets criteria for a diagnosis of one of the following anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, social phobia, specific phobia, panic disorder or obsessivecompulsive disorder. Minimum score of 12 on the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale Severity Scale. Child has a Full Scale and Verbal Comprehension IQ &gt; 80. Current clinically significant suicidality or engagement in suicidal behaviors within the last 6 months. Presence of any clinical features requiring a higher level of care (inpatient or partial hospital treatment). Any lifetime diagnosis (meeting DSMIV criteria) of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder; or Substance abuse in the past 6 months. Initiation of an antidepressant medication within 10 weeks before study enrollment or an antipsychotic medication 6 weeks before study enrollment or the child has changed the dose of an established medication within 6 weeks before study enrollment (4 weeks for antipsychotic) or during psychotherapy (unless the dose is lowered because of side effects). If the child is on a medication, she or he can remain on it at its current dose. While in their treatment arm, children randomized to the EFCBT condition will not be able to continue or initiate psychosocial interventions targeting anxiety(psychotherapy, certain types of social skills training, applied behavior analysis targeting anxiety). Those in the TAU arm will be able to seek out psychiatric/psychological services at their discretion.</criteria>
