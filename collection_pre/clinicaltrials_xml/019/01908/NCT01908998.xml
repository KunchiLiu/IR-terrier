	<brief_summary>The Y-balance test is a lower extremity, dynamic test performed in single limb stance that measures a person's ability to reach in 3 directions. The test is typically conducted in barefoot. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of footwear on Y-Balance test scores. The investigators hypothesize that by improving alignment and augmenting muscle mechanics, sandals with medial arch support may improve Y-Balance scores.</brief_summary>
