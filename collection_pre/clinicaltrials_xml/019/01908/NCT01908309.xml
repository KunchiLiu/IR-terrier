	<brief_summary>We previously demonstrated that the slope of the relationship plotting individual iodine loads against contrast-induced serum creatinine changes ( the load-to-damage relationship, LDR) characterizes the intrinsic nephrotoxicity of the contrast. Aim of the present study is to compare, through the assessment of the LDR slope, the intrinsic nephrotoxicity of two different contrast media using serum cystatin-C changes as the LDR dependent variable.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We previously demonstrated that the slope of the relationship plotting individual iodine loads against contrast-induced serum creatinine changes ( the load-to-damage relationship, LDR) characterizes the intrinsic nephrotoxicity of the contrast and it may allow for reliable comparative evaluations among small sized study groups randomized to different contrast media. The aim of the present study is to compare, through the assessment of the LDR slope, the intrinsic nephrotoxicity of two different contrast media using serum cystatin-C changes as the LDR dependent variable.</detailed_description>
