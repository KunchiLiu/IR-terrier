	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I Study of veliparib (ABT-888) in combination with Gemcitabine and Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy in Patients with Locally Advanced, Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer. Primary Objectives: - Determine the maximum tolerable dose of veliparib in combination with gemcitabine and intensity modulated radiation therapy in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. - Determine the safety and toxicity of the combination of veliparib with gemcitabine and radiation therapy in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gemcitabine will be administered by intravenous infusion of 1000 mg/m2 over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15 of the cycle. Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) will be given to a total dose of 36 Gy in 15 fractions (2.4 Gy per fraction, one fraction per day, 5 fractions per week, Monday through Friday) beginning on day 1. Veliparib will be administered per a dose escalation schema. The starting dose of veliparib is 20 mg BID based upon safety/efficacy data available. Dose escalation will continue in 20 mg increments until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. Intra-patient dose escalation will not be allowed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with histopathological or cytological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, as well as those with high clinical suspicion of adenocarcinoma, which is deemed locally advanced unresectable or borderline resectable as determined by a pancreatic cancer surgeon and/or following evaluation by a GI oncology tumor board.
