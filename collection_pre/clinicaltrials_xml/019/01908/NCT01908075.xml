	<detailed_description>To evaluate whether beclomethasone dipropionate / formoterol (BDP/FOR; Fostair® 100/6) is at least equivalent in terms of exacerbation prevention to fluticasone dipropionate / salmeterol (FP/SAL; Seretide®) in matched asthma patients switching to BDP/FOR following treatment with FP/SAL in normal clinical practice compared with patients not switched. To evaluate respiratory outcomes for Fostair in comparison to Seretide using a UK primary care database (in patients switched for cost rather than clinical reasons).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Aged: 1880 years 6180 years to be nonsmokers only Evidence of asthma: a diagnostic code for asthma or two scripts for asthma.. Baseline FP/SAL therapy: ≥2 prescription for ICS/LABA therapy as FP/SAL Evidence of Continuing Therapy: Include only patients who receive ≥2 prescriptions for the therapy under study during the outcome year (i.e. ≥1 prescription at the index date and ≥1 other). UK average is 34 prescriptions refilled per year, so ≥2 ensures capture of "reallife" data. Evidence of Switching for economic reasons: FP/SAL patients from practices with ≥5 switches to Fostair in a 3 month period to minimise data taken from switching of anomalous patients; optimal practices for inclusion are those switching "wholesale" for economic reasons. Any chronic respiratory disease other than asthma Are receiving maintenance oral steroid therapy during baseline period</criteria>
