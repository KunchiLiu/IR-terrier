	<brief_title>Phase 1 Study of CC-486 in Japanese Subjects With Hematological Neoplasms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study that will evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of CC-486 in Japanese subjects with hematological neoplasms including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), multiple myeloma (MM), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), or Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). A standard phase 1 design for MTD determination, an open label, dose ascending, "3 + 3" design, is adopted in this study. This study consists of screening phase, MTD determination phase, and treatment phase. Each subject continues study treatment until documentation of progressive disease or discontinuation of study treatment for any reason. Originally only MDS subjects were targeted and the MTD of CC-486 when administered once daily (QD) for 21 days in a 28-day cycle would be evaluated in this study. Currently CC-486 is being clinically developed with both 14-day and 21-day dosing schedules in various diseases. This study was suspended to amend protocol to evaluate the MTD on these different dosing schedule in larger population. This study was re-opened after amended protocol was approved by institutional review board at study site.</detailed_description>

Have a documented diagnosis of one of the following: Myelodysplastic syndromes or Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (based on a bone marrow aspirate or bone marrow biopsy) or; Acute myeloid leukemia (based on a bone marrow aspirate or bone marrow biopsy), limited to those subjects for whom standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective or; Multiple myeloma, limited to those subjects for whom standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective or; NonHodgkin lymphoma or Hodgkin lymphoma, limited to those subjects for whom standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective; 5. For subjects with myelodysplastic syndromes only, have at least one of the following: Hemoglobin level ≤ 9.0 g/dL; Platelet count ≤ 75,000 /μL; Red blood cell transfusiondependent as defined by: Average red blood cell transfusion requirement of ≥ 4 units per 28 days confirmed for a minimum of 84 days prior to starting study treatment. Hemoglobin levels within 7 days prior to administration of an red blood cell transfusion must be ≤ 9.0 g/dL in order for the transfusion to be counted towards red blood cell transfusiondependent status. Red blood cell transfusions administered when hemoglobin levels were &gt; 9.0 g/dL and/or red blood cell transfusions administered for elective surgery will not qualify as a required transfusion for the purpose of providing evidence of red blood cell transfusiondependent status. Note that 4 units of red blood cell in Japan is equivalent to 2 units of red blood cell outside of Japan; No consecutive 42 days that are red blood cell transfusionfree during the 84 days prior to starting study treatment; • Platelet transfusiondependent as defined by: Have at least two separate platelet transfusion episodes during 56 days prior to starting study treatment.

Male subjects with a female partner of childbearing potential must agree to use at least 2 physicianapproved contraceptive methods throughout the course of the study and should avoid fathering a child during the course of the study and for 3 months following the last dose of study drug. 1. Hypoplastic myelodysplastic syndromes defined as bone marrow cellularity of &lt; 20%; 2. Atypical chronic myeloid leukemia and unclassifiable myeloproliferative neoplasms.
