	<brief_summary>Women with breast cancer and breast cancer survivors are often bothered by menopausal symptoms to a special degree. Treatment options for those symptoms are currently limited as hormone replacement therapy is often prohibited. Yoga has been shown to reduce menopausal symptoms as well as symptoms associated with breast cancer. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether a 12-week yoga intervention can reduce menopausal symptoms in women with breast cancer and breast cancer survivors.</brief_summary>
