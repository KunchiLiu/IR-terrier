	<brief_title>Lesinurad Interaction Study With Ranitidine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate the potential effect of ranitidine on the pharmacokinetics of lesinurad. An earlier study demonstrated an effect on lesinurad PK in the presence of both calcium-containing and magnesium- and aluminum-containing antacids. The current study will assess whether raising gastric pH, without the presence of these cations, affects lesinurad PK and PD under the fasted state. If an impact is seen, then the optional second cohort will be conducted under the fed state.</detailed_description>
