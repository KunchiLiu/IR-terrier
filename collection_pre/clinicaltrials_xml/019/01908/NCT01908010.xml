	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of ABT-354 in Subjects With Mild-to-Moderate Alzheimer's Disease on Stable Doses of Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multiple-dose, multicenter study. Up to 20 male and female subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) who are taking stable doses of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors will be enrolled in this study. Within 28 days prior to study drug administration, subjects will be screened based on National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS/ADRDA) criteria for probable AD, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Modified Hachinski Ischemic Scale (MHIS) scores, medical history, physical examination, neurological examination, vital signs, ECG, laboratory tests and response to Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). The study will be performed in two groups of 10 subjects each. In each group of 10 subjects, 7 subjects will be randomly assigned to receive ABT-354 and 3 subjects to receive matching placebo.</detailed_description>
