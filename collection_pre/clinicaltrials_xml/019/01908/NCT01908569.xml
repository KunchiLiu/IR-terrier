	<brief_summary>The MACS technique (magnetic-activated cell sorting) is based on the usage of microbeads, magnetic particles with a diameter of 35 nanometers joined to the compound annexin V. Annexin V is a protein with a high affinity for the molecule phosphatidylserine. This system allow us to eliminate those spermatozoids which have begun the apoptosis and have phosphatidylserine residues on their membrane surface. Using this technique, the apoptotic spermatozoids will join the microbeads and consequently be retained in a column applying a magnetic field. Recent studies show the benefits of spermatozoid selection using MACS and the improvement in mobility, viability, DNA fragmentation and fertilization potential. It has also been observed an improvement in the embryo cells division rate, clinical pregnancy rates and spermatozoid survival after thawing. However, it is necessary to perform new clinical studies in order to evaluate the real potential of this technology and its safety. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the MACS technique on the clinical results of good-prognosis patients who are going through IVF/ICSI treatments in order to achieve a pregnancy. The hypothesis of this study is that the application of the MACS technique in assisted reproduction treatments is associated with a better embryo quality and pregnancy rates.</brief_summary>
