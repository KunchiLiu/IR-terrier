	<criteria>Body weight : ≥50.0 kg, &lt;80.0 kg Body Mass Index : ≥17.6, &lt;26.4 Healthy, as judged by the investigator/subinvestigator based on the results of physical examinations (subjective symptoms and objective findings) and all tests obtained at screening and during the period from hospital admission to immediately before study medication Subjects with the following history. 1. Hepatic disease (e.g. viral hepatitis, druginduced liver injury). 2. Heart disease (e.g. congestive heart failure, angina pectoris, arrhythmia requiring treatment). 3. Respiratory disease (e.g. serious bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis) 4. Gastrointestinal disease (e.g. serious peptic ulcer, gastroesophageal reflux esophagitis; diseases requiring several selections except for appendicitis) 5. Renal disease (e.g. acute renal failure, glomerulonephritis, interstitial nephritis). 6. Cerebrovascular disorder (e.g. cerebral infarction). 7. Malignant tumor. 8. Drug allergies. Allergic disorders (except for hay fever) 9. Drug dependence, alcohol dependence Any disease (except dental caries) A deviation from the normal reference range of blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature, or 12lead ECG A deviation of the following criteria for clinical laboratory tests. The normal reference ranges specified at the study site will be used as the normal reference ranges in the present study. 1. Hematology: A deviation of ±20% from the upper or lower limit of the normal range 2. Blood biochemistry: A deviation from the normal range for AST, ALT, creatinine (Cre), HbA1c or serum electrolytes. A deviation of ±20% from the upper or lower limit of the normal range for other items than the above. However, the lower limit of the normal range will not be established for items for which a deviation from the lower limit is not considered clinically significant[AST, ALT, total bilirubin (TBil), ALP, γGTP, LDH, CK, Cre, uric acid (UA), BUN, and total cholesterol (TCho)]. 3. Urinalysis: UGlc and/or UPro results of (±) or worse UUro results of (+) or worse 4. Urinary drug test: A positive result for phencyclidine, benzodiazepine, cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis, opiates, barbiturates or tricyclic antidepressants 5. Immunological test: A positive result for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis, or HIV History of treatment, including medication, within 14 days before the start of study drug administration Consumption of food or beverages containing St. John's Wort within 14 days before the start of study drug administration, or consumption of grapefruit Previous participation in a pre or postmarketing clinical study of another prescription drug or a medical device within 120 days before the study History of administration of quetiapine History of administration of fluvoxamine Whole blood sampling of 400 mL or more within 90 days before the screening assessment, whole blood sampling of 200 mL or more within 30 days before the screening assessment, or blood component donation within 14 days before the screening assessment Routine excessive alcohol consumption ("excessive alcohol" is defined as an average of 45 g of alcohol per day [cf., a large bottle of beer containing 25 g of alcohol, 180 mL of sake containing 22 g of alcohol]) Subjects with a smoking habit (except those who quit smoking at least 90 days before the screening assessment)</criteria>
