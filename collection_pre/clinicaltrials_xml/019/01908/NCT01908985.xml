	<brief_summary>Monocentric prospective study conducted in two phases evaluating the secretion and elimination of aqueous humor by fluorophotometry in patients with glaucoma treated with cyclo-coagulation with ultrasound. Population selected: - Patients with refractory open angle glaucoma despite previous treatments currently validated for glaucoma. The purpose of our study is: - To evaluate the mechanism of action of glaucoma treatment by cyclo-coagulation with high intensity focused ultrasound in studying the secretion and elimination of aqueous humor by fluorophotometry. Planning: - First phase: 2 patients (feasibility study) If reduction of at least 10% of the flow of aqueous humor production at one month in the first two patients in the feasibility study, further in second phase. - Second phase: 6 patients</brief_summary>
