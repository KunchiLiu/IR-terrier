	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the benefit of using positron emission tomography (PET) in addition to the standard (computed tomography) CT to plan radiation therapy for cancer treatment. The information from the PET-CT may allow the investigators to change the radiation plan or the delivery of the radiation to the tumor/tumor site such as the total dose of radiation or the size of the area to receive further radiation. Presently the use of PET scans to adjust radiation therapy during radiation treatment is not standard of care and is being investigated in this study.</brief_summary>
