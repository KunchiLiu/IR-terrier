	<brief_summary>In this randomized, controlled clinical trial, we will evaluate the effects of (1) a brain-training program that uses real-time neurofeedback in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to allow people to learn how to gain voluntary control over activity in targeted brain regions and/or (2) 8 weeks of computer-based cognitive training using a software program (Cognitive Remediation for Brain Injury (CRBI)) versus control training tasks on cognitive learning and symptoms. In addition, the investigators will measure brain function (active and resting functional magnetic resonance imaging) and structure (high resolution magnetic resonance imaging) before and after treatment.</brief_summary>
