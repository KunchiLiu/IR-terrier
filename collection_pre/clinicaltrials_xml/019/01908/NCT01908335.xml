	<brief_summary>This dose-escalating study is to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of different doses of a new bio-product Pegylated Recombinant Consensus Interferon Variant Solution for Injection (PEG-IFN-SA) and Ribavirin（RBV） in the treatment of Chronic hepatitis C who have not been previously treated with Interferon(IFN) by exploring the dose-effect relationship, while identity the optimal dose for phase Ⅲ study. In addition, population pharmacokinetic method is adopted to assess the pharmacokinetic behavior, individuals / intra-individual variability, and the possible factors for further study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase Ⅱ Dose-escalating Study of PEG-IFN-SA and Ribavirin in IFN Naive Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total 200 subjects will be randomized and enrolled into four groups proportionally receiving experimental drug of high dose, middle dose, low dose and positive-control drug. Treatment duration will be 24 or 48 weeks corresponding to different HCV genotype, genotype 2,3 and non-genotype2,3.</detailed_description>
