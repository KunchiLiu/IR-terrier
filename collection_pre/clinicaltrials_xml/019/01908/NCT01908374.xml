	<brief_title>Bioavailability of EPA and DHA From Two Dietary Supplements</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the acute and sub-chronic (2 week) bioavailability of EPA and DHA from two marine oil supplements consumed with a meal in men and women with mildly elevated triglycerides. The supplements provide similar amounts of EPA + DHA esterified as either triglycerides; or esterified as phospholipids and triglycerides.</detailed_description>
