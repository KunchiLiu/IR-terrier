	<brief_title>Correlation of Venous Oxygen Saturation Measurements by Non-invasive Mespere Venous Oximeter and Central Venous Catheter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The conventional pulse oximeter has been a standard in clinical care for non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring, which only measures arterial blood oxygenation. The clinical application of venous oximetry is numerous, including severe sepsis and septic shock, severe trauma and hemorrhagic shock, and heart failure and cardiac arrest. The existing method for venous blood oxygenation monitored is either through an invasive fiber optic catheter, or intermittently by blood sampling and CO-Oximetry. However, catheterization can be costly and can include inherent risks. Therefore, due to the inherent risks of catheterization, venous oximetry is limited only to critically ill patients. By non-invasively monitoring venous blood oxygenation, the Mespere Oximeter provides more complete information on patient hemodynamics.</detailed_description>
