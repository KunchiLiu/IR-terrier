Progression following at least 1 prior systemic treatment for HCC. 5. Recovery to from toxicities related to any prior treatments. 6. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. 7. Adequate hematologic and renal function, based upon meeting protocol defined laboratory criteria within 7 days before randomization. 8. ChildPugh Score of A. 9. Antiviral therapy per local standard of care if active hepatitis B (HBV) infection. 10. Sexually active fertile subjects(male and female)must agree to use medically accepted methods of contraception during the course of the study and for 4 months after the last dose of study treatment. 11.

Receipt of more than 2 prior systemic therapies for advanced HCC. 3. Any type of anticancer agent (including investigational) within 2 weeks before randomization. 4. Radiation therapy within 4 weeks (2 weeks for radiation for bone metastases) or radionuclide treatment within 6 weeks of randomization. 5. Prior cabozantinib treatment. 6. Known brain metastases or cranial epidural disease unless adequately treated with radiotherapy and/or surgery and stable for at least 3 months before randomization. 7. Concomitant anticoagulation, at therapeutic doses, with anticoagulants. 8. Serious illness other than cancer that would preclude safe participation in the study. 9.
