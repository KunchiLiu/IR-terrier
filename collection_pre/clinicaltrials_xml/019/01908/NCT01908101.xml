	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well eribulin mesylate works in treating patients with previously treated breast cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as eribulin mesylate, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Eribulin Mesylate in Treating Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Progression free survival (PFS). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Frequency of alopecia with absence or decrease to &lt; 50%. II. Incidence of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia of &lt; 30%. III. Incidence of sensory neuropathy (all grades) to &lt; 25%. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the role of circulating endothelial cell precursors (CEPs) and apoptotic circulating endothelial cells (CECs), in predicting early response to treatment. OUTLINE: Patients receive eribulin mesylate intravenously (IV) over 2-5 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.</detailed_description>
