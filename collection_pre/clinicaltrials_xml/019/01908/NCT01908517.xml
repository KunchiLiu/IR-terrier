	<brief_summary>There has been very limited research that has looked at electronic reminders (text messages) and its effectiveness in adherence to vaccination among low-income minority populations. Results have shown that text messages, among low-income parents and adolescents who were identified as having a cellphone, is an effective strategy to increase the likelihood of adolescent vaccination adherence. Hard copy and electronic messaging reminders have also been proven to be effective when coupled with other prevention strategies for immunizations for influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia and screening for colon, breast, and cervical cancer in adults. Additionally, Merck and Co. recommend electronic reminders in their patient compliance program as a key strategy for adherence. To our knowledge, this community-based pilot intervention study will be the first to assess electronic reminders and HPV vaccine initiation and adherence among rural uninsured and Medicaid populations. The investigators hypothesize that adolescent whose parents who receive the intervention will be more likely to initiate HPV vaccination and be compliant at 3 months and at 7 months as compared to the control group.</brief_summary>
