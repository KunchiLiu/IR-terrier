	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to determine the most effective and/or the least effective treatment of benzodiazepine-refractory status epilepticus (SE) among patients older than 2 years. There are three active treatment arms being compared: fosphenytoin (FOS),levetiracetam (LEV), and valproic acid (VPA). The second objective is comparison of three drugs with respect to secondary outcomes. The final objective is to ensure that the trial is informative for treatment of established SE in children by describing the effectiveness, safety, and rate of adverse reactions of these drugs in children.</brief_summary>
