	<brief_summary>If the heart fails to pump a sufficient amount of blood, it is crucial to know why in order to provide the best treatment. Pressure-volume analysis is the gold standard for evaluating the heart's pumping function. Unfortunately, current techniques are invasive, so most patients will not get this examination. By combining the strengths of echo-Doppler ultrasound, blood pressure monitoring and biomedical computing, the investigators aim to develop a non-invasive method for pressure-volume analysis, extending its applicability to more patients and settings.</brief_summary>
