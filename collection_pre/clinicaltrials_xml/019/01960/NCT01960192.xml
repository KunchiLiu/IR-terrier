	<detailed_description>Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare B-cell variant of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is confined to the brain, leptomeninges, spinal cord, and eyes. The optimum treatment for patients with PCNSL remains challenging and at present there is no universally accepted therapeutic approach for patients with newly diagnosed disease.
