	<brief_summary>Patients who on taking clopidogrel are randomized to either continue clopidogrel into general surgery or discontinue clopidogrel 7 days before surgery. All patients resume clopidogrel after surgery. The investigators track the development of bleeding complications that may develop within 90 days of the surgery. Patients are medically cleared to be in either arm of the study by their cardiologist and surgeon. There is currently no evidence to support for or against the use continuation or discontinuation of clopidogrel prior to general surgery.</brief_summary>
