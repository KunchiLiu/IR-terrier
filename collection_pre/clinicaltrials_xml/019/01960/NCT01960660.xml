	<brief_summary>Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids has been extensively researched and is known to provide healthful benefits for patients with a diversity of conditions and diseases. Not all omega-3 supplements are created equally however; some sources of omega-3 fatty acids are superior to others due to a greater bioavailability of omega-3 fatty acids than others, differences in source material, and processing techniques.
