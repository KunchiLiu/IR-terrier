	<brief_summary>Dietary manipulation is proving to be an effective lifestyle strategy to combat the obesity epidemic. Increased dietary protein is one effective strategy. For example, increased whey protein ingestion with and without exercise training is associated with enhanced weight loss, body composition and subjective hunger in overweight and obese individuals. Our findings suggest that the effects of whey protein ingestion occur independent of a calorie-restricted diet and to a greater extent in individuals following a combined exercise program of resistance exercise, sprint intervals, stretching/yoga/pilates, and aerobic exercise training compared to standard resistance training.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Whey Protein Intake With and Without Exercise on Visceral Fat: The P+RISE Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was a 16 week whey protein and exercise training intervention in middle aged overweight/obese adults. Subjects were randomized into 3 groups: Whey protein only consumed as 20 grams per serving three times per day (total 60 grams per day) (WP); Whey protein and resistance exercise training (WP-RT); and Whey protein and combined exercise training (P+RISE). All outcomes, including the primary outcome of visceral fat was measured at baseline (week 0) and post-intervention (week 17) in all study subjects.</detailed_description>
