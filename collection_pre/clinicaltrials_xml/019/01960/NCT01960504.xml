	<criteria>Subject is &gt; 18 years and &lt; 80 years of age Written subject informed consent available prior to PCI Subjects with stable or unstable angina pectoris or documented silent ischemia Subject eligible for PCI Subject acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass surgery Subjects with a maximum of two single lesions in two separate coronary arteries which have to be de novo lesions. Reference vessel diameter between 2.23.8 mm by visual estimation Target lesion length ≤ 21 mm by visual estimation Target lesion stenosis by visual estimation, assisted by QCA / IVUS: &gt; 50% &lt; 100% Eligible for Dual Anti Platelet Therapy (DAPT) Pregnant or breastfeeding females or females who intend to become pregnant during the time of the study Evidence of myocardial infarction within 72 hours prior to index procedure Subjects with a ≥2 fold CK level or in absence of CK a ≥3 fold CKMB level above the upper range limit within 24 hours prior to the procedure Unprotected left main coronary artery disease Threevessel coronary artery disease at time of procedure Thrombus in target vessel Subject is currently participating in another study with an investigational device or an investigational drug and has not reached the primary endpoint yet Planned interventional treatment of any nontarget vessel within 30 days postprocedure Subjects on dialysis Planned intervention of the target vessel within 6month after the index procedure Ostial target lesion (within 5.0 mm of vessel origin) Target lesion involves a side branch &gt;2.0 mm in diameter Documented left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 30% Heavily calcified lesion Target lesion is located in or supplied by an arterial or venous bypass graft The target lesion requires treatment with a device other than the predilatation balloon prior to scaffold placement (including but not limited to, rotational atherectomy, cutting balloon etc.) Known allergies to: Acetylsalicylic Acid (ASA), Heparin, Contrast medium, Sirolimus, or similar drugs; or the scaffold material Impaired renal function (serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dl or 221 mmol/l, determined within 72 hours prior to intervention) Subject is receiving oral or intravenous immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., inhaled steroids are not excluded) or has known lifelimiting immunosuppressive or autoimmune disease (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus, systemic lupus erythematosus, but not including diabetes mellitus) Proximal or distal to the target lesion located stenosis that might require future revascularization or impede run off detected during diagnostic angiography Life expectancy less than 1 year Planned surgery or dental surgical procedure within 6 months after index procedure In the investigators opinion subjects will not be able to comply with the followup requirements</criteria>
