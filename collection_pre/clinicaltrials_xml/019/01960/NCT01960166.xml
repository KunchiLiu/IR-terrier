	<brief_summary>The investigators proposed study will investigate the efficacy of tablet computer distraction as an analgesic for the pain associated with various painful procedures in the emergency department. Since prior studies have shown that distraction by a parent or nurse can be an effective analgesic, there is reason to believe that tablet computer distraction will similarly reduce pain. Participants in the control group will receive a cartoon on the TV monitor in the patient room, while participants in the study group will receive a more immersive distraction of playing a game or watching a cartoon (for children too young to play a game) on a tablet computer. Data from this study will help inform best practices for administering painful procedures in a way that minimizes pain.</brief_summary>
