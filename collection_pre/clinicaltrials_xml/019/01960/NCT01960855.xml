	<criteria>Diagnosed with RA based on either the 1987revised American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria or the 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) criteria for ≥ 3 months. Subjects must have been receiving oral or parenteral MTX therapy ≥ 3 months and on a stable prescription of 7.5 to 25 mg/week for at least 4 weeks prior to initiating the study drug. Subjects should also be on a stable dose of folic acid (or equivalent) for at least 4 weeks prior to initiating the study drug. Subjects should continue with their stable doses of MTX and folic acid throughout the study Subjects have been treated with 1 or more antiTNF biologics (no maximum cap) for ≥ 3 months but continue to exhibit active RA, or had to discontinue due to intolerability or toxicity. In addition, subjects with prior exposure to nonantiTNF biologic(s) (no maximum cap) (e.g., abatacept, rituximab, anakinra, or tocilizumab) are allowed. Have active RA as defined by the following minimum disease activity criteria: &gt;= 6 swollen joints (based on 66 joint counts) at Screening and Baseline, &gt;= 6 tender joints (based on 68 joint counts) at Screening and Baseline, hsCRP &gt; Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) OR positive for both rheumatoid factor and antiCCP antibody. Prior exposure to Janus Activated Kinase (JAK) inhibitor (e.g. tofacitinib, baricitinib) Pregnant or breastfeeding female Ongoing or active infection.</criteria>
