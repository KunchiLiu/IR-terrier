	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this prospective, Randomized, Controlled, Multicentre, Open Study is to investigate the inhibition of restenosis by the Paclitaxel-eluting Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloon Freeway versus PTA alone in the treatment of de-novo occluded, stenotic or reoccluded, restenotic superficial femoral (SFA) or popliteal arteries.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or nonpregnant female (&gt; 18 years of age) with symptomatic ischemia, requiring treatment of SFA or PI segment ( 25 of Rutherford classification) Single and/or multiple de novo occluded, stenotic or reoccluded, restenotic lesion(s) of &gt; 70% , ≤ 15 cm in total length and vessel diameter ≥ 4mm and ≤ 7mm (by visual estimation). Patient provides a signed informed consent and complies with the follow up visits Successful wire crossing of lesion At least one patent (less than 50% stenosis) tibioperoneal runoff vessel Gastrointestinal bleeding or coagulopathy contraindicating use of antiplatelet therapy Known intolerance contraindications to study medications and contrast agents, noncontrollable with medication. Patient actively participating in another device or drug study History of hemorrhagic stroke within 3 months Previous or planned surgical or intervention procedure within 30 days of index procedure Significant untreated inflow disease or no normal arterial segment proximal of lesion in which duplex ultrasound velocity ratios can be measured Acute or subacute thrombus in target vessel Use of adjunctive therapies (i.e. laser, atherectomy, cryoplasty, scoring/cutting balloon) Patients with instent restenosis or prior surgery of the target lesion Patients with abdominal aortic, iliaca or popliteal aneurysm (AAA) with ≥ 4cm diameter</criteria>
