	<brief_summary>The CHROMED project focuses its investigation on the applicability of an integrated solution for a pathological condition which: a) is very prevalent in ageing patients and b) severely impairs quality of life: COPD with other typical comorbidities such as congestive heart failure and sleep disordered breathing. A specific ICT platform in combination with a set of innovative devices will be used to collect and process useful clinical data at the patient's home and used to optimize their medical treatment. To evaluate the impact of this solution, an international multi-centric randomized control trial will be implemented in five European regions: United Kingdom, Sweden, Estonia, Spain and Slovenia, representing different social and organizational contexts in Europe.</brief_summary>
