	<brief_summary>In the USA, every year 795,000 patients suffer a cerebral vascular accident (CVA), which represents a yearly cost of $73.7 billion. CVA is the third main cause of death and the main source of acquired handicap in adults, as a result it is now a key priority in public health and part of " The CVA National Action Plan 2013-2014". Copeptin is a polypeptide, by- product of Vasopressin metabolism. The increase of Copeptin plasma level, as for Vasopressin, is connected to hydric balance disorders found in cardio-vascular, renal and endocrine diseases. This link has already shown its interest in the early diagnosis of myocardial infarction and, in a more indirect way, CVA. Copeptin is associated with acute endogenous stress. It seems to have interesting potential in the diagnosis of CVA by its negative predictive value like D-dimeres in pulmonary embolism. Proadrenomedullin and Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) are both associated with the prognosis of cardio-vascular diseases and could be interesting in evaluating CVA prognosis.</brief_summary>
