	<brief_summary>To determine whether, and if so, which gas exchange parameters measured on the Shape-HF Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing System predict 30 and 180 day re-hospitalization in subjects discharged from hospitalization for an episode of acute decompensated heart failure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gas Exchange for Predicting Hospital Heart Failure Readmissions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, single-specialty clinical study. This study is intended to evaluate the select gas exchange parameters during a short, sub-max bout of exercise using a simple stationary step on day of discharge to predict the subjects' readmission for acute decompensated heart failure.</detailed_description>
