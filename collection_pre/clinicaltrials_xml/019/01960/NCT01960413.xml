	<brief_summary>In this feasibility trial, the investigators will compare participants treated with montelukast and hydroxyurea to those treated with placebo and hydroxyurea for a total of 8 weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study of Montelukast for the Treatment of Sickle Cell Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary hypothesis for this trial is that montelukast adds efficacy to hydroxyurea therapy for improving vaso-occlusion when compared to hydroxyurea alone. The following specific aims will be tested in adolescents and adults with sickle cell disease: Aim 1. To determine whether montelukast versus placebo added to hydroxyurea will improve markers of vaso-occlusion-associated tissue injury in adolescents and adults with sickle cell disease. Aim 2. To evaluate physiologic effects of montelukast versus placebo added to hydroxyurea in adolescents and adults with sickle cell disease. Subaim 2A. To determine if montelukast versus placebo added to hydroxyurea will improve lung function in adolescents and adults with sickle cell disease. Subaim 2B. To determine if montelukast versus placebo added to hydroxyurea will improve forearm microvascular blood flow in adolescents and adults with sickle cell disease, respectively.
