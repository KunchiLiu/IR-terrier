	<brief_summary>This study will investigate a new drug called Infacort®; a newly-developed immediate release formulation of a well-established drug called hydrocortisone. Hydrocortisone is used as a replacement treatment for people whose adrenal glands are not producing enough natural cortisol - a condition known as adrenal insufficiency. The study will assess how Infacort® acts once inside the body, by measuring cortisol and other hormone levels in the body, compared to already marketed hydrocortisone tablet and hydrocortisone intravenous (through the vein) injection. The population who are eligible to take part in the study are healthy male volunteers, aged between 18 and 60 years of age.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Investigational Study of Hydrocortisone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will evaluate the normal physiology, PK and metabolism of cortisol, investigate the PK and bioavailability of cortisol from the test Infacort® Granules (hydrocortisone) and the reference hydrocortisone tablets and i.v injection in healthy adult male volunteers and explore the role of cortisol in the regulation of metabolic pathways.</detailed_description>

Subjects (unless anatomically sterile or where abstaining from sexual intercourse is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject) and sexual partners must use effective contraception methods during the trial and for 3 months after the last dose, for example: Oral contraceptive + condom Intrauterine device (IUD) + condom Diaphragm with spermicide + condom Subjects must be available to complete the study. Subjects must satisfy a medical examiner about their fitness to participate in the study. Subjects must provide written informed consent to participate in the study.
