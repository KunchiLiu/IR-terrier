	<brief_summary>Cirrhosis is associated with a reduction in muscle mass and exercise capacity. This has an impact on morbidity and mortality. Regular aerobic exercise training is a proven effective therapy to improve exercise capacity in healthy and clinical populations. The effect of this training has not yet been evaluated in the decompensated cirrhosis patient population. The safety of this intervention also requires further study. Using a randomized controlled design, the investigators aim to determine the safety and efficacy of eight weeks of aerobic exercise training on aerobic capacity, functional performance, and muscle mass in decompensated cirrhosis patients.</brief_summary>
