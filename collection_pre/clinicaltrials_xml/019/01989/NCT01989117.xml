	<brief_summary>Osteopathy is an alternative healthcare that seems effective in relieving the pain of patients. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of preoperative osteopathic care in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for osteoarthritis. The secondary objectives are to assess pain during the first postoperative month on a VAS and knee function and quality of life at 6 months and 1 year. Our hypothesis is that osteopathy will decrease postoperative pain and increase knee function.</brief_summary>
