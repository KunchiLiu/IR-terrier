	<brief_summary>The study purpose is to examine polymorphism of genes associated to post-operative persistent pain and to verify the possible association between genotype phenotype and ADRB2 polymorphism in orthopaedic surgery. The primary aim is to evaluate the expression of ADBR2 in VAS&gt;4 patients and to compare it to those with VAS&lt;4.</brief_summary>
