	<brief_summary>It is important to identify and evaluate foods, such as strawberries, that can improve established and emerging cardiovascular risk factors, such as postprandial lipid and glycemic responses, and vascular health. Postprandial derangements may affect multiple metabolic pathways that lead to increased arterial stiffness. Research has demonstrated the potential of strawberries to ameliorate postprandial responses to a high fat/high glucose meal. Further research is needed to demonstrate this effect in better controlled clinical studies and explore whether metabolic effects lead to improved arterial health. The investigators propose to examine the effects of adding 40 g of freeze-dried strawberry powder to a high fat/high glucose meal on postprandial cardiovascular risk factor including lipids, insulin, glucose, and arterial stiffness and central blood pressure. The investigators hypothesize that the bioactive components of strawberry powder will attenuate postprandial lipemic and glycemic responses, as well as improve measures of arterial health.</brief_summary>
