	<brief_summary>To evaluate optimal usage of bevacizumab to compare which is better, continuing bevacizumab and paclitaxel or switching to hormonal maintenance therapy followed by bevacizumab+paclitaxel after induction therapy of bevacizumab+paclitaxel. To examine biomarkers such as monitoring markers of study treatment as exploratory analysis.</brief_summary>
