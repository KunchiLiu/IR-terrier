	<brief_title>Study to Investigate Relative Bioavailability of up to Five Different Formulations of AZD5069</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An Open-label, Single Centre Relative Bioavailability Study With an Adaptive Design Comparing up to 5 Solid Oral AZD5069 Formulations After Single Dose Administration to Healthy Volunteers</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Healthy male and/or female volunteers aged 18 to 50 years (inclusive). 2. Nonsmokers or exsmokers with no smoking history for the last 3 months prior to screening. 3. Body mass index (BMI) ≥18.0 and ≤30.0 kg/m2 calculated from height and weight at screening; minimum (min) weight 50 kg and maximum (max) weight 100 kg. 4. Healthy volunteers with neutrophil counts within the laboratory range at screening. 1. A definite or suspected personal history of severe allergy, intolerance or hypersensitivity or ongoing allergy to drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to AZD5069 and/or the excipients, as judged to be clinically relevant by the Investigator. 2. Healthy volunteers who have previously received AZD5069. 3. Volunteers with latent tuberculosis as suggested by their history and judged by the Investigator; confirmatory testing with eg, Quantiferon(R) TB Gold may be done if required. 4. Volunteers who have received live or liveattenuated vaccine in the 2 weeks prior to the first administration of the IP</criteria>
