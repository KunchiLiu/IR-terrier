	<brief_title>Effects of Hallux Valgus Deformity on Rear Foot Position, Pain, Function, and Quality of Life in Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To investigate relationship between HV deformity and position of rearfoot joints, and its effects on the quality of life, pain, and related functional status in women with bilateral hallux valgus (HV). Study included 27 right-dominant women. Demographic data, HV angle, weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing subtalar pronation (SP), and navicular height were recorded. Visual Analog Scale, Foot Function Index (FFI), and the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) MTP-IP along with AOFAS Mid foot (MF) Scales, and SF-36 were used. HV angle, weight-bearing SP, and pain intensity of the left foot were higher. HV angle of left foot was correlated with all sub-sections of FFI, pain parameter of AOFAS MTP-IP, and pain and total score of AOFAS-MF Scale ). HV angle of left foot was correlated with physical role, pain, and social function sub-domains of SF-36. Right HV angles were correlated with right foot pain and non-weight-bearing SP.Increasing HV angle and pathomechanical changes in rear foot were correlated. Besides, although all participants were right-dominant, their left foot problems were more highlighted.</detailed_description>
