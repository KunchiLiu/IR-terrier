	<brief_summary>The positional plagiocephaly is a condition involving craniofacial asymmetry. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the spine, the posture and the psychomotor state in children who were diagnosed with infant plagiocephaly.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Positional infant plagiocephaly is a clinical entity in which the shape of an infant's head becomes altered as the result of external forces applied to the malleable bones of the cranium and can occur pre- or postnatally. It is characterized by asymmetric occipital flattening (one side or the central part of the occiput is flattened)with ipsilateral frontal bossing.Viewed from above, this results in a parallelogram deformity of the head. We hypothesize that children who had plagiocephaly when they were infants, they have postural and spine implications at 3-5 years old.</detailed_description>
