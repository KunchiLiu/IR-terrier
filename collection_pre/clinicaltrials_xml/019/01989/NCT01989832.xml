	<brief_summary>The prevalence of renal acute rejection in transplantation is reduced thanks to the optimized use of immunosuppressive drugs. However, graft survival at ten years has not improved since then; this may be explained in part by the toxicity of these drugs, viral infections, and other comorbidities (diabetes, cardiovascular diseases â€¦). According to transplant center, strategies for the combination of immunosuppressive drugs are different, and probably involve a difference in the global cost of patient management. There is no recommendation in France to establish similar practices. EPHEGREN is an observational, prospective, multicentric, pharmacoeconomic study for the renal transplant patients.</brief_summary>
