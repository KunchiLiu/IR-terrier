	<detailed_description>The investigators would like to conduct a randomized clinical trial to compare the efficacy of diabetes treatment between different gastric bypass procedures involving type 2 diabetics patients with BMI from 27.5 to 35 kg/m2. This program will determine the relative effectiveness among LMGB 、RYGB and SADJB .The primary end point including HbA1C&lt;6.0%, LDL-C&lt;100mg/dl and SBP&lt;130mmHg at one year after surgery. Through this study, the investigators may understand which gastric bypass is the best for type 2 diabetic's treatment. The investigators also hope some new treatment modulation may be developed.</detailed_description>
