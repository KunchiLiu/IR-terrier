	<mesh_term>Glioblastoma</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Histologically confirmed GBM. GBM in recurrence/progression after surgery (or biopsy), standard radiotherapy and chemotherapy with Temozolomide. Imaging confirmation of first tumor progression or regrowth as defined by the RANO criteria. No more than one prior line of chemotherapy (Temozolomide). Recovery from the toxic effects of prior therapy. Patients who have undergone recent surgery for recurrent or progressive tumor are eligible provided that: 1. Surgery must have confirmed the recurrence. 2. A minimum of 14 days must have elapsed from the day of surgery to registration. For core or needle biopsy, a minimum of 7 days must have elapsed prior to registration. 3. Craniotomy or intracranial biopsy site must be adequately healed and free of drainage or cellulitis, and the underlying cranioplasty must appear intact at the time of registration. Age ≥ 18 years. Willingness and ability to provide written informed consent and to comply with the study protocol as judged by the investigator. KarnofskyPS ≥ 60%. Stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids within 5 days prior to registration. Patients unable to undergo brain MRI scans with gadolinium (iv). Preexisting peripheral neuropathy, grade ≥ 2. History of intracranial abscess within 6 months prior to registration. Anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the trial. Treatment with enzyme inducing antiepileptic agents was not allowed. However, patients whose anticonvulsant was changed to a nonenzymeinducing antiepileptic drug were eligible for entry after a 1week ''washout'' period</criteria>
