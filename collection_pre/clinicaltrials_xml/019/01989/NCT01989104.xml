	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to measure and link cadence (number of steps taken in a minute) to intensity of physical activity (e.g., low-intensity, moderate-intensity, vigorous-intensity) in children and adolescents (6-20 years-old), and to identify the cadence values corresponding to children's and adolescent's behavior during simulated free-living activities.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Procedure - 1 visit - (approximately 3 hours in total) Day of Testing: Participant must be FASTED - No food for 4 hours before visit. All of the study procedures involving the participant will be completed in a single testing session (one-day - approximately 3 hours) at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center. If preferred, two visits on separate days can be scheduled to complete the protocol. - Screening questions (approximately 3-5 minutes) o Participants (or their legal guardian) will be asked to answer several screening questions to determine their eligibility for participating in CADENCE-KIDS. - Height and weight measures data collection (approximately 10 minutes) - Height will be measured. - Body weight and body fat percentage will be measured using a specialized scale. - Waist circumference will then be measured using a measuring tape. - Instrument attachment, treadmill walking, free-living activities (approximately 140 minutes) - Participants will be fitted with 10 devices (Digi-Walker Pedometer, NL-1000 Pedometer, StepWatch Activity Monitor, SenseWear Armband, GT3X+ accelerometer, GENEActiv Accelerometer, Actical Accelerometer, ActivPal Accelerometer, Polar Heart Rate Monitor, K4b2 Portable Metabolic Unit) to measure/monitor physical activity throughout the testing session. - Participants will then complete several low intensity free-living activities while their physical activity and oxygen uptake are concurrently assessed. Specifically, participants will rest in a chair, watch a portion of a child-friendly movie while seated in a chair, and color in a coloring book while seated in a chair. Each activity will last for 5 minutes and a 2 minute rest will occur between each activity. - Participants will then complete a series of walking bouts on a treadmill while their physical activity and oxygen uptake are concurrently assessed. The walking bouts start at 0.5 miles per hour and end at 5 miles per hour (0.5 miles per hour increments). Treadmill testing stops when the participant finishes the bout where they naturally select to jog/run, or following the completion of the last bout at 5.0 miles per hour, whichever occurs first. A 2 minute rest will occur between each treadmill bout. - Participants will then complete three additional free-living activities where physical activity and oxygen uptake continue to be concurrently measured. Specifically, participants will step up and down on an aerobic step at 88 beats per minute, dribble a basketball, and perform jumping jacks at 126 beats per minute (63 jumping jacks per minute). Each activity will last for 5 minutes and a 2 minute rest will occur between each activity.</detailed_description>
