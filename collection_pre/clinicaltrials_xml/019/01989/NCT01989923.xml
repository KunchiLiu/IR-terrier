	<brief_title>Smoking Cessation in Women With Gynecological Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will allow women with serious gynecological conditions to sample both traditional nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (electronic cigarettes, ENDS). Whether the woman samples NRT or ENDS first will be randomized. Women will choose the product they wish to try for a 6-week intervention period for smoking cessation. Women choosing NRT will receive a 6-week intervention of a daily nicotine patch plus either nicotine gum or lozenges to use (as needed) throughout the day. The ENDS group will receive an electronic cigarette device with refills to last the 6-week duration of the study. Both groups will receive identical tobacco cessation counseling. As part of the study, each subject will complete a survey conducted at baseline, 6-weeks into the study during intervention, and upon completion of a 6 week follow-up period in which participants receive no intervention. At the 12-week measurement period we will add a qualitative interview that will allow us to ask the women whether the methods were acceptable, caused any problems, and if so, what the problems entailed.</detailed_description>
