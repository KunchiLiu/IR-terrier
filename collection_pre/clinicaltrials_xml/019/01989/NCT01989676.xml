	<brief_summary>The current study will compare the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of PF-05280014 in combination with paclitaxel versus trastuzumab sourced from the European Union (trastuzumab-EU) with paclitaxel in female patients with HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer in the first-line treatment setting. The hypothesis to be tested in this study is that the efficacy (ORR) of PF-05280014 is similar to trastuzumab-EU.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer. Presence of metastatic disease. Documentation of HER2 gene amplification or overexpression. Available tumor tissue for central review of HER2 status. At least 1 measurable lesion as defined by RECIST 1.1. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status of 0 to 2. Left ventricular ejection fraction within institutional range of normal, measured by either two dimensional echocardiogram or multigated acquisition scan. Relapse within 1 year of last dose of previous adjuvant (including neoadjuvant) treatment (except endocrine therapy) and within 1 year before randomization. Prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease (except endocrine therapy). Prior cumulative dose of doxorubicin of &gt;400 mg/m2, epirubicin dose &gt;800 mg/m^2, or the equivalent dose for other anthracyclines or derivatives (eg, 72 mg/m^2 of mitoxantrone). If the patient has received more than one anthracycline, then the cumulative dose must not exceed the equivalent of 400 mg/m^2 of doxorubicin. Inflammatory breast cancer. Active uncontrolled or symptomatic central nervous system metastases.</criteria>
