	<brief_summary>The study aims to investigate efficacy and safety of nasal mask and prongs used in non-invasive ventilation in newborns by using esophageal pressure transducer. The parameters including ventilation duration, hospitalization duration, pulmonary outcomes and side effects will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nasal Mask and Prong Use in Non-invasive Ventilation for Newborns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although it seems as more non-invasive there is still lack of data especially on efficacy of nasal mask use in NIV for newborns. By using esophageal pressure transducers we will evaluate the pressure supplied by the ventilation mode and compare it with more commonly used nasal prongs. The investigators will test the hypothesis of equivalence of nasal mask in comparison to prongs with better safety parameters.</detailed_description>
