	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to compare the combined ultrasound-guided supraclavicular brachial plexus block and distal median, radial, and ulnar nerve blocks, with supraclavicular block alone. Sixty two patients undergoing upper extremity surgery will be randomized to supraclavicular only (Group S, n=31) or supraclavicular + distal (Group SD, n=31) group. Patients in group S will receive 32 mL of lidocaine 1.5% + epinephrine 5µg/mL and in group SD receive 20 mL of lidocaine 1.5% + epinephrine 5µg/mL followed by a distal median, radial, and ulnar nerve blocks using 50:50 mixture of lidocaine 2% + levobupivacaine 0.5% (4 mL/nerve). Sensory and motor block of the ulnar, median, radial and musculocutaneous nerves will be assessed every 5 minutes starting at the 10th minutes. The imaging, needling and performance times will be recorded. Also the onset and anesthesia related times, need for analgesic and first analgesic time will be noted.</brief_summary>
