	<brief_summary>Few data are currently available in the literature on pancreatic adenocarcinoma in France. About 8,000 new cases each year in France. The 5-year survival for all stages combined is &lt;5%. This is the only digestive cancer in which mortality / incidence ratio is 98%. Epidemiological characteristics at diagnosis, the impact on the survival of recent advances related to surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy and new standard forms of adjuvant chemotherapy (FOLFIRINOX) are mispriced in real life. The development of new drugs and the development of Phase II and III require a better understanding of the state of this disease in the country. The main objective is to describe the characteristics of the pancreatic adenocarcinoma at diagnosis in France and make an inventory of diagnostic practices and support.</brief_summary>
