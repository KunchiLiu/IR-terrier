	<brief_title>Study of the Physical Activity in Anesthesiologists</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to: 1. Measure and compare the physical activity of the anesthesiology residents and attendings during routine daily work in the main operating room as determined by the pedometer-counted steps walked by every individual 2. Estimate the physical activity outside of work by responding to survey of the past seven day exercise recall The primary objective of this study is to compare the physical activity of resident and attending anesthesiologists. We hypothesize that the attendings will walk more steps than residents at work, but it is possible that the residents will be more active in their spare time. In addition, we hypothesize that the first year residents, likely associated with inefficiency in work pattern, will have more physical activity at work compared to the third year residents. The final objective of this study is to compare the physical activity of these two groups to the recommended guidelines for healthy lifestyle. We anticipate that this study will provide us with an idea of the physical activity of the 'average anesthesiologist' in USA and will be useful for determining the need of promoting exercise for healthier lifestyle.</detailed_description>
