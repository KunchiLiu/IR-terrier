Have undergone a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy; 3. Have medically confirmed ovarian failure. All other female subjects (including females with tubal ligations and females that do NOT have a documented hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy and/or ovarian failure) will be considered to be of childbearing potential. Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs). Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the subject (or a legal representative) has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.

Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of dosing). Subjects with a history of or current positive results for any of the following serological tests: Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), anti Hepatitis C antibody (HCV Ab) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Subjects with a history of autoimmune disorders. Subjects with a history of allergic or anaphylactic reaction to a therapeutic drug. History of tuberculosis or active, latent or inadequately treated tuberculosis infection. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local requirement, whichever is longer) or 5 half lives or 180 days for biologics preceding the first dose of study medication.
