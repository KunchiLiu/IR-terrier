	<brief_summary>Evaluate if the ad libitum use of the THS 2.2 Menthol (mTHS), a candidate Modified Risk Tobacco Product, for 5 days in confinement, and after 86 days in an ambulatory setting, by apparently adult healthy smokers results in a reduction in the levels of biomarkers of exposure (BoExp) to selected harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reduced Exposure Study Using THS 2.2 Menthol (5 Days in a Confinement Setting, Then 86 Days in an Ambulatory Setting)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main goal of the study is to evaluate if the ad libitum use of the THS 2.2 Menthol (mTHS) for 5 days in confinement, and after 86 days in an ambulatory setting, by apparently adult healthy smokers results in a reduction in the levels of biomarkers of exposure (BoExp) to selected harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs) compared to smokers continuing smoking their own preferred brand of menthol conventional cigarette (mCC) and smoking abstinence (SA). Smokers who remained abstinent from SA were used as a benchmark to provide context to the exposure reduction.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Smoking, apparently healthy subject as judged by the Investigator. Subject smokes at least 10 commercially available mCCs per day (no brand restrictions) for the last 4 weeks, based on selfreporting. Subject has smoked for at least the last 3 consecutive years. Subject does not plan to quit smoking within the next 6 months. As per Investigator judgment, the subject cannot participate in the study for any reason (e.g., medical, psychiatric, and/or social reason). The subject has received medication within 14 days or within 5 halflives of the medication (whichever is longer), which has an impact on CYP1A2 or CYP2A6 activity. For women: Subject is pregnant or is breast feeding. For women: Subject does not agree to use an acceptable method of effective contraception.</criteria>
