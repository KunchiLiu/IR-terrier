	<brief_summary>This partially randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of dabrafenib, trametinib, and navitoclax and to see how well they work in treating patients with v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) mutant melanoma or solid tumors that have spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery. Dabrafenib, trametinib, and navitoclax may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dabrafenib, Trametinib, and Navitoclax in Treating Patients With BRAF Mutant Melanoma or Solid Tumors That Are Metastatic or Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), toxicity, and safety profile of navitoclax when given in combination with dabrafenib and trametinib in patients with BRAF-mutant solid tumors. (Phase I) II. To estimate the complete response (CR) rate in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma treated with dabrafenib, trametinib, and navitoclax as compared to the historical control dabrafenib and trametinib combination (DT). (Phase II) III. To compare the maximal tumor regression in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma treated with dabrafenib, trametinib versus dabrafenib, trametinib, and navitoclax. (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To describe pharmacodynamics effects of treatment with dabrafenib, trametinib, and navitoclax on both serial tumor biopsies and serial blood draws in a small subset of patients treated with BRAF-mutant melanoma. (Phase I) II. To describe the pharmacokinetics of treatment with dabrafenib, trametinib, and navitoclax. (Phase I) III. To compare the progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and overall response rate (ORR) in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma treated with dabrafenib, trametinib, versus dabrafenib, trametinib, and navitoclax. (Phase II) IV. To compare the degree of apoptosis induced in on-treatment biopsies of patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma treated with dabrafenib, trametinib versus dabrafenib, trametinib, and navitoclax. (Phase II) V. To explore other pharmacodynamic effects in on-treatment biopsies of patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma treated with either dabrafenib, trametinib versus dabrafenib, trametinib, and navitoclax including cell proliferation (Ki-67), proteomics (reverse-phase protein microarrays [RPPA]), and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family gene expression analysis. (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of dabrafenib, trametinib, and navitoclax followed by a randomized phase II study. PHASE I: Patients receive navitoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days -7 to -1 of course 1 only. Patients also receive dabrafenib PO twice daily (BID), trametinib PO QD, and navitoclax PO QD days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive dabrafenib PO BID and trametinib PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive navitoclax PO QD days -7 to -1 of course 1 only. Patients also receive dabrafenib PO BID, trametinib PO QD, and navitoclax PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days.</detailed_description>
