	<brief_summary>Background: - Vaccines create resistance to disease. This study tests experimental human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccines that use an adenovirus as a transporter. Transporters may help vaccines stimulate an immune response against HIV. This means the body works to fight infection. Researchers want to see if different ways of giving the vaccines cause different immune responses. They also want to see if the vaccines adenovirus is contagious. Adenoviruses cause cold symptoms or mild eye infections. Participants cannot get HIV from these vaccines. But they can get the adenovirus, so their entire household and intimate contacts must participate. Objective: - To test the safety of experimental HIV vaccines. Eligibility: - Healthy adults 18 49 years old. Design: - Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine tests. - Participants will receive the vaccine 3 times over 6 months. Each time, they will have a physical exam and blood and urine tests. Samples will be taken from their nose, rectum, and cervix. - Some participants will receive the vaccine by swallowing 11 capsules with water. Clinic staff will observe them for 1 hour. - Some participants will receive the vaccine swabbed in their throat. They will get dose 1 at the hospital and stay there for 1 week. They will have medical tests and nose swabs. Doses 2 and 3 will not require a hospital stay. - Participants will have 7 follow-up visits over 6 months, with a physical exam and blood tests. Samples will be taken from their nose, throat, and rectum. - Household and intimate contacts will have 4 clinic visits over 8 months, with a physical exam and blood tests.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Safety and Immunogenicity of HIV Vaccines in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1, single center, randomized, double-blind study designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of live, replication-competent recombinant Adenovirus type 4-HIV vaccine regimens. The oral route will also contain a placebo control. The vaccine candidates Ad4-mgag and Ad4-EnvC150 will be formulated as enteric-coated capsules to be delivered orally, and as an aqueous formulation for intranasal administration. Determining the optimal regimen and route will greatly accelerate investigations of these vectors as HIV vaccine platforms. Participants volunteering to receive the vaccine orally will be randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms, and those volunteering to receive the vaccine via the intranasal route will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. Participants will receive either 1 or both vaccines or placebo, depending on group assignment. The study vaccines will be administered to participants in 3 rounds of vaccination at 0, 2, and 6 months. All participants will receive a booster vaccination with a bivalent HIV gp120 glycoprotein at 8 months. Intranasal vaccine recipients will receive the first vaccine in the NIH Special Clinical Studies Unit or other appropriate unit and be followed on an inpatient basis to allow for respiratory isolation. Beginning 4 days after vaccination, participants will be tested daily for respiratory shedding of Ad4 by nasopharyngeal wash. They will be discharged to home with close monitoring on Day 7 or after 2 consecutive negative washes, whichever comes first; they may remain on the unit longer if medically necessary. Prior to receiving the second dose of vaccine on an outpatient basis, seroconversion to Ad4 will be confirmed in the intranasal vaccine recipients. Those that have not seroconverted will continue to receive subsequent doses as inpatients until they show seroconversion. Alternatively, they may withdraw from the study and will be replaced. Oral capsule recipients will be vaccinated and discharged to home. In addition to clinical and laboratory monitoring of safety, the principal assessments will be shedding of this viruses in rectal, cervicovaginal, throat, and nasal swabs, and assessment of the antibody (mucosal and systemic) response to the HIV and to the Ad4 virus. The candidate vaccines will also be administered to 2 groups of participants who have previously received an unrelated HIV vaccine in another clinical study and/or are Ad4 seropositive. The aim for these groups is to explore the boost potential of the enteric coated capsule and aqueous formulations of the Ad4-mgag and Ad4- EnvC150 vaccines when given to subjects who have previously received another HIV vaccine and/or are Ad4 seropositive. All participants will be followed for a total of 14 months. Household and intimate contacts will also be enrolled and monitored for Adenovirus and HIV antibodies over 8 months.</detailed_description>
