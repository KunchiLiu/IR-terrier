	<brief_summary>Evidences showed that patients suffering from spinal cord injury (SCI) have poor mobility and higher chance to develop cardiopulmonary diseases, which leads to poor quality of life and shorter life expectancy. Different modalities were developed aiming at mobility restoration in SCI patients and robotic assisted body weight supported treadmill training is one of the latest technique in recent years. Yet there are scarce studies to investigate its effectiveness. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of robotic-assisted body weight supported treadmill training on mobility and cardiopulmonary function of patients suffering from SCI by a randomized controlled trial. 80 patients suffering from incomplete SCI will be recruited for an 8-week training program. They will be randomized into either robotic assisted body weight supported treadmill training group or passive lower limb mobilization training group. The training effects will be measured by Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury version II, lower extremity motor score, lower limb Modified Ashworth Scale, robotic gait system, gait analysis and gas analysis under sub maximal exercise stress test. Through the study, we intent to find the effectiveness of robotic-assisted body weight support treadmill training on walking and cardiopulmonary recovery with patients suffering from incomplete spinal cord injury. The hypothesis of the study is: Compared to the control group, robotic-assisted body weight supported treadmill training leads to a greater improvement in walking ability and cardiopulmonary functioning.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants will be recruited from the spinal cord rehabilitation unit of Physiotherapy Department of Kowloon Hospital. Subjects will be allocated into intervention group or control group by using sealed envelope and they will be blinded for their group allocation. All participants will undergo standard physiotherapy program, including mobilization and strengthening exercise of limbs, trunk stabilization training, wheelchair maneuver training and overground walking training. Based on this standard training program twice per week, 60 minutes per session, participants will receive an additional 30 minutes (exclude set-up time) of robotic-assisted body weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT) or control training based on their group allocation 3 times for 8 week. Outcome measures will be collected before the intervention and the subjects will be reassessed after finishing their 8 weeks of intervention. Outcome measures include Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury version II, Spinal Cord Independence Measure version III, lower extremity motor score, Modified Ashworth Scale, L-stiff and L-force measured by Lokomat system, VO2 maximum, spirometry, and gait analysis (walking speed, heel-heel base support,bilateral stance duration, bilateral symmetry) The result of this study will provide useful information to enhance the clinical effectiveness of the management for spinal cord injury with the use of robotic assisted body weight supported treadmill training.</detailed_description>
