	<brief_title>A Study of the Effects of Canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) on Renal Endpoints in Adult Participants With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be conducted in adult participants with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), receiving standard of care for hyperglycemia and cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, who have either a history of a prior CV event or 2 or more risk factors for a CV event. Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to canagliflozin or matching placebo to be taken once daily. Canagliflozin will be provided at a dose of 100 mg/day through Week 13 and then increased at the discretion of the investigator to a dose of 300 mg/day, if the participant requires additional glycemic control and is tolerating the 100 mg dose. The study will consist of a 2-week screening period and a double-blind treatment period lasting between 78 and 156 weeks with study completion in April 2017. A total of 5,700 participants will be recruited into the study; the maximum duration of the study for each participant can be up to 3.5 years. Participants can be either drug na√Øve to antihyperglycemic agents, using monotherapy, or using combination of antihyperglycemic therapy for the control of blood glucose levels.</detailed_description>
