	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1/2 study of the combination of CTO with lomustine in patients with recurrent malignant glioma to be treated at the Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center (PRTBTC) at Duke. The Primary Objectives are: - Phase 1: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CTO when combined with lomustine among patients with recurrent malignant glioma (World Health Organization (WHO) grade III or IV) who have not been previously treated with bevacizumab. - Phase 2: To assess the efficacy of CTO (either in monotherapy or in combination with lomustine) compared to lomustine alone in patients with recurrent WHO grade IV malignant gliomas that have not been previously treated with bevacizumab based upon 6-month progression free survival (PFS6). Note: This study was terminated early due to funding issues. At the time of termination, the study was still in Phase 1 and no MTD for the combination of CTO and lomustine had been determined for this population. Phase 2 will not proceed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ph 1/2 CTO With Lomustine for Bevacizumab-Naive Recurrent Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the Phase 1 component of the study, we will conduct a dose-escalation study of the combination of CTO with lomustine among patients with recurrent malignant glioma (WHO grade III or IV). All patients will be bevacizumab-naïve. The dose escalation will be a standard "3+3" design to determine the MTD of CTO in combination with lomustine. The Phase 2 portion of this study will be a randomized screening study comparing CTO alone (Arm A) versus CTO with lomustine (Arm B) versus lomustine alone (Arm C) in patients with recurrent WHO grade IV malignant glioma who are bevacizumab-naïve. Subjects will be randomized with a treatment arm allocation ratio of 2:2:1. Based on the results of patients who have already taken part in Phase 1 of the study, the Principal Investigator has decided to reduce the dose of lomustine used in combination with CTO in this study by 25% of the FDA-approved dose, due to hematologic side effects (side effects related to lower than expected blood counts). Therefore, the dose of lomustine received in combination with CTO is approximately 75% of the standard recommended dose. Note: This study was terminated early due to funding issues. At the time of termination, the study was still in Phase 1 and no MTD for the combination of CTO and lomustine had been determined for this population. Phase 2 will not proceed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Phase 1 portion: Patients must have recurrent histologically confirmed diagnosis of WHO grade III or IV malignant glioma with no more than 3 prior progressions Phase 2 portion: Patients must have recurrent histologically confirmed diagnosis of WHO grade IV malignant glioma (glioblastoma or gliosarcoma) with no more than 3 prior progressions Patients should have received optimal surgical management and radiotherapy prior to study enrollment Age ≥ 18 years Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥ 70% Bidimensionally measurable disease as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging based on RANO criteria Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥ 1000 cells/µl, Platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/µl (without transfusion within 14 days before enrollment) Adequate renal function as indicated by the following: Serum creatinine &lt; 1.25 times upper limit of normal or calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/minute and urine dipstick for proteinuria &lt; 2+ unless a 24hour urine protein &lt;1 g of protein is demonstrated Prothrombin time (PT) ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤ 1.5 x ULN within 14 days prior to first study treatment for patients not receiving anticoagulation. The use of fulldose oral or parenteral anticoagulants is permitted as long as the PT or aPTT is within therapeutic limits (according to the medical standard of the enrolling institution) and the patient has been on a stable dose of anticoagulants for at least two weeks prior to the first study treatment. For patients on corticosteroids, they must be on a stable dose for 7 days prior to anticipated start of study drug, and the dose should not be escalated over entry dose level, if clinically possible. Signed informed consent approved by the Institutional Review Board No evidence of &gt; grade 1 active central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage on the baseline MRI or CT scan Female patients must not be pregnant or breastfeeding. Female patients of childbearing potential (defined as &lt; 2 years after last menstruation or not surgically sterile) must use a highly effective contraceptive method (allowed methods of birth control, [i.e. with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year] are implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, intrauterine device [intrauterine device (IUD); only hormonal], sexual abstinence or vasectomized partner) during the trial and for a period of &gt; 6 months following the last administration of trial drug(s). Female patients with an intact uterus (unless amenorrhea for the last 24 months) must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 48 hours prior to first study treatment. Fertile male patients must agree to use a highly effective contraceptive method (allowed methods of birth control [i.e. with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year] include a female partner using implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, IUDs [only hormonal], sexual abstinence or prior vasectomy) during the trial and for a period of &gt; 6 months following the last administration of trial drugs. Pregnancy or breastfeeding Treated previously with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) therapies, including antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors Prior disease progression on lomustine Taking cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inducers and moderate or strong inhibitors. To note: Corticosteroids are allowed, as long as patients have been on a stable dose for 7 days prior to anticipated start of study drug, and the dose should not be escalated over entry dose level, if clinically possible.
