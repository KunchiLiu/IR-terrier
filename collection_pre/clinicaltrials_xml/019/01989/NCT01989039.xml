	<brief_summary>FPCOS is associated with an adverse cardiometabolic profile, consisting of increased total or central adiposity, increased insulin resistance and abnormal glucose metabolism. Low-grade chronic inflammation predicts cardiovascular outcomes and is observed in women with PCOS. However, obesity is also associated with increased inflammatory markers. Obesity is per se associated with increased adipose expression and plasma levels of leptin, lower expression of adiponectin, and elevated inflammatory markers. To study the insulin resistance、inflammatory markers and cardiovascular risk in women with PCOS, body weight status should be considered. Investigator therefore conduct this retrospective study to evaluate the insulin resistance、inflammatory and cardiovascular markers between PCOS and non-PCOS among obese and non-obese women.</brief_summary>
