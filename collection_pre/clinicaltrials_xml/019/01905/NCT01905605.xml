	<brief_summary>Sensory gating is defined as the automatic process of inhibiting brain response to repeated auditory sounds. Infants who brains respond similarly to two identical sounds presented about 1/2 second apart are more likely to have later problems with attention than infants who suppress response to the second sound. This study will examine whether providing a nutritional supplement, phosphatidylcholine, for two months in infancy will result in an increased likelihood of developing more robust sensory gating.</brief_summary>
