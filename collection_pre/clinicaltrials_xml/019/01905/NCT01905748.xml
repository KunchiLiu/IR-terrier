	<brief_summary>Acute Migraine attacks can be related to vascular or coagulation activation. Previous studies found relative high incidence of prothrombotic events in Migraine. The present study intends to assess the coagulation system and activation in patients with Migraine during steady state phase and at the beginning of attacks and after 72 hours. A control group of patients with another acute neurologic event like convulsions will be also studied. Patients will be at pediatric age and teenagers.</brief_summary>
