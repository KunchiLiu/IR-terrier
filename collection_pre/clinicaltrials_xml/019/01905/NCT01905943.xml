	<brief_summary>This multicenter, open-label, single-arm study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of obinutuzumab alone or in combination with chemotherapy in participants with previously untreated or relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Participants will receive 6 cycles of single-agent obinutuzumab or obinutuzumab in combination with chemotherapy at the investigator's discretion. Each participant will be followed until 30 months after the last participant has been enrolled. Total length of the study is anticipated to be approximately 5 years.</brief_summary>
