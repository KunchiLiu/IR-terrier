	<brief_summary>On October 26, 2012, the FDA granted Premarket Approval (PMA) for the PCM Cervical Disc. PCM Cervical Disc is indicated for use in skeletally mature patients for reconstruction of a degenerated cervical disc at one level from C3-C4 to C6-C7 following single-level discectomy for intractable radiculopathy (arm pain and/or a neurological deficit), with or without neck pain, or myelopathy due to a single-level abnormality localized to the disc space, and manifested by at least one of the following conditions confirmed by radiographic imaging (CT, MRI, X-rays): herniated nucleus pulposus, spondylosis (defined by the presence of osteophytes), and/or visible loss of disc height as compared to adjacent levels. The purpose of this post-approval study is to evaluate the long-term (7 year) safety and effectiveness of the PCM Cervical Disc.</brief_summary>
