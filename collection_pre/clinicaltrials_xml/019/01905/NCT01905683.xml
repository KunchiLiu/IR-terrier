	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether injections of Botulinum toxin type A into muscles of the leg(s) or of leg(s) and one arm are safe in treating children/adolescents (age 2-17 years) long-term with increased muscle tension/uncontrollable muscle stiffness (spasticity) due to cerebral palsy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Main clinical inclusion criteria for completers of study MRZ60201_3070_1: Subject with lower limb [LL] spasticity who completed leadin study MRZ60201_3070_1 in any of the three dose groups with duration of both injection cycles between 12 and 16 weeks. Ashworth scale [AS] score ≥2 in plantar flexors (at least unilaterally). For subjects with an AS score of 1, the investigator has to decide on the clinical need for reinjection. Clinical need for spasticity treatment with NT 201 according to the clinical judgment of the investigator for: Unilateral treatment of LL spasticity with 8 U/kg BW NT 201 (maximum of 200 U) into pes equinus and need for additional 8 U/kg BW NT 201 (maximum of 200 U) for treatment of clinical pattern flexed knee or adducted thigh (ipsilateral) or bilateral treatment of LL spasticity with 8 U/kg BW NT 201 (maximum of 200 U) into pes equinus on each side. No treatment of other clinical patterns is allowed. Main clinical inclusion criteria for subjects who did not participate in MRZ60201_3070_1: Female or male subject of 2 to 17 years age (inclusive). Uni or bilateral CP with clinical need for BoNT injection to treat limb spasticity. AS score ≥ 2 in plantar flexors (at least unilaterally). Clinical need according to the clinical judgment of the investigator in one out of four treatment combinations: 1. For LL(s) treatment only (Gross Motor Function Classification System [GMFCS] levels IV): Unilateral treatment of LL spasticity with 8 U/kg BW NT 201 (maximum of 200 U) into pes equinus, and 8 U/kg BW NT 201 (maximum of 200 U) into flexed knee or adducted thigh or bilateral treatment of LL spasticity with 8 U/kg BW NT 201 (maximum of 200 U) into each pes equinus (AS score ≥ 2 on both sides). 2. For combined unilateral UL and unilateral LL, (GMFCS levels IIII): Unilateral treatment of LL spasticity with 8 U/kg BW NT 201 (maximum of 200 U) into pes equinus, and 8 U/kg BW NT 201 (maximum of 200 U) into flexed knee or adducted thigh plus Unilateral treatment of UL spasticity with 4 U/kg BW NT 201 (maximum of 100 U) into flexed elbow, flexed wrist, clenched fist, thumb in palm and/or pronated forearm. 3. For combined unilateral UL and unilateral LL (GMFCS level IVV): Unilateral treatment of LL spasticity with 8 U/kg BW NT 201 (maximum 200 U) into pes equinus, and 4 U/kg BW NT201 (maximum 100 U) into flexed knee or adducted thigh plus unilateral treatment of UL spasticity with 4 U/kg BW NT 201 (maximum of 100 U) into flexed elbow, flexed wrist, clenched fist, thumb in palm and/or pronated forearm. 4. For combined unilateral UL and bilateral LL (GMFCS levels IIII): Bilateral treatment of LL spasticity with 8 U/kg BW NT 201 (maximum of 200 U) into each pes equinus (AS score ≥ 2 on both sides) plus unilateral treatment of UL spasticity with 4 U/kg BW NT 201 (maximum of 100 U) into flexed elbow, flexed wrist, clenched fist, thumb in palm and/or pronated forearm. Exclusion Criteria for subjects who completed MRZ60201_3070_1: Infection and/or inflammation in the area of the planned injection points. Pregnancy for female with history of menarche. Clinically relevant pathological findings indicating active disease of vital organs. Exclusion Criteria for subjects who did not participate in MRZ60201_3070_1: Fixed contracture defined as severe restriction of the range of joint movement on passive stretch in the target clinical pattern(s) or predominant forms of muscle hypertonia other than spasticity (e.g., dystonia) in the target limb(s). Surgery in the pes equinus on side(s) intended to treat with BoNT injections within 12 months prior to Screening Visit (V1), within the screening period or planned for the time of participation in this study. Hip flexion requiring BoNT injection. Limitation of hip abduction to less than 40° or prediagnosed migrational percentage greater than 30. Vaccination within 2 weeks prior to Screening Visit (V1) and/or within the screening period. Nonresolved fractures of the treated limb. Ventilator dependency. Severe neurological diagnosis and comorbidity outside the spectrum of cerebral palsy. Pure dyskinetic CP or mixed CP with predominantly dyskinetic movements. Treatment with BoNT (other than study drug in this study) for any body region within 14 weeks prior to Screening Visit (V1), within the screening period and/or intended to be administered during the study period. Treatment with phenol or alcohol of any muscle within 6 months prior to Screening Visit (V1), within the screening period, and/or intended to be administered during the study period. Treatment with drugs acting as peripheral muscle relaxants intrathecal baclofen, or oral anticoagulants administered within 2 weeks prior to Screening Visit (V1), within the screening period, and/or intended to be administered during the study period.</criteria>
