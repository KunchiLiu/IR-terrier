	<brief_summary>VVZ-149 is a novel analgesic drug candidate that shows a potential analgesic activity inhibiting GlyT2 and 5HT2A simultaneously. There have been many efforts to develop single-target selective drugs to treat pain, but usually unsuccessful due to the lack of efficacy or limitations of single-target approach for new drug discovery. VVZ-149 is expected to have a dual-target activity, demonstrated having a synergism between GlyT2 and 5HT2A antagonistic activities to maximize an antinociceptive effect in the in vivo animal models. Now the investigators are developing VVZ-149 as an IV injection to treat post-operative pain. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate a safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic properties of VVZ-149 injection with placebo in healthy male volunteers. This Phase 1 study consists of a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, single and multiple ascending dose (SAD &amp; MAD) escalation clinical trials.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study to Investigate Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of VVZ-149 Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this clinical study, the investigational drug product will be offered as an injectable form in a transparent glass vial that contains VVZ-149 dissolved by water for injection. When administered, the drug will be diluted by normal saline and will be given by intravenous infusion for 4 hours. SAD study is planned that maximal 7 cohorts of healthy male subjects are administrated single dose of VVZ-149 injection or placebo. The planned groups for dose escalations were 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 mg/kg groups. As a pilot study for safety in this first-in-human study, only 3 subjects received active drug are allocated to first two groups each, without subjects for placebo. For the following groups, 6 subjects for active drug and 2 for placebos are allocated after randomized. MAD study is planned that 2 cohorts of 10 healthy male subjects each were administered multiple doses of VVZ-149 injection or placebo. The final doses of VVZ-149 injection will be determined later based on the results of SAD study. In each group, 7 subjects for active drug and 3 for placebos are allocated after randomized</detailed_description>
