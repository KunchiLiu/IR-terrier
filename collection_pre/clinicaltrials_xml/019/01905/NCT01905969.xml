	<brief_summary>Adjuvant chemotherapy followed by curative gastrectomy for Stage II/III gastric cancer has improved disease free time and survival. However, there are still considerable number of patients experience relapse even after adjuvant chemotherapy. In an attempt to select patients who really benefit the postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, we have identified potential biomarkers (NF-kappaB/JNK) from cell line panel screening followed by immunohistochemical validation. In the present study, we further validate the significance of the biomarkers in a larger set of clinical samples to see if chemotherapeutic response can be determined immediately after surgery.</brief_summary>
