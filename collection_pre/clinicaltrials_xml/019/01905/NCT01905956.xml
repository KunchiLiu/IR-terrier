	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of IQP- AK-102 in Reducing Body Weight</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Appetite regulation plays an important role in determining the food intake, which is a complex process influenced by biological, behavioral and environmental stimuli. Satiation (intrameal satiety) is defined as the process of feeling full and subsequently stopping food consumption during eating, it therefore reduces hunger and limits the energy consumptions during meals. On the other hand, satiety or more precisely intermeal satiety, delays the onset and possibly reduces the consumption of the next meal. High viscosity and bulking food components such as dietary fibre are expected to elicit stronger satiation/satiety than macronutrients or clear liquid. Due to its unique physicochemical properties, dietary fibre has been recognized as a potential ingredient that helps to enhance the sensation of satiety in the upper gut by increasing gastric distension and delaying gastric emptying, which subsequently reduces the food intake, and eventually leading on to weight loss. The investigational product is formulated from IQP-AK-102, a proprietary, patent pending combination of three soluble fibres. In-vitro studies showed synergistic properties for the fibres in IQP-AK-102. When consumed orally, IQP-AK-102 capsules dissolve in the stomach to release the fibres. Once hydrated, the fibres swell to form a thick, viscous and indigestible gel structure in the stomach. This physical structure results in increased gastric distension and delays the gastric emptying that induces satiety and fullness. However the unique composition of IQP-AK-102 had not been evaluated in human clinical studies. The objective of this placebo controlled, double blind study was to confirm the benefit of IQP-AK-102 in weight loss through promoting satiety and managing appetite. In this study, 120 overweight and obese subjects (60 per study arm) were tested to investigate if IQP-AK-102 is effective in reducing body weight over a period of 12 weeks.</detailed_description>
