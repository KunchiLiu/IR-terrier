	<brief_summary>This study compared two doses of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) versus docetaxel in participants with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had experienced disease progression after platinum-containing systemic therapy. Participants were assigned randomly to receive either pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg once every three weeks (Q3W), pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q3W or docetaxel 75 mg/m^2 Q3W. This study used an adaptive trial design so that the total number of participants randomized depended upon demonstration of sufficient objective responses at an interim analysis. Based on the positive outcome of the Overall Survival (OS) analysis, Protocol Amendment 12 (effective date: 09 Dec 2015) enabled eligible participants who were allocated to docetaxel and experienced disease progression, to be permitted to crossover to receive pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W as long as Inclusion/Exclusion criteria were met. These participants were participating in the Cross-Over Phase. The primary study hypotheses are that pembolizumab prolongs OS and Progression-free Survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) by independent radiologists' review in previously-treated participants with NSCLC in the strongly positive programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) stratum compared to docetaxel and in participants whose tumors express PD-L1 compared to docetaxel.</brief_summary>
