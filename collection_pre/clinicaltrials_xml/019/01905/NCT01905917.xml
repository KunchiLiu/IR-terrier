	<brief_summary>The primary hypothesis tested in this randomized control trial is that a tele-rehabilitation intervention involving video-conferencing with a therapist and use of wearable monitoring devices in the first three months after stroke results greater functional recovery using the Jette Late Life Functional and Disability Instrument (LLFDI) (primary outcome) among stroke at three months survivors compared to usual care. The secondary hypotheses tested in this randomized control trial are that a tele-rehabilitation intervention involving video-conferencing with a therapist and use of wearable monitoring devices in the first three months after stroke results in: - Functional recovery using the LLFDI at 6 months, - Functional recovery using gait speed, 2-minute walk test and Shah modified Barthel Index at 3 and 6 months, - Greater contact time with a therapist at 3 &amp; 6 months, - Better balance at 3 &amp; 6 months, - Better self-report health-related quality of life at 3 &amp; 6 months, - Decreased health service utilization at 3 &amp; 6 months, - Reduced caregiver burden at three months survivors compared to usual care at 3 &amp; 6 months.</brief_summary>
