	<brief_summary>Objectives: To compare the effects of clopidogrel versus ticagrelor on atherosclerotic plaque inflammation using serial FDG PET/CT imaging of carotid artery and ascending aorta. Hypothesis: Thrombosis and inflammation are tightly linked rather than separate entities. Therefore, P2Y12 receptor inhibitors may have an anti-ischemic effect by inhibiting plaque inflammation, and ticagrelor may be superior in efficacy to clopidogrel.</brief_summary>
