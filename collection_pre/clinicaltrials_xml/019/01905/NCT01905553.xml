Subject is willing to comply with any applicable contraceptive requirements of the protocol and is: Male, or Female of nonchildbearing potential (defined as a female who is postmenopausal [amenorrhea for at least 12 consecutive months] or surgically sterile [hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy]) and at least 6 weeks poststerilization Nonpregnant, nonlactating female At least 90 days postpartum or nulliparous (females only).

If QTc exceeds 450msec, the ECG should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTc values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility. Subject reports any food allergies, celiac disease, or requirements for specific diet (eg, vegan, vegetarian, low fat).
