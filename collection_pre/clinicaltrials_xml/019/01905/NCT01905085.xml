	<brief_summary>Indirect calorimetry is valuable in determining resting energy expenditure in infants, children and adults. This measure will estimate the number of calories needed per day under resting conditions. Adding physical activity measures will help estimate total energy requirements in individuals. With the rise in obesity, numerous programs of prevention are being developed. Being able to characterize carefully energy intake and energy expenditure is one of the challenges of most of these initiatives.</brief_summary>
