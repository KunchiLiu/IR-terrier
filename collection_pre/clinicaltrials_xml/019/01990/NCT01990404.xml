	<brief_summary>Pain in the elderly is poorly evaluated and clearly under treated. Premixed nitrous oxide and oxygen is used in the emergency medical care of the trauma, burns, during transport of patient with pain. None randomized study has validated the use of premixed nitrous oxide and oxygen in the emergency department in the elderly. The aim of the study is to demonstrate the efficacy of premixed nitrous oxide and oxygen compared to medical air in elderly patient with out-of-hospital severe acute pain</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Premixed Nitrous Oxide and Oxygen in Elderly Patient With Out-of-hospital Severe Acute Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint is the percentage of patients with pain relief (with a numerical rating scale of 3/10 or lower) 15 minutes after randomisation. Secondary endpoints are treatment safety and adverse events, time to analgesia and duration of analgesia. This study will expect 108 patients assigned in two parallel groups, defined by a randomization scheme. Four sites will participate to the research. Eligible patients with a numeric rating scale (NRS) score higher than 6/10 are randomly allocated to receive either MEOPA, or medical air. Neither the investigator nor the nurse knows the treatment. Pain score will be measured at baseline and every 5 minutes until pain relief will be obtained. The safety evaluation will include non invasive monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2) and adverse events collection.</detailed_description>
