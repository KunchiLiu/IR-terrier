	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether mifepristone is an effective treatment for hyperglycemia due to mild hypercortisolism. - To test the hypothesis that GR blockade with mifepristone will decrease the severity of metabolic syndrome features as measured by waist circumference, lipid profile, body mass index, blood pressure and insulin resistance, measured by HOMA-IR score. - To test the hypothesis that GR blockade with mifepristone will improve QoL, depression and anxiety scores, measured by validated assessments, in patients with mild hypercortisolism.</brief_summary>
