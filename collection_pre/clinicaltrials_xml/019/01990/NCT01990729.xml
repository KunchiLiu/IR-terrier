	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of ARTRA (Glucosamine Plus Chondroitin Sulfate Combination) in Treatment of Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We enrolled patients between 40 and 65 years of age who had low back pain for at least 12 weeks with a pain intensity &gt;3 on a 0-10 point visual analogue scale (VAS). Major exclusion criteria were presence of fibromyalgia, degenerative spondylolisthesis, and alcohol and/or drug abuse. All patients were treated with ARTRA (combination of glucosamine hydrochloride 500 mg and chondroitin sulfate 500 mg in tab; Unipharm Inc.) at a dose of 1 tab bid for the first month and then 1 tab daily for the next two months. The primary endpoint was pain intensity (at rest and movement) as measured on a 0-10 point VAS. Secondary endpoints included Oswestry Disability Index, patient global assessment of efficacy (0-5 scale) and NSAID consumption.</detailed_description>
