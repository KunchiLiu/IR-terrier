	<brief_title>90‐Day Cobalt Supplementation Study to Investigate the Cobalt Body Burden in Ten Healthy Adult Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over the counter cobalt (Co) dietary supplements are available for sale in the United States, but little is known regarding their clinical effects and biokinetic distribution and body burden with long-term use. This study assessed blood kinetics, steady-state levels, biochemical responses, and clinical effects in five adult males and five adult females who voluntarily ingested approximately 1.0 mg Co/day of a commercially available Co supplement over a three month period. Volunteers were instructed to take the Co-dietary supplement in the morning according to the manufacturer's label. Blood samples were collected and analyzed for a number of biochemical parameters before, during, and after dosing. Hearing, vision, cardiac, and neurological functions were also assessed in volunteers before, during, and after dosing.</detailed_description>
