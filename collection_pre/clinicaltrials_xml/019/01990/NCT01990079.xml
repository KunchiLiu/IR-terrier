	<brief_summary>The primary goal of the study is to evaluate the use of a new smart phone application in preventing relapse to smoking among people with PTSD. The technology intervention will combine a mobile system to reward non-smoking, smoking cessation counseling, smoking cessation medications, and use of the smart phone app. The primary aim is to evaluate how effective this intervention is in preventing smoking relapse compared to another intervention that does not include the app.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of Technological Advances to Prevent Smoking Relapse Among Smokers With PTSD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal of the current study will be to evaluate the use of a new smart phone application (app; Stay Quit Coach) in preventing relapse to smoking among individuals with PTSD. The enhanced technology intervention will combine mobile contingency management (mCM), guideline-based smoking cessation counseling, bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and use of the Stay Quit Coach. For this study, we will propose a clinical trial with a two-group design in which 20 smokers with PTSD will be randomized to either: QUIT4EVER, an intervention that combines guideline-based smoking cessation counseling, bupropion and NRT, mCM and Stay Quit Coach. COMBINED CONTACT CONTROL (CCC) an intervention that is identical to QUIT4EVER except Stay Quit Coach will not be included. The CCC controls for compensation, monitoring, time and attention effects. Specific aims are to: AIM 1: evaluate the efficacy of QUIT4EVER on rates of abstinence from cigarettes (assessed with multiple measures including bioverified abstinence) during short and long term abstinence (measured at 3 and 6 months). Hypothesis 1: QUIT4EVER will be associated with increased long term abstinence (self-reported and bio-verified prolonged abstinence at the 3 and 6 month follow-up). AIM 2: assess the impact of QUIT4EVER on counseling treatment completion and medication adherence. Hypothesis 2. Increased abstinence associated with QUIT4EVER will be partially mediated by increased telephone counseling treatment completion and greater medication adherence. AIM 3: calculate the relative cost-effectiveness of the QUIT4EVER intervention in quality adjusted life years (QALY). Hypothesis 3: QUIT4EVER based treatment will result in greater cost-effectiveness compared to the control condition as measured by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Overall, results of this study could lead to a highly efficient, effective, and easily disseminated treatment method for reducing smoking among smokers with PTSD and other psychiatric disorders.</detailed_description>
