	<brief_title>Absolute Bioavailability of Reslizumab in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is designed to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability, immunogenicity, and pharmacodynamics of reslizumab</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Criteria for Inclusion: Subjects may be included in the study if they meet all of the following criteria: All Subjects 1. Written informed consent is obtained. 2. The subject can read, speak, and write in English or Japanese (as applicable to the respective enrollment group). 3. The subject is in good health as determined by medical and psychiatric history, physical examination, brief neurologic examination, ECG, serum chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and serology. 4. The subject, if a woman, is surgically sterile, 2 years postmenopausal, or, if of childbearing potential, is using a medically accepted method of contraception, and agrees to continued use of this method for the duration of the study and for 30 days after completion of the study. Acceptable methods of contraception include abstinence or an intrauterine device (known to have a failure rate of less than 1% per year). 5. The subject must be willing and able to comply with study restrictions and to remain at the clinic for the required duration at each visit. NonJapanese Subjects 6. The subject has Caucasian parents and grandparents. 7. The subject is a man or woman 18 through 45 years of age with a body mass index (BMI) of 20.0 to 30.0 kg/m2, inclusive (Appendix A). Note: At least half of the subjects enrolled into each treatment group must be within the more stringent age and weight criteria noted below for Japanese subjects. Also, every effort should be made to enroll an approximately equal number of men and women. Japanese Subjects 8. The subject is a man or woman 20 through 45 years of age weighing 50 through 80 kg with a BMI of less than 28.0 kg/m2. Note: Every effort should be made to enroll an approximately equal number of men and women. 9. The subject was born in Japan. 10. The subject has Japanese parents and grandparents. 11. The subject has lived less than 5 years outside Japan. 12. The subject has a Japanese passport. 13. The subject has no plans to leave the US until at least 1 week after the end of the study. Criteria for Exclusion: Subjects will be excluded from participating in this study if they meet 1 or more of the following criteria: 1. The subject has any clinically significant uncontrolled medical conditions (treated or untreated). 2. The subject has a clinically significant deviation from normal in ECG, physical examination, or brief neurologic examination findings, as determined by the investigator or the medical monitor. 3. The subject is a pregnant or lactating woman. (Any women becoming pregnant during the study will be withdrawn from the study.) 4. The subject has any disorder that may interfere with drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion (including gastrointestinal surgery; a history of appendectomy is allowed). 5. The subject has received reslizumab in a previous study. 6. The subject has received an immunosuppressant drug or antiinterleukin5 (antiIL5) antibody within 6 months before the dose of study drug. 7. The subject has received any investigational drug (nonbiologic) within 30 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) before the dose of study drug, or in the case of a new chemical entity, 3 months or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) before the dose of study drug. 8. The subject has participated in any investigative biologics study within 6 months or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) before the dose of study drug. 9. The subject has a known or suspected hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to antiIL5 antibodies, any compound present in the study drug, or monoclonal antibodies. 10. The subject has a history of any clinically important drug, vaccine and/or other allergies or there is indication of potential for allergic reactions.

The subject has used any vitamins within 2 weeks before the dose of study drug or has used any systemic or topical prescription, or nonprescription (overthecounter [OTC]) medication (except acetaminophen or ibuprofen) within 2 weeks or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) before the dose of study drug. 14.

The subject has donated plasma within 7 days prior to the dose of study drug. 17. The subject has, after resting for 5 minutes, elevated blood pressure (defined as seated systolic blood pressure of more than 140 mm Hg and/or seated diastolic blood pressure of more than 90 mm Hg), or low blood pressure (defined as seated systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg and/or seated diastolic blood pressure of less than 45 mm Hg). (Only 2 rechecks of the subject's blood pressure are permitted for eligibility purposes.) 18. The subject has, after resting for 5 minutes, a seated pulse of less than 45 or more than 90 beats per minute (bpm). (Only 2 rechecks of the subject's pulse are permitted for eligibility purposes.) 19.
