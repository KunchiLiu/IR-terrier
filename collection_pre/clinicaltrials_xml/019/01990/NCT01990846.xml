Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18 to 30 kg/m2 inclusive and body weight of 50 to 100 kg inclusive. 3. Normal spirometry values at Screening and Baseline defined as forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) greater than 80% predicted or above the LLN and the FEV1/FVC ratio greater than 70%. Results of FEV1 and FVC must be reproducible (± 5%) between Screening and Baseline. 4. Postmenopausal women with amenorrhea for at least 2 years will be eligible (confirmed by follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] test). 5. Females of childbearing potential must use acceptable birth control methods throughout the study and for 30 days after the last dose of the IMP: 6. Male subjects: 1.

Must agree to not donate sperm for 90 days after the last dose of IMP. 3. Vasectomies in males for 6 months minimum prior to the first dose of the IMP are an acceptable form of contraception. 4. Males who claim abstinence as their method of contraception are allowed provided they agree to use a barrier method (diaphragm plus spermicide in female partner or condom) should they become sexually active from screening to 90 days after the last dose of IMP. 7.

Clinically significant abnormalities at Screening or Baseline in safety laboratory tests, ECGs, or spirometry. 5. Inability to perform spirometry according to the 2005 American Thoracic Society (ATS) acceptability and repeatability standards. 6. History of significant nasal irritation from use of nasal sprays or drops. 7. Corrected QT interval (QTc) greater than 450 msec for males and 470 msec for females as corrected by the Fridericia formula. 8. History of drug or alcohol abuse within the past 2 years; current excessive user of alcohol defined as regular weekly intake of greater than 15 units for male subjects and 10 units for female subjects. One unit equals 25 mL spirits, 125 mL wine or 250 mL beer. 9. Tobacco users (includes users who stopped smoking £90 days prior to the screening evaluation). [Note: "Tobacco use" includes smoking and the use of snuff and chewing tobacco, and other nicotine or nicotine containing products.] 10. Received an IMP or participated in another research study within 30 days of the first dose of the IMP for this study. 11. Participated in a previous investigational study of FF3. 12. History of influenza vaccination with a live vaccine within 7 days or with an attenuated vaccine within 14 days of the first dose of IMP. 13. Use of prescription drugs within 14 days prior to the first dose of IMP, excepting oral contraceptives. 14.
