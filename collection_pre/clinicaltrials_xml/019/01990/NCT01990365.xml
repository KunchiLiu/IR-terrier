	<brief_summary>Many patients with acute osteoporotic vertebral fracture (acute OVFs) admitted because of low back pain. But there are only part of patients with acute OVFs, because some patients do not have low back pain although OVFs occurred.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Influence of Vertebral Mobility on Low Back Pain in Patients With Acute Osteoporotic Vertebral Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many patients of acute OVFs present with low back pain. While there are also many patients without low back pain even if acute OVFs occurred. The mechanism of low back pain after acute OVFs is well unknown. We set up a hypothesis that low back pain results from vertebral body mobility, which refers to a change of vertebral height or configuration with changes in body positioning. The main objective of this study is to reveal the relationship between vertebral body mobility and low back pain.</detailed_description>
