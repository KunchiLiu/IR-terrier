	<brief_summary>For non-healing ulcers, abnormal periods of wound healing processes: inflammation, proliferation and remodelling, are believed to lead to chronic wounds. As a chronic "stalled" wound, investigators hypothesized that these glue-assisted closure (GAC)-failed enterocutaneous fistula (ECF) might have a prolonged inflammatory phase modulated by excessive pro-inflammatory cytokines or proteases. The aim of this study was to analyze the chemicals in ECF wounds in order to determine patients' condition and fitness for GAC.</brief_summary>
