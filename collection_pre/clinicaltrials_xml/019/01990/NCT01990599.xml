	<brief_summary>Airway management of patients undergoing thermal coagulation of the Gasserian ganglion is very delicate. This is because of the specific operation site and moreover patients should recover quickly from anesthesia to follow verbal intraoperative commands of the surgeon. Endotracheal intubation or laryngeal mask of course hinders the patient from speaking. An obvious alternative airway management, as performed in this preliminary study, is a nasopharyngeal placed tube. The purpose of the present study is to objectify the gas exchange in patients during this new ventilation technique.</brief_summary>
