	<brief_summary>We will quantify one of the lipid compounds (5,6 epoxy eicosatrienoic acid (5,6 EET), 5,6- EpoxyEicosaTrienoic acid) in colonic biopsies of Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients. We will evaluate its possible use as a pathological activity biomarker and its potential as a therapeutic target. We hypothesized that 5,6-EET is present in human colonic tissues in varying quantities depending on the pathological state of the IBD patient.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lipid Mediators in Colonic Biopsies as Biomarkers of Disease Activity of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The project is an exploratory physiopathological/translational pilot study, aiming at understanding the relative importance of the lipid compounds, especially 5,6-EET, in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. Using mass spectrometry, 5,6-EET and other 33 lipid metabolites will be quantified in situ in colonic biopsies from IBD patients and from control patients. We will compare quantities of 5,6-EET in inflammatory and non-inflammatory zones of biopsies from IBD patient to biopsies from control patient. We will establish a cluster of lipid compounds associated with pathological activity. We will determine the exposed profile of receptor lipid mediators expressing to the 5,6-EET lipid compound and one of its signalization. All data will be submit to statistical analysis to confirm relevance. We expect this pilot study to help us define 5,6-EET and other components of the same metabolic family as markers for IBD activity. It could point lipid mediators and their receptors as potential new therapeutic targets. It will increase our knowledge on current treatment efficiency by evidencing lipid markers for the inflammatory condition.</detailed_description>
