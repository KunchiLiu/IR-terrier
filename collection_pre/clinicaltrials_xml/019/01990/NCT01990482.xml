	<brief_summary>A delay in the return of normal bowel function with the passage of flatus and feces is one of the most important factors affecting early recovery and discharge in patients undergoing open complete staging surgery for gynecological malignancies. A prolonged hospital stay increases the risk of hospital-acquired infections, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary compromise and total hospital costs. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of coffee intake on postoperative bowel function in patients undergoing abdominal complete staging surgery for gynecological malignancies.</brief_summary>
