	<brief_summary>This interventional, open study will evaluate clinical data in relation to biomarkers in patients 12 to 75 years of age with severe oral corticosteroid (OCS) - dependent asthma. Patients with uncontrolled asthma will be offered an additional escalation of OCS at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg for 7 days. Patients enrolled in this study would be eligible to be enrolled in a future placebo-controlled intervention study designed to measure the steroid-sparing effect of lebrikizumab.</brief_summary>
