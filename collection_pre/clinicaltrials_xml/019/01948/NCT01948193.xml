	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to describe the immunogenicity and safety of a novel DTaP- IPV- Hep B-PRT~T fully liquid combined hexavalent vaccine (Hexaxim™) administered at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age in infants born to mothers documented to be serum anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) serology negative in India. Primary Objective: - To evaluate the immunogenicity of the study vaccine in terms of seroprotection [diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) polysaccharide (PRP), hepatitis B (Hep B)] and vaccine response for pertussis antigens [pertussis toxoid (PT) and filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA)] one month after the third dose. Secondary Objectives: - To further describe the immunogenicity of the study vaccine, before the first dose and one month after the third dose. - To describe the safety after each and any doses of the study vaccine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP~T Combined Vaccine in Indian Infants Previously Given a Dose of Hepatitis B Vaccine at Birth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All participants will receive a total 4 doses of Hep B, i.e. one dose of Hep B monovalent vaccine given at birth followed by 3 doses of Sanofi Pasteur's hexavalent vaccine given at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age in the context of the study. Participants and parents will attend four clinic visits; the expected participation in the study is approximately 3 months.</detailed_description>
