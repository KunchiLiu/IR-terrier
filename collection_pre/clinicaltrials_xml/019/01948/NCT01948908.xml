	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine exactly how much drug volume should be administered into each nare, so that the drug absorption can be maximized and the amount that runs out of the nose, or is swallowed, is minimized, thereby optimizing the effectiveness of any drug given intranasally. The investigators will determine this ideal "volume of administration" by studying intranasal midazolam in children who require sedation to facilitate laceration repairs. The investigators will evaluate both clinical outcomes as well as pharmacokinetic outcomes associated with each volume of administration. We will block randomize children to receive intranasal midazolam in maximum aliquots of one of the three following VOA: 200 microliters (mcL), 500 mcL, or 1000 mcL.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Volumes of Administration for Intranasal Midazolam</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The intranasal route is an effective means of administering sedative medications for children. However, sometimes the child has to receive a certain dose that requires a very large volume to be administered into the nose, because of the types of concentrations of drugs that are available. Most drugs are not concentrated enough so that small volumes can be consistently given, so as a result, sometimes a very large amount of medication is administered intranasally. When the amount is too large, most of the medication either runs back out the nose, or down the back of the nose and throat and is swallowed, instead of being absorbed in the nasal cavity, where it can be quickly absorbed and produce optimal effectiveness.</detailed_description>
