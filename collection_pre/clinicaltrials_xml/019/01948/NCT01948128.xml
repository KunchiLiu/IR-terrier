	<brief_summary>This protocol is a randomized, phase 2 "window of opportunity" trial assessing the biological effects of short term oral vitamin D administration on breast cancer clinical and translational markers in patients awaiting surgery at the Ottawa Hospital. It takes advantage of the current wait times (2-8 weeks) for breast cancer surgery as a "window of opportunity" to rapidly assess biological changes with vitamin D intake.</brief_summary>
