	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to assess whether the increased angina threshold on ranolazine and subsequent higher training intensity will result in improved exercise tolerance and oxygen consumption; and greater than that observed with exercise training on placebo. The study team anticipates the chronic exercise improvements with ranolazine will be incrementally higher than the acute effects provided by ranolazine alone and demonstrated in previous trials. Key secondary objectives include the acute ranolazine and chronic exercise plus ranolazine effects on total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) and angina-related quality of life.</brief_summary>
