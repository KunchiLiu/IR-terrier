	<brief_summary>The purpose of the project is to obtain skin and adipose tissue samples from patients with ALS to develop new diagnostic and prognostic markers of the disease. These samples will be obtained when percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is performed as part of their standard of care. Skin and adipose tissue samples will also be obtained from disease control subjects who require a PEG as part of their standard of care.</brief_summary>
