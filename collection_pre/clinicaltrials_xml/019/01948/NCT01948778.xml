	<brief_summary>Septic shock has a high mortality risk despite the availability of various treatments. Endotoxin, that is present in the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria, is a potent trigger of innate immunity. Endotoxin leads to an activation of a cascade with an overwhelming systemic overflow of pro- and anti- inflammatory mediators at the early phase of sepsis with generalized vascular endothelial damage, tissue injury and multi-organ failure. Extracorporeal blood purification therapies aim to reduce the circulating level of endotoxin. Different extracorporeal blood purification systems are available. The oXiris™ device comprises a surface treated AN69 membrane capable to adsorb a large spectrum of plasma cytokines, such as IL-6 and HMGB1 protein. The positively charged inner surface of the membrane allows absorbing negatively charged bacterial products such as endotoxin. From an historical perspective, filters containing AN69-based membranes have been the most commonly used products for CRRT in the management of critically ill patients and a substantial volume of published data exist. Another extracorporeal endotoxin removal therapy is the hemoperfusion with ToraymyxinTM (PMX) filter, which is a cartridge selectively removing blood endotoxin. PMX is composed of polymyxin B covalently bonded to polystyrene-derivative fibres. It is well known that the polarity of the polymyxin B antibiotic binds endotoxin and has bactericidal activity. Therefore, the rationale underlying extracorporeal therapy with PMX is to remove circulating endotoxin by adsorption. - Trial with medical device</brief_summary>
