	<brief_summary>Hypofractionation with simultaneous integrated boost has been investigated in a few trials and appears to be safe and feasible with less lung toxicity in smaller studies. Investigators initiated this multicenter phase II prospective trial to analyse acute toxicity of hypofractionation with simultaneous integrated boost in patients with early breast cancer under the hypothesis that the ratio of patients with acute radiogenic toxicity Grad II according NCI-CTCAE amounts maximum 20%.</brief_summary>
