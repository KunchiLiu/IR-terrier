	<brief_title>Desvenlafaxine Monotherapy in Dysthymia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective: To investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of open-label desvenlafaxine monotherapy in dysthymic subjects. Secondary objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of desvenlafaxine on clinical measures relating to improvement of depressive symptoms, quality of life and occupational functioning. It is hypothesized that Dysthymic subjects will show significant improvement in depressive symptoms after 8 weeks of treatment with desvenlafaxine. There will be significant improvement in measures of quality of life and stress coping at end of treatment, compared to Baseline. There will also be significant improvement in measures of occupational functioning at end of treatment, compared to Baseline.</detailed_description>
