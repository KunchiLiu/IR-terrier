	<brief_summary>The P300 is one of the cognitive wave of the Event-Related Potential (ERP) that is used to investigate the cognitive process. The P300 component are accepted as electro-physiological markers of neuropsychiatric disorders like alcoholism or drug addiction. Recent scientific data suggest that eating disorders, leading to weight gain and obesity, will be similar of those of drug addiction: it is the incentive sensitization theory that implicates the dopaminergic reward system. The aim of this cross-sectional study is to investigate the alteration of P300 auditory ERP in obese women with eating disorders in comparison with obese and lean women without eating disorders.</brief_summary>
