	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether overweight but not obese pregnant African women having unlimited access to a health education-information technology (IT) based intervention package gain weight within the acceptable range of 8-12 kg during the pregnancy period. Therefore, we hypothesize that unlimited access to health education via an IT-based intervention package has the potential to reduce the onset of obesity in African pregnant women. To date (Aug 2015), 95% of patients have been recruited, 1320 potential subjects have been screened and 150 enrolled into the study</brief_summary>
