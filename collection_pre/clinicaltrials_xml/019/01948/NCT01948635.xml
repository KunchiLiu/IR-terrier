	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesized that PVC tapered-cuff tracheal tubes would reduce microaspiration of gastric content as determined by pepsin level in tracheal aspirate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Tracheal Cuff Shape on Microaspiration in Intensive Care Units</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Microaspiration is the main route for entry of contaminated secretions into the lower respiratory tract of intubated critically ill patients. Tracheobronchial colonization might progress to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) when the quantity and virulence of bacteria are high and when local and general host defenses are weak. Recent in vitro and animal studies suggest that tapered-cuff tracheal tubes could be associated with reduced microaspiration of contaminated secretions and might be helpful in preventing VAP.</detailed_description>
