	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of the utilization of two doses of corticotrophin ( ACTH) as a treatment in patients with early onset rheumatoid arthritis as an alternative to conventional steroid therapy by evaluating the change from baseline in the clinical findings as well as the structural findings on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Corticotrophin (ACTH) may prevent the well documented structural progression damage in RA patients using disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Corticotrophin (ACTH) in Combination With Methotrexate in Newly Diagnosed Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase II 24-week open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of H.P. Acthar Gel Respository Injection, Corticotrophin( ACTH) administered to newly diagnosed patients with rheumatoid arthritis in conjunction with methotrexate, folllowed by a 24 week follow-up period. There will be a total of twenty (20) patients and two (2) treatment groups with 10 patients in each treatment group</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patient must be at least 18 years old at the screening visit. 2. Patient must be able to understand the information provided to them and to give written Informed Consent. 3. Female patients must be either postmenopausal for at least 1 year, surgically incapable of childbearing, or effectively practicing an acceptable method of contraception (oral/parenteral/implantable hormonal contraceptives, Intrauterine Device (IUD), or barrier and spermicide). Abstinence only is not an acceptable method. Patients must agree to use adequate contraception during the study and for 4 weeks after their last dose of corticotrophin (ACTH). Male patients must agree to ensure they or their female partner(s) are using adequate contraception during the study and for 4 weeks after the patient receives their last dose of corticotrophin (ACTH). 4. Patients must have a new diagnosis of adultonset rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as defined by the 2010 European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology (EULAR/ACR) classification criteria and who have had symptoms for &lt;1 year. 5. Patients must be experiencing mild to moderate rheumatoid arthritis ( RA), have at least 6 tender and 6 swollen joints at screening and a clinical disease activity index (CDAI) score of &gt; 6.0 6. A Baseline Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI) must show the presence of osteitis or erosions in the hand or wrist. 7. Patients must be able and willing to comply with the requirements of the study protocol. 8. Patients must have a Creactive Protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) &gt; upper limits of normal Exclusion criteria: 1. Patients who have a diagnosis of any other inflammatory arthritis (e.g., psoriatic arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis). 2. Patients with exposure to any disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), Biologic, Nonbiologic or experimental medication for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 3. Patients with a noninflammatory type of arthritis (e.g. osteoarthritis or fibromyalgia) that in the Investigator's opinion is symptomatic enough to interfere with evaluation of the effect of study drug on the patient's primary diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 4. Patients with history of an infected joint prosthesis at any time with that prosthesis still in situ. 5. Patients have received prohibited medication: nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAIDs /COX2 inhibitors) (any change in dose regimen in the 7 days prior to baseline) Oral corticosteroids within 4 weeks of baseline Intramuscular, intravenous, intraarticular (IM/IV/IA) corticosteroids/ Intraarticular (IA) Hyaluronic acid (any dose 28 days prior to baseline) 6. Female patients who are breastfeeding, pregnant, or plan to become pregnant during the trial or within twelve weeks following last dose of study drug. 7. Patients with a history of chronic infection due to fungal, parasitic or mycotic pathogens during the preceding year, recent serious or lifethreatening infection within 6 months (including herpes zoster), or any current sign or symptom that may indicate an infection. 8. Patients with active Tuberculosis (TB) (or history of active TB), positive chest Xray for TB, or positive (defined as induration of ≥ 5mm) purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test, positive QuantiFERON, or patients having close contact with an individual with active TB. Patients having a PPD skin test ≥ 5 mm or a positive QuantiFERON test can enter the study, provided that active TB is excluded and provided that they are adequately treated for latent TB (e.g., isonicotinic acid hydrazide [INH therapy] for 9 months [with vitamin B6]) and provided that appropriate treatment is initiated simultaneously with the first administration of ACTH. 9. Patients at a high risk of infection (e.g. leg ulcers, indwelling urinary catheter and persistent or recurrent chest infections and patients who are permanently bedridden or wheelchair bound). 10. Patients with a known allergy or intolerance to steroids 11 Concurrent malignancy or a history of malignancy (other than carcinoma of the cervix or basal cell carcinoma successfully treated more than 5 years prior to screening). 12. Patients with a current or recent history of severe, progressive, and/or uncontrolled renal, hepatic, hematological, gastrointestinal, endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, neurological or cerebral disease. 13. Patients with class III or IV congestive heart failure according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) 1964 classification criteria. 14. Patients with a history of, or suspected, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (e.g. multiple sclerosis or optic neuritis). 15. Patients with any other condition (e.g. clinically significant laboratory values) which in the Investigator's judgment would make the patient unsuitable for inclusion in the study. 16. Patients who have a metal device affected by MRI (e.g., any type of electronic, mechanical, or magnetic implant; cardiac pacemaker; aneurysm clip(s); implanted cardioverter defibrillator; or a cochlear implant) 17. Patients who have a potential ferromagnetic foreign body (metal slivers, metal shavings, other metal objects) for which they have sought medical attention. 18. Concurrent steroid use for any concomitant disease. 19. Subjects who are known to be Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C positive</criteria>
