	<brief_summary>PROSper is a prospective cohort study of 100 women 35-50 years of age with BRCA 1/2 mutations who have elected to either undergo risk reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) or nonsurgical management. The investigators will compare the change in cardiovascular health, bone health, sexual function, quality of life, and menopausal symptoms over 3 years of follow-up between women who undergo RRSO (baseline just prior to surgery) and age-matched controls that do not undergo RRSO. The investigators hypothesis is that women who undergo a premature surgical menopause induced by RRSO have worse cardiovascular health and bone health compared with women who do not undergo RRSO.</brief_summary>
