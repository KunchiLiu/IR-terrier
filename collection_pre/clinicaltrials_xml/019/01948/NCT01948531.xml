In the case of UV exposure must be used a sun screen total block cream. Each volunteer is precisely informed about the study, a consent form being completed and signed. At the end of the study the investigator will declare to have informed all the volunteers participating it, signing and dating the relative form. The study will be started only after Independent Ethical Committee approval. It is understood that the treatment would be immediately interrupted as soon as the investigator judges it necessary. For each volunteer a Case Record Form is filled and to each one a progressive number is assigned. Personal data, subject's history, clinical and instrumental evaluations are registered in basal conditions and at all study visits. During 3 hours before the visit the volunteer must not smoke, drink coffee or alcohol. Any cosmetic product can be used on the skin test area during 2 hours before the visit. All measurements are performed under standard environmental conditions (Temperature=22+\-2°C; Relative Humidity&lt;60%). Before each visit the volunteer will get acclimatized under relax conditions for at least 10-15 min. Each volunteer will report on the personal diary card all information about the date, the time of study product application and a comment if necessary. At each visit, the volunteers must give back the diary card to the Investigator to verify their compliance.
