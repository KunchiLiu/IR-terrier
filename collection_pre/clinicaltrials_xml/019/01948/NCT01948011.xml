	<brief_summary>To investigate the Racecadotril pharmacokinetic linearity after single oral administration of 10, 30 and 60 mg as a suspension. To evaluate the comparative bioavailability of the new Racecadotril formulation (suspension) versus the reference sachet formulation (granules)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Racecadotril Suspension Linearity Study &amp; Comparative Bioavailability Versus Granules</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single center, open-label, single oral dose, 4-period cross-over study to assess the bioequivalence of a new formulation (suspension) in healthy male volunteers.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy male, 18 to 45 years old, be certified as normal by a comprehensive clinical assessment (detailed medical history and a complete physical examination), arterial blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), an ECG and laboratory investigations (haematological, blood chemistry tests, urinalysis), the results of which are within the normal range and/ or judged by the investigator as clinically acceptable for healthy subjects, Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18 and 28 kg/m2. History of cardiovascular, pulmonary gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, metabolic, haematological, neurological, psychiatric, systemic, or infectious disease. Any other condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would jeopardize the safety of the subject or impact the validity of the study results. Subject has used any drug including OTC products two weeks before the scheduled administration of study drug, except paracetamol (maximum 1g/day).</criteria>
