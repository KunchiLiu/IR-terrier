	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well nintedanib works in treating patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have failed up to two previous chemotherapy regimens. Nintedanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nintedanib in Treating Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Who Have Failed Up to Two Previous Chemotherapy Regimens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFRI) amplified squamous cell lung cancer patients treated with BIBF 1120 (nintedanib). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the 6-month PFS rate for the entire FGFRI amplified group versus the FGFRI wild-type patients. II. Compare the 6-month PFS rate for each FGFRI amplified group (low, intermediate, and high) versus historical controls and FGFRI wild-type patients. III. To assess the following endpoints overall and by FGFRI group: PFS, overall survival (OS), confirmed tumor response rate, and adverse events. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. The relation of FGFRI gene copy number with PFS, OS, confirmed response rate, and adverse events. II. The relationship fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) polymorphisms with toxicity and efficacy. OUTLINE: Patients receive nintedanib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 8 weeks.</detailed_description>

upper limit of normal (ULN) Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) =&lt; 1.5 x ULN (ALT and AST =&lt; 2.5 x ULN is acceptable if there is liver metastasis) Calculated or measured creatinine clearance &gt;= 45 mL/min Patients of childbearing potential must agree to use acceptable contraceptive methods (e.g., double barrier) during treatment and have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test done =&lt; 7 days prior to registration (for women of childbearing potential only) Life expectancy &gt;= 12 weeks Willingness to provide the blood specimens as required by the protocol; please note that the willingness to participate pertains only to the patient and does not factor in the institution's ability to participate in any part of the translational component Patients with any known endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and/or anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK) translocation Symptomatic, untreated, or uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) metastases or seizure disorder; patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases treated with whole brain radiation (WBRT) or gamma knife radiosurgery (GKR) may be enrolled &gt;= 1 week after completion of WBRT/GKR provided toxicities are =&lt; Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grade I at the time of registration and/or controlled with dexamethasone 2 mg once daily for at least 5 days at the time of study treatment; patients with symptomatic CNS metastases treated with WBRT/GKR may be enrolled &gt;= 2 weeks after completion of WBRT/GKR provided toxicities are =&lt; CTC grade 1 at the time of registration and neurologic symptoms controlled with dexamethasone =&lt; 2 mg once daily for at least 1 week at the time of study treatment Patients receiving palliative radiation to skeletal metastases may be registered as early as 1 week after completion of radiation therapy provided toxicities are =&lt; CTC grade I at the time of registration Any of the following prior therapies for malignancy: Systemic chemotherapy =&lt; 4 weeks prior to registration Radiation therapy =&lt; 4 weeks prior to registration (exceptions noted in the prior bullet); the site of previous radiotherapy should have evidence of progressive disease if this is the only site of disease Major surgery (i.e., laparotomy), open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury =&lt; 4 weeks prior to registration; minor surgery =&lt; 2 weeks prior to registration; insertion of a vascular access device is not considered major or minor surgery in this regard Other investigational agent =&lt; 30 days prior to study treatment The following patients will be excluded from this study: Pregnant women Breastfeeding women Men or women who are sexually active and unwilling to use a medically acceptable method of contraception (e.g., such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices or vasectomized partner for participating females, condoms for participating males) during the trial and for at least three months after end of active therapy; a highly effective method of birth control is defined as one which results in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly; patients will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless surgically sterilized by hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation/salpingectomy, or postmenopausal for at least 2 years Second primary malignancy with the following exceptions which are allowed: Carcinoma in situ of the cervix Nonmelanoma skin cancer History of lowgrade (Gleason score =&lt;
