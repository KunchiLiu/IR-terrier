	<brief_title>Randomized Study for Efficacy and Safety of Ranibizumab 0.5mg in Treat-extend and Monthly Regimens in Patients With nAMD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a 12-month, phase IIIb, randomized, Visual Acuity assessor-masked, multi-center, interventional study assessing the efficacy and safety of the TER vs monthly regimens of 0.5 mg ranibizumab intravitreal (IVT) injections in patients with newly diagnosed nAMD. Patients will be randomized 1:1 into one of two treatment arms, Treat and Extend or monthly regimens. There will be 3 periods in this study: Screening period (up to 14days), treatment period (11 months), follow-up period (1 month). At randomization visit patients will be randomized into one of the 2 treatment groups Group I ranibizumab 0.5 mg based on monthly treatment or Group II ranibizumab 0.5 mg based on TER (randomization ratio of 1:1) and will receive the first dose of Investigational treatment. Patients in Group I the following visits will perform on monthly intervals. For patients in Group II the investigator will evaluate disease activity (i.e., signs of exudation) based on SD-OCT, and in case of absence of disease activity every next visit will be 2 weeks), with a maximum of a 12-week interval.</detailed_description>

Stroke or myocardial infarction within 3 months prior to Screening. Any active periocular or ocular infection or inflammation in both eyes. Ocular disorders in the study eye at the time of enrollment that may confound interpretation of study results and compromise visual acuity. Presence of amblyopia or amaurosis in the fellow eye. History of treatment with any antiangiogenic drugs (including any anti vascular endothelial growth factor (antiVEGF) agents) e.g., bevacizumab [Avastin®], aflibercept [Eylea®]) or vPDT in the study eye. History of intravitreal treatment with corticosteroids within 6 months and history of intraocular surgery within 3 months in the study eye prior to the Screening. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women. Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using effective methods of contraception during dosing of study treatment.</criteria>
