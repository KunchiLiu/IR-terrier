	<brief_summary>The Essure System is indicated for women who desire non-incisional permanent birth control (female sterilization) by occlusion of the fallopian tubes. The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Essure System (Model ESS505) for permanent birth control in preventing pregnancy. The Essure ESS505 System includes a design modification that will be studied to determine if it provides immediate birth control, thereby removing the three months waiting period required for the commercially available Essure System Model 305 to be effective.</brief_summary>
