	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of rifaximin SSD versus placebo in preventing complications of liver cirrhosis, such as all-cause mortality (death due to all causes) or hospitalization, in subjects with early decompensated liver cirrhosis. Rifaximin, a non-systemic antibacterial agent, is currently marketed as a 550 mg tablet for the reduction in risk of recurrent overt hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver cirrhosis. The rifaximin SSD tablet was formulated to maximize the efficacy of rifaximin. Subjects will receive 1 of 5 doses of rifaximin SSD tablets or placebo tablets every day for 24 weeks.</brief_summary>
