	<brief_summary>Systemic lupus erythematosus is a complex disease whose evaluation in everyday practice and in clinical research requires several aspects to be taken into account, in particular the impact of disease activity on quality of life. To date, the effect of systemic lupus on quality of life has only been described using generic questionnaires. Among the specific questionnaires for systemic lupus, the LupusQol, which has been validated in French, shows interesting psychometric properties. The determinants of quality of life specifically related to the disease are still unknown and could be studied using a longitudinal cohort thanks to the French version of the LupusQol.</brief_summary>
