	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to compare the effects of TAS-102 with either amrubicin or topotecan (drugs used in Small Cell Lung Cancer) on lung cancer to find out the effects on survival, how much time may pass without disease progression, and the safety of TAS-102.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study Comparing TAS-102 Versus Topotecan or Amrubicin to Treat Small Cell Lung Cancer Following Platinum-Based Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, open-label, two-arm, randomized Phase 2 study of TAS-102 versus Investigator's choice of therapy in patients requiring second-line chemotherapy for SCLC refractory or sensitive to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Investigator's choice of therapy is defined as second-line chemotherapy with IV topotecan (Europe/Japan) or IV amrubicin (Japan). Patients will be stratified by response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (sensitive vs refractory). Sensitive patients are defined as patients who did not progress within 90 days after the last dose, and refractory patients are defined as patients who never responded or who responded but had radiologic progression &lt; 90 days after the last dose.</detailed_description>
