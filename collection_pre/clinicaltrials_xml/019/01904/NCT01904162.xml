	<brief_summary>Previous clinical studies have indicated that finafloxacin is well-tolerated with few treatment-related adverse events. As a part of the clinical development of finafloxacin, other PK studies are required to determine the effect of other variables on the PK profile of finafloxacin. This study aims to determine the effect of age and gender on the pharmacokinetic profile of finafloxacin.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy adult male and/or female, 18 to 35 years of age (inclusive), or 65 years or over(≥ 65 years). Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18 and ≤ 30 kg/m2. No clinically significant abnormal findings, as judged by the Principal Investigator (PI), on the physical examination, ECG, medical history, or clinical laboratory results during screening. Negative screen for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, C and/or positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and antiHepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies. Females of childbearing potential were either sexually inactive (abstinent) for 14 days prior to the first dose and throughout the study or were using one of the following acceptable birth control methods: 1. Surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy) for a minimum of 6 months. 2. Intrauterine device (IUD) in place for at least 3 months. 3. Barrier methods (condom and diaphragm) plus spermicide for at least 14 days prior to the first dose and throughout the study. 4. Surgical sterilization of the partner (vasectomy for 6 months minimum). 5. Hormonal contraceptives for at least 3 months prior to the first dose of the study and throughout the study. Females of nonchildbearing potential were either postmenopausal for at least 2 consecutive years prior to Day 1, with a folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt; 40 IU/mL or had undergone one of the following sterilization procedures at least 6 months prior to Day 1: 1. Bilateral tubal ligation. 2. Hysterectomy. 3. Hysterectomy with unilateral or bilateral oophorectomy. 4. Bilateral oophorectomy. Male subjects were either sexually inactive (abstinent) or using a barrier method for 14 days prior to the first dose and throughout the study. In addition, male subjects and female subjects of childbearing potential were advised to remain sexually inactive or to keep the same birth control method for at least 30 days in the case of females and 90 days in the case of males, following the last dose. Male subjects were additionally advised not to donate sperm for 90 days following the last dose. Was able to understand and willing to sign an ICF. Subject with psychiatric, neurological, or behavioral disorders that may have interfered with the conduct or interpretation of the study. Subject with a history or presence of cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, endocrine, or hematological disorders that were capable of significantly altering the absorption, metabolism, or elimination of drugs, or were considered a risk with the study medication or could have interfered with the interpretation of data. Subject who had an abnormality in the 12lead ECG that, in the opinion of the PI, increased the risks associated with participating in the study. Subject with clinically relevant abnormal laboratory data or vital signs at screening, or any abnormal laboratory value which, in the opinion of the PI, could have interfered with the assessment of safety. Subject with exposure to any investigational drug within 30 days prior to screening. Subject with a known hypersensitivity or other contraindication to the use of fluoroquinolones. Subject with a history of tendon rupture or tendonitis. Subject who received corticosteroid therapy in the 4 weeks prior to study drug administration. Subject with prior participation in a finafloxacin investigational study. Subject who had current diagnosis or known history of drug and/or alcohol abuse. Subject who smoked &gt; 10 cigarettes per day and was unable or unwilling to refrain from nicotine during study confinement. Subject who received any drugs known to strongly inhibit or induce any of the enzymes within the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system within 30 days prior to the first dose. Subject who had exposure to any medication (with the exception of hormone replacement therapy [HRT] for the elderly subjects), including overthecounter (OTC) medications, 7 days prior to dosing. Subject who had exposure to antacid medication 24 hours prior to study drug administration until collection of the last PK sample. Subject who had consumed grapefruit 10 days prior to study drug administration until collection of the last PK sample. Subject with any clinically significant illness 3 months before the study. Subject who had donated blood or plasma during the previous 56 days prior to dosing. Subject who was unlikely to comply with the clinical study protocol. Subject who was a member of the clinical site or Sponsor personnel or their immediate family, defined as spouse, parent, sibling, child, grandparent, or grandchild. Any other condition that, in the opinion of the PI, precluded participation in the study.</criteria>
