	<brief_summary>Periodontitis is an infectious disease that destroys the tooth supporting tissues and triggers a local and systemic immune response. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM2) is a risk factor for periodontitis.Patients with DM2 and periodontitis have greater difficulty getting and maintaining an appropriate glycemic control. It has been reported an average decrease of 0.4% in glycosylated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c) in patients periodontally treated versus untreated. It is not has been established that periodontal treatment type in spaced sessions (multiple sessions over a period of 4 weeks) or rapid and intensive (2 sessions in 24 hours), has a greater impact on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of intensive periodontal treatment modality as compared with conventional on HbA1c level in periodontitis and DM2 decompensated patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Periodontal Treatment in Non-controlled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients. Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is proposed to conduct a clinical trial in 100 type 2 diabetic patients with poor glycemic control defined as a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥ 7% at last check, with randomization stratified by referral center, with two parallel groups (1: 1). Diabetic patients are in treatment and control in Diabetes Polyclinic Medical Specialty Center of the University of the Andes or the medical polyclinic Joan Alsina in San Bernardo . All decompensated DM2 patients diagnosed with chronic periodontitis will receive periodontal treatment based on 2 different periodontal treatment modalities: the first and most traditional is by spaced sessions by quadrant in 1 weekly session (5 sessions). The second form of treatment corresponds to an intensive periodontal treatment, whole mouth in 24 hours. All patients will be given an initial periodontal examination with manual north carolina periodontal probe, performed by a single operator previously calibrated. Periodontal status will be determine according to the classification of Page and Eke (2007) and periodontal wound size (PISA) will be also determine. Also, will be measured inflammatory mediators and cytokines in both plasma and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) by ELISA test. The data were entered into a medical record designed specifically for this study and the variables will be recorded prior and at 3 and 6 months after periodontal therapy.</detailed_description>
