	<brief_summary>This is a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to determine the effectiveness of vitamin D3 supplementation on depressive symptoms, self-management, and blood pressure in approximately 180 adult women with type 2 diabetes who have significant depressive symptoms. Consenting adult women who are eligible to participate will be randomly assigned to either a weekly dose of 50,000 international units of vitamin D3 supplementation or a matching weekly active comparator of 5,000 international units of vitamin D3 for six months. Participants will complete approximately four in-person study visits and several telephone visits throughout the six month trial period, where the researchers will assess depressive symptoms, diabetes self-management, and systolic blood pressure. Aim 1: To determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on depressive symptoms (primary outcome), self-management (secondary outcome), and systolic blood pressure (exploratory outcome) compared to placebo. Hypothesis: Women receiving vitamin D supplementation will report fewer depressive symptoms, increased diabetes self- management mediated by depression improvement, and have a lower systolic blood pressure compared to those taking placebo at three and six months follow-up. Aim 2: To explore the mechanistic effect of vitamin D supplementation on inflammatory biomarkers and their association with depression. Hypothesis: Women receiving vitamin D supplementation will have a decrease in inflammatory biomarkers which will be associated with fewer depressive symptoms compared to those taking placebo at three and six months follow-up</brief_summary>
