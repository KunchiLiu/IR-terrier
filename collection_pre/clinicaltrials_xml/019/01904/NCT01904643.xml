	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of lenalidomide when given together with combination chemotherapy in treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Lenalidomide may stop the growth of acute myeloid leukemia by blocking blood flow to the cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as mitoxantrone hydrochloride, etoposide, and cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving lenalidomide and combination chemotherapy may be an effective treatment for acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide and Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lenalidomide when used in combination with mitoxantrone hydrochloride, etoposide, and cytarabine (MEC) in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). II. To determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of this combination in this patient population. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether the combination of lenalidomide priming prior to re-induction chemotherapy with MEC has clinical activity in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lenalidomide. LENALIDOMIDE PRIMING: Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) for 5 or 7 days. RE-INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive etoposide intravenously (IV) over 1 hour, cytarabine IV over 3 hours, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 15-30 minutes on days 1-5. Patients failing to achieve blast count &lt; 5% at 21 days may receive a second course of induction therapy. Patients achieving complete remission proceed to lenalidomide priming. LENALIDOMIDE PRIMING: Within 4-6 weeks, patients receive lenalidomide PO for 5 or 7 days and then proceed to consolidation therapy. CONSOLIDATION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive etoposide IV over 1 hour, cytarabine IV over 3 hours, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 15-30 minutes on days 1-4. Treatment repeats every 28-35 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.</detailed_description>
