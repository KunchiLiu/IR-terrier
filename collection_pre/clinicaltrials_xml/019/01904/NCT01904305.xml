	<brief_title>Clinician Ability to Predict the Presence of Nosocomial Pneumonia Based on Bronchoscopic Findings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to determine whether interpretations of bronchoscopic results enable physicians to successfully predict the presence of pneumonia in traumatically injured patients. Bronchoscopies will be videotaped. The clinician doing the procedure will make prediction as to whether the patient, in fact, has pneumonia. In addition, at least one other physician will view the videotape and predict whether the patient has pneumonia. Once laboratory results are available, the physician predictions will be compared against the definitive laboratory determination</detailed_description>
