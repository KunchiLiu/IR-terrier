	<brief_summary>The aim is to set up tools that will serve as quality tracers for cryopreservation procedures. To meet this objective, we have chosen to develop reference samples (sentinel cells) that, in the medium term, can be used as controls to guarantee the quality of preservation for biological samples. The biological tools and an optimised follow-up strategy will make it possible to validate preservation procedures at the CRB in order to guarantee the perfect stability of samples and the validity of clinical studies.</brief_summary>
