	<brief_title>A Single-dose, Open-label, Parallel-group Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetics of BAF312 in Subjects With Renal Impairment Compared to Subjects With Normal Renal Function</brief_title>

	<mesh_term>Renal Insufficiency</mesh_term>
	<criteria>All subjects: At least 50 kg and body mass index (BMI) within 1838 kg/m2. CYP2C9 wildtype (CYP2C9*1 homozygous carriers) Renal impairment: Subjects must have either mild, moderate or severe renal impairment All subjects Use of other investigational drugs within certain timelines Donation or loss of 400 mL or more of blood or plasma within eight (8) weeks prior to initial dosing History of cardiac rhythm abnormalities or cardiac rhythm abnormalities identified in the 24h Holter ECG recording including episodes of bradycardia (HR &lt; 50 bpm) during waking hours and/or arrhythmic episodes; subjects with history or presence of ventricular rhythm disturbances (ventricular extrasystoles &gt;100/24h, or higher grade), or supraventricular arrhythmias (other than occasional supraventricular ectopic beats with a maximum of 5 subsequent ectopic beats per event) or subjects with conduction disturbances (higher than AVblock grade 1) or bradycardia or tachycardia. Women of childbearing potential History of malignancy of any organ system History or presence of symptomatic postural hypotension or syncope. Total WBC or lymphocyte counts which falls outside the 1.5fold local laboratory normal range or platelet count &lt; 30,000/Î¼L at screening or baseline. Clinically significant infection or recent vaccination with liveattenuated vaccines. History or presence of hepatitis B or C and/or positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or Hepatitis C test result at screening. Renal impairment: History or presence of any noncontrolled and clinically significant disease that could affect the study outcome or that would place the patient at undue risk. Any surgical or medical condition other than renal impairment which might significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, or which may jeopardize the safety of the study subject in case of participation in the study. Treatment with certain drugs Healthy subjects: History or presence of any clinically significant disease of any major system organ class including (but not limited to) cardiovascular, metabolic, renal, neurological or psychiatric diseases. Any surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, drugs, or which may jeopardize the subject in case of participation in the study. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
