	<brief_title>Volar Locked Plating vs Bridging External Fixation in Distal Radius Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We have designed a randomized prospective study for comparison of volar locked plating versus Hoffman II bridging external fixation in patients with extraarticular dislocated distal radius fractures AO/OTA type A3. On the basis of power analysis a total of 160 patients are to be included in this project. The follow-up period is 1 year and evaluation is based on x-ray analysis, grip strength, range of motion, pain and satisfaction with the treatment ( PRWE, Quick-DASH)</detailed_description>
