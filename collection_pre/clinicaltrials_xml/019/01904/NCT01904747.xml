	<brief_summary>This study is intended to quantify the effect of food on the extent of absorption of palbociclib. The caloric content of the food and the time of the meals with respect to palbociclib administration may influence the capacity of the body to absorb the drug. High and low calorie meals will be given to the subjects 30 minutes before palbociclib administration as 2 of the 3 conditions to compare with completely absence of food in the body when dosing (fasted).The third condition to test and compare with fasted stage will be the administration of food before and after palbociclib administration. This information will help the program to decide wether or not the presence of food when dosing palbociclib help with its absorption and to what extent it does help. Based on the collected information, a recommendation about the administration of palbociclib with food will be provided to patients.</brief_summary>
