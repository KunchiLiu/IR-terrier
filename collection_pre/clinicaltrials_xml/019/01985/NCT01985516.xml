	<brief_summary>Currently, there are no specific guidelines or best practice suggestions for female catheterization. However, there is a consensus that an anesthetic lubricating gel should be routinely used in women as well. Urethral lubrication can be performed in two different techniques: instillation of the gel directly into the urethra or pouring the gel on the catheter's tip. In this study, we will evaluate the pain level during female urethral catheterization in each technique. Our hypothesis is that the level of pain will be much less if the lubrication agent will be instilled directely to the urethra.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Female Urethral Catheterization - Instillation of the Lubricating Gel Into the Urethra or Pouring it on the Catheter's Tip?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized prospective study that will compare the pain levels of urethral catheterization in women randomized to intraurethral lidocaine gel instillation or lubrication of the catheter's tip with lidocaine gel. Women aged 18 years and older who will be referred for multichannel Urodynamic study in order to evaluate lower urinary tract symptomswill be included. Patients will be randomized to 2 groups: (1) 5mL of 2% lidocaine gel instilled directly into the urethra 5 minutes before catheterization; (2), 5mL of 2% lidocaine gel poured on the distal part of the catheter. The randomization technique will be employed by a computerized random number generator. A 12F Nelaton urethral catheter will be introduced in order to measure post-void residual volumes. Subsequently, multichannel Urodynamic testing (Duet Encompass System - Mediwatch Group Plc) will be performed using a dual lumen 6F urethral and 9F rectal catheters. Filling will be carried out using room temperature saline at a filling rate of 50 ml/min. Patients will be requested to fill out a 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain) visual analog pain scale (VAS) in different time points: prior to gel instillation (baseline), immediately after gel instillation (only in group 1), immediately after the introduction of the Nelaton catheter, 5 and 30 minutes after the catheter will be taken out. Time frame of the study: 30 minutes before the test and 1 hour after the test. Since the study evaluates pain during the procedure the time frame of the study and assessment is very short. longer follow-up is not needed.</detailed_description>
