	<brief_summary>Cow Milk Allergy (CMA) occurs in 2 to 5 % of all infants. Reflux, regurgitation and vomiting are well recognised symptoms of CMA. The recommended treatment of CMA is an extensive hydrolysate. The North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) &amp; the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) reflux guidelines have no strict recommendations for the treatment of distressed infants with reflux, suspected of CMA. One of the preferred proposed options is to thicken an extensive hydrolysate . This study aims at evaluating the additional value of a thickened extensive hydrolysate in children suspected of CMA and presenting with frequent regurgitation.</brief_summary>
