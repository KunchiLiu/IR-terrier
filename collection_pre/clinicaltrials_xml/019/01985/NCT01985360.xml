	<brief_summary>The purpose of the ISCHEMIA-CKD trial is to determine the best management strategy for patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD), at least moderate ischemia and advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD; estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt;30 or on dialysis). This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with a target randomization of ~1000 patients with advanced CKD and at least moderate ischemia on stress testing. Participants will be assigned at random to a routine invasive strategy (INV) with cardiac catheterization (cath) followed by revascularization plus optimal medical therapy (OMT) or to a conservative strategy (CON) of OMT, with cath and revascularization reserved for those who fail OMT. The trial is designed to run seamlessly in parallel to the main ISCHEMIA trial as a companion ancillary trial. SPECIFIC AIMS A. Primary Aim. The primary aim of the ISCHEMIA-CKD trial is to determine whether an invasive strategy of routine early catheterization followed by optimal revascularization, in addition to OMT, will reduce the primary composite endpoint of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction in SIHD patients with advanced CKD and at least moderate ischemia over an average follow-up of approximately 4 years compared with an initial conservative strategy of OMT alone with catheterization reserved for those who fail OMT. The primary endpoint is time to centrally adjudicated death or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI). B. Secondary Aims. Major: To compare angina-related quality of life between the INV and CON strategies. Other secondary aims include: comparing the incidence of the composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for unstable angina or heart failure; composite of cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction; cardiovascular death; non-fatal myocardial infarction; all-cause death; stroke; hospitalization for heart failure or unstable angina Condition: Coronary Disease Procedure: Cardiac catheterization Phase: Phase III Condition: Cardiovascular Diseases Procedure: Angioplasty, Transluminal, Percutaneous Coronary, other catheter-based interventions Phase: Phase III Condition: Heart Diseases Procedure: Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery Phase: Phase III</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: Among patients with advanced CKD, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death,15-30 times higher than the age-adjusted cardiovascular mortality rate in the general population. The projected 4-year mortality is &gt;50% in patients with advanced CKD and is worse than that for patients in the general population who have cancers, heart failure, stroke or MI. Participants with advanced CKD are 5-10 times more likely to die than to reach end stage renal disease (ESRD). Despite this, ~80% of contemporary coronary artery disease (CAD) trials exclude participants with advanced CKD. Most of the treatments aimed at reducing cardiovascular events in advanced CKD are therefore extrapolated from cohorts without advanced CKD. Participants with advanced CKD and cardiovascular disease are undertreated with less frequent use of statins and revascularization therapies, and the optimal management approach to these patients is unknown. Participants with advanced CKD are notably underrepresented in contemporary trials comparing revascularization with medical therapy in SIHD patients, such as the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes (BARI 2D) trial or the Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation (COURAGE) trial,making any assessment about the efficacy of revascularization plus medical therapy vs. initial medical therapy alone in this cohort problematic. Participants with advanced CKD are at increased risk for complications of the assigned invasive procedure, specifically contrast-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), dialysis, major bleeding and short-term risk of death. However, there is controversy in the medical literature regarding the incidence (&lt;1% to &gt;30%), effective treatment (saline hydration, N-acetyl cysteine, or sodium bicarbonate) and prognosis of contrast induced AKI (&lt;0.5% to &gt;5% requiring dialysis). In addition although contrast induced AKI have been associated with increase in short-term mortality residual confounding in these studies makes interpretation difficulty. Moreover it is unknown if these short-term increased risks are offset by long-term benefits. Limited observational study in the CKD cohort suggests a survival benefit of revascularization when compared with medical therapy alone long-term, despite increase in short-term risks. However, the medical therapy in these trials was not optimized, drug eluting stents were rarely used and there is undoubtedly inherent selection and ascertainment bias with observational studies. The above has resulted in substantial clinical equipoise in the management of these patients with the rates of revascularization of only around 10-45%. The results of ISCHEMIA-CKD will have profound implications for guidelines, health policy, and clinical practice.</detailed_description>
