	<brief_title>Combined Modality Treatment of Sarcomas of the Extremities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design A dose escalation trial of Pazopanib, starting at 400mg daily, orally in combination with the standard 25 x 2Gy preoperative radiotherapy in newly diagnosed extremity sarcoma patients. Dose of pazopanib will be escalated via 600mg to maximally 800mg. Overall treatment time of pazopanib is 40 days. Treatment plan: Pazopanib Dose level Dose of pazopanib orally, once daily, # patients 1. (starting) 400 mg 3 2. 600 mg 3 3. (maximum) 800 mg 3 Treatment plan: radiotherapy RT is given during 5 weeks with a once daily fraction of 2 Gray (50 Gray in 25 daily fractions) RT planning: The dose planning should be performed by CT based Intensity Modulated RT (IMRT) or 3 Dimensional Conformal RT (3D-RT) according to the local planning protocol of the participating institute. Dose specification: According to the ICRU 50/62.</detailed_description>

Prior major surgery or trauma within 28 days prior to first dose of study drug and/or presence of any nonhealing wound, fracture, or ulcer. 13. Chemotherapy or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. 14. Biological therapy or treatment with an investigational agent within 28 days or 5 halflives, whichever is longer prior to the first dose of study drug. 15. Prohibited medications listed in the protocol for 14 days or five halflives of a drug (whichever is longer) prior to Visit 1 and for the duration of the study should not be taken. 16.
