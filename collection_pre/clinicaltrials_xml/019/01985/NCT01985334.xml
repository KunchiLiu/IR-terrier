	<brief_summary>The main goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of glycopyrronium bromide and indacaterol maleate and glycopyrronium bromide fixed dose combination (FDC) in patients with moderate COPD who switch from their current COPD therapy. This study aims to provide data on how non-exacerbating, but still symptomatic patients with moderate COPD switching from their current COPD treatment to glycopyrronium bromide or indacaterol maleate and glycopyrronium bromide FDC maintain or improve their symptoms. Another purpose of this study is to increase awareness and usage of validated COPD symptoms tools and dyspnea questionnaires in order to facilitate clinical assessment and improve early diagnosis of symptomatic patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Glycopyrronium or Indacaterol Maleate and Glycopyrronium Bromide Fixed-dose Combination Regarding Symptoms and Health Status in Patients With Moderate COPD Switching From Treatment With Any Standard COPD Regimen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment epoch will last 12 weeks. The total duration of the study for each patient is 12 weeks (from randomization) plus 30 days of safety follow-up. The study has three phases: screening phase (=wash-out period, if required), treatment phase and safety follow-up phase. Eligible patients will be randomized to either receive glycopyrronium or indacaterol maleate and glycopyrronium bromide fixed dose combination or to remain in their baseline therapy, in an allocation ratio of 3:1 for each cluster (Groups A, B, C, and D), based on their COPD symptoms and baseline treatment: Group A: Patients treated with any SABA ( Short-acting β2-adrenergic agonist) and/or SAMA (Short-acting muscarinic antagonist) as monotherapy or in free or fixed dose combination (FDC) will be assigned to glycopyrronium or will remain in their baseline therapy (3:1) Group B: Patients treated with any LABA (Long-acting β2-adrenergic agonist) or LAMA (Long-acting muscarinic antagonist) monotherapy and mMRC score =1 point will be assigned to glycopyrronium or will remain in their baseline therapy (3:1) Group C: Patients treated with any LABA and ICS (Inhaled corticosteroid) in free or FDC will be assigned to indacaterol maleate and glycopyrronium bromide fixed dose combination or will remain in their baseline therapy (3:1) Group D: Patients treated with any LABA or LAMA monotherapy and mMRC score &gt;1 point will be assigned to indacaterol maleate and glycopyrronium bromide fixed dose combination or will remain in their baseline therapy (3:1)</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male and female adults aged ≥ 40 years Patients with moderate COPD according to the GOLD criteria 2013 Current or exsmokers who have a smoking history of at least 10 pack years Patients with airflow limitation indicated by a postbronchodilator FEV1 ≥50% and &lt;80% of the predicted normal value and a postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt;0.7 at Visit 2. Post bronchodilator refers to within 1015 min of inhalation of 400 μg (4x100 μg) of salbutamol Patients who, at Visit 1, have been for at least 3 months on a stable dose of one of the following COPD baseline treatments: *Any SABA monotherapy (such as, but not limited to, salbutamol) *Any SAMA monotherapy (such as, but not limited to, ipratropium) *Any SABA and SAMA in free or FDC (such as, but not limited to, salbutamol/ipratropium) *Any LABA monotherapy (such as, but not limited to, formoterol, salmeterol, indacaterol) *Any LAMA monotherapy (such as, but not limited to, tiotropium, aclidinium) except glycopyrronium bromide (NVA237) *Any LABA and ICS in free (ICS such as, but not limited to, beclomethasone, fluticasone) or FDC (such as, but not limited to, salmeterol/fluticasone, formoterol/budesonide). Patients with an mMRC score ≥1 at Visit 1. Patients with conditions contraindicated for treatment with, or having a history of reactions/ hypersensitivity to any of the following inhaled drugs or to drugs of similar chemical classes or any component thereof: Anticholinergic agents, Long and shortacting 2adrenergic agonists, Sympathomimetic amines, Lactose or any of the other excipients of the trial medication. Patients with narrowangle glaucoma or urinary retention, severe renal impairment (history of estimated glomerular filtration rate below 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 within 12 months prior to visit 1), including those with endstage renal disease requiring dialysis. Patients with active/ clinical history of asthma.If the Investigator finds clear and compelling evidence that a patient was misdiagnosed with asthma in the past, then the burden of proof is on the Investigator to properly document this previous misdiagnosis. This documentation must include the rationale for this change in diagnosis including reference to the differential diagnosis that supports this decision. Patients with a history of malignancy of any organ system (other than localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin), treated or untreated, within the past 5 years, regardless of whether there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases. Patients who have a postbronchodilator FEV1 decrease more than 10% compared to prebronchodilator FEV1 result at Visit 2 (see Appendix 5 for details). A documented history of &gt;1 COPD exacerbation requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids or antibiotics and/or hospitalization in the previous 12 months. Patients who have NOT had a COPD exacerbation in the previous 12 months and develop a COPD exacerbation between screening (Visit 1) and (Visit 2) will not be eligible but will be permitted to be rescreened after a minimum of 6 weeks after the resolution of the COPD exacerbation. (Patients suffering an exacerbation between Visit 1 and Visit 2 can only be rescreened in case it is the first one in the previous 12 months. In case this COPD exacerbation has led to an alteration of the patient COPD treatment, before this patient can be rescreened 3 months of stable COPD treatment will be required as described in Inclusion Criterion 6). Patients who, in the judgment of the investigator, have a clinically relevant laboratory abnormality or a clinically significant condition such as (but not limited to): *Unstable ischemic heart disease, left ventricular failure (NYHA Class III &amp; IV), history of myocardial infarction,arrhythmia (excluding chronic stable atrial fibrillation). Patients with such events not considered clinically significant by the investigator may be considered for inclusion in the study.*Uncontrolled hypoor hyperthyroidism, hypokalaemia or hyperadrenergic state. *Any condition which might compromise patient safety or compliance, interfere with evaluation, or preclude completion of the study History of resting QTc (Fridericia preferred, but Bazett acceptable) &gt;450 msec (male) or &gt;460 msec (female) within five years before Visit 1. Patients who are treated with glycopyrronium bromide (NVA237) at visit 1 are not allowed to be included into the trialPatients on nonselective betablockers. Those patients may enter the study after nonselective betablocker withdrawal during a 7day washout period. Patients receiving any other prohibited COPDrelated medications specified in Table 52 Prohibited COPD related medications must undergo the required washout period prior to Visit 2. Patients who are, in the opinion of the investigator known to be unreliable or noncompliant. Patients with a body mass index (BMI) of more than 40 kg/m2. Use of other investigational drugs within 5 halflives of enrollment or within 30 days, whichever is longer. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive hCG laboratory test. Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using effective methods of contraception during dosing of study treatment.</criteria>
