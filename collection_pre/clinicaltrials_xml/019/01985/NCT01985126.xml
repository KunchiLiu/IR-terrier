	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2 daratumumab treatment regimens in participants with multiple myeloma who have received at least 3 prior lines of therapy (including a proteasome inhibitor [PI] and immunomodulatory drug [IMiD]) or are double refractory to a PI and an IMiD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Safety Study of Daratumumab in Patients With Multiple Myeloma Who Have Received at Least 3 Prior Lines of Therapy (Including a Proteasome Inhibitor [PI] and Immunomodulatory Drug [IMiD]) or Are Double Refractory to a PI and an IMiD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known) study of daratumumab for the treatment of participants with multiple myeloma who have received at least 3 prior lines of therapy including a PI and an IMiD or whose disease is double refractory to both a PI and an IMiD. Up to approximately 150 participants are to be enrolled. The study includes screening, treatment, and follow-up phases. Participants will receive daratumumab by intravenous infusion (28-day cycles) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other protocol-defined reasons. For all study drug administrations, participants will receive pre- and post-infusion medications for the prevention of infusion related reactions. Follow-up will continue until death, loss to follow up, consent withdrawal for study participation, or study end, whichever occurs first. The study will consist of 2 sequential parts (Part 1 and Part 2). The purpose of Part 1 is to select a dose and schedule for Part 2 of the study. Assessment of tumor response and disease progression will be conducted according to IMWG response criteria. Serial pharmacokinetic blood samples and a pharmacogenomic blood sample will be collected. Safety will be monitored throughout the study. At the end of the study, participants who are benefiting from treatment with daratumumab will have the option to continue treatment.</detailed_description>
