	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives: To determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of SAR405838 / pimasertib combination therapy in patients with solid tumors. To assess the anti-tumor activities of SAR405838 / pimasertib in patients with solid tumors. Secondary Objectives: To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of SAR405838 and pimasertib. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effect of the SAR405838 and pimasertib. To characterize genetic status in tumor tissue and circulating tumor DNA.</brief_summary>

Prior history of myositis or rhabdomyolysis. Recent major surgery or trauma, unhealing/open wounds. The patient has had congestive heart failure, unstable angina, a myocardial infarction, cardiac conduction abnormality or pacemaker or a stroke within 3 months of entering the study. The patient has a baseline corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt;480 ms or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;50% or less than the lower limit of normal. The patient has a previouslyidentified allergy or hypersensitivity to components of the study treatment formulations.

Recent history of acute pancreatitis. Clinically significant illness, medical condition, surgical history, physical finding, or laboratory abnormality that could affect the safety of the patient; alter the absorption of the study drugs; or impair the assessment of study results. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
