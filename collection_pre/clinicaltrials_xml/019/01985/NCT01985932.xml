	<criteria>Age 18 or older Male Biopsy proven prostate cancer without evidence of metastatic disease Planned definitive external beam RT with daily ERB and implanted Visicoil fiducial markers. Prior fMRIec documenting an IPL 25 mm2 in axial bidimensional diameter product, concordant with intraprostatic tumor location as documented on transrectal ultrasoundbiopsy Subject capable of giving informed consent for standard external beam RT and for the study. No current contraindication that would prevent MRI or gadolinium contrast. Metastatic disease Lack of fMRIec documeneting an IPL 25 mm2 in axial bidimensional product, concordant with intraprostatic tumor location as documented on transrectal untrasound biopsy Neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy greater than 10 weeks, defined from date of LHRH analog injection to date of fMRIsim Contraindication that would prevent MRI or gadolinium contrast GFR 30 mL/min/1.73m2 per CrockoftGault formula.</criteria>
