	<brief_summary>Fovea is characterized by its vessel-free zone, called foveal avascular zone and it can be visualized by fluorescein angiography. Removal of epiretinal membrane and internal limiting membrane is frequently performed procedure and we suspected that these procedures may affect integrity of foveal avascular zone. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the change of foveal avascular zone after removal of epiretinal membrane and internal limiting membrane</brief_summary>
