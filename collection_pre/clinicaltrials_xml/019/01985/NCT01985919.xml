	<brief_summary>This clinical research protocol is intended to allow for bone marrow aspirate/biopsy and blood specimens to be collected for research purposes, specifically allowing subjects the option of sedation during the bone marrow procedure. Samples will be banked for future research related to cancer and other diseases. Researchers hope this protocol will improve the collection of research correlative and translational biopsy specimens for clinical research.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>PLanned procedure including a bone marrow aspirate and/or bone marrow biopsy The procedure is planned for the purpose of obtaining a research specimen (as part of another research study or as part of this standalone sample collection protocol.). Procedures with a dual purpose (i.e. to obtain both clinicallyindicated specimens and research specimens) are permitted, but procedures to obtain clinical specimens only are not permitted. All subjects must provide written informed consent for the biopsy procedure, the collection of bone marrow and blood specimens for research purposes and (if planned) the administration of sedation. Moderate sedation may not be administrated to subjects with a clinical contraindication to its provision, or if the investigator believes that administration of moderate sedation would constitute under risk to the subject.</criteria>
