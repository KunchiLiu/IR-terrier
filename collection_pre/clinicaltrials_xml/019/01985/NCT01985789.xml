	<brief_summary>The asthmatic airway is identified and studied using inhaled agents such as histamine and methacholine. The use of antihistamines prior to the test will inhibit the test result if histamine is used to cause airway constriction. If using methacholine, this may also be true depending on whether old (e.g. benadryl) or new (e.g. desloratadine) antihistamines are used. This study will look at the effect of old and new antihistamines on inhaled methacholine challenge response in individuals with mild asthma.</brief_summary>
