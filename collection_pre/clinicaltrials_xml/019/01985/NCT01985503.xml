	<brief_summary>In Turku PET Centre, there have been 3 positron emission tomography studies on brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity in healthy adults. BATPET was performed between 2008 and 2009. FATBAT started in 2011 and Dixon-BAT in 2012 and they are both currently ongoing. In the current study, participants of BATPET, FATBAT and Dixon-BAT studies are recruited for a follow-up study to examine associations between obesity, cardiovascular risk factors, serum metabolic profile and BAT structure at baseline and during follow-up several years later. 43 BATPET participants will be called for follow-up in 2013 with a follow-up period of 5 years and 52 FATBAT and Dixon-BAT participants in years 2014 and 2015 with a follow-up period of 3 years. The aim of this study is to examine longitudinal associations between BAT function and structure, liver adiposity and cardiovascular risk factors at baseline and during follow-up.</brief_summary>
