	<brief_title>A Trial of Robotic-assisted Versus Laparoscopic Versus Open Abdominoperineal Resection for Treating Low Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be eligible for inclusion if their primary tumors is low rectal cancer. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to robotic-assisted (arm A)versus laparoscopic (arm B) versus open abdominoperineal resection (arm C).</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Rectal Neoplasms</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Histologically proven rectal adenocarcinoma Inferior edge of the tumor located within 5 cm from the anal verge as determined by colonoscopy withdrawing and digital rectal examination No evidence of distant metastases (including pelvis, peritoneum, liver, lung, brain, bone, distant lymph node, etc) according to ultrasound, CT, PETCT, etc Tumor assessed as cT1T3 or ycT1T3 after preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy by pelvic MRI No other malignancies in medical history except adequately treated basocellular carcinoma of the skin or in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri Suitable for both robotassisted, laparoscopic and open surgery American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I III No other preoperative treatment except neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy Informed consent Tumors assessed as cT1N0 and suitable for local excision Signs of acute intestinal obstruction, bleeding or perforation needing emergency surgery More than one colorectal tumor Familial Adenomatosis Polyposis, Lynch Syndrome, acute inflammatory bowel disease Schedules need for other synchronous colon surgery Absolute contraindications to general anesthesia or prolonged pneumoperitoneum (ASA class &gt; III) Pregnancy or lactation Patients and/or family members can not understand and accept this study Patients received chemoradiotherapy or other antitumor therapy before surgery</criteria>
