	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple doses of volitinib administered to patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors and determine MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose) or RPTD(recommended Phase 2 dose).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study of the Volitinib (HMPL-504) in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint is evaluation of safety and tolerability during all the study of therapy following the initiation of multiple dosing of HMPL-504. The safety and tolerability variables to be evaluated in this study are adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs (specifically including blood pressure), clinical laboratory evaluations including serum chemistry, hematology (Maximum Tolerated Dose), and urinalysis (with detailed sediment analysis, proteinuria, and 24-hour urine for collection for protein), and electrocardiograms (ECGs) in triplicate, Incidence and nature of DLTs (Dose-Limiting Toxicity), to determine the MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Signed Informed Consent Form Age≥18 years Histologically or cytologically documented(include both dose escalation stage and dose expansion stage), incurable, locally advanced, or metastatic solid malignancy In the dose escalation stage: patients with any malignant solid tumor type for whom standard therapy either has proven to be ineffective (progressed on, or failed to respond to) or intolerable, have no access to standard systemic therapy or standard systemic therapy does not exist. In the dose expansion stage: Metastatic or locally advanced gastric cancer patients with cMet positive b)Metastatic or locally advanced EGFR wild type NSCLC patients and with cMet positive. ECOG performance status of 0, or 1 Male or female patients of childproducing potential must agree to use double barrier contraception, condoms, sponge, foams, jellies, diaphragm or intrauterine device (IUD), contraceptives (oral or parenteral), Implanon, injectables or other avoidance of pregnancy measures during the study and for 90 days after the last day of treatment Absolute neutrophil count ＜1500 cells/uL, hemoglobin ＜9 g/dL or platelet count &lt; 100,000/mm3 Total bilirubin &gt; 1.5×the the upper limit of normal(ULN).
