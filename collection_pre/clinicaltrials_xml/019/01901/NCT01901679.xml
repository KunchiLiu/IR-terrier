	<brief_title>Celecoxib Inhibition of Aromatase Expression and Inflammation in Adipose Tissue of Obese Postmenopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study seeks to examine how effective the celebrex may be in reducing inflammation, crown-like structures in fat tissue, the enzyme aromatase, PGE-M in the urine and estrogen in blood and urine. Volunteer subjects will be expected to stay in the hospital for about 2 weeks taking Celebrex for approximately 10 days while eating a diet similar to what they consumed before coming into the hospital for the study.</detailed_description>
