	<brief_summary>The purpose of this protocol is to compare and develop new surgical technique of partial-thickness corneal transplantation for treating corneal opacity. A newly developed technique, "dovetail" laser-assisted lamellar anterior keratoplasty (LALAK), will be tested and compared with standard full-thickness corneal transplantation, Intralase-enabled keratoplasty (IEK). The new LALAK technique replaces only the front portion of the cornea and does not have the risks associated with conventional IEK. Additionally, optical coherence tomography (OCT) will be used to guide the depth of the graft and donor dissections. The data will be analyzed to understand whether the new technique (LALAK) can repeatedly achieve good visual outcomes with lower risk from the operation compared to the visual outcomes and risk associated with the current standard of care, IEK.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Eyes with corneal opacities that cannot be adequately or safely corrected with spectacles, contact lens or excimer laser surface ablation. The cornea must have healthy endothelium (endothelial cell density &gt; 1,500/mm2). 1. Preoperative corneal thickness less than 400 microns. 2. Inability to give informed consent. 3. Corneal edema 4. Central guttata 5. Inability to maintain stable fixation for OCT imaging. 6. Inability to commit to required visits to complete the study. 7. Eyes with concurrent cataract, retinal diseases, glaucoma, or other eye conditions that may limit the visual outcome after surgery. 8. Patients with severe collagen vascular diseases or ocular surface disorders</criteria>
