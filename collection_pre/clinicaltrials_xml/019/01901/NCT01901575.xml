	<brief_title>Remifentanil Intravenous Patient Controlled Analgesia (IVPCA) for Ablation of Idiopathic Ventricular Tachycardia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study is to determine the effects of remifentanil conscious sedation in patients undergoing Electrophysiological (EP) studies for the ablation of idiopathic ventricular tachycardia and/or persistent frequent PVCs of non-ischemic origin. Remifentanil is an analgesic- synthetic opiate with an very short half life. It is rapidly broken down by enzymes in the blood and is ideally suited for continuous sedation. The effect is practically eliminated within 5 minutes after the intravenous sedation is stopped. You are being asked to participate in this study because you are already scheduled to undergo EP studies under the care of your cardiologist for the ablation of idiopathic ventricular tachycardia and/or persistent frequent PVCs of non-ischemic origin.</detailed_description>
