	<brief_summary>Adolescents and young adults who are living with cancer are not benefiting from the same age-appropriate physical and psychosocial care, as are children and older adults. As a result, their unique needs often go unmet or unaddressed. Studies have demonstrated that a lack of age-appropriate care may be responsible for a deceased quality of life. Studies have also shown that physical activity is able to reduce many of the negative side-effects linked to cancer and its treatment (e.g., nausea, vomiting, fatigue). A light form of physical activity that is both safe and manageable for cancer patients is yoga. The purpose of this study is to examine the achievability and safety of a light 7-week home/hospice-based Hatha yoga program (available on DVD) in the adolescent and young adult non-curative cancer population. This study will also examine the ability of yoga to reduce cancer related side effects.</brief_summary>
