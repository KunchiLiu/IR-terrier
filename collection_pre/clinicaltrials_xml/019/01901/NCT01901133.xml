	<brief_summary>This study will assess the influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of a single dose of MDV3100 in male subjects. The study will consist of two treatment arms. Arm A will assess the influence of mild hepatic impairment, and Arm B will assess the influence of moderate hepatic impairment. Data obtained from subjects with hepatic impairment will be compared to data from Body Mass Index (BMI) and age-matched subjects with normal hepatic function.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria: Subject must be nonfertile, i.e., surgically sterilized or must practice an adequate contraceptive method to prevent pregnancies Body Mass Index (BMI) of at least 18.5 and no greater than 34.0 kg/m2. Subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment must also meet the following inclusion criteria: ChildPugh classification Class A (mild, 5 or 6 points) or Class B (moderate, 7 to 9 points) liver function impairment. All subjects must not have any of the following characteristics: Known or suspected hypersensitivity to MDV3100 or any components of the formulation used. History of seizure or any condition that may predispose to seizure. Also history of loss of consciousness or transient ischemic attack within 12 months of enrollment (Day 1 visit). Any clinically significant history of asthma, eczema, any other allergic condition or previous severe hypersensitivity to any drug (excluding nonactive hay fever). Abnormal pulse and/or blood pressure (BP) measurements at the prestudy visit as follows: Pulse &lt;40 or &gt;90 bpm; mean systolic BP &gt;160 mmHg; mean diastolic BP &gt;100 mmHg (BP measurements taken in triplicate after subject has been resting in supine position for 5 min; pulse will be measured A QTcF interval of &gt;450 ms after repeated measurements (consistently after duplicate measurements), a history of unexplained syncope, cardiac arrest, unexplained cardiac arrhythmias or torsades de pointes, structural heart disease, or a family history of Long QT Syndrome (LQTS). Significant renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance below 60 mL/min, estimated according to the method of modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) formula). Regular use of any inducer of metabolism (e.g. barbiturates, rifampin) in the 3 months prior to admission to the Clinical Unit. Participation in any clinical study within 3 months or participation in more than 3 clinical studies within 12 months, prior to the expected date of enrolment into the study, provided that the clinical study did not entail a biological compound with a long terminal half life. For subjects with normal hepatic function: Regular use of any prescribed or OTC (overthecounter) drugs, which includes vitamins, natural and herbal remedies (e.g. St John's wort) and food supplements in the 4 weeks prior to admission to the Clinical Unit and use of any drugs in the 2 weeks prior to admission to the Clinical Unit, except for occasional use of paracetamol (up to 3 g/day). Positive serology test for HBsAg, anti HAV (IgM), antiHCV, antiHIV1 or antiHIV2. For subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment: Fluctuating or rapidly deteriorating hepatic function, as indicated by strongly varying or worsening of clinical and/or laboratory signs of hepatic impairment within the screening period. (e.g. advanced ascites, infection of ascites, fever, active gastrointestinal bleeding). Change in dose regimen of medically required medication within the last two weeks before prestudy examination (allowed comedication in patients), and/or the use of unallowed comedication in the 3 weeks prior to admission to the clinical unit (not allowed: any known hepatic enzyme altering agents or compounds known to restrict metabolism). Presence of a hepatocellular carcinoma, or an acute liver disease caused by an infection or drug toxicity. Severe portal hypertension or surgical portosystemic shunts, including TIPSS (Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt). Biliary obstruction or other cause of hepatic impairment not related to parenchymal disorder and/or disease of the liver. Signs of significant hepatic encephalopathy (Hepatic encephalopathy score &gt;2). Severe ascites and/or pleural effusion Esophageal variceal bleeding in the medical history. Thrombocyte level below 40x109/L and /or hemoglobin below 90 g/L. Previous liver transplantation. Positive serology test for, anti HAV (IgM), antiHIV1 or antiHIV2.</criteria>
