Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1. Female patients of childbearing potential and male patients who are not surgically sterile must be willing to use effective methods of contraception as defined by protocol during the treatment period and for 10 days after the last dose of RO5503781. There are no limitations on additional, allowable type and amount of prior antitumor therapy. Acute toxicities from any prior antitumor therapy, surgery, or radiotherapy must have resolved to NCICTCAE version 4.03 Grade &lt;/= 1. The last dose of prior therapy must &gt;/= 21 days prior to the first administration of study drug RO5503781 (or &gt;/= 5 x terminal halflife of that therapy). Adequate bone marrow, hepatic and renal function Patients with stable CNS metastases (have had therapy or do not require therapy, are off steroids, have no change on screening CT or MRI and are asymptomatic), are eligible Any form of leukemia except for Stage 0 and 1 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) not requiring treatment in addition to the underlying malignancy Hormonal therapy within the 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study medication. Patients with prostate cancer who are not surgically castrated should remain on GnRH analogues. Patients who are using other investigational agents or who received investigational drugs &lt;/= 4 weeks prior to study treatment start. Preexisting GI disorders that may interfere with proper absorption of the drug(s), as per investigator discretion. History of allergic reactions attributed to components of the formulated product History of seizure disorders or unstable CNS metastases Any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other conditions that could affect their participation in the study Patients who must receive CYP2C8 inhibitors, substrates or inducers, strong CYP 3A4 inducers or moderate/strong CYP3A4 inhibitors listed in protocol while on study. Substrates, inducers, and inhibitors listed in protocol must be discontinued 7 or 14 days prior to start of study medication. Evidence of electrolyte imbalance (treatment for correction of electrolyte imbalances is permitted during screening to meet eligibility) Pregnant or breast feeding women HIVpositive patients who are currently receiving combination antiretroviral therapy Patients with known coagulopathy, platelet disorder or history of nondrug induced thrombocytopenia.

A washout period of at least 7 days prior to the start of study is required. Patients may receive anticoagulant flushes for maintenance of indwelling catheters.
