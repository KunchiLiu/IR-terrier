	<brief_title>Transarterial Chemoembolization Plus Radiotherapy or Sorafenib in Hepatocellular Carcinoma With Major Vascular Invasion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current practice guidelines recommend sorafenib for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma invading major intrahepatic vessels. However, recent data suggest that the combination of transarterial chemoembolization and external beam radiotherapy would be effective as sorafenib.</detailed_description>
