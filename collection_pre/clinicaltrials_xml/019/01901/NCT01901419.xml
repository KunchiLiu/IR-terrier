	<brief_summary>Hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass results in peripheral vasoconstriction and heparin trapping. Hypoperfusion and ischemic-reperfusion injury are associated with systemic inflammatory response, while insufficient and delayed neutralization of heparin by protamine may contribute to more blood loss during rewarming stage. Nitroglycerin infusion, an NO-related vasodilator, is an established and effective treatment for unstable angina, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and perioperative hemodynamic management for cardiac surgery. Therefore, we hypothesize that nitroglycerin infusion during rewarming corrects systemic ischemic stress and facilitates heparin neutralization in cardiac surgery.</brief_summary>
