	<brief_summary>The hypothesis of this study is that coronally positioned tunnel with acellular dermal matrix using a continuous sling suture to secure both the graft and the flap will result in better percent root coverage compared to the continuous sling suturing technique to secure the graft and the flap separately.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Thirty patients will be selected by meeting the following criteria: Inclusion Criteria: A. At least one Miller Class I or II mucogingival defect ≥ 3 mm (Miller 1985). B. The mucogingival defect must be on a non-molar tooth. C. Patients must be between ≥ 18 years of age. Exclusion Criteria: A. Patients with debilitating systemic or diseases that significantly affect the periodontium. B. Patients with a known allergy to any of the materials that will be used in the study, including systemic antibiotics (tetracycline and doxycycline). C. Patients requiring antibiotic prophylaxis. D. Root surface restorations at the site of recession. E. No detectable cemento-enamel junction. F. Patients who fail to maintain oral hygiene levels of at least 80% plaque free surfaces. G. Patients who are pregnant or lactating. H. Patients who use tobacco products (smoking or smokeless tobacco). I. Patients with alcohol abuse problems. J. Patients undergoing long-term steroid therapy. K. History of previous root coverage procedures, graft or guided tissue regeneration, on the test teeth. L. Patients who fail to complete the informed consent form.</detailed_description>
