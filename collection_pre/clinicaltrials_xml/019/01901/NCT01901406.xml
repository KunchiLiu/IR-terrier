	<brief_summary>Epiretinal membrane is common disease, affecting 5~10 % incidence over 60 years old population. It reduce visual acuity, cause metamorphopsia. In the past, vitrectomy and epiretinal membranectomy was indicated in patients with visual acuity less than 20/40, but nowadays with technical improvement and surgical instrument renovation, it seems to have been changed the surgical indication. Therefore, we plan to evaluate the changes of binocular visual acuity, aniseikonia in patients with epiretinal membrane.</brief_summary>
