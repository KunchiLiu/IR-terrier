	<brief_summary>The BRAVO study seeks to determine if dietary supplementation with omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 HUFAs) reduces the risk for serious suicidal behaviors, suicidal thinking, negative emotions, and symptoms associated with suicide risk, in a Veteran and non-Veteran population that is at risk for suicidal behaviors. This study seeks to evaluate the efficacy of omega-3 HUFAs among a representative population of US Veterans and non-Veterans already receiving appropriate medical care so that if successful, these results can be readily applied to broader populations in the US.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Better Resiliency Among Veterans With Omega-3's (BRAVO) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The BRAVO study seeks to determine if dietary supplementation with omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 HUFAs) reduces the risk for serious suicidal behaviors, suicidal thinking, negative emotions, and symptoms associated with suicide risk, in a Veteran and non-Veteran population that is at risk for suicidal behaviors. Changes in cognitive processes specific to suicide risk will be evaluated, including implicit associations, response inhibition and sustained attention. Sub-analyses will evaluate efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms, alcohol and nicotine use among Veterans and non-Veterans with concomitant significant depressive symptoms, and alcohol and nicotine use disorders. In addition, a sub-study will utilize functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to evaluate the neuropsychological and neurophysiological effects of the omega-3 HUFAs. This study seeks to evaluate the efficacy of omega-3 HUFAs among a representative population of US Veterans and non-Veterans already receiving appropriate medical care so that if successful, these results can be readily applied to broader populations in the US.</detailed_description>
