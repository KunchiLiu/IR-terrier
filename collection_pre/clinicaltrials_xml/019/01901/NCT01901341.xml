	<brief_title>The Efficacy and Safety Study of CB-5945 for the Treatment of Opioid-Induced Constipation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in participants with OIC taking opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain. Approximately 600 participants (300 participants per treatment group) with OIC will be randomized at approximately 75 study centers to receive either oral 0.25 mg CB-5945 BID or oral matching placebo BID for the 12-week double-blind treatment period, followed by a 4-week follow-up period. All randomized participants will be evaluated for clinical response for duration of their study participation. All participants will be followed for safety for 4 weeks after last dose of the study medication, regardless of when they discontinue study medication. The clinical study report for this study includes pooled results for studies 5945-OIC-12-02 (NCT01901302) 5945-OIC-12-03 (NCT01901328), and 5945-OIC-12-04 (NCT01901341).</detailed_description>
