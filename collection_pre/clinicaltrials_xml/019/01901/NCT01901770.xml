II. Evaluate the effectiveness of the multi-level HPV vaccine educational intervention in a group randomized controlled trial in 12 Ohio Appalachia counties.

Arm I: Parents and health care providers receive educational materials about HPV vaccination by mail or in-person review with project staff including a culturally tailored HPV and cervical cancer educational video and brochures, a question and answer (Q &amp; A) fact sheet, and a HPV and cervical cancer resource list. Clinics receive waiting and exam room posters and brochures, tabletop cards, reminder cards to mail to participants, an information resource list, newsletter, vaccine tracking system, and "invitation to be vaccinated" letter to mail to parents. Arm II: Parents and health care providers receive educational materials about influenza vaccination by mail or in-person review with project staff.
