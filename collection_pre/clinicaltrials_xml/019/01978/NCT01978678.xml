	<brief_summary>The application of biomarkers that are more closely associated with eosinophillic airway inflammation, such as measurements of FeNO level, cell count in induced sputum or bronchial reactivity could improve asthma control by better directing treatment. A systematic review and meta-analysis is to be conducted to assess the efficacy of tailoring asthma intervention on clinical symptoms compared with exhaled nitric oxide or induced sputum count.</brief_summary>
