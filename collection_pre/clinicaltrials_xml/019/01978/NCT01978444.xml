	<brief_summary>Radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer with D2 lymph node dissection has been widely applied in advanced gastric cancer. However,for most patients,tumor local-regional recurrence has been proven unavoidable. Recently, many clinical studies have proved that some cancer cells and cancer nodes exist in the mesogastrium which can be hardly removed by conventional radical gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy. It is suggested that Complete mesogastrium excision (CME) is imperative and should be added to D2 lymphadenectomy in order to reduce the risk of local recurrence. Thus, the comparison of short-term and long-term outcome between laparoscopic D2 lymphadenectomy plus complete mesogastrium excision and conventional laparoscopic D2 lymphadenectomy for locally advanced gastric cancer based on a well designed randomized controlled trial is needed.</brief_summary>
