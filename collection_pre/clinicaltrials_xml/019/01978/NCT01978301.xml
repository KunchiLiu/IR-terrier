	<brief_summary>This is a 3-arm randomised clinical enabling study, with no investigational product. Keloid patients who are scheduled for surgical excision of one or more keloid scars (up to nine) will be recruited to the study. The aim is to investigate how collagen synthesis within keloid scars is affected by the current approved steroid treatment for keloids, triamcinolone acetonide (TAC). The primary endpoint will be fractional collagen synthesis in keloids which have received intra-lesional injections of TAC, placebo or no treatment prior to their removal. Fractional collagen synthesis will be determined using an established isotope/mass spectrometric technique which measures levels of deuterium incorporation into collagen following administration of heavy water to the subject. In addition; keloid tissue samples will be evaluated post surgery to identify further biomarkers of extracellular matrix synthesis and degradation for application in future clinical studies. Subjects will complete a screening visit and will then be randomised to receive three intra-lesional injections of TAC or placebo, or no treatment, at an interval of 2-3 weeks. Subjects will be randomised to different treatment sequences depending on the number of keloids they have scheduled for surgery, in such a way that subjects with multiple keloids will receive different arms of study treatment in their different keloids. Planned surgery for removal of their keloid(s) will be performed at week 6-8. All subjects will receive daily heavy water (Deuterium oxide) administration (twice daily or thrice daily as directed), with the first dose being taken at the Week 2 clinic visit and the final dose being taken on the day prior to surgery. A follow-up visit will be conducted at 1-4 weeks post-surgery.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects have at least one keloid scar scheduled for removal as part of their normal course of treatment Males or females aged between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Childbearing potential with negative pregnancy test as determined by urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test at screening, AND; agrees not to become pregnant during the course of the study and for at least 1 month after completion of heavy water consumption; OR is of non childbearing potential Male subjects must agree not to father a child during the study and for at least 1 month after completion of heavy water consumption. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form Keloids to be randomised must not have received steroid treatment for at least two months prior to screening. Evidence of other skin conditions or scarring in the region of keloid scaring (including but not limited to: hypertrophic scars, eczema, psoriasis, etc.) unless the Investigator, in consultation with the GSK medical monitor, agree that the condition is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones). History of regular alcohol consumption that could preclude safe completion of the study. History of sensitivity to corticosteroids or history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. Subjects currently receiving oral corticosteroids. Subjects with a recent history of tuberculosis (TB) (within last three years). Evidence or recent history (past two weeks) of any infection (viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic). History of recurrent fungal infection. Lactating females. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer).</criteria>
