	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to identify and evaluate dissemination strategies to promote the uptake of evidence-based cancer and other chronic disease prevention among state-level public health practitioners. Dissemination strategies such as multi-day in-person training workshops and electronic information exchange modalities are hypothesized to associate with improved access and use of public health evidence and organizational supports for program and policy decision making based on evidence-based public health.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Disseminating Public Health Evidence to Support State Health Department Prevention of Cancer and Other Chronic Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evidence-based public health approaches to prevent cancer and other chronic diseases have been identified in recent decades and have the potential for high impact. Yet barriers to implement prevention approaches persist as a result of multiple factors including lack of organizational support, limited resources, competing priorities, and limited skill among the public health workforce. The purpose of this study is to learn how best to promote the adoption of evidence based public health practice related to chronic disease prevention. This cluster randomized trial aims to evaluate the dissemination of public health knowledge about evidence-based prevention of cancer and other chronic diseases and will test receptivity and usefulness of dissemination strategies directed toward state health department chronic disease practitioners to enhance capacity and organizational support for evidence-based chronic disease prevention. Twelve state health department chronic disease units were randomly selected and assigned to intervention or control. State health department staff and the university-based study team are jointly identifying, refining and selecting dissemination strategies. Intervention strategies may include multi-day in-person training workshops, electronic information exchange modalities, and remote technical assistance. Evaluation methods include pre-post surveys, structured qualitative phone interviews, and abstraction of state-level chronic disease prevention program plans and progress reports.</detailed_description>
