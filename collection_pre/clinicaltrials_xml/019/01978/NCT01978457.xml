	<brief_summary>We will develop a procedure for conditioning cue-cocaine associations in human drug users. Next, we will reactivate that learning and intervene pharmacologically to prevent the reconsolidation of cue-drug memories. We hypothesize that a combined behavioral and pharmacological approach will have significant potential for persistently inhibiting relapse.</brief_summary>
