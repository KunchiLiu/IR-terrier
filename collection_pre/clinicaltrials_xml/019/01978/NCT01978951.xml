	<brief_summary>If primary health-care officers and Villages Health Volunteers (VHVs) be trained to render proper CKD care, it is interesting if their intimate relationship and commitment to their responsible village households will result in better outcomes when compared with the conventional care model as mention above. In this project, we plan to compare the effectiveness of a conventional care program against an integrated multidisciplinary CKD care program provided by nephrologists in conjunction with well-trained paramedical personnel and VHVs on CKD progression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Integrated Care on Delaying Chronic Kidney Disease Progression in Rural Communities of Thailand</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background The unique characteristic of community-health care in Thailand is a system of primary- health care officers and Village Health Volunteers (VHVs) providing basic health care to more than 90% of Thai population. Should these allied personnel be trained on how to render proper chronic kidney disease (CKD) care, it would be interesting to study whether their role play care will result in better quality of CKD care. Design This study is a community-based cluster randomized controlled trial to be conducted in 2 districts of Kamphaeng Phet Province, located about 400 kilometers north of Bangkok. About 300 stage 3-4 CKD patients will be enrolled to each of the 2 treatment groups. Patients in both groups will be treated according to The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines. The District 1 (control group) patients will be provided a conventional CKD care. For the District 2 (intervention group) patients, an integrated CKD care program will be provided by the multidisciplinary team of district hospital in conjunction with the community CKD care networks (i.e. primary-health care officers and VHVs). The key activities of integrated CKD care program are live demonstration about treatment and optimal diets for CKD patients which will be provided during each hospital visit and quarterly home visits. Clinical and laboratory parameters of all cases will be assessed every 3 months. Duration of the study is 24 months. The primary outcome of this study is the rate of eGFR decline. The secondary outcomes are time of initiation of dialysis, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality.</detailed_description>
