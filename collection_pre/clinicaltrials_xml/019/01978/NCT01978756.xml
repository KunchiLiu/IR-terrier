	<brief_summary>In order to evaluate the late outcome in patients curatively treated for breast cancer, a special outpatient clinic will be developed. There are two main purposes of the outpatient clinic. The first purpose is evaluating the results of the radiation treatment by mapping A) late toxicity and B) tumour control and survival. The second purpose is that this outpatient clinic for late outcome will also function as a pilot for a new CAT (Computer Assisted Theragnostics, abbreviated CAT project) in which multiple late outcome variables will be recorded. In this pilot we want to investigate whether physical presence of the patient on the outpatient clinic, allowing physical examination, has any added value to the questionnaires filled in by the patient at home. The ultimate aim of this new CAT project is to use these multicentric data to develop models for predicting both oncological outcome and late side effects. Insight in the beneficial and adverse effects of a certain treatment using these predictive models, will be required choose the optimal treatment for the individual patient using a shared decision making process.</brief_summary>
