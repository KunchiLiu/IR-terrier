	<brief_summary>Purpose of this study is to compare the astigmatic power of the toric IOL obtained from the AcrySof toric calculator, TECNIS toric calculator, and iTrace toric calculator in a group of patients with preoperative with-the-rule (WTR) and against-the-rule (ATR) corneal astigmatism. The study included 100 eyes with cataract and greater than 0.75 diopter of corneal astigmatism, and the subjects were divided into WTR and ATR group. Keratometric value was measured using autokeratometry, IOLMaster partial coherence interferometry (PCI), iTrace incorporating corneal topography and ray-tracing aberrometry. Based on measured values, toric IOL power calculations were performed using AcrySof, TECNIS and iTrace toric calculators.</brief_summary>
