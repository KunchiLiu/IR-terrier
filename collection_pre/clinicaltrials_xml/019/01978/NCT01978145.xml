	<brief_summary>This is a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, two way cross-over, 12 weeks noninferiority study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of FSC 250/50 mcg capsule-based inhaler and a multi-dose inhaler administered BID in adults with COPD. The primary objective of this study is to establish the non-inferiority of the efficacy of the FSC 250/50 mcg capsule-based inhaler compared to the FSC 250/50 mcg multi-dose inhaler administered BID. The study consists of 6 phases: Pre-screening, Screening/Run-in (3 weeks), Treatment Period 1 (12 weeks), Washout (minimum 4 weeks), Treatment Period 2 (12 weeks) and Follow-up (1 week). The total duration of the study for each subject will be at least 32 weeks.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female &gt;=40 and &lt;=80 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone &gt;40 milli international unit per milliliter (mIU/mL) and oestradiol &lt;40 picogram [pg]/mL [&lt;147 picomole per liter (pmol/L)] is confirmatory); females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods (i.e., in accordance with the approved product label and the instructions of the physician for the duration of the study from Screening to followup contact) if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks should elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. After confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method; childbearing potential and is abstinent or agrees to use one of the contraception methods for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) before the start of dosing to sufficiently minimise the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until at least 2 days post the last dose of study treatment; abstinence from penilevaginal intercourse must be consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. COPD Diagnosis: An established clinical history of COPD in accordance with the following definition by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society. Severity of Disease: A measured pre and postsalbutamol/albuterol FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of &lt;0.70 at Visit 1 (Screening and Runin Visit) A measured presalbutamol/albuterol FEV1 &lt;50% of predicted normal values at Visit 1 (Screening and Runin Visit). A measured postsalbutamol/albuterol FEV1 &gt;=30% of predicted normal values at Visit 1 (Screening and Runin Visit). Predicted values will be calculated using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III reference equations. Tobacco Use: Current or prior history of at least 10 packyears of cigarette smoking (e.g., 20 cigarettes/day for 10 years). One packyear is defined as 20 manufactured cigarettes (1 pack) smoked per day for 1 year. Former smokers are defined as those who have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1 (Screening and Runin Visit). Former smokers are eligible to enter the study provided they have at least 10 packyears smoking history. Subjects making a conscious decision to stop smoking at any time during the study and who refrain from smoking for &gt;4 weeks will be discontinued from the study. Additionally, subjects who start smoking during the study and smoke for at least 7 consecutive days will be discontinued from the study. Dyspnoea: A score of &gt;=2 on the Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale (mMRC) at Visit 1 (Screening and Runin Visit) Liver Safety Criteria: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;=2 the upper limit of normal (ULN), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;=1.5 ULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5 ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin is &lt;35%) at Visit 1 (Screening and Runin Visit) Electrocardiogram (ECG) Safety Criteria: The subject must have no ECG abnormalities that would, in the opinion of investigator, compromise subject safety, or significantly affect subject's ability to complete the trial. As such the investigator will determine the clinical significance of any ECG abnormality and determine if a subject is precluded from entering the study. At Visit 1 (Screening and Runin Visit), ECG safety criteria must be: QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) or QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia formula (QTcF) &lt;450 milliseconds (msec) or QTc &lt;480 msec for subjects with a bundle branch block. Investigators will be responsible for ensuring appropriate clinical interpretation of ECGs Able to use the inhaler devices adequately after training Capable of giving informed consent, which includes compliance with the study requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. A current diagnosis of asthma Any clinically significant and uncontrolled disease, including but not limited to the following: neurological, psychiatric, renal, immunological, endocrine/metabolic (including uncontrolled diabetes, hypokalaemia or thyroid disease), cardiovascular, neuromuscular, hepatic, gastric, or haematological abnormalities, or peripheral vascular disease. Significant is defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk or would affect the efficacy analysis if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study A respiratory diagnosis other than COPD (e.g., lung cancer, bronchiectasis, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, lung fibrosis), including subjects with a diagnosis of alpha1antitrypsin deficiency. Allergic rhinitis is not exclusionary An abnormal and clinically significant chest Xray film or computed tomography scan not believed to be a result of the presence of COPD. A chest Xray must be taken if the subject has not had 1 within 6 months of Visit 1 (Screening and Run in Visit) Lung resection surgery (e.g., lung volume reduction surgery, or lobectomy) within 1 year of Visit 1 (Screening and Runin Visit) A COPD exacerbation and/or infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract requiring treatment with systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroids and/or antibiotics that has not resolved within 30 days of Visit 1 (Screening and Runin Visit) A COPD exacerbation that resulted in hospitalisation that has not resolved within 3 months of Visit 1 (Screening and Runin Visit) Use of nocturnalpositive pressure (e.g., continuous positive airway pressure or bilevel positive airway pressure) Oropharyngeal Examination: A subject will not be eligible for the Runin Period if he/she has clinical visual evidence of candidiasis at Visit 1 (Screening and Runin Visit) An abnormal and clinically significant 12lead ECG result. For the purposes of this study, an abnormal ECG result is defined as a 12lead tracing that is interpreted as demonstrating (but not limited to) any of the following: Myocardial ischemia, clinically significant conduction abnormalities (e.g., left bundle branch block, WolffParkinsonWhite syndrome), clinically significant arrhythmias (e.g., atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia). The study investigator will determine the clinical significance of any ECG abnormality and determine if a subject is precluded from entering the study. Cancer: Subjects with carcinoma that has not been in complete remission for at least 5 years. Carcinoma in situ of the cervix, squamous cell carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma of the skin would not be excluded if the subject has been considered cured within 5 years since diagnosis Investigational Medications: A subject must not have used any investigational drug within 30 days prior to Visit 1 (Screening and Runin Visit) or within 5 half lives of the prior investigational drug (whichever is longer of the two).
