	<brief_title>Retrospective Review of Anterior and Posterior Cervical, Thoracic, and Lumbar Instrumented Arthrodesis Surgeries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal arthrodesis can be performed through either anterior, posterior, or lateral approaches for a variety of traumatic, degenerative, or deformity conditions. In recent years, the development of more sophisticated segmental instrumentation techniques and hardware has allowed for incorporation of multiple spinal levels in single settings. The long-term consequences for spinal motion segments adjacent to such fusions remain unknown. The investigators propose to undertake a retrospective case study analysis evaluating both radiologic and clinical parameters indicative of adjacent-segment pathology in patients who have undergone instrumented arthrodesis procedures at Ohio State University, performed by either Dr. Francis Farhadi, James B. Elder, or Gary Rea.</detailed_description>
