	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, non-randomized, first-in-man investigational study, to assess the safety and technical feasibility, deployment and withdrawal characteristics of the NovaCross™ micro-catheter during an interventional coronary angioplasty procedure and evaluating the CTO penetration rate. Each study subject/patient will have a total of one (1) procedure performed for this study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Adult aged 2580 2. Patient understands and has signed the study informed consent form. 3. Patient has an angiographic documented Chronic Total Occlusion (i.e. &gt;3 months occlusion duration) showing distal TIMI flow 0. 4. Suitable candidate for nonemergent, coronary angioplasty 5. Documented coronary angiography preceding the PCI reveals at least one CTO lesion situated in a noninfarct related coronary artery or its side branches with the following characteristics: 1. Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 0 flow for at least 90 days; 2. Satisfactory distal vessel visualization 3. CTO should be amenable to percutaneous treatment and must be located in a coronary vessel with a reference diameter of at least 2 millimeters. 4. CTO refractory to a minimum of 10 minutes of conventional guide wire attempt. 6. Body Mass Index (BMI) &lt; 40 7. Left ventricle ejection fraction &gt; 25% For the purpose of this trial, a CTO is defined as a 100% luminal narrowing without antegrade flow or with antegrade or retrograde filling through collateral vessels. 1. Patient unable to give informed consent. 2. Current participation in another study with any investigational drug or device. 3. Patient is known or suspected not to tolerate the contrast agent. 4. Aortoostial CTO location (Ostial bifurcation origins may be considered), SVG CTO and instent CTOs. 5. Intolerance to aspirin or Clopidogrel or Prasugrel or Ticagrelor medications 6. Appearance of a fresh thrombus or intraluminal filling defects. 7. Recent major cerebrovascular event (history of stroke or TIA within 1 month) 8. Cardiac intervention within 4 weeks of the procedure 9. Renal insufficiency (serum creatinine of &gt; 2.3mg/dl) 10. Active gastrointestinal bleeding 11. Active infection or fever that may be due to infection 12. Life expectancy &lt; 2 years due to other illnesses 13. Significant anemia (hemoglobin &lt; 8.0 mg / dl) 14. Severe uncontrolled systemic hypertension (&gt; 240 mmHg within 1 month of procedure ) 15. Severe electrolyte imbalance 16. Congestive heart failure [New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III\IV] ,CSA Class IV. 17. Unstable angina requiring emergent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 18. Recent myocardial infarction (MI) (within the past two weeks) 19. Uncontrolled diabetes &gt;2 serum glucose concentrations of &gt;350 mg/dl within 7 days. 20. Participation in another investigational protocol 21. Unwillingness or inability to comply with any protocol requirements 22. Pregnant or nursing 23. Extensive prior dissection from a coronary guidewire use 24. Drug abuse or alcoholism. 25. Patients under custodial care. 26. Bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder; 27. Kawasaki's disease or other vasculitis.</criteria>
