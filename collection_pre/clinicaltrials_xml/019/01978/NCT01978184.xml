	<brief_summary>This is a randomized phase II trial that will examine the ability of the hydroxychloroquine to improve the clinical activity of a pre-operative regimen of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in subjects with potentially resectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Eligible subjects will receive 2 cycles of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (day 1, 8, 15) with or without hydrocychloroquine followed by surgical resection. Primary endpoint will be histologic response as graded by Evans criteria. Secondary endpoints will be CA19-9 response and PET response. Pre and post treatment tissue biopsies will be obtained to assess for levels of autophagy in tumor, liver and peripheral blood.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects with biopsyproven potentially resectable or borderline adenocarcinoma of the pancreas as determined by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria Karnofsky performance status of 70100% No active second malignancy except for basal cell carcinoma of the skin Patient has adequate biological parameters as demonstrated by the following blood counts at screening Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5 × 109/L; Platelet count ≥100,000/mm3 (100 × 109/L); Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥9 g/dL. Patient has the following blood chemistry levels at Baseline aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (SGOT), Alanine transaminase (SGPT) ≤2.5 × upper limit of normal range (ULN) Total bilirubin ≤ULN Serum Creatinine ≤ 1.5mg/dl OR calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 for those patients with creatinine greater than 1.5 Prothrombin time (PT)within normal limits (WNL). If patient is on warfarin for prophylactic clot presentation for indwelling catheter, Partial PT/PTT may be +/ 15 % thromboplastin time (PTT) WNL. If patient on warfarin for prophylactic clot presentation for indwelling catheter, PT/PTT may be +/ 15 % Age &gt;18 years. Patient must be able to swallow enteral medications with no requirement for a feeding tube. Patient's must not have intractable nausea or vomiting which prohibits the patient from oral medications Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Subjects deemed surgically unresectable or subjects unwilling to undergo surgical resection. Subjects who have received chemotherapy within 12 months prior to randomization. Prior use of radiotherapy or investigational agents for pancreatic cancer. Any evidence of metastasis to distant organs (liver, lung, peritoneum). Symptomatic evidence of gastric outlet obstruction Inability to adhere to study and/or followup procedures History of allergic reactions or hypersensitivity to the study drugs (hydroxychloroquine, gemcitabine, abraxane). Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. All females of childbearing potential must have a blood test or urine study within two weeks prior to randomization to rule out pregnancy. Patients with porphyria are ineligible. Patients with psoriasis are ineligible unless the disease is well controlled and they are under the care of a specialist who agrees to monitor the patient for exacerbations. Patients requiring the use of enzymeinducing antiepileptic medication that includes: phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone or oxcarbazepine are excluded. Patients with previously documented macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy are excluded. Baseline electrocardiogram (EKG) with corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt;470 msec (including subjects on medication). Subjects with ventricular pacemaker for whom QT interval is not measurable will be eligible on a casebycase basis. Patient with a history of interstitial lung disease, history of slowly progressive dyspnea, sarcoidosis, silicosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or pulmonary hypersensitivity pneumonitis Patient with known active infection with HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C Patients requiring use of warfarin for therapeutic purposes.</criteria>
