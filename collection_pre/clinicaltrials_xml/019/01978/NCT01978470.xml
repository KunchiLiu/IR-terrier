	<detailed_description>This study evaluates the safety and tolerability of the NeuroSigma eTNS system for the treatment of drug resistent partial seizures. Up to 20 subjects, ages 18 - 75, with partial epilepsy will be enrolled in an acute 4-week tolerability study at Olive View/UCLA Medical Center ....... Enrolled subjects will be asked to maintain an accurate seizure calendar, and will be seen at the initial visit, then at two and four weeks.......</detailed_description>
