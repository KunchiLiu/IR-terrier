	<brief_title>The Retention Rate Between Brand A and Brand B Punctal Plugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eyes will be randomized to either Brand A or Brand B punctal plug. The primary outcome measure is length of time punctual plugs are retained, measured in weeks. This will be measured at weekly assessments for 6 months. Secondary outcome measures include patient satisfaction, and improvement in subjective and objective dry eye scores, as well as complications related to punctual plugs including spontaneous plug loss, and intolerance. We will evaluate these measures by repeating the Canadian Dry Eye Assessment, Schirmer 1, tear meniscus height, fluorescein corneal staining (NEI scale), and lissamine green conjunctival staining (NEI scale) at month 1, month 3, and month 6 visits.</detailed_description>
