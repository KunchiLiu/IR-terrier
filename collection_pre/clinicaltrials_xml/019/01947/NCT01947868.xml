	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, non-interventional, single-arm, multicenter study in a real-world population to assess the clinically symptom improvement and quality of life (QoL) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC and positive EGFR mutation who receive EGFR-TKIs as the first-line treatment. The Primary Objective is to estimate symptom improvement rates in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC and positive EGFR mutation who receive EGFR-TKIs as the first-line treatment. A clinically meaningful improvement is defined as an increase from baseline of 2 or more points for LCS (Lung Cancer Scales) at Week 4.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Secondary Objectives are: 1. To estimate symptom improvement rates at weeks 2 and 12 2. To estimate mean change from baseline in overall QoL scores using the FACT-L instrument and LCS score at Week 2, 4 and 12. 3. To estimate the proportion of patients exhibiting an LCS change of 7 points or more at weeks 2, 4 and 12. 4. Subgroup information of symptom improvement rate, QoL and disease-related symptom scores by gender, smoking status, smoking pattern, WHO performance, number of metastatic sites, female/never smokers and patients with COPD at week 2, week 4 and week 12.</detailed_description>
