	<brief_summary>This research study is to see if smartphone applications help college women remember to take birth control better than pharmacist consultation alone. Patients will participate in this study for 6 (six) months. The study will have two groups. Patients will be randomly assigned to one group or the other. The control group will be counseled by the pharmacist on the importance of taking birth control as prescribed. The study group will get the same counseling, but will also be set up to receive reminders to take medication on a smartphone application called Dosecast.</brief_summary>
