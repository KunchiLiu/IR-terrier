	<brief_summary>Patient satisfaction is an important aspect of care and is gaining increasing importance as a measure of Healthcare quality. Tools for improving physician-patient communication are available but have not yet been tested in the Hospital setting. The purpose of this project is to determine if training in AIDET (Acknowledge, Introduce, Duration, Explanation, Thank) communication method improves physician-patient communication. Patient satisfaction data will be compared to historical controls using modified HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Survey) as the primary outcome measure. In addition, a validation of delivery of AIDET communication will be accomplished through administration of questionnaires to patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of AIDET on Physician-Patient Communication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a process of change study, which will compare HCAHPS patient satisfaction surveys before and after the Hospitalist receives AIDET physician-patient communication training. Once the Hospitalists agree to participate in the study, they will receive AIDET training by a Studor Group certified trainer. Both before and after the training intervention, Hospitalists' use of the AIDET method will be validated by having patients complete anonymous questionnaires during their hospital stay. All HCAHPS surveys will be conducted by an external patient satisfaction survey vendor, and information will be de-identified both in terms of patient and specific Hospitalist. Validation questionnaires will be distributed by administrative staff, and will also be de-identified both in terms of patient and specific Hospitalist.</detailed_description>
