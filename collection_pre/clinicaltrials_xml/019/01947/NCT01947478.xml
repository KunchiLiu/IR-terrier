	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of MDT-2113 for the interventional treatment of de novo and non-stented restenotic lesions in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and the proximal popliteal artery (PPA) as compared to treatment with standard percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age: ≥ 20 years and ≤ 85 years Documented ischemia with Rutherford classification 2, 3, or 4 Able to walk without assistive devices Target lesion is in the SFA and/or PPA above the knee Target lesion consists of a single de novo or nonstented restenotic lesion (or tandem lesions) or is a combination lesion that meets the following criteria: 1. ≥ 70% and &lt; 100% occluded with total lesion length ≥ 40 mm and ≤ 200 mm 2. 100% occluded with total lesion length ≤100 mm 3. Combination lesions must have total lesion length ≥40 mm and ≤200 mm with an occluded segment that is ≤ 100 mm in length (by visual estimates) Reference vessel diameter ≥ 4 mm and ≤7 mm (by visual estimate) Angiographic evidence of adequate distal runoff through the foot Stroke or STEMI within the 3 months prior to enrollment Either local or systemic thrombolytic therapy within the 48 hours prior to the index procedure Inability to tolerate oral anticoagulation therapy (blood thinners such as warfarin) while on concomitant dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) Known allergies or sensitivities to heparin, aspirin (ASA), other anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapies or to paclitaxel, or an allergy to contrast media that cannot be adequately pretreated prior to the index procedure Chronic renal insufficiency Subject is enrolled in another investigational device, drug, or biologic study Any major surgical procedure or intervention performed within the 30day period prior to or post index procedure Contralateral SFA/PPA disease requiring treatment in the same setting as index procedure Failure to successfully cross the target lesion Angiographic evidence of severe calcification Target lesion known in advance of enrollment to require treatment with alternative therapy such as stenting, laser, atherectomy, cryoplasty, brachytherapy, reentry devices, cutting balloons, scoring balloons; use of embolic protection devices is also prohibited</criteria>
