	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to implement and measure the efficiency of a standardized acute and brief non-pharmacological intervention (Cognitive interventions on Sleep - Anxiety - Attention - Memory) following mild TBI and observe their impact pre- and post-treatments. The ultimate goal is to have patients be re-integrated to their activities faster with lesser symptoms and have patients present lesser post-concussive symptoms. Specific objectives: 1) Measure the effect of an acute and brief non-pharmacological intervention on PCS symptoms, sleep, headaches, affect, cognition and functional outcome following mild TBI; 2)To redefine a model of outcome prediction following mild TBI.</brief_summary>
