	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, multinational, prospective and retrospective, observational study of patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC). Data on natural profile (demographical characteristics, clinical phenotype, laboratory values, electrocardiography parameters, echocardiography parameters, coronary angiography parameters, medication) and outcome are systematically collected. Our aim is to gain a better insight into the clinical profile and pathophysiology of TTC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>International Takotsubo Registry (InterTAK Registry)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Registry is an open-ended study and eligible individuals are assessed at index event and follow-up on their phenotypical characteristics. Furthermore, outcome data are collected (by clinical visits or telephone follow-up). In addition, participants are given the option to consent to the donation of biosamples for the purposes to identify TTC specific biomarkers and mutations (sub-study on behalf of the registry).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Mayo Clinic Diagnostic Criteria (Prasad et al. American Heart Journal 2008) 1. Transient hypokinesis, akinesis, or dyskinesis of the left ventricular mid segments with or without apical involvement; the regional wall motion abnormalities extend beyond a single epicardial vascular distribution; a stressful trigger is often, but not always present.* 2. Absence of obstructive coronary disease or angiographic evidence of acute plaque rupture. † 3. New electrocardiographic abnormalities (either STsegment elevation and/or Twave inversion) or modest elevation in cardiac troponin. In both of the above circumstances, the diagnosis of TTC should be made with caution, and a clear stressful precipitating trigger must be sought. * There are rare exceptions to these criteria such as those patients in whom the regional wall motion abnormality is limited to a single coronary territory. † It is possible that a patient with obstructive coronary atherosclerosis may also develop TTC.
