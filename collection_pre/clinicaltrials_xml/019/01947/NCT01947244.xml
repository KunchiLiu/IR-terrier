	<brief_title>Doula Home Visiting Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of doula enhanced evidence-based home visiting programs for young mothers in Illinois. Mothers in the intervention group receive home visits from doulas during pregnancy and in the first few weeks postpartum, and doulas provide mothers with support at the hospital during labor, delivery, and with early breastfeeding. Additionally, mothers in the intervention group receive prenatal and long-term postpartum home visitation services through an evidence-based home visiting program, such as Parents as Teachers and Healthy Families Illinois. Mothers in the comparison group receive a less intensive case management service. Four existing doula home visiting programs located in economically distressed communities in Illinois were selected for participation in the study. At each site, young pregnant women are recruited for participation in the study, provide informed consent, and complete a baseline interview in their homes during mid-pregnancy. At completion of the baseline interview, mothers are randomly assigned to either the doula home visiting intervention group or the case management comparison group. At 37 weeks of pregnancy, and at 3 weeks-, 3 months-, 13 months-, and 30 months postpartum, mothers are interviewed in their homes on topics including pregnancy, parenting, health, mental health, feeding practices, employment/education, and relationships. Additionally, at all postpartum visits, mothers are videorecorded interacting with their infants. At the 13 and 30 month followup sessions, children of the study participants are administered developmental and behavioral assessments. Based on prior studies of doula services and the goals of doula enhanced home visiting programs, a variety of outcomes are assessed at followup time points. These outcomes include prenatal medical care, prenatal bonding with infant, feelings of efficacy during labor, anesthesia use during labor, breastfeeding, positive parenting behaviors, parenting attitudes and stress, infant health, maternal health, maternal depressive symptoms, and child behavior and development.</detailed_description>
