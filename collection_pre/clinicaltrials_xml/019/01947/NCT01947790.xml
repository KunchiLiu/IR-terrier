	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular complications account for the highest mortality in type 2 diabetic patients, mainly due to ischeamia heart disease (IHD). Most of the attention in treating IHD in type 2 diabetes is understandably directed toward treating coronary artery conditions. However there are other treatable culprits in these patients. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is widespread in type 2 diabetic patients with IHD, even in the absence of hypertension. It is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. In one study, the presence of LVH was a stronger predictor of mortality than either multivessel coronary disease or impaired left ventricular function. Regression of LVH has been associated with an improved prognosis, independent of change in blood pressure (BP). Therefore, cardiovascular events and mortality in type 2 diabetes with IHD might will be reduced if we can find novel therapies to regress LVH. Pioglitazone can improve atherosclerosis. Therefore, we hypothesied that pioglitazone can regress the left ventricular mass (LVM) in type 2 diabetes with IHD.Therefore, in this study, we will treat patients with pioglitazone, and we will also metformin as control.</brief_summary>
