	<brief_summary>Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at significantly higher risk for death due to cardiovascular disease. Those with paradoxical increases in blood pressure (BP) during hemodialysis (HD), defined as intradialytic hypertension (IDH), are at even greater risk of cardiovascular mortality. This study seeks to determine the mechanisms that underlie IDH, and whether mindfulness meditation might improve BP during dialysis in these patients. The investigators will first determine if increased adrenaline levels during volume removal contributes to IDH. The investigators will then determine lack of suppression of adrenaline levels in the setting of a high BP also contributes to IDH. This will be done by manipulating blood pressure by using small amounts of vasoactive drugs, and determining if an appropriate response in adrenaline levels occurs. Lastly, the investigators will determine if an intradialytic mindfulness meditation program improves BP and adrenaline levels in ESRD patients with IDH.</brief_summary>
