	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of lapatinib ditosylate when given together with dabrafenib in treating patients with thyroid cancer that cannot be removed by surgery and has not responded to previous treatment. Dabrafenib and lapatinib ditosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dabrafenib and Lapatinib Ditosylate in Treating Patients With Refractory Thyroid Cancer That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of lapatinib (lapatinib ditosylate) that can be used in combination of dabrafenib. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. Evaluate potential mechanisms of primary resistance of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) mutant thyroid cancer to dabrafenib by performing pathway profiling of tumor biopsies before and while on therapy. III. Obtain preliminary data on the activity of the combination of lapatinib and dabrafenib in BRAF mutant thyroid cancer through imaging. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lapatinib ditosylate. Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and lapatinib ditosylate PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. NOTE: Patients also receive dabrafenib PO for 2 weeks prior to beginning treatment with lapatinib ditosylate. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative measures do not exist or are no longer effective Patients must have measurable and histologically or cytologically confirmed thyroid cancer with a BRAF V600E or V600K (c. 1799 T to A and c.1799_1800TG&gt;AA) mutation that is not considered curable by surgery; confirmation will be done at Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK); only tumors with a BRAFV600E or BRAFV600K mutation will be eligible for the clinical study; BRAF status will be assessed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory; BRAF status may also be tested with any Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved test (such as Cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test) The tumor is considered to be radioactiveiodine refractory by any of the following criteria: Total lifetime dose of radioactive iodine &gt; 600 mCi Absent or insufficient radioactive iodine uptake in either all lesions or an index lesion which has never been resected or received external beam radiation therapy as documented on a radioactive iodine scan (insufficient uptake must be confirmed by either an endocrinologist or nuclear medicine physician) Progression of disease (by imaging or thyroglobulin) within 6 months of radioactive iodine treatment Fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG)avid lesion (standard uptake variable maximum [SUVmax] &gt;= 3) on a FDGpositron emission tomography (PET) scan No recent treatment for thyroid cancer as defined as: No radioactive iodine therapy is allowed if given &lt; 3 months prior to initiation of this protocol therapy; a diagnostic study using &lt; 10 mCi of radioactive iodine (RAI) is not considered radioactive iodine therapy No external beam radiation therapy &lt; 4 weeks prior to initiation of therapy on this protocol No chemotherapy or targeted therapy (e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitor) is allowed &lt; 4 weeks prior to the initiation of therapy Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 01 or Karnofsky &gt;= 60% Life expectancy of greater than 2 months Able to swallow and retain oral medication and must not have any clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter absorption such as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1.2 x 10^9/L Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dL Platelets &gt;= 100 x 10^9/L Bilirubin =&lt;

1.5 mg/dL (if blood creatinine is &gt; 1.5 mg/dL, calculate creatinine clearance using standard Cockcroft and Gault method or using a 24 hour urine collection for creatinine; creatinine clearance must be &gt; 50 mL/min) Prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) =&lt; 1.3 x institutional ULN; subjects receiving anticoagulation treatment may be allowed to participate with PT/INR/PTT established within the therapeutic range prior to randomization; subjects will be eligible if it is determined by a hematologist that the cause is not associated with clinical bleeding (e.g., deficiency of factor XII) Left ventricular ejection fraction &gt;= institutional lower limit of normal (LLN) by echocardiogram (ECHO) Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days of the first dose of study treatment Women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control, or abstinence; hormonal contraception is not allowed) for the duration of study participation, and for at least 2 weeks after treatment with dabrafenib; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Patient must agree to allow 3 separate biopsies of any malignant lesion; biopsies do not need to be done if: Tumor is not considered accessible by either the investigator or the person performing the biopsy (it is determined the risk is too high due to location near vital organs or too great of a risk of an adverse event) Patient is on anticoagulation and it would be unsafe to temporarily hold the anticoagulation Consent of the principal investigator (PI) not to have a biopsy done A minimum of 8 subjects must participate in the biopsy part of the study; if at any time there is a total of 10 out of the 18 evaluable subjects who have not had biopsies due to either of the first 2 reasons above, all further subjects who are registered to the study must be included in the biopsy part (i.e., subjects who would have been excluded from having biopsies done due to the above reasons would be excluded from participating in the study) Prior systemic anticancer therapy (chemotherapy with delayed toxicity, extensive radiation therapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, or vaccine therapy) within the last 3 weeks; chemotherapy regimens without delayed toxicity within the last 2 weeks preceding the first dose of study treatment Use of other investigational drugs within 28 days (or five halflives, whichever is shorter;
