	<brief_title>A Dose Ranging Escalation Study of Tramadol Hydrochloride in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), sequential-cohort (time lagged), double-blind (neither the participant or the study doctor will know the name of the assigned treatment), parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 3-arm (participants will be assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups), single-center, Phase 1 study of multiple ascending doses of tramadol HCl in healthy adult volunteers. Thirty participants (15 men and 15 women) will be sequentially assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups of 10 subjects each (5 men and 5 women). Participants in each treatment group will receive a total of 9 oral doses (one every 6 hours) of tramadol HCl or placebo, in the ratio of 4:1. The study includes a screening phase and a double-blind treatment phase. The treatment phase will consist of 3 treatment periods separated by a 5-day safety review period before the next ascending dose of study drug is administered to the next group. Participants in each group will be confined to the study center for a total of 5 days, the total duration of each subject's participation will be up to 33 days, including the screening phase. The total duration of the study (completion of all 3 treatment cohorts) will be up-to-approximately 2 months.</detailed_description>
