	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of the rapid-acting insulin analogue aspart (Novorapid®) injected subcutaneously by jet-injection to that of the same insulin injected with a conventional pen in the management of hyperglycemia in subjects with diabetes</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Insulin by Jet-injection for Hyperglycemia in Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently, we showed in both healthy, non-diabetic volunteers and in patients with type 1 (T1DM) and insulin-treated type 2 diabetes (T2DM) a 40-50% faster absorption of rapid-acting insulin analogues when administered by jet injection technology rather than by conventional insulin pen. The faster insulin action of insulin administration by jet injection may be especially advantageous for correction of hyperglycemia. To investigate this, a open-label randomised controlled cross-over study will be performed in 20 adult patients (18-75 years) with T1DM or T2DM on basal-bolus insulin treatment. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of insulin aspart will be derived from the time-action profiles of insulin and glucose, respectively, in response to insulin (in a dose of 1.5 times the amount of insulin needed to reduce blood glucose to 6 mmol/l calculated by the insulin-sensitivity factor) after reaching hyperglycemia (18-23 mmol/l). All patients will be investigated twice, where on one occasion the jet-injector device will be used to inject insulin, and on the other occasion insulin will be injected with a conventional insulin pen. The order of these occasions will be randomised. Both devices will be operated by the patient after sufficient training. Ease of use will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
