	<brief_title>Effect of Music Therapy on Cognitive Recovery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Music therapy could have a significant impact on clinical outcomes for patients with epilepsy. One study found that epilepsy patients who received music therapy for six months or greater had a significant reduction in number of seizures and could potentially aid in decreasing medication dosage. The investigators would like to contribute to this sort of research, but focus on what effect music therapy has on a patient's cognitive recovery after undergoing epilepsy surgery. Although research exists regarding music therapy on memory and communication, its overall effect on this patient population is unclear. The Dell Children's Epilepsy program hopes that this research project on memory and communication will have a positive effect on their patients with epilepsy.</detailed_description>
