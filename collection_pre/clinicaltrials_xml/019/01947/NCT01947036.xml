	<brief_summary>The study aims to establish whether defects in immune cell function are shared across multiple autoimmune diseases and whether those problems match to similar genes in the cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>T and B Cell Responses in Autoimmune Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a non-randomized, multi-center clinical research study. Subjects who are healthy or have a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of type 1diabetes, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, Crohn's disease, or rheumatoid arthritis will be asked to donate a blood sample. No follow-ups are planned. Investigators will: - evaluate immune cells from subjects enrolled in this study and match the differences to types of immune cells known to cause autoimmune diseases - investigate a particular disease pathway: the IL23R signaling cascade.</detailed_description>
