	<brief_summary>This study aims to evaluate the effect of chlorhexidine digluconate (CRX) application in etched dentin on the retention of noncarious cervical lesions restorations. A randomized controlled split-mouth and blind trial will be carried out. Patients with at least two non-carious cervical lesions (NCL) will be selected. NCL will be randomly assigned according the type of teeth (incisors, canine or pre-molars) into two groups: control or experimental group (application of 2% CRX for 60 seconds after the acid etching procedure). Class V restorations will be performed out with an etch-and-rinse adhesive system (Adper Single Bond 2-3M ESPE) and a composite resin (Filtek Z350-3M ESPE) according the manufacture instructions, by previously trained operators. The restorations will be evaluated by a calibrate examiner at 1 week (baseline), and 6-month, 12-month and 24-month, using the World Dental Federation (FDI) criteria. The outcome is retention of the restoration.</brief_summary>
