	<brief_summary>A suspicious circumferential resection margin (CRM), defined as tumor cells within 1 mm of the CRM, is still controversial. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical significance of a suspicious CRM to histologically positive (R1) and negative margin (R0) resections in patients with pT3 esophageal and GE-Junction tumors.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>From our prospectively build database 923 consecutive pT3 patients operated between january 1990 and june 2013 were selected. CRM status in patients treated by surgery only (n = 747) or after neoadjuvant therapy (n = 176) was recorded prospectively after surgery. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated, and factors affecting survival were assessed by Cox regression multivariate analysis.</detailed_description>
