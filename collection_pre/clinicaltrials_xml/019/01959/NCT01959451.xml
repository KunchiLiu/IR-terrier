	<brief_summary>This study investigates whether a platelet function testing guided approach with a short-term (1 week) prasugrel treatment and a switch over to clopidogrel treatment in adequate responders to clopidogrel is non-inferior regarding the combined incidence of bleeding and thrombotic complications to a 12 month standard treatment with prasugrel in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Testing Responsiveness to Platelet Inhibition on Chronic Antiplatelet Treatment For Acute Coronary Syndromes Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients suffering of heart attack have highly activated blood platelets. During and after invasive treatment of blocked coronary vessels (percutaneous coronary intervention = PCI) a potent platelet inhibition is needed to reduce the risk of thrombotic complications which is particularly high within the first week after PCI. On the other hand, the use of potent platelet inhibitors such as prasugrel is associated with higher bleeding risk particularly when used at long-term. A combination of a potent antiplatelet drug (prasugrel) within the first week with a less potent antiplatelet drug (clopidogrel) thereafter might lead to a higher net clinical benefit - means less bleeding and thrombotic complications. This hypothesis is being investigated in the current trial.</detailed_description>
