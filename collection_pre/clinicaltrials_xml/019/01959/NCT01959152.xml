	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of preserving low-frequency acoustic hearing in adults with a moderate degree of hearing loss in the low frequencies and severe-to-profound hearing loss in the mid-to-high frequencies who are implanted with the HiRes™ 90K Advantage implant with HiFocus™ Mid-Scala electrode.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>No previous cochlear implant experience 18 years of age or older Up to a moderate sensorineural hearing loss in the lowtomid frequencies (pure tone average ≤ 65 dB HL for 125, 250, 500, and 1000 Hz) and a severetoprofound sensorineural hearing loss in the high frequencies (pure tone average ≥ 70 dB HL for 2,000, 4,000, and 8,000 Hz) in the ear to be implanted Aided monosyllabic word score of 1050% in the ear to be implanted Up to a moderate sensorineural hearing loss in the lowtomid frequencies (pure tone average ≤ 65 dB HL for 125, 250, 500, and 1000 Hz) and a severetoprofound sensorineural hearing loss in the high frequencies (pure tone average ≥ 70 dB HL for 2,000, 4,000, and 8,000 Hz) in the contralateral (nonimplanted) ear English language proficiency Willingness to participate in all scheduled procedures outlined in the protocol Previous inner ear surgery Cochlear malformation or obstruction that would preclude full insertion of electrode array Presence of additional disabilities that would prevent or interfere with participation in the required study procedures Medical or psychological conditions that contraindicate surgery or impact the ability to manage an implanted device or the studyrelated procedures Evidence of central auditory lesion or compromised auditory nerve</criteria>
