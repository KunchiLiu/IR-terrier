	<brief_title>Phase III Study of ASP2151 in Herpes Zoster Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ASP2151 (200 mg and 400 mg) in comparison with valaciclovir (VACV) 3000 mg in patients with herpes zoster. The efficacy will be evaluated for the primary endpoint defined as, "the proportion of subjects achieving cessation of new lesion formation by Day 4 of study treatment" to demonstrate the non-inferiority of ASP2151 to VACV. The safety will be evaluated based on adverse events, laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECGs.</detailed_description>
