	<brief_title>Phase III Study of ASP2151 in Herpes Simplex Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ASP2151 in patients with herpes simplex (labial/facial herpes or recurrent genital herpes). The efficacy will be evaluated for the primary endpoint defined as, "the proportion of subjects achieving lesion healing by Day 8 of study treatment" to demonstrate the superiority of ASP2151 to placebo. The safety will be evaluated based on adverse events, laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECGs.</detailed_description>
