	<brief_summary>ICU caregivers face up to a demanding job with a high level of technical skills, a stressful environment, and a heavy work load. They run a high risk of developing burnout that can impact on their welfare, performance, and patient care. Burnout favours absenteeism and staff quitting their jobs, whereas the shortage of ICU caregivers already started. No randomised controlled intervention aimed at reducing such distresses had been run until now. This study allowed finding a new method of psychological support applicable in the special environment of ICU. Our findings suggest that psychologists specifically assigned to treat ICU caregivers might be beneficial on their burnout.</brief_summary>
