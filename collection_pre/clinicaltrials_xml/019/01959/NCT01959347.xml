	<brief_summary>The overarching goal of this randomized trial is to estimate the effect of combined midurethral sling (MUS) and peri-operative behavioral/pelvic floor therapy (BPTx) compared to MUS alone on successful treatment of MUI symptoms in 472 women. Secondary objectives include estimating the effect of combined treatment compared to MUS on improving overactive bladder (OAB) and stress urinary incontinence (SUI) outcomes separately, need for additional treatment, time to failure and identifying predictors of poor outcomes in this MUI population. A supplemental study, The Human Microbiome Study of ESTEEM, will evaluate the urinary and vaginal microbiome as it relates to women with MUI, their treatment and unaffected controls.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined Treatment for Mixed Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ESTEEM is a multi-center randomized trial of 472 women with MUI who have elected to undergo surgical treatment for SUI. Participants will be randomized to a peri-operative BPTx program+MUS versus MUS alone. The purpose is to compare combined MUS+BPTx versus MUS alone (control) on improving MUI symptoms at 1 year. Patients will be assigned to one of the two treatment groups. Randomization will be stratified by clinical site and by UUI "severity," which will be defined by the number of urgency urinary IEs on diary. The primary outcome for this study is the mean change from baseline in UDI-total score at 1 year postoperative. The UDI is a validated, disease-specific, patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure. Secondary outcomes UUI/OAB outcomes will be measured using the UDI-irritative subscale that measures symptom burden, impact, and changes related to OAB. It is highly responsive to treatment-related change and is able to discriminate among levels of change in all bladder diary variables (urinary urgency, frequency and urge incontinence) and patient ratings of treatment benefit that will characterize how MUS may affect all OAB symptoms individually and as a whole. SUI symptom outcomes will be measured using the UDI-stress subscale to compare SUI outcomes between women randomized to MUS + BPTx versus MUS alone. Other UUI/OAB outcomes that will be compared between groups include 1) the change in IE frequency and type, number of urgency episodes, urgency severity with voids, number of diurnal voids, and number of nocturnal voids using a bladder diary; 2) patient satisfaction with treatment using the OAB-SAT-q; 3) bother and heal related quality of life using the OAB-q subscale For analyzing time to failure, "failure" will be defined as initiation of any additional treatment for either SUI or UUI/OAB symptoms during the follow-up period. Subjects lost to follow up will be censored at the time of their last visit. Quality of life/global impression will be assessed be compared between treatment groups using the a) Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ), Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ), c) European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), d) Adaptation Index and e) Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) and Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S). Safety/additional treatments will be characterized as a) additional re-treatments for SUI or UUI within 12 months of treatment, and type of re-treatment and b) return to OR for sling revision due to worsened OAB symptoms. To evaluate the association between PFM strength and improvements in UI symptoms, we will objectively assess PFM strength changes using the Peritron Perineometer, and instrument specifically designed for pelvic floor assessment.</detailed_description>
