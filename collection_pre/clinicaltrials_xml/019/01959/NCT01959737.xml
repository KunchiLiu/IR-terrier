	<brief_summary>The first hours after birth are a sensitive period for promotion of optimal mother-child-interaction and secure attachment. Maternal sensitivity and responsivness are high in the first hours after birth due to high oxytocin levels. Developing optimal mother-child-interaction is more difficult for preterm mothers because mother and child are separated after birth and the preterm infant is not able to show strong signs to promote maternal sensitivity. We hypothesize that promoting skin-to-skin contact of VLBW infants and their mothers for 60 minutes within the first hours after birth improves mother-child-interaction at 5 to 6 months corrected age. We also hypothesize that reactivity of HPA axis and molecular patterns of stress signaling pathways differ in preterm infant with or without SSC after birth.</brief_summary>
