	<brief_summary>Unlike healthy control skin, the skin of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) is frequently colonized by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), putting these patients at increased risk of S. aureus skin infections. In addition, research in the investigator's lab has shown that these patients have fewer protective antimicrobial Staphylococcal species such as Staphylococcal epidermidis (S. epidermidis) that are known to produce antimicrobial peptides that play a role in protecting the skin from invading pathogens. In this study, the investigator will attempt to decrease S. aureus colonization and increase colonization by protective Staph species in AD patients. First the investigator will capture the bacteria on subjects' lesional AD skin. Next the investigator will selectively grow the subject's antimicrobial Staphylococcal colonies and place them into a base moisturizer. The moisturizer plus bacteria will be applied to one of the subject's arms, and the moisturizer alone (without bacteria) to the other arm. The investigator will then do a quantitative wash of the bacteria growing on each arm one day later in order to determine whether the S. aureus abundance was affected by the application of the transplanted bacteria.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female subjects who are not pregnant or lactating 1880 years of age Diagnosis of atopic dermatitis for at least 6 months using the Hanifin and Rajka Diagnostic Criteria for atopic dermatitis Presence of lesional atopic dermatitis skin in both antecubital fossae Positive methicillinsensitive S. aureus colonization based on results of a skin culture taken from one of their ADaffected antecubital fossae during the screening visit Use of any topical AD treatments (including topical steroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors) to either arm within one week of either screening visit Use of any oral/systemic AD therapies (antihistamines, steroids) within 28 days of either screening visit Severe AD that would worsen significantly from holding a participant's usual topical/oral AD medications for the time periods required in the inclusion/exclusion criteria (one week prior to the screening visits and during the study for topical medications and 28 days prior to screening visits and during the study for oral medications) Subjects who have taken a bleach bath within a week prior to screening, or who take bleach baths during the study Patients with severe medical condition(s) that in the view of the investigator prohibits participation in the study Subjects with Netherton's syndrome or other genodermatoses that result in a defective epidermal barrier Any subject who is immunocompromised (e.g. provides researchers with a history lymphoma, HIV/AIDS, WiskottAldrich Syndrome) or has a history of malignant disease (with the exception of nonmelanomatous skin cancer). This information will be gathered verbally from the patient while taking a medical history from the patient, and will not involve further testing such as an HIV test. Subjects with a history of psychiatric disease or history of alcohol or drug abuse that would interfere with the ability to comply with the study protocol Active bacterial, viral or fungal skin infections Any noticeable breaks or cracks in the skin on either arm, including severely excoriated skin or skin with open or weeping wounds suggestive of an active infection or increased susceptibility to infection. Ongoing participation in another investigational trial Use of any oral or topical antibiotic for up to four weeks prior to screening Use of any systemic immunosuppressive therapy (e.g. cyclosporin, methotrexate, etc.) within four weeks of screening. Sensitivity to or difficulty tolerating Dove fragrancefree bar soap, Dial antibacterial liquid soap, Cetaphil lotion, or alcoholbased cleaners</criteria>
