	<brief_title>In-office Bleaching With a 2-day Interval Between Sessions: Tooth Sensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The in-office bleaching uses 35% hydrogen peroxide gel which is applied in 2 to 3 sessions usually with one week interval between sessions, without a scientific and plausible reason for this recommendation (. The aim of this study was to evaluate the tooth sensitivity (TS) risk using a shorter interval between clinical sessions. Methods: In this randomized, single-blind study, 40 young patients with color C2 or darker were selected and randomly divided in two groups. In the 7-day group, two bleaching sessions with a 35% hydrogen peroxide gel (Whiteness HP Blue Calcium - FGM) were performed with a one-week interval and in the 2-day group, the same protocol was performed but with a 2-day interval. TS was recorded on a 0-10 visual analog scale up to 48 h after bleaching. The color evaluation was performed at baseline and 30 days after bleaching with a value-oriented shade guide and a spectrophotometer. The absolute risk of TS (%) was evaluated by Fisher´s exact. The TS intensity was evaluated by two-way repeated measured ANOVA and color changes (ΔSGU and ΔE) were evaluated by Student´s t-test (alpha = 5%).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The participants should have: At least six maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth cariesfree. Without restorations on the labial surfaces. The central incisors should be C2 or darker according to a valueoriented shade guide (Vita Lumin). Preexisting anterior restorations. Pregnant/lactating. Severe internal tooth discoloration (tetracycline stains, fluorosis, pulpless teeth). Taking any drug with antiinflammatory and antioxidant action. Bruxism habits or any other pathology that could cause Tooth Sensbility (such as recession, dentine exposure).</criteria>
