	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To assess the effects of subcutaneous (SC) doses of alirocumab on the elimination (measured by Fractional Clearance Rate (FCR)) of apolipoprotein B (apoB) in low density lipoprotein (LDL) in adults with mildly elevated LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C). Secondary Objectives: To assess the effects of SC doses of alirocumab on: - Various parameters of the metabolism and turnover in plasma of different lipoproteins - Plasma lipids concentration: total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apoB, lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) - Lipoprotein particle size profile - PCSK9 (free and total) concentrations in serum To assess safety and tolerability of alirocumab. To assess emergence of anti-alirocumab antibodies. To document serum alirocumab concentrations.</brief_summary>
