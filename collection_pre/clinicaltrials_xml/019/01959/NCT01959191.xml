	<brief_summary>Objective: To evaluate the early and late prognoses of patients according to platelet reactivity after clopidogrel administration and determine whether the measurement of platelet inhibition predicted 1-year clinical outcomes after off-pump coronary bypass (OPCAB) Study design - Prospective, observational, single-center study - Subjects with OPCAB surgery who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled. - Platelet reactivity after 7-days clopidogrel treatment from the day of surgery will be measured by VerifyNow system. - Dual antiplatelet therapy including aspirin and clopidogrel will be administered for 1 year after surgery and subjects will be followed-up for 1 year about primary endpoint. - Cutoff value of P2Y12 reactivity units (PRUs) for primary endpoint will be assessed and the cohort will be divided by the PRU cutoff value (low/high platelet reactivity groups). - The primary and secondary endpoints will be compared between two groups</brief_summary>
