	<brief_title>A Study of Safety and Effectiveness of JNJ-54781532 in Patients With Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2b, multicenter, randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance that is compared with a medication to test whether the medication has a real effect in a clinical study), parallel-group (each group of participants will be treated at the same time), dose-response study (a study to evaluate response to different dosages of study medication) of oral tablets of JNJ-54781532 in adult participants with moderately to severely active UC. Approximately 220 participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 5 treatment groups at Week 0 (placebo; JNJ-54781532 25 mg once daily; JNJ-54781532 75 mg once daily; JNJ-54781532 150 mg once daily; and JNJ-54781532 75 mg twice daily) to receive their randomized dosage of study medication through Week 8 and will be assessed for clinical response at Week 8. Participants who achieve clinical response at Week 8 will continue to receive their original randomized dosage of study medication through Week 32. Participants who do not achieve clinical response at Week 8 will be treated as follows: participants originally randomized to placebo will receive JNJ-54781532 150 mg once daily through Week 16; participants originally randomized to JNJ-54781532 will continue to receive their original randomized dosage of JNJ-54781532 through Week 16. Participants who were not in clinical response at Week 8 and do not achieve a partial Mayo score response (a decrease from baseline in the partial Mayo score by â‰¥3 points) at Week 16 will be discontinued from study medication; and those who achieve a partial Mayo score response at Week 16 can continue receiving JNJ 54781532 through Week 32. Participants will be evaluated for safety (adverse events) up to Week 36 (ie, 4 weeks after the last dose of study medication). The maximum study duration for each participant will be approximately 44 weeks (including maximum screening period).</detailed_description>
