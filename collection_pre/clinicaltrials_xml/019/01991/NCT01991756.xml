	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the acute safety of deploying and implanting the Altura Endograft in the treatment of AAA in subjects who are candidates for endovascular repair. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the acute and longer-term safety and performance of the Altura Endograft through 5 years.</brief_summary>
