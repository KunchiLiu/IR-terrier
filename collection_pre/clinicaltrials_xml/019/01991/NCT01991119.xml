	<brief_title>Efficacy of Propafenone Versus Dronedarone for the Maintenance of Sinus Rhythm in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia requiring continuous therapy. Conversion to and maintenance of sinus rhythm is important. Propafenone and dronedarone has been used as treatment for maintenance of sinus rhythm after DC cardioversion. But there are no direct comparison study. The purpose of this study is to compare the ability of propafenone and dronedarone to maintain sinus rhythm after DC cardioversion.</detailed_description>
