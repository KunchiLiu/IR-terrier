	<brief_summary>The aim of this observational study is to evaluate the in hospital and 6 month outcomes of the use of Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor eptifibatide as adjunctive therapy in patients undergoing primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for ST-elevation myocardial infarction in a large tertiary referral center. It is hypothesized that Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor use during primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for ST-elevation myocardial infarction/ acute myocardial infarction is superior to unfractionated heparin alone or bivalirudin alone. Additionally, after propensity matching this superiority remains.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a retrospective, observational, data analysis of approximately 800 patients who underwent primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention at our institution since September 2000. Patients will have either received eptifibatide pre-or during Percutaneous Coronary Intervention or have received no eptifibatide. Patients who received a thrombolytic prior to Percutaneous Coronary Intervention will be excluded. This analysis is estimated to take 1-2 months.</detailed_description>
