	<brief_summary>In order to determine whether the 'incubation of craving' phenomenon also occurred in alcoholics, investigators employed an experimental approach to investigate the time course of cue-induced craving in alcoholism. Eighty male participants were randomly divided into Four groups, and they were assessed at 7, 14, 30, and 60 days of abstinence for cue-induced alcohol craving . Another group including 19 patients was repeatedly tested for the cue-induced alcohol craving at the above abstinence days. Other psychological and physiological measures were administered at the four abstinence time points.</brief_summary>
