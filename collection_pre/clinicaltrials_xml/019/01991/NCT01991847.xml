	<brief_title>Tertiary Prevention by Exercise in Colon Cancer Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Apart from a genetic predisposition lifestyle factors (low physical activity, nutrition, and obesity) increase the risk of colon cancer. Furthermore, in observational studies increased physical activity has shown to improve the prognosis in patients after the diagnosis of colon cancer. However, there are currently no prospective randomized controlled trials which prove the causal relationship between exercise and prognosis in colon cancer patients. The long-term aim of this study is to evaluate whether physical activity of ≥ 18 MET-h per week significantly improves disease free survival in colon cancer survivors (stage UICC II/III). In the first instance, structure-, process- as well as outcome-characteristics need to be investigated within a feasibility study (F-PROTECT). Essential aims are to establish collaborations with clinics and training centres, to achieve the required recruitment numbers, and to conduct the training intervention.</detailed_description>
