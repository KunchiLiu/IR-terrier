	<brief_summary>The classic laminectomy for surgical treatment of spinal stenosis has considerable morbidity .This is further magnified by the disease being more common in elderly with associated medical comorbidities and being usually global involving multiple levels.The purpose of this study is to present and to evaluate a new endoscopic technique named Irrigation Endoscopic Decompressive Laminotomy (IEDL) for lumbar spinal canal decompression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irrigation Endoscopic Decompressive Laminotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the IEDL group,2 portals 0.5cm were used one for the endoscope and the other for instruments. For every additional level one portal is added. The endoscope and instruments are directly placed over the surface of lamina without any dissection and saline under pump pressure is used to open a potential working space. Unilateral laminotomy and bilateral decompression under endoscopic vision is performed. In the microsurgical group, bilateral fenestration is performed in the usual manner</detailed_description>
