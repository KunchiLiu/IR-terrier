	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine whether exercise reduces the postprandial effects of an unhealthy meal on heart function and endothelial function. Both healthy people and type 2 diabetes subjects will during three days either carry out two different sessions of exercise training or not before ingesting an unhealthy meal high in saturated fat and fast carbohydrates. The two different exercise training modes used are high intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate intensity training (MIT) Hypothesis: Exercise training in advance of an unhealthy meal will improve endothelial- and cardiac function in healthy and type 2 diabetes individuals. HIIT will reduce the negative postprandial effects on the endothelium more than MIT.</brief_summary>
