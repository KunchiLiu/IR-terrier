	<brief_summary>In pre-clinical study, we found that serum thioredoxin reductase activity harbours huge difference after any kind of treatments, so we hypothesis that serum activity of thioredoxin reductase may be a warning markers in excised non-small lung cancers, serum activity of this enzyme may elevated before CT scan</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Warning Study of Serum Thioredoixn Reductase Activity in Excised Non-small Cell Lung Cancers (EWSOTRILC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a cooperative research project in Thoracic Surgery Department and Medical Oncology department of Affiliated Cancer Hospital of xiangya School of Medicine Central South University, and the State Key Laboratory for Natural Medicine and Biomimetic Drugs Perking University. The primary objective is to measure the thioredoxin reductase activity in blood in staged(Ⅰ~ⅢA) non-small lung cancers, to study the warning relapse ability of thioredoxin reductase in blood. The secondary objective is to compare the warning relapse activity of blood thioredoxin reductase activity with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in subjects who received surgery. Blood will be collected in subjects before surgery, 5 days after surgery, and every 3 months after surgery till 2 years, then every 6 months till 3 years, or collect blood till tumor relapse for the subjects at stage ⅠA and low risk ⅠB. Blood will be collected before surgery, 5 days after surgery, before adjuvant chemotherapy, after 2 circles of all adjuvant chemotherapy, then every 3 months after adjuvant chemotherapy till 2 years, and every 6 months till 3 years, or collect blood till tumor relapse for the subjects of high risk ⅠB~ⅢA, evaluation CT results every time collect blood samples.</detailed_description>
