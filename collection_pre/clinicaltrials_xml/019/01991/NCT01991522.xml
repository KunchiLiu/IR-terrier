	<brief_summary>Colonoscopy is a commonly used medical procedure. Medical and surgical residents learning colonoscopy typically learn the procedure experientially but simulation based teaching is increasingly being integrated into training programs. The optimal manner to teach colonoscopy on virtual-reality simulators is uncertain. We aim to test a curriculum in simulation-based colonoscopy with self-directed learning on simulators.</brief_summary>
