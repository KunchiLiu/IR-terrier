	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether breathing pattern (specifically the inspiratory time/total respiratory cycle value) has an influence over the response to the noninvasive mechanical ventilation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Response to NonInvasive Mechanical Ventilation According to the Breathing Pattern</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breathing pattern will be analyzed along the adaptation to 3 different NonInvasive-Mechanical-Ventilation modes (controlled mode, spontaneous mode and placebo mode or simulator).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Hypercapnic chronic respiratory failure due to restrictive pulmonary disease (with usual criteria for home NonInvasive Mechanical Ventilation). Transcutaneous carbon dioxide (CO2) basal pressure â‰¥ 50 mmHg when conscious. Clinically stable (within the previous month). Patients without previous NonInvasive Mechanical Ventilation treatment. Clinical exacerbation. Chronic airflow limitation Forced expiratory volume in 1 second/Forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio &lt; 70% or Sleep ApneaHypopnea Syndrome</criteria>
