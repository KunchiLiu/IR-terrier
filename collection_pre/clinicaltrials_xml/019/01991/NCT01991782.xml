	<brief_title>The Impact of Telemedicine on Orthopaedic Trauma Patients With Closed Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients who are over the age of 18 years with closed fractures treated at Vanderbilt University Medical Center by the Orthopaedic Trauma Department will be recruited into the study into one of two arms: a telemedicine arm in which the patient will have some of his or her visits conducted through video calls, and a control arm in which all of the visits for the patient will be in-person at the Vanderbilt University Orthopaedic Trauma Clinic. Comparisons between the two groups will be made through surveys administered to the patients half-way through the study and at the conclusion of the study, and comparisons will be made using standard statistical tests. The feasibility of telemedicine as a medium for follow-up visits in lieu of in-person visits will be assessed in this study.</detailed_description>
