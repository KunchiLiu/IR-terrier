	<brief_summary>Cataract surgery is among the world's most frequently performed operations. It involves removal of an opaque lens from the human eye and implantation of an artificial lens. The operation is performed under local anaesthesia using ultrasound technology, by which the lens is emulsified and removed by suction. Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery is a new innovative surgical procedure that can improve the quality of cataract surgery and provide a new best possible standard of quality. In contrast to the conventional method the capsulotomy and the fragemntation are fully automatically performed with a femtosecond laser. In addition, the lens is fragmented by the laser, which substantially facilitates its removal and reduces the operation time. Study to investigate whether the femtosecond laser cataract surgery causes any significant differences in clinical outcomes as compared to the conventional, manual continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC). Effective phako time (EPT) is defined as duration of phakoemulsifikation of the crystalline lens. EPT of conventional surgery at intraoperative visit &gt; EPT oflaser-assisted surgery at intraoperative visit</brief_summary>
