	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety of LY2928057 and how LY2928057 affects hemoglobin in hemodialysis participants. This study will involve multiple doses of LY2928057 given during a 6 week period either after a participant discontinues or reduces treatment to stimulate red blood cells. This study will last up to 26 weeks for each participant.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participants having endstage renal disease (ESRD), have received an erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) at least weekly for 2 weeks prior to screening, and have been receiving adequate maintenance hemodialysis (3 times weekly) for at least 12 weeks prior to screening (that is, an approximate Kt/V greater than 1.1 (K equals dialyzer clearance of urea, t equals dialysis duration time, V equals volume of distribution of urea, which is approximately equal to the participant's total body water) based on the clinical judgment of participant's nephrologist and investigator and who are willing to stop (Parts A and B) or reduce (Part C) their stable ESA dose from the week of randomization until completion of the 6week treatment period (unless rescue therapy is needed) Have a hemoglobin value (taken prior to dialysis if taken on a dialysis day) greater than or equal to 9.5 grams per deciLiter (g/dL) and less than or equal to 12.5 g/dL at screening Have a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 45 kilograms per square meter (kg/m^2) inclusive at screening Have a transferrin saturation (TSat) greater than or equality to 15 percent and ferritin greater than 40 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) at screening Any cause of anemia other than renal disease A history of hyporesponsiveness to ESA</criteria>
