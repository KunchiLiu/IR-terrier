	<brief_summary>Previous studies on iron absorption have focused on the effects on the addition of iron absorption enhancers like ascorbic acid and EDTA to a meal and more recently the enzymatic phytic acid removal through phytase. The investigators want here to investigate the effects of fat on iron absorption with and without the addition of exogenous phytase as a potential iron absorption enhancer in lipid nutrient supplements (LNS) products compared to micronutrient powder(MNP) products. Furthermore the investigators will evaluate the effects of Lipids- on iron absorption to induce the ileal brake by ingestion of a fat emulsion prior to a meal. Increasing the caloric density of a meal by increasing its fat content might enhance iron absorption by delaying gastric emptying, gastric acid secretion and increasing Fe stomach residence time.</brief_summary>
