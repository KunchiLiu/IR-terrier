	<brief_summary>This is a phase II, randomized, multi-center, open-label, parallel-group study to evaluate the progression-free survival during maintenance therapy. Eligible patients will be treated within a 12-week induction therapy. Those patients achieving CR/PR or SD at 12 weeks and qualifying for maintenance treatment and re-induction treatment with all potential drug components, will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to receive chemotherapy plus panitumumab or chemotherapy alone during maintenance. In case of progression, re-induction treatment will be started.</brief_summary>
