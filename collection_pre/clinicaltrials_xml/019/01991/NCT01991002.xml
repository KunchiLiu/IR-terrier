	<brief_summary>The scientific literature shows a quantitative relationship between diet combined with physical activity as a long term weight reduction modality and an important factor in weight maintenance. Primary assumption - the 14/21 diet will have an impact on BMI values, and their long-term maintenance. Secondary assumption - the 14/21 diet will have a positive impact on anthropomorphic and biochemical markers, on blood pressure, resting heart rate, RMR, and life quality.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An interventional part for a duration of 56 days and a follow-up period including monitoring of different parameters. Follow up session are set to 3, 6, 12 and 24 months from the end of the interventional period. Participants will be recruited in several rounds, each including up to 25 participants. Diet program is divided into 3 periods: 1. Low carb diet for 14 days; 2. Low carb and regular diet in alternating days for 21 days; 3. Individual carbohydrate-rich diet for 21 days. The diet consists of a free choice of food ingredients from a detailed list of foods in each category (proteins, carbohydrates, vegetables, fat etc.).
