	<brief_summary>The Nevanac product information insert says that it can cause increase in eye pressure in 5-10% of patients. There is very little published literature on the effect of topical Nepafenac eye drops on eye pressure in normal people. The purpose of our study is to report this effect with a working hypothesis that there is no increase in eye pressure following use of Nepafenac eye drops.</brief_summary>
