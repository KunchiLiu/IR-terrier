	<brief_summary>This open-label, multicenter, phase 1b study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of DNIB0600A in participants with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer (PSOC) or Non-Squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). The maximum tolerated dose of intravenously infused DNIB0600A in combination with carboplatin will be determined in escalating dose cohorts. The combination of DNIB0600A and carboplatin will then be evaluated with and without bevacizumab [Avastin] in three dose expansion cohorts.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status of 0 or 1. Histologically documented epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer that is platinum sensitive. PSOC (i.e., epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer) with documented radiographic progression or relapse within 6 to 18 months of most recent platinumbased chemotherapy. Female participants of childbearing potential must use effective contraception as defined by study protocol and cannot be pregnant or breastfeeding. NSCLCspecific Histological documentation of incurable, locally advanced, or metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC that has progressed on prior treatment Not more than 2 prior regimens in the metastatic setting, including one prior cytotoxic regimen and one prior noncytotoxic regimen (prior treatment with adjuvant therapy within 6 months of recurrence is considered a treatment regimen in the metastatic setting). For participants with a documented epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement, one additional line of noncytotoxic prior treatment will be permitted provided the therapy is a targeted agent against the EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement. For participants with lung cancer, centrally confirmed high expression of a sodiumdependent phosphate transporter (NaPi2b) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) is required (i.e., IHC 2+ or 3+). Antitumor therapy of any kind or major surgery within 4 weeks prior to Day 1. For ovarian cancer participants only, platinumbased chemotherapy within 6 months prior to Day 1. For ovarian cancer participants only, platinum treatment with more than two platinumbased chemotherapy regiments or more than four anticancer regimens, overall, for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Palliative radiation within 2 weeks prior to Day 1. Toxicity (except alopecia and anorexia) from prior therapy or neuropathy of grades &gt; 1. Evidence of any significant disease or condition that could affect compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results. Known active infection (except fungal nail infections). History of liver disease or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Other malignancy within the last 5 years, except for adequately treated or controlled carcinoma in situ of the cervix or skin cancer or primary endometrial cancer of stage &lt;/= 1B. Untreated or active central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Prior treatment with NaPi2b targeted therapy. BevacizumabSpecific Exclusion Criteria (for Participants in Second Ovarian Expansion Cohort Only): Inadequately controlled hypertension or history of hypertensive crisis or encephalopathy. History of heart problems or thrombosis within 6 months prior to study start. History of stroke within 6 months prior to study enrollment. History of significant vascular disease. History of expectoration of blood within 1 month prior to study start or blood clotting problems. Core biopsy or other minor surgical procedure within 7 days prior to study start Serious and nonhealing wound, active ulcer, or untreated bone fracture.</criteria>
