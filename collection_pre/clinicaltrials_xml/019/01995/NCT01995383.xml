	<brief_summary>This single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study will assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of RO6836191 in healthy male volunteers in two parts. Part 1 will assess the safety of oral single ascending doses of RO6836191 compared to placebo in fasted volunteers. In Part 2, participants will be given two single oral doses of RO6836191 or placebo under low or normal-salt diet conditions. A subset of these participants will subsequently receive a single IV dose of RO6836191 for further analysis.</brief_summary>
