	<brief_summary>The aim of the present project is to examine the effects of single session of French ear acupuncture on pain sensation and on postural control in individuals with chronic low back pain. We hypothesize that: I) The application of French ear acupuncture at specific points to reduce low back pain would decrease pain intensity in patients with chronic low back pain. II) The pain reduction would be greater for those individuals with low back pain who receive application of French ear acupuncture at specific points to reduce low back pain compared with patients who receive placebo treatment. III) The application of French ear acupuncture at specific points to reduce back pain will have positive effect on the performance of the postural control system.</brief_summary>
