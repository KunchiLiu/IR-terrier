	<brief_title>Developing a Discrimination Model to Diagnose ALS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Early diagnosis and lack of understanding of the pathophysiology of ALS remain a significant obstacle to making a timely intervention to help patients suffering from this fatal disease. We envision a future in which neuroimaging techniques will be a critical tool in the diagnostic work-up of ALS. Advanced neuroimaging techniques offer great potential in identifying central nervous system metabolite and cellular alterations in ALS. We propose an innovative approach to combine complementary advanced MRI techniques to interrogate brain chemistry (MRS), brain microstructure (DTI) and brain function (fcMRI) and develop a clinically relevant discriminatory disease model.</detailed_description>
