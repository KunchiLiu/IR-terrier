After an initial immunological and ear-nose-throat (ENT) assessment children with at least 3 relapses in their patient history will be vaccinated with 4-valent HPV vaccine according to the following schedule: 0., 2., 6. months. It will be followed by an immunological and 3 ENT examinations to assess response to vaccination.</brief_summary>
