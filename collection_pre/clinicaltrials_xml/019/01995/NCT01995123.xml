	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine whether behavioral activation as an adjuvant to standard smoking cessation treatment improves smoking cessation outcomes among veterans with PTSD relative to a comparably intense combination of standard smoking cessation treatment + health and smoking education. It is expected that behavioral activation will produce more successful results than health and smoking education when paired with standard smoking cessation treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Behavioral Activation for Smoking Cessation in PTSD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to examine whether behavioral activation as an adjuvant to standard smoking cessation treatment improves smoking cessation outcomes among veterans with PTSD relative to a comparably intense combination of standard smoking cessation treatment + health and smoking education. It is expected that behavioral activation will produce more successful results than health and smoking education when paired with standard smoking cessation treatment. After an initial phone screen, in-person screening, and baseline assessment, enrolled participants will be randomized to either behavioral activation therapy and standard smoking cessation treatment (BA+ST) or health and smoking education and standard smoking cessation treatment (HSE+ST). Both groups will meet with a therapist once a week for 8 weeks to receive either BA+ST or HSE+ST. Participants' mood and smoking outcomes will be monitored throughout the 8 weeks of treatment and at 2 follow-up visits and 2 follow-up phone calls.</detailed_description>
