	<brief_summary>Background: Lipid lowering response to weight loss in subjects with genetic hyperlipidemias and overweight or obesity and its effect on cholesterol metabolism has not been studied. Objective: To explore the effects of weight loss on lipid values and cholesterol metabolism, by measuring circulating non-cholesterol sterols, in overweight or obese subjects with genetic hypercholesterolemias. Design: The investigators conducted a 6-months weight loss intervention in subjects with the diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL), body mass index &gt;25 kg/m2, steady weight (±3 kg in the last 3 months) and absence of lipid lowering drugs in the previous 5 weeks. They were advised to follow a hypocaloric diet with a deficit of 600 kcal (30% fat, 15% protein, and 55% carbohydrates) per day as calculated from the person's resting energy expenditure and activity level. Anthropometric data, biochemical analysis including lipids, apolipoproteins and non-cholesterol sterols were evaluated at baseline, 3 months and 6 months.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age ≥18 years. Diagnosis of Familial Combined Hyperlipidemia* and Familial Hypercholesterolemia**. Body mass index &gt; 25 kg/m2. Steady weight (±3 kg in the last 3 months). Absence of lipid lowering drugs including sterols supplements in the previous 5 weeks. Familial Combined Hyperlipidemia diagnosis was based on the presence of primary combined hyperlipidaemia in untreated patients whose serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were above the sex and agespecific 90th percentiles for the Spanish population, serum total apolipoprotein B concentration ≥ 120 mg/dL and there was at least one firstdegree relative with hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol and/or triglycerides &gt;90th percentile) (GómezGerique JA et al; 1999). Familial Hypercholesterolemia was diagnosed in subjects with offtreatment LDL cholesterol concentrations above the age and sexspecific 95th percentile of a Spanish reference population, triglyceride below 200 mg/dL and familial vertical transmission with at least one firstdegree relative with LDL cholesterol above age and sexspecific 95th percentiles (GómezGerique JA et al; 1999). Alcohol consumption &gt;30 gr/day. Uncontrolled type2 diabetes (HbA1c &gt;8%). Any other disease that could interfere with the ability to comply with the study protocol were excluded Personal history of cardiovascular disease, very high risk as defined by the presence of ≥ 2 major risk factors, or total cholesterol ≥ 350 mg/dL since lipidlowering drug were considered highly recommended.</criteria>
