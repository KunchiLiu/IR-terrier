	<brief_summary>This multicenter, open-label study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneously administered RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate or other non-biologic DMARDs in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and an inadequate response to non-biologic DMARDs or to one anti-TNF. In Phase 1, all patients will receive RoActemra/Actemra 162 mg subcutaneously (sc) weekly for Weeks 1 to 24, with or without methotrexate or other non-biologic DMARDs. For Part 2, patients who achieve sustained clinical DAS28-ESR remission at Weeks 20 and 24 will be randomized to receive RoActemra/Actemra 162 mg sc either weekly or every 2 weeks for Weeks 24 to 48, with or without methotrexate or other non-biologic DMARDs. Patients who do not achieve sustained clinical remission but achieve low disease activity (DAS-ESR &lt;/= 3.2) will continue the initial treatment of RoActemra/Actemra 162 mg sc weekly for Weeks 24 to 48, with or without methotrexate or other non-biologic DMARDs.</brief_summary>
