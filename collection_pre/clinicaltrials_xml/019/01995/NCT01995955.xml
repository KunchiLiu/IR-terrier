	<brief_summary>The proposed study is to validate a new non-invasive imaging technique for evaluation of cardiac microciculation in coronary artery disease with a comparison with validated technique invasive, which is measure of index of myocardial resistance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Coronary Microvascular Dysfunction (EVACORY)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary microvascular dysfunction is closely associated with coronary artery disease, it is an independent risk factor and predicts future coronary events or clinically manifest disease up to 10 years later. Index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) is a validated method to Assessment of the Coronary Microcirculation but this is an invasive technique. In this study, we use a new mathematic technique from homogeneity analysis to provide precise, objective, automated quantification of perfusion heterogeneity at stress with new camera CZT SPECT. We compare the results with those of the measurement of IMR.</detailed_description>
