	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of the trial is to investigate the pharmacokinetics (the exposure of the trial drug in the body) and pharmacodynamics (the effect of the investigated drug on the body) of rFVIIa (activated coagulation factor VII) following one single injection of 270 microg/kg compared to three injections of 90 microg/kg rFVIIa in patients with haemophilia.</brief_summary>
