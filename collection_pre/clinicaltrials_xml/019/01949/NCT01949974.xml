	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical trial is to compare a non-pharmaceutical intervention (Integral Attention Program or PAI) versus standard palliative chemotherapy treatment plus PAI in patients with advanced cancer who have already received at least a first course of chemotherapy but had proven therapeutic failure. The study hypothesis is that palliative chemotherapy offers no clear benefits in relation to quality-of-life-adjusted survival compared to a comprehensive care program.</brief_summary>
