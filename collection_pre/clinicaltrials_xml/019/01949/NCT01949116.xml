	<brief_summary>People with HIV infection who are taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) may be at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which can be caused by inflammation. Methotrexate (MTX) is a medication used to treat inflammation in people with rheumatoid arthritis. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of low-dose methotrexate (LDMTX) at reducing inflammation in HIV-infected adults.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety and Effectiveness of Low-Dose Methotrexate at Reducing Inflammation in HIV-Infected Adults Taking Antiretroviral Medications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV-infected people taking ART have a higher than expected risk of premature CVD. Many factors likely contribute to this risk, including chronic inflammation. Strategies to reduce inflammation in HIV-infected people may be beneficial in reducing CVD risk, as well as other conditions, including kidney disease, bone disease, and neurologic complications. MTX is an anti-inflammatory medication used to treat people with rheumatoid arthritis. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of LDMTX at treating inflammation and on endothelial function in virologically suppressed HIV-infected adults who have CVD or are at increased risk of CVD. The total study duration will be 36 weeks. Prior to enrolling in the study, participants will have a chest X-ray. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive LDMTX or placebo for 24 weeks. Participants will continue taking their antiretroviral (ARV) medications as usual; ARVs will not be provided by the study. At study entry, participants will undergo a medical and medication history, physical examination, blood collection, and adherence assessments. From study entry through Week 1, participants will receive either 5 mg of MTX or placebo once a week. For participants who are clinically stable at the Week 1 study visit, the dose of MTX or placebo will be increased to 10 mg once a week through Week 12. For participants who are clinically stable at the Week 12 study visit, the dose of MTX or placebo will be increased to 15 mg once a week through Week 24. Participants who do not meet the criteria for dose escalation will be re-evaluated at the following study visit. In addition to LDMTX or placebo, all participants will also receive 1 mg of folic acid once a day from study entry throughout Week 24. After taking the final dose of LDMTX or placebo, all participants will continue taking folic acid for an additional 4 weeks. Additional study visits will occur at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, and 36. They will include a physical examination, blood collection, and adherence assessments; an arm ultrasound test will also be performed at Weeks 12 and 24. At Week 2, some participants will also take part in a pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment, which will involve undergoing a blood collection several times over a 6-hour period.</detailed_description>

The assay used for eligibility can be performed by any U.S. laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent. NOTE: Single determinations that are between the assay quantification limit and 200 copies/mL are allowed as long as the preceding and subsequent determinations are below the level of quantification.
