	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study in a patient population with suspected Coronary Artery Disease CAD) as defined by the presence of an abnormal nuclear (PET/SPECT) perfusion scan. In this study design, PET/SPECT will serve as the comparative standard for presence of myocardial ischemia. We intend to determine the accuracy of a novel MR technique for localization of perfusion deficits in comparison to PET/SPECT. This is not a study to specifically evaluate the efficacy or safety of the drugs but rather the diagnostic accuracy of the cardiac MRI procedure as a whole</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Artifact-Free High-Resolution Myocardial Perfusion MRI in Subjects With Abnormal Nuclear Myocardial Perfusion Studies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 2 imaging protocols will be used in this study: (1) One-day SPECT protocol, which involves the subjects undergoing stress myocardial perfusion SPECT and MRI in the same day; (2) Two-day PET/SPECT protocol, which involves MRI of subjects who have had a recent abnormal PET/SPECT study and includes an optional second-day visit. Two blinded readers will interpret MR and SPECT/PET studies by consensus to assess the presence of perfusion deficits at stress and rest.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults â‰¥ 18 years of age Clinically stable individuals with suspected or known coronary artery disease Clinically indicated stress PET/SPECT study with mild to moderate ischemia or prior myocardial infarction AND a visual scan interpretation of definitely abnormal; or, clinically indicated stress SPECT study with either prior myocardial infarction or prior abnormal SPECT/PET study and no intervening revascularization since the prior study. Hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt;100 mm Hg) Significant noncoronary cardiac disease (e.g. severe valvular abnormality, significant cardiomyopathy, etc). Persons unable to successfully pass MRI health and safety screening Persons whose renal function test does not meet CSMC standard of care MRI contrast protocol requirements (GFR &lt;45 ml/min based on serum creatinine, age, gender, and ethnicity). Subjects with contraindications to or intolerance of regadenoson. Persons with an allergy to gadoliniumbased contrast. Persons with a history of kidney or liver disease.</criteria>
