	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the absorption, the metabolic pathways (a series of metabolic reactions) and the excretion of JNJ26489112 in healthy male adult participants after administration of a single oral dose of 1000 mg of 14C-JNJ26489112.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate Absorption, Metabolism, and Excretion of 14C-JNJ26489112 in Healthy Male Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-dose, 1-arm (group), open-label study (all people know the identity of the intervention) in healthy adult male participants. On Day 1, after completing a 10-hour overnight fast, participants will receive a single oral dose of 14C-JNJ-26489112 1,000 mg as a 10-mL suspension. Participants will be recruited in 2 cohorts. The 6 participants in the first cohort were dosed in error with doses less than 1000 mg. So, an additional cohort of 4 participants will be enrolled to receive a single oral dose of 1000 mg 14C-JNJ 26489112. Total 10 participants will receive the study medication. Safety will be assessed by monitoring vital signs, physical examinations, electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory tests throughout the study. The total duration of the study for each participant will be approximately 5 weeks (including up to 3 weeks for screening and 11 to 15 days of study) or up to 1 additional week for participants who excrete 14C-JNJ26489112 more slowly.</detailed_description>
