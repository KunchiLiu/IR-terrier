	<brief_summary>The purposes of this study is to examine the feasibility of implementing an internet-based treatment for insomnia among veterans with substance use disorders, some with co-morbid serious mental illness, and to develop potential methods to support and encourage veterans while they self-administer this treatment. Our hypotheses are that the implementation of an internet-based therapy will be feasible and that a method of support can be devised, and tested in the future.</brief_summary>
