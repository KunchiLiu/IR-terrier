	<brief_title>Transcutaneous Electrical Spinal Cord Stimulation for Lower Limbs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is to determine if non-invasive electrical stimulation of the spinal cord can be used to: 1) assess spared function following a spinal cord injury; and 2) be use for rehabilitation. The investigators hypothesize that this type of stimulation can be used to locate and determine if any spinal (nerve) pathways or connections were spared following a spinal cord injury. We also hypothesize the same stimulation can help revive or recover function to muscles connected to these spared spinal (nerve) pathways in individuals who are clinically paralyzed. Our research has demonstrated that modifying the activation state of the spinal cord after an injury, or awakening the spinal cord, can benefit people with paralysis years after a spinal cord injury. This method and device have not yet been approved by the FDA for the treatment of paralysis and are under investigation. This study if successful will help provide further evidence that could be use to one day to gain FDA approval.</detailed_description>
