	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Study Evaluating CPI-0610 in Patients With Progressive Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Lymphoma</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Adults (aged ≥ 18 years) Histologically confirmed diagnosis of a nonHodgkin or Hodgkin lymphoma that has progressed in spite of prior treatment, and for which additional effective standard therapy is not available Patients may have either measurable or nonmeasurable disease, but in all cases eligible patients must have disease that can be clinically evaluated for improvement or progression Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2 Adequate hematological, renal, hepatic, and coagulation laboratory assessments Written informed consent to participate in this study before the performance of any studyrelated procedure A primary lymphoma of the central nervous system (CNS) or known lymphomatous involvement of the CNS. CNS imaging and cerebrospinal fluid sampling are not mandatory in the absence of a clinical suspicion of lymphomatous involvement of the CNS. Current infection with HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C. Patients will have serologic testing performed during screening for HIV and Hepatitis B and C. Any serologic results suggestive of an ongoing viral infection will be further investigated as necessary to clarify the patient's status. Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of CPI0610, including any unresolved nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that is CTCAE grade &gt;1. Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases, including any of the following: Acute myocardial infarction or angina pectoris ≤ 6 months prior to starting study drug Serum cardiac troponin (cTn) level ≥ 99% percentile of the upper reference limit QTcF &gt; 470 msec on the screening ECG Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 40% Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia (patients with ratecontrolled atrial fibrillation are not excluded.) Any other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled concomitant medical condition that could compromise participation in the study (e.g., clinically significant pulmonary disease, clinically significant neurological disorder, active or uncontrolled infection) Systemic anticancer treatment or radiotherapy less than 2 weeks before the first dose of CPI0610 Radioimmunotherapy (e.g., 131Itositumomab, 90Yibritumomab tiuxetan) less than 6 weeks before the first dose of CPI0610 Treatment with an investigational small molecule less than 2 weeks before the first dose of CPI0610. In addition, the first dose of CPI0610 should not occur before a period equal to or greater than 5 halflives of the small molecule investigational agent has elapsed. Treatment with a therapeutic antibody less than 4 weeks before the first dose of CPI0610. A minimum 2week period between the last treatment with a therapeutic antibody and the first dose of CPI0610 may be permitted in patients with rapidly progressive or aggressive subtypes of lymphoma following discussion with the medical monitor. Treatment with medications that are known to be strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP450 enzymes. Treatment with medications that are known to carry a risk of Torsades de Pointes. Immunosuppressive treatment that cannot be discontinued both prior to study entry and for the duration of the study. Oral prednisone at a dose of 10 mg or less per day is allowed, as are other oral corticosteroids given at glucocorticoidequivalent doses. Topical, nasal and inhaled corticosteroids are also allowed. Pregnant or lactating women Women of childbearing potential and men with reproductive potential, if they are unwilling to use adequate contraception while on study therapy and for 3 months thereafter Patients unwilling or unable to comply with this study protocol</criteria>
