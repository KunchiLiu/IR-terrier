	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of oral dose of selumetinib in combination with chemotherapies (cisplatin and gemcitabine) in Japanese patients with advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC). In addition, the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of selumetinib and chemotherapies will be investigated. Also, the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of selumetinib in combination with chemotherapies for Japanese BTC patients will be identified, if possible.</brief_summary>
