	<criteria>Male or female adults who are 65 years of age and older at the time of first study vaccination. Written informed consent obtained from the subject. Subjects who the investigator believes can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. Stable health status, as established by medical history and physical exam, and defined by absence of a health event satisfying the definition of a serious adverse event, or a change in an ongoing drug therapy due to therapeutic failure or symptoms of drug toxicity, within 1 month prior to enrollment. Access to a consistent means of telephone contact, which may be either in the home or at the workplace, land line or mobile, but NOT a pay phone or other multipleuser device. Presence or evidence of neurological or psychiatric diagnoses which, although stable, are deemed by the investigator to render the potential subject unable/unlikely to provide accurate safety reports. Presence or evidence of substance abuse. Diagnosed with cancer, or treatment for cancer within three years. Persons with a history of cancer who are diseasefree without treatment for three years or more are eligible. Persons with a history of histologicallyconfirmed basal cell carcinoma of the skin successfully treated with local excision only are excepted and are eligible, but other histologic types of skin cancer are exclusionary. Women who are diseasefree three years or more after treatment for breast cancer and receiving longterm prophylaxis are eligible. Diagnosed with excessive daytime sleepiness (unintended sleep episodes during the day present almost daily for at least one month), or narcolepsy; or history of narcolepsy in subject's parent, sibling or child. Presence of a temperature ≥ 38.0ºC (≥100.4ºF), or acute symptoms greater than "mild" severity on the scheduled date of first vaccination. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition including history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Receipt of systemic glucocorticoids within 30 days prior to the first dose of study vaccine/placebo, or any other cytotoxic, immunosuppressive or immunemodifying drugs within 6 months of first study vaccine/placebo dose. Topical, intraarticularly injected, or inhaled glucocorticoids, topical calcineurin inhibitors or imiquimod are allowed. Any significant disorder of coagulation or treatment with warfarin derivatives or heparin. Persons receiving individual doses of low molecular weight heparin outside of 24 hours prior to vaccination are eligible. Persons receiving prophylactic antiplatelet medications, e.g., lowdose aspirin, and without a clinicallyapparent bleeding tendency, are eligible. An acute evolving neurological disorder or Guillain Barré Syndrome within 42 days of receipt of prior seasonal or pandemic influenza vaccine. Administration of an inactive vaccine within 14 days or of a live attenuated vaccine within 30 days before the first dose of study vaccine/placebo. Planned administration of any vaccine other than the study vaccine/placebo before blood sampling at the Day 42 visit. Previous administration of any H7 vaccine or physicianconfirmed H7 disease. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine/placebo, or planned use during the study period. Receipt of any immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within 90 days before the first dose of study vaccine/placebo, or planned administration of any of these products during the study period. Any known or suspected allergy to any constituent of influenza vaccines or component used in the manufacturing process of the study vaccine including a history of anaphylactictype reaction to consumption of eggs; or a history of severe adverse reaction to a previous influenza vaccine. Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from participating in the study.</criteria>
