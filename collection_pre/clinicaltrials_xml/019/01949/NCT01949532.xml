	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see how the body and the cancer react to carfilzomib, including measuring the amount of the study drug in the blood at certain times following dosing. This study is being done in people with normal kidney function and those with end-stage renal disease to see if they respond differently to the study drug.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Carfilzomib in Patients With Multiple Myeloma and Renal Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specifically, the purpose of this study is to assess the influence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on area under the curve (both area under the curve, from time 0 to the last concentration measured [AUC0-last] and area under the curve, from time 0 extrapolated to infinity [AUC0-inf]) of carfilzomib 56 mg/m² at Cycle 2 Day 1 (C2D1) in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma.</detailed_description>
