	<brief_summary>The treatment of craniomandibular disorders is a challenging task. Many different treatments are yet available with occlusal splints being one of the most commonly used. A relative new diagnostic and treatment alternative is the Grindcare device. This enables the electromyographic (EMG) assessment of the activity of the temporal muscle and the contigent electrical stimulation of this muscle as bio-feedback whenever the EMG activity exceeds a certain limit. This stimulation results to a sudden break of the muscle activity. Aim of this study is to compare the therapeutic efficacy of the Grindcare device in pain reduction at female non-chronic CMD patients to that of a Michigan-type splint. Our null-hypothesis was that there is no difference between the device and the splint in the reduction of pain intensity.</brief_summary>
