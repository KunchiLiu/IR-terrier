	<brief_summary>This is an open label extension study for patients who participated in placebo-controlled dupilumab atopic dermatitis (AD) trials. The study primarily evaluates long term safety (adverse events) and immunogenicity. Efficacy parameters are based on Investigator Global Assessment (IGA), Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) and the Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The inclusion criteria include, but are not limited to, the following: 1. Participation in a prior clinical trial of dupilumab for AD and met one of the following: 1. Received study treatment and adequately completed the assessments required for both the treatment and followup periods of the parent studies (except studies listed in b) as defined in the parent protocols 2. Received study treatment in one the studies that have completed last patient last visit : R668AD0914, R668AD1026, R668AD1117, R668AD1021, R668AD1121, and R668AD1307 irrespective of duration of participation. 3. Underwent screening in R668AD1334 (Liberty AD SOLO 1) or R668AD1416 (Liberty AD SOLO 2), but could not be randomized due to randomization closure. 2. Willing and able to comply with all clinic visits and studyrelated procedures 3. Able to understand and complete studyrelated questionnaires 4. Provide signed informed consent The exclusion criteria include, but are not limited to, the following: 1. Patients who, during their participation in a previous dupilumab clinical trial, developed a serious adverse event (SAE) deemed related to dupilumab*, which in the opinion of the investigator or of the medical monitor could indicate that continued treatment with dupilumab may present an unreasonable risk for the patient. 2. Patients who, during their participation in a previous dupilumab clinical trial, developed an AE that was deemed related to dupilumab* and led to study treatment discontinuation, which in the opinion of the investigator or of the medical monitor could indicate that continued treatment with dupilumab may present an unreasonable risk for the patient. 3. Conditions in the previous dupilumab study consistent with protocoldefined criteria for permanent study drug discontinuation, if deemed related to dupilumab* or led to investigator or sponsorinitiated withdrawal of patient from the study (eg, noncompliance, inability to complete study assessments, etc.). *Note for exclusion criteria # 1, 2, and 3: In studies that are still blinded, conditions deemed related to the study treatment will be considered related to dupilumab. 4. Treatment with an investigational drug, other than dupilumab, within 8 weeks or within 5 halflives (if known), whichever is longer, before the baseline visit 5. Pregnant or breastfeeding women, or planning to become pregnant or breastfeed during the patient's participation in this study</criteria>
