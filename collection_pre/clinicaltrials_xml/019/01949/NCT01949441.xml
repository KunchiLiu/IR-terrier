	<brief_summary>House Dust Mites (HDMs) are arachnids that infest bedding, carpet, upholstered furniture and fabric. Like many other allergens, exposure to HDMA in sensitised patients is associated with poorer lung function, greater medication requirements and more asthma symptoms as well as chronic rhinosinusitis symptoms. In contrast to other allergens, there is evidence that HDMA leads to the development of asthma, in addition to exacerbating pre-existing asthma in HDM-sensitised patients. ToleroMune House Dust Mite (TM-HDM), a combination of seven Synthetic Peptide Immuno-Regulatory Epitopes, is being developed for the treatment of HDM allergy. This study to assess the tolerability of ToleroMune House Dust Mite in subjects with controlled asthma and house dust mite-induced rhinoconjunctivitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ToleroMune House Dust Mite (HDM) Tolerability Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multiple dose study to evaluate the tolerability of four intradermal doses of TM-HDM in subjects with controlled asthma and HDM-induced rhinoconjunctivitis.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Conjunctivitis</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Male or female, aged 1865 years. Asthma controlled by Step 1 or Step 2 treatment as defined by GINA in the four weeks prior to randomisation. Asthma controlled by Step 1 or Step 2 treatment as defined by GINA in the four weeks prior to randomisation. No change in asthma controller treatment (dose, frequency) in the four weeks prior to randomisation. A reliable history consistent with rhinoconjunctivitis on exposure to HDM for at least 1 year that has required symptomatic treatment on at least one occasion during the year prior to randomisation Positive skin prick test to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus with an average wheal diameter at least 5 mm larger than that produced by the negative control. ImmunoCAP® Dermatophagoides pteronyssinusspecific Immunoglobulin E ≥ 0.35 kU/L. History of lifethreatening asthma Asthma exacerbation in the 12 weeks prior to randomisation Prebronchodilator Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) &lt; 80 % of predicted, regardless of the cause. Postbronchodilator FEV1/Forced Vital Capacity ratio of &lt; 0.7. Concurrent respiratory disease that would confound study participation or affect subject safety. NonHDM allergy that may significantly interfere with the results of this study. 7. Previous immunotherapy treatment with any HDM allergen for more than 1 month within 5 years prior to screening.</criteria>
