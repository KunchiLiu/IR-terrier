	<brief_summary>This pilot research trial studies patient preferences in making treatment decisions in patients with stage I-IVA oropharyngeal cancer. Questionnaires that measure patient priorities before and after treatment may improve the ability to plan for better quality of life in patients with oropharyngeal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patient Preferences in Making Treatment Decisions in Patients With Stage I-IVA Oropharyngeal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the stability of Head and Neck Priorities Scale (HNPS) ranking between pre- and post-treatment assessments. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Use patient-interviews to refine and modify the HNPS for use in a larger scale trial. II. Pilot the Head and Neck Patient Outcomes Survey (HNPOS) as a potential tool to identify priorities most important to quality-of-life outcomes. III. Use the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Head and Neck (FACT-H&amp;N) and EurolQoL-5D to determine the validity of the HNPOS. OUTLINE: Patients participate in a 45-minute interview comprising assessment of priorities and quality of life at baseline, 1, 6, and 12 months.</detailed_description>
