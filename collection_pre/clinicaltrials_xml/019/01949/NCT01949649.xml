	<brief_summary>Five percent of young women meet criteria for anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or binge eating disorder, with another 5% meeting criteria for Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (ED-NOS), which includes subthreshold variants of these disorders. Over half of those presenting for eating disorder treatment meet criteria for ED-NOS and both threshold cases and ED-NOS are marked by chronicity, relapse, distress, functional impairment, and increased risk for future obesity, depression, suicide attempts, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, morbidity, and mortality. Anorexia and bulimia nervosa show stronger relations to suicide attempts, outpatient/inpatient treatment, and functional impairment than most other psychiatric disorders. Treatment of eating disorders is very expensive, similar to the cost for schizophrenia treatment, and is effective for only 40-60% of patients. Thus, a public health priority is to develop and disseminate effective eating disorder prevention programs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dissonance Eating Disorder Prevention: Clinician Led, Peer Led vs Web Delivered</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although dozens of eating disorder prevention programs have been evaluated, only a dissonance-based program (the Body Project) has significantly reduced future onset of threshold and subthreshold eating disorders through long-term follow-up. An effectiveness trial found that the Body Project produced significant reductions in risk factors, eating disorder symptoms, and functional impairment relative to educational brochure controls, with some effects persisting through 3-yr follow-up when high school clinicians recruited students and delivered the program. These trials confirm the efficacy and effectiveness of the Body Project, but revealed a key dissemination barrier; it can be difficult to identify and recruit clinicians at high schools and colleges with the time and expertise to competently deliver the program. One solution to this key dissemination barrier is to train students in established peer leader programs at colleges to recruit high-risk students and deliver the program. Another solution to this dissemination barrier would be to deliver the Body Project via the Internet. Because peer-led groups and Internet delivery of the Body Project could markedly extend the reach and sustainability of this evidence-based program, we propose to conduct the first large multi-site effectiveness trial that directly compares the effects and cost effectiveness of peer-led Body Project groups, the eBody Project intervention, and clinician-led Body Project groups to an educational video control condition.</detailed_description>
