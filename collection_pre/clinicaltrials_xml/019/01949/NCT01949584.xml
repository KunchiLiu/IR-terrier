	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, interventional, study in which patients with a history of habitual snoring to determine whether low pressure nasal continuous airway pressure can reduce the frequency, duration or intensity of snoring in subjects with mild to moderate snoring who do not have Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Nasal Airflow Pressure Optimization to Resolve Excessive Snoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this a prospective, interventional, study, each patient will be studied four times. Subjects without OSA will undergo an initial observational control study to establish the presence of snoring (session 1); a single CPAP titration night to determine the minimally effective CPAP level (session 2) to alleviate snoring; a subsequent full night of CPAP treatment at this CPAP level (CPAP not to exceed 6 cm H2O) using the Cloud9™ low-pressure CPAP device (session 3); and a final control night of study conducted off CPAP to assess whether the patient's snoring remained stable over time (session 4). In this study, each subject shall serve as his/her own control.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject is &gt; 18 years of age. Subject is willing and able to provide written Informed Consent using a Patient Information and Consent form that has been reviewed and approved by a governing Institutional Review Board (IRB). Subject has a history of habitual snoring (almost every night or every night for at least 30% of the night) as determined by the subject or a bedpartner. Subject has been prescreened and demonstrates no excess daytime sleepiness on an Epworth Questionnaire (an assessment of daytime sleepiness; high number = greater sleepiness) score of less than 11, no history of witnessed apneas or nocturnal gasping/choking episodes and a body mass index (BMI) ≤ 35. Inclusion Criteria for treatment trials (Nights 2 and 3): Subject meets Inclusion Criteria for the Baseline Trial (criteria ad above) The subject has snoring intensity that exceeds 40 dBA during ≥30% of the respiratory efforts during sleep time on the baseline study night. Subject has been diagnosed with COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), such as asthma, emphysema or chronic bronchitis. Subject has a history of heart disease, heart attack or stroke. Subject has uncontrolled or poorly controlled hypertension. Subject has been diagnosed with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), defined as an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 5/hr in the presence of excessive sleepiness (an Epworth score ≥ 11) or AHI ≥15/hr when there is no evidence of excessive daytime sleepiness (an Epworth score ≤ 10). Subject is currently participating in another clinical study for which followup is ongoing.</criteria>
