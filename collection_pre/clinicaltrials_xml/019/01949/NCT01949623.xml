	<brief_title>Biomarkers In Retinitis Pigmentosa (BIRP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People with Retinitis Pigmentosa have loss of night vision followed by loss of central vision due to damage and death of photoreceptors. One of the mechanisms causing damage is high levels of oxygen in the eye. This damage produces specific biomarkers which can be measured. In this study, these biomarkers will be assessed in people with Retinitis Pigmentosa and compared to controls.</detailed_description>
