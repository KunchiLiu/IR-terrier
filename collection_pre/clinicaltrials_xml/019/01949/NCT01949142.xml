	<brief_title>OTO-201 for the Treatment of Middle Ear Effusion in Pediatric Subjects Requiring Tympanostomy Tube Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, multicenter, Phase 3 study of OTO-201 administered intraoperatively in pediatric subjects with bilateral middle ear effusion requiring TT (tympanostomy tube) placement. One dose level (6 mg) of OTO-201 was evaluated relative to sham (empty syringe). Study subjects are required to have a clinical diagnosis of bilateral middle ear effusion requiring TT placement. On the day of surgery, prior to surgery, eligible subjects were examined via otoscope to confirm bilateral middle ear effusion. Subjects with bilateral middle ear effusion were randomized to either 6 mg OTO-201 or sham. Subjects without bilateral effusion on the day of surgery were not randomized and were considered screen failures. Approximately 264 subjects are planned to be randomized to OTO-201 or sham using a 2:1 allocation ratio. Randomization to OTO-201 or sham was stratified by age: 6 months to 2 years or &gt;2 years. Subjects are to visit the study site for safety assessments and otoscopic examination on Days 4, 8, 15, and 29. The assessment of otorrhea by the blinded assessor for the primary efficacy endpoint occurred on Days 4, 8, and 15.</detailed_description>
