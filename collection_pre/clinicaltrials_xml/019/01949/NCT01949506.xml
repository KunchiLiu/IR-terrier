	<brief_summary>This is a prospective study to document the local control rates with SBRT specifically for pulmonary metastases from soft tissue sarcoma. This study will prospectively document acute and late toxicity, quality of life (QoL), tumor control, and survival.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>(SBRT) and (ART) for Pulmonary Metastases From Soft Tissue Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of no more than 20 people are expected to participate in this study at the Medical College of Wisconsin/Froedtert Hospital. Patients will be followed for three years. The usual treatment for sarcomas that spread to the lungs is to remove the cancer with surgery. Patients who cannot have surgery or prefer not to have surgery, can receive radiation therapy. Standard radiation therapy involves several weeks of daily treatment sessions, although it is not as effective as surgery and may seriously damage normal surrounding lung tissue. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a radiation treatment that gives fewer but higher doses of radiation than standard radiation. SBRT is used to treat metastases to the lung from many types of cancer but has not been used very often with patients who have metastatic disease to their lungs from sarcomas. The purpose of this study is to test the possibility of SBRT to the lung for metastatic disease to the lung. This information will be used to find out if there are factors that can predict recovery or outcome of patients with metastatic disease to the lung from sarcoma. SBRT will consist of 1 to 3 treatments per week for a total of 3 to 5 treatments to each tumor until therapy is complete. After SBRT is completed, follow-up exams will occur 4-6 weeks from the completion of radiation treatment, every 3 months in year 1 and every 6 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>
