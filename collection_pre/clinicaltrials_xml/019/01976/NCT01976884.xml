	<brief_summary>Immunosuppression is the leading cause of death in septic patients. Neutrophils are classical components of innate immunology, but recent studies showed that neutrophils might display antigen presenting function and inhibit lymphocyte proliferation by expressing programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1). Whether neutrophils express PD-L1 and its role in immunosuppression during sepsis remain unclear.</brief_summary>
