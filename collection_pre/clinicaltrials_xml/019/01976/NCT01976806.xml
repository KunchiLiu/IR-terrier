	<brief_title>The Effects of DHA on Periodontitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 2 gm/day) plus low dose aspirin (ASA 81 mg/day)compared to ASA alone on periodontitis over three months. Our hypothesis is that DHA plus ASA will improve periodontitis as measured by objective periodontal exam, including decreased pocket depth (mm), gingival index (0-3), plaque index (0-3) and bleeding on probing (yes/no) compared to ASA alone. 2. Assess the effect of DHA and ASA exposure on markers of local inflammation, including gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) CRP, IL-1 beta and IL-6 three months after exposure to DHA plus ASA compared to ASA alone. 3. Evaluate potential mechanisms through changes in the periodontal microbial flora which may occur as a result of exposure to DHA and ASA compared to ASA alone. Our hypothesis is that there will be a substantial post therapy change in the microbial flora of dental plaques, favoring bacteria associated with a lower systemic inflammatory state. 4. Assess the effect of DHA and ASA exposure on markers of systemic inflammation, including serum C-Reactive Protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and vascular adhesion molecule (VCAM) compared to ASA. Our hypothesis is that there will be a decrease in serum CRP, IL-6 and VCAM three months after exposure to DHA plus ASA compared to ASA alone. 5. Assess the effect of DHA and ASA exposure on markers of systemic bone turnover, including urine N-terminal telopeptide (NTx) compared to ASA. Our hypothesis is that there will be a decrease in urine NTx three months after exposure to DHA plus ASA compared to ASA alone.</detailed_description>
