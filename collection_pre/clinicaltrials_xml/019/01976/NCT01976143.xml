	<brief_title>A Study in Cancer Patients to Evaluate the Effect of a Single Dose of NKTR-102 (Etirinotecan Pegol) on the QTc Interval and to Assess Pharmacokinetics and Safety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label study that will assess the effect of NKTR- 102 on cardiac ventricular repolarization, as characterized by QTcF (QT interval with Fridericia correction) interval values, in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors following administration of a single dose of NKTR-102.</detailed_description>
