	<brief_summary>This study intends to use music and movement (MWM) to reduce anxiety and behavioral symptoms of people with early dementia (PWD) and their family carers in the community. It also aims to examine whether MWM can enhance the sleep quality of PWD and their family caregivers and promote their well-being. This is a mixed methods study with the quantitative paradigm being the main research approached used. The quantitative arm will be a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The qualitative arm will adopt a naturalistic approach through interviewing for data collection. Recruited subjects from the community centres of non-government organizations (NGOs) will be randomly allocated to the intervention and control group. The outcome measures of the PWD will include Rating Anxiety in Dementia (RAID), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PQSI), Quality of Life - Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Revised Life Event Scale (RLES), Modified Brathel Index (MBI) and Non-pharmacological Therapy Experience Scale (NPTES), whereas the outcome measures of the family caregivers will be Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7), Zarit Burden Scale (ZBD), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Reverse Life event Scale (RLES), and World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF). To address the research questions, data will be collected at baseline (T0), immediately post-intervention at 8-weeks (T1), and 8 post-intervention (T2). The qualitative arm of this study will contribute to the understanding of issues and effects of MWM as an intervention. Its finding will complement the results obtained from the RCT.</brief_summary>
