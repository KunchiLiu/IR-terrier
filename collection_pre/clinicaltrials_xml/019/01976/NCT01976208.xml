	<brief_summary>The primary purpose is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of recombinant humanized anti-IgE monoclonal antibody injection in patients with allergic asthma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Omalizumab to Treat Allergic Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Omalizumab will be given as add-on treatment to budesonide inhaled powder in patients with moderate or severe allergic asthma(IgE&gt;=60IU/ml), who demonstrate inadequate asthma symptom control. Response to Omalizumab will be assessed by the overall improvement in control of asthma. Omalizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to human immunoglobulin E(IgE). The antibody has a molecular weight of approximately 150 kilodaltons and produced by Chinese Hamster Ovary cell. Omalizumab inhibits the binding of IgE to the high-affinity IgE receptor on the surface of mast cells and basophils. Reduction in surface-bound IgE on cells limits the degree of release of mediators of the allergic response.</detailed_description>
