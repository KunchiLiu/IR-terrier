	<brief_summary>Tracheal intubation with videolaryngoscopes have been widely studied, and is now often used in the management of difficult airways. Videolaryngoscopes with angulated blades can improve laryngeal view, however this does not always match with a higher intubation succes. To adress this matter the aim of this study is gathering experience with intubation with mcgrath videolaryngoscope and a blade-shape intubation foreceps (Boedeker intubation foreceps, Karl Storz, Germany). The hypothesis is that intubation with this combination is easy and can be a good alternative when using the McGrath videolaryngoscope in patients with predictors of difficult airway.</brief_summary>
