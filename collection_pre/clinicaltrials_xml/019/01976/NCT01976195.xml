	<brief_summary>The project was undertaking by Qilu Hospital of Shandong University in China. In order to report the efficacy and safety of thalidomide combining with high-dose dexamethasone for the treatment of adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), compared to conventional high-dose dexamethasone mono-therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-dose Dexamethasone Combining Thalidomide Versus Dexamethasone Mono-therapy for Management of Newly-diagnosed ITP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators are undertaking a multicenter, randomized controlled trial of 200 primary ITP adult patients from 5 medical centers in China. One part of the participants are randomly selected to receive Thalidomide (given at a dose of 150mg for 15 consecutive days), combining with dexamethasone (given intravenously at a dose of 40 mg per day for 4 days, the others are selected to receive high-dose of dexamethasone treatment (given intravenously at a dose of 40 mg daily for 4 days). Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment. Adverse events are also recorded throughout the study. In order to report the efficacy and safety of thalidomide combining with high-dose dexamethasone therapy compared to high-dose dexamethasone for the treatment of adults with ITP.</detailed_description>
