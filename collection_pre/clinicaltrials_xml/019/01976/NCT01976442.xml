	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a novel standard of care protocol, washing red cell and platelet transfusions for younger patients with acute leukemia, has yielded improved clinical outcomes at Strong Memorial Hospital (Rochester, New York, USA). This standard of care was implemented based upon an earlier randomized trial (BMC Blood Disorders. 2004 Dec 10;4(1):6) The comparator will be historical controls from the medical literature. Key outcomes will be treatment related mortality (deaths at 30, 60 and 100 days) and three year survival.</detailed_description>
