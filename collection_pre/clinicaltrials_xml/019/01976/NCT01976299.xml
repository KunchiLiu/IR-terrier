	<brief_summary>The Osprey Medical AVERT System is indicated to reduce contrast media (CM) exposure to the kidneys during percutaneous coronary procedures thereby reducing the risk of contrast induced nephropathy (CIN).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AVERTâ„¢ Clinical Trial for Contrast Media Volume Reduction and Incidence of CIN</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this trial is to assess the AVERT System device, which is designed to limit the volume of CM (Contrast Media) utilized, during a staged therapeutic coronary PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) or a coronary diagnostic procedure that is anticipated to become a PCI (i.e. ad hoc PCI) for the reduction of CIN (Contrast Induced Nephropathy).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>The subject is a candidate for a therapeutic percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure. The subject has documented chronic kidney disease (CKD) Subject is in acute renal failure Assessment of ventricular function that cannot be accomplished without the use of the CM. Subject has acute STEMI within 72 hours prior to planned PCI procedure, or is currently having an acute STEMI. Subject is unable to undergo periprocedural hydration.</criteria>
