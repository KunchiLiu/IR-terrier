	<brief_summary>Leg compression is considered the basic treatment for superficial vein thrombosis (SVT). However, its use is more or less based on subjective experience while scientific evidence for its efficacy is lacking. There is one uncontrolled trial reporting improvement of clinical symptoms when patients with SVT were treated with fixed compression bandages. This study evaluates the efficacy of compression stockings (23-32 mmHg) in the treatment SVT of the legs. The investigators hypothesis is that compression treatment is superior to no compression in alleviating disease related clinical symptoms.</brief_summary>
