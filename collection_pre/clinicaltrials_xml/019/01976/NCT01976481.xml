	<brief_summary>Our study aims to clarify the impact of the use of a standard sunbed according to new EU guideline EN 60335-2-27 and possibly discount the positive effects of tanning beds. We plan to investigate the serum elevation of 25(OH)D under sunbed use, respecting the new recommendations for the exposure plan for different skin types according to EN 60335-2-27. The use of a sunbed will be compared to a control group not using a sunbed in the observation period. - Trial with medical device</brief_summary>
