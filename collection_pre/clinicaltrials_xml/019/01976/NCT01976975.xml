	<brief_title>Brain Mechanisms of Human Motivation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study involves five sessions. In the first session, participants will play a computer task. In the second session, participants will go through a clinical interview and will have an EEG recording while playing another computer task. In the third session, participants will undergo an fMRI scan while playing another computer task. All tasks assess reward learning. At three and six months after the final session, participants will come back for a follow-up interview session during which a clinician will assess symptom severity. There will be no intervention in this study.</detailed_description>
