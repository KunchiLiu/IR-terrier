	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Testing Salicylic Acid Peels Versus Glycolic Acid Peels for the Treatment of Melasma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants in this study will be patients who are clinically diagnosed with at least a 2 x 2 cm patch of melasma on each side of their face (forehead or cheek). One half of the subject's face will be randomly selected to receive 4 treatments of 30% glycolic acid peels and the other half of the face will receive 4 treatments of 30% salicylic acid peels/ weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12.
