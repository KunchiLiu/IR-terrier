	<brief_summary>Mesquida, J et al showed there was a significant linear correlation between pulse pressure variations under tidal volume 6 ml/kg and 8 ml/kg in patients after the resuscitation phase of severe sepsis and septic shock. No study revealed the actual relationship between various PPV under different VT. So we hypothesized that there were relationship between various PPV in different tidal volume settings. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between various PPV.</brief_summary>
