	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well ipilimumab with or without bevacizumab works in treating patients with stage III-IV melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and bevacizumab, block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ipilimumab With or Without Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Stage III-IV Melanoma That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare overall survival for patients receiving ipilimumab plus bevacizumab versus ipilimumab alone. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the progression free survival, response rate and safety in patients receiving ipilimumab plus bevacizumab versus ipilimumab alone. II. To evaluate the utility of immune related response criteria (irRC) in patients receiving ipilimumab plus bevacizumab versus ipilimumab alone. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM A: INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Beginning course 8, patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM B: INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive bevacizumab as in Induction Therapy. Beginning course 8, patients also receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status: 0 or 1 Untreated or previously received one treatment regimen for measurable unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] 2010) (for BRAF wildtype, and regardless of human leukocyte antigen [HLA] type); untreated or previously received up to two treatment regimens for measurable unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma (AJCC 2010) (for BRAF mutant, and regardless of HLA type; If 2 prior regimens, one should be a BRAF inhibitor); this does not include any therapies given in the adjuvant setting Prior treatment (chemotherapy [chemo], radiation, hormone, and immune therapies) must be completed &gt; 4 weeks prior to randomization (&gt; 6 weeks prior to randomization for nitrosoureas, mitomycin C, and checkpoint inhibitors) Patients who received prior therapy with anthracyclines should have a baseline multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) or echocardiogram (echo) with a normal ejection fraction within 28 days prior to randomization Patients must have recovered from any acute toxicity associated with prior therapy by the start of study treatment Women must not be pregnant or breastfeeding; all females of childbearing potential must have a blood test or urine study within 2 weeks prior to randomization to rule out pregnancy; a female of childbearing potential is any woman, regardless of sexual orientation or whether they have undergone tubal ligation, who meets the following criteria: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months) All sites of disease must be evaluated within 4 weeks prior to randomization; patients must have measurable disease White blood cell (WBC) &gt;= 2000/uL Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1000/uL Platelets &gt;= 75 x 10^3/uL Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dL Creatinine =&lt; 2.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =&lt; 2.5 x ULN for patients without liver metastases and =&lt; 5 x ULN for patients with liver metastases Serum bilirubin =&lt; 2.0 x ULN (except patients with Gilbert's syndrome, who must have a total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dL) Patients BRAF mutation status must be known No concomitant therapy with any of the following: interleukin (IL) 2, interferon, or other nonstudy immunotherapy regimens; cytotoxic chemotherapy; immunosuppressive agents; other investigational therapies; or chronic use of systemic corticosteroids; must have been discontinued &gt;= 4 weeks prior to randomization No infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) No active infection with hepatitis B No active or chronic infection with hepatitis C Patients are ineligible if they have any history of central nervous system (CNS) metastases Patients are ineligible if they have a history of any other malignancy from which the patient has been diseasefree for less than 2 years, with the exception of adequately treated and cured basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix Patients are ineligible if they have a history of autoimmune disease, as follows: patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease are excluded from this study as are patients with a history of symptomatic disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune vasculitis [e.g., Wegener's granulomatosis]); patients with motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin (e.g., GuillainBarre syndrome and myasthenia gravis) are excluded; patients with a history of autoimmune thyroiditis are eligible if their current thyroid disorder is treated and stable with replacement or other medical therapy Patients are ineligible if they have an active infection Patients are ineligible if they have a history of prior treatment with ipilimumab, bevacizumab, or prior tumor CD137 agonist or CTLA4 inhibitor or agonist; patients may be treatment naive or have had one prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease as outlined in the eligibility criteria; patients may have received PD1 or PDL1 as per current protocol eligibility, although they are not currently commercially approved in the front line setting Patients are ineligible if they have a history of any underlying medical or psychiatric conditions or require any medications or treatment that in the opinion of the principal investigator may interfere with compliance, make the administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the interpretation of adverse events, such as a condition associated with frequent diarrhea Patients are ineligible if they have any concurrent medical condition requiring the use of systemic steroids;
