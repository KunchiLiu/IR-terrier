	<brief_summary>Betaine is important in cellular metabolic pathways. Few epidemiologic studies link betaine levels to diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Small human studies suggest benefit for non-alcoholic liver disease. In this study we will determine if administration of betaine improves metabolic measures, liver fat and/or endothelial function in humans with glucose intolerance who are overweight.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study is a single site, prospective, randomized (1:1), double masked, placebo controlled trial to assess metabolic effects of betaine compared to placebo on glycemia and insulin sensitivity, liver fat and endothelial function.</detailed_description>
