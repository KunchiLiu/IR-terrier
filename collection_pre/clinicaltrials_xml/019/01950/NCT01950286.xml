	<brief_summary>Hyper-CVAD (a chemotherapy regimen) has shown promising results in adult T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL). Patients with T-ALL diagnosis were reported to the Swedish Adult Acute Leukemia Registry between October 2002 and September 2006. Hyper-CVAD was recommended to all patients without severe comorbidity. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation was recommended for patients with high-risk disease. The aim of this population-based study was to assess the efficacy of Hyper-CVAD treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hyper-CVAD Treatment of Adult T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Sweden.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with T-ALL diagnosis were prospectively reported to the Swedish Adult Acute Leukemia Registry between October 2002 and September 2006. Missing data were complemented retrospectively. Hyper-CVAD (fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone alternating with cycles of high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine) was recommended to all patients without severe comorbidity. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) was recommended for patients with high-risk disease: white blood cell count &gt;100Ã—109/L, complete remission (CR) achievement after more than two courses, high minimal residual disease level, and relapsed disease (after CR2 achievement). In patients without high-risk factors maintenance therapy was given with per oral mercaptopurine and methotrexate for two years including reinduction courses: daunorubicine, vincristine and prednisolone every second month (1st year) and cytarabine, thioguanine and prednisolone every third month (2nd year).</detailed_description>
