	<brief_summary>This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of nanosilver fluoride for controlling the growth of S. mutans present in dental plaque of children.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nanosilver Fluoride to Prevent Dental Biofilms Growth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The product will be apllied on cervical vestibular surfaces of incisors and canines healthy, with a total of 8 teeth, 4 upper and 4 below. Children will be instructed not to ingest any liquid or food within two hours after application. After a period of 7 days will be carried biofilm colect of cervical dental surfaces of incisors and / or canines upper and lower, with the aid of sterile spatulas. This material will be packaged in pre-weighed microfuge tubes containing 1.5 ml of buffered saline solution (0.9% sodium chloride), and transported under refrigeration immediately to the laboratory where analysis will be performed and the S. mutans colonies will be counted. The biofilm collect and posterior laboratorial analysis will be performed weekly.</detailed_description>
