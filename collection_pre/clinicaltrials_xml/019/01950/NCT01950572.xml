	<brief_summary>Background: - Malignant mesothelioma is a malignancy arising from the mesothelial cells of the pleura, peritoneum, pericardium, or tunica vaginalis. - Mesothelioma accounts for 0.10% of deaths annually in the United States. Malignant pleural mesothelioma is the most common of these, comprising of 80% of the cases with an annual incidence of about 2,500 in the United States. - The median survival from diagnosis of pleural mesothelioma is approximately 12 months. The majority of patients present with stage III or IV disease with 85-90% of patients considered unresectable at diagnosis. - Peritoneal mesothelioma has a better prognosis than pleural mesothelioma; nevertheless, patients undergoing therapy for peritoneal mesothelioma have few well-studied treatment options due in large part to the rarity of the disease. Objectives: -To allow sample acquisition for use in the study of mesothelioma. Eligibility: - All patients age greater than or equal to 2 years with malignant mesothelioma - Must be able and willing to provide informed consent if 18 or over; parent or guardian must be able and willing to provide consent for patients under the age of 18 Design: - Up to 1000 subjects will be enrolled. - Patients will be followed to determine the course of disease and to record any treatment received for mesothelioma. - Patients will undergo sampling of blood, urine, tumor and abnormal body fluids for tissue banking. - Studies which may be performed on banked material include genetic and genomic studies, establishment of cell cultures and immunologic studies.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background: - Malignant mesothelioma is a malignancy arising from the mesothelial cells of the pleura, peritoneum, pericardium, or tunica vaginalis. - Mesothelioma accounts for 0.10% of deaths annually in the United States.

Objective: -To allow sample acquisition for use in the study of mesothelioma and other mesothelin expressing cancers. Eligibility: - All patients age greater than or equal to 2 years with malignant mesothelioma - All patients age greater than or equal to 2 18 years with thymic carcinoma, pancreatic or biliary adenocarcinoma or lung, gastric or ovarian cancers - Must be able and willing to provide informed consent if 18 or over; parent or guardian must be able and willing to provide consent for patients under the age of 18 Design: - Up to 1000 subjects will be enrolled. - Patients will be followed to determine the course of disease and to record any treatment received for the eligible mesothelin expressing cancer. - Patients will undergo sampling of blood, urine, tumor and abnormal body fluids for tissue banking. - Studies which may be performed on banked material include genetic and genomic studies, establishment of cell cultures and immunologic studies.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: All patients greater than or equal to 2 years of age with malignant mesothelioma. All patients greater than or equal to18 years of age with thymic carcinoma, pancreatic or biliary adenocarcinoma or lung, gastric or ovarian cancers. Confirmed pathological diagnosis is required Ability and willingness of subject to provide informed consent to participation. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Active symptomatic major organ disorder that would increase the risk of biopsy, including but not limited to ischemic heart disease, recent myocardial infarction, active congestive heart failure, pulmonary dysfunction. Pregnant or breast feeding women will be eligible for this protocol, but will not undergo tumor biopsy. Active concomitant medical or psychological illnesses that may increase the risk to the subject or in adult patients, inability to obtain informed consent, at the discretion of the principal investigator.</criteria>
