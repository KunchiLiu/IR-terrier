	<brief_summary>Recently, it was reported that the incomplete resection rate of neoplastic large polyps after conventional polypectomy was markedly high in clinical practice. The incomplete resection rate of neoplastic large polyps after endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is not known. The aim of this study is to compare the incomplete resection rate of neoplastic large polyps after EMR or conventional polypectomy. The EMR technique is preferable to conventional polypectomy for the complete resection of the large polyps (&gt;15 mm in diameter)</brief_summary>
