	<brief_summary>- NAFLD (Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) has become the most common cause of liver disease in Western countries (hepatic manifestation of insulin resistance); - NAFLD represents a cardiovascular risk factor; - Lifestyle modification(weight loss)is the effective medical treatment recommended for NASH (Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis); - Ezetimibe could represent a novel safe treatment for NAFLD (Patel 2006. Here the investigators propose a Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial to evaluate the addictive effect of ezetimibe on liver histology, biochemical and sonographic parameters in a small (n.40) number of NASH patients randomized for 12 months in two arms: lifestyle vs lifestyle+ezetimibe.</brief_summary>
