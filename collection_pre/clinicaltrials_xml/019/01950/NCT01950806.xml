	<brief_summary>The objective of this randomized, controlled feeding study is to investigate the potential health benefits of a pecan-containing diet. The investigators hypothesize the chronic consumption of pecans will improve an array of biomarkers related to cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes risk, including indices of oxidative stress, antioxidant activity, inflammation, endothelial function, and insulin resistance when compared with a control diet that is absent nuts.</brief_summary>
