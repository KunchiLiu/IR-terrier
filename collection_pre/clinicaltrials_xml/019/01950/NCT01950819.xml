	<criteria>1. Written informed consent obtained. 2. Subject randomized within 24 hr of completion of transplant surgery. 3. Recipient of a kidney with a cold ischemia time &lt; 30 hours. 4. Recipient of a primary (or secondary, if first graft is not lost due to immunological reasons) renal transplant from a deceased heart beating, living unrelated, living related nonhuman leukocyte antigen identical or an expanded criteria donor. 1. Subject unable to tolerate oral medication at time of randomization. 2. Use of other investigational drugs at the time of enrollment. 3. History of hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or to drugs of similar chemical classes. 4. Multiorgan transplant recipient. 5. Recipient of ABO incompatible allograft or complementdependent lymphocytotoxic (CDC) crossmatch positive transplant. 6. Subject at high immunological risk for rejection as determined by local practice for assessment of antidonor reactivity e.g. high PRA, presence of preexisting DSA. 7. Subject who is HIVpositive. 8. HBsAg and/or a HCV positive subject with evidence of elevated LFTs (ALT/AST levels ≥ 2.5 times ULN). Viral serology results obtained within 6 months prior to randomization are acceptable. 9. Recipient of a kidney from a donor who tests positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or antihepatitis C virus (HCV). 10. Subject with a BMI greater than 35. 11. Subject with severe systemic infections, current or within the two weeks prior to randomization. 12. Subject requiring systemic anticoagulation. 13. History of malignancy of any organ system. 14. Subject with severe restrictive or obstructive pulmonary disorders. 15. Subject with severe hypercholesterolemia or hypertriglyceridemia that cannot be controlled. 16. Subject with white blood cell (WBC) count ≤ 2,000 /mm3 or with platelet count ≤ 50,000 /mm3. 17. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women. 18. Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using effective methods of contraception during dosing of study treatment.</criteria>
