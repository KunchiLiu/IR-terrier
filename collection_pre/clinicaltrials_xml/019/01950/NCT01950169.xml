	<brief_summary>The study hypothesis is that nutritional supplementation together with bisphosphonates have a better preserving effect on bone mineral density (BMD) after hip fracture than bisphosphonates alone and that nutritional supplementation given postoperatively for 6 months preserve lean body mass in elderly hip fracture patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Bisphosphonates and Nutritional Supplementation After a Hip Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inclusion criteria: Men and women, ≥ 60 years of age with a recent fracture of the femoral neck or trochanter, admitted to any of the four University hospitals in Stockholm, Sweden. Patients are randomized into three groups by sealed enveloped technique in blocks by 12, thus assuring that each center had an equal distribution of patients in the three treatment groups. Patients randomly assigned and followed for 12 months. Each center with a doctor in charge and a trial nurse. The trial nurse in collaboration with the doctor are responsible of the randomization procedure and that blood samples are taken in the morning of the first weekday after inclusion at the ward and further that the dual-energy X-ray (DXA) and all estimates are done during hospital stay.The pharmacological treatment and nutritional supplementation starts as soon as the patients are circulatory stable, able to take food by mouth and are able to sit in an upright position one hour after taking the tablets.Patients are examined at baseline with a follow up at 6 and 12 months.</detailed_description>
