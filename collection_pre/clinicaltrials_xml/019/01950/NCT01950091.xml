	<brief_summary>Nonspecific low back pain (NLBP) is the diagnosis for 85% of low back pain sufferers with no underlying medical cause (e.g., herniated disc, spinal stenosis) that requires physician care. Treatment, however, is impractical for many physicians to implement during office visits, and there are relatively few providers for NLBP treatment that follow national pain control guidelines. This study evaluated the efficacy of an on-line intervention using desktop computers or mobile technology to help users self treat NLBP occurrences and to engage in activities to decrease future occurences.</brief_summary>
