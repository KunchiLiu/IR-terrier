	<brief_summary>Sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) has become a well-established treatment for patients with fecal incontinence since 1995. The mechanism of action of SNS is still not fully understood but recent studies have shown changes in both colonic motility and rectal sensibility. The investigators have previously shown IBS patients to benefit from sacral nerves stimulation. With the present study, the investigators aim to evaluate if sacral nerve stimulation alters the gastro-colic response in IBS patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multimodal Stimulation Before and After Sacral Nerve Stimulation for Irritable Bowel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty four patients with IBS-D or IBS-M according to the ROME III criteria, will be enrolled in the study. Having meet inclusion criteria, the patients will be examined with Multimodal Stimulation at baseline and at six weeks in the sacral nerve stimulation test period. During the Multimodal Stimulation the patients will have impedance planimetry conducted before and after a standardised meal to evaluate on their gastro-colic response without and during sacral nerve stimulation. The patients enrolled in the study will in the same time period participate in another study evaluating subsensory sacral nerve stimulation. A study registered at clinical trials. Here patients are randomised to receive either OFF-subsensory or subsensory-OFF stimulation in a 2+2-week period followed by 2 weeks of suprasensory stimulation. Hereby rendering a stimulation test period of a total of 6 weeks (a permanent electrode is used).</detailed_description>
