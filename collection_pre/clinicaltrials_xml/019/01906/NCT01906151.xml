	<criteria>Diagnosis of Primary Angle Closure (PAC) or Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma (PACG) with indication for Laser Peripheral Iridotomy (LPI). PAC is defined by the presence of a partial or complete iridotrabecular contact(ITC) in more than 2 quadrants with either raised intraocular pressure (IOP) (ie. more than 21 mmHg) and/or PAS; however, with normal optic disc and visual field. PACG is defined by the presence of ITC with either raised IOP and/or PAS, and evidence of glaucomatous optic disc and visual field No IOPlowering drug treatment or a 4week washout period prior to Study Day 0 Aged â‰¥18 years, of either sex Not more than 6 diopters spherical equivalent on the study eye Have given written informed consent, prior to any investigational procedures History of acute angle closure glaucoma on the study eye Secondary angle closure glaucoma on the study eye History of ocular surgery within the last 3 months on the study eye History of ocular laser treatment, including previous LPI on the study eye Corneal or conjunctival abnormality precluding contact lens adaptation on the study eye Severe dry eye syndrome on the study eye Patients with allergy to corneal anesthetic Patients with contraindications for silicone contact lens wear Patients not able to understand the character and individual consequences of the investigation</criteria>
