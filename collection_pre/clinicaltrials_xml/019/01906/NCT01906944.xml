	<brief_summary>Patients with chronic abdominal pain- with a component of abdominal wall pain- are often treated with trigger point injections. This study will help to determine if a block within the transversus abdominis plane (TAP) will provide superior analgesic benefit to a trigger point injection as therapy for these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound Guided Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) vs. Trigger Point Injection (TPI) for Abdominal Wall Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Only patients referred to the Pain Clinic for abdominal trigger point injections for abdominal wall pain will be considered for study recruitment. Following informed consent, patients will complete a baseline questionnaire in the Pain Clinic which gathers basic demographic data, pain scores and functional scores. Patients will be randomized to receive either a TAP injection or a TPI. Because the TAP injection involves a larger area to be anesthetized, a larger volume of medication will be used. Thirty minutes after the injection, a sensory exam will be performed on the patient to determine the level of block. At one week, one month, three months and six months after the injection, a staff member will telephone the patient to assess how they are doing. The call will take approximately 10 minutes and will consist of relaying a pain score as well as daily functioning and sleep questions. Subjects are responsible for all clinical costs associated with the injection. There is no remuneration offered for study participation.</detailed_description>
