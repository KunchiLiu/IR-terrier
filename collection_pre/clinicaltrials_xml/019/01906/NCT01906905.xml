	<brief_summary>Trancranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-drug and non-invasive treatment for depression and has been investigated for the treatment of psychiatric illness for over 15 years. There is now established evidence indicating TMS is an effective treatment for depression. However, the effectiveness of TMS varies between people, thus requiring further research to investigate its optimal application. Investigators want to compare the effectiveness of different forms of TMS, given with differing stimulation settings to the right or left side of the brain that has been associated with depression. This could potentially help clinicians in the future to improve the prescription of TMS as a treatment for depression.</brief_summary>
