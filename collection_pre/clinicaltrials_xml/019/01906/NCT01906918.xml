	<brief_summary>Strategies for myocardial protection during open heart surgeries are desired. Several experimental studies have shown beneficial effects of remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC). The underlying mechanisms are not totally understood. This study intends to evaluate molecular mechanisms involved with RIPC on myocardium of patients underwent open heart surgeries.</brief_summary>
