	<brief_summary>This observation plan outlines the approach to build a diabetes registry to collect data on daily routine of treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IMSÂ® DIAREG Diabetes Registry - Prospective Diabetes Registry of Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The choice to establish such a (general and specific) disease patient registry was based on several scientific and practical considerations as described in the AHRQ user's guide: registries for evaluating patient outcomes (www.ahrq.gov, 2007). From a public health point of view, such a register should monitor naturalistic (i.e., unbiased) use of diabetes treatment in the community and should primarily guide and assist medical professionals to make optimal choices in combating diabetes. The primary focus of this registry is therefore to monitor the medical and lifestyle treatment of diabetes in order to enable comparison of different treatment options and to provide data for future discussions of optimal treatment.</detailed_description>
