	<criteria>Diagnosis of primary angle closure (PAC) or primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) with indication for laser peripheral iridotomy (PAC is defined by the presence of a partial or complete iridotrabecular contact in more than 2 quadrants with either raised intraocular pressure [i.e. more than 21 mmHg] and/or primary adhesion to the trabecular meshwork (peripheral anterior synechiae [PAS]; however, with normal optic disc and visual field. PACG is defined by the presence of iridotrabecular contact with either raised intraocular pressure and/or PAS, and evidence of glaucomatous optic disc and visual field) No intraocular pressurelowering drug treatment or a 4week washout period prior to study day 0 and throughout the study Aged â‰¥18 years, of either sex Not more than 6 diopters spherical equivalent on the study eye Not more than 2 diopters cylinder equivalent on the study eye Have given written informed consent, prior to any investigational procedure History of acute angle closure glaucoma Secondary angle closure glaucoma History of ocular surgery within the last 3 months History of ocular laser treatment, including previous laser peripheral iridotomy Corneal or conjunctival abnormality precluding contact lens adaptation Severe dry eye syndrome Patients with allergy to corneal anesthetic Patients with contraindications for silicone contact lens wear Patients not able to understand the character and individual consequences of the investigation Participation in other clinical research within the last 4 weeks</criteria>
