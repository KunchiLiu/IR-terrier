	<brief_summary>The true incidence of thrombosis in the portal venous system after blunt splenic trauma is unknown and has not been elucidated in the medical literature. The investigators hypothesize that this entity is more common than previously suspected. Consequences of missing this diagnosis can be clinically significant, i.e. mesenteric ischemia in the acute phase and portal venous hypertension in the chronic phase. Early diagnosis would facilitate treatment with anticoagulation and avoidance of these complications. In a prospective fashion, doppler ultrasound will be performed prior to discharge and at 3 months in all patients 18 and up who have sustained blunt splenic trauma. Clinical follow-up will be extended to 6 months in patients initially diagnosed with thrombosis in the portal venous system on their 3 month ultrasound. The investigators will attempt to identify risk factors in this trauma population that would facilitate an early screening protocol.</brief_summary>
