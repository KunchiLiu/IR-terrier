	<brief_title>Gene Expression Profiling of Malignant Tumor Predict the Therapeutic Response of DC-CIK Immunotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. The patients with malignant tumor are treated with dendritic cells (DC) plus cytokine induced killer cells (CIK) . 2. Venous blood (4 ml) is collected from each subject and placed into tubes containing Ethylene Diamine Tetraacetic Acid(EDTA) before and after each treatment. Lymphocytes are sorted by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting(FACS) and stored at -80°C until processing. 3. The T-Cell Receptor/B-Cell Receptor gene expression is detected by micro-array。 4. Estimate Immunotherapy response, time to disease progression, survival rates and clinical benefit response on patients. Response is assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor Group (RECIST) guidelines. Degree of response is used to divide the cancers into two groups: sensitive and non-sensitive to immunotherapy. 5. Compare the gene expression profile between different immunotherapy response groups to explore the mechanism that predict the DC-CIK immunotherapy response.</detailed_description>
