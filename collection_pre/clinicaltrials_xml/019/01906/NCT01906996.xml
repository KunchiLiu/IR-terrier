	<brief_summary>There are two types of interventions to treat a post-traumatic wrist osteoarthritis: the proximal row carpectomy and the four corner fusion. They are used to reduce pain and to maintain the mobility. In previous studies are shown that the proximal row carpectomy shows a better mobility of the wrist postoperatively, whereas the four corner fusion has lower progression of radiocarpale osteoarthritis. The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical, radiological and subjective outcomes after the treatment with a proximal row carpectomy or a four corner fusion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proximal Row Carpectomy Versus Four Corner Fusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two surgical procedures are used to treat a post-traumatic wrist osteoarthritis, especially after scaphoid non-union advanced collapse (SNAC) and scapholunate advanced collapse (SLAC): the proximal row carpectomy and the four corner fusion. Both surgical procedures are rescue operations. They are used to reduce pain and to maintain the mobility, compared to a complete stiffening of the wrist. In previous studies are shown that the proximal row carpectomy shows a better mobility of the wrist postoperatively and a lower complication rate, whereas the four corner fusion has a lower progression of radiocarpale osteoarthritis and a better grip strength. The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical, radiological and subjective outcomes after the treatment with a proximal row carpectomy or a four corner fusion.</detailed_description>
