	<brief_summary>Currently, seven medications are approved for the treatment of hepatitis B: two formulations of interferon and five nucleons(t)ide analogues. The current treatment strategy of chronic hepatitis B is now standard: initial selection of entecavir, tenofovir, or peginterferon alfa-2a (peg-IFNα-2a). Interferon is administered for a finite duration while nucleotide analogues are usually administered for many years. But among hepatitis B e antigen （HBeAg） positive patients with high serum hepatitis B virus DNA levels, the rates of virological response are poor. And antiviral drug resistance is a major limiting factor to the success of nucleotide analogue treatment. Therefore, combination therapy using peginterferon with an oral agent with a high genetic barrier to resistance might be superior to standard current monotherapy. However, the addition of lamivudine to peg-IFNα-2a therapy led to a greater decrease in serum HBV DNA levels during treatment but did not increase the rate of HBeAg sero¬conversion. Entecavir is a nucleoside analogue superior to lamivudine and adefovir in achieving higher virological response, histological improvement and normalisation of ALT. Moreover, Entecavir has a high genetic barrier with a very low incidence of drug resistance. This study is aimed to investigate the efficacy of combination or sequential therapy using peg-IFNα-2a and entecavir in HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B(CHB) patients.</brief_summary>
