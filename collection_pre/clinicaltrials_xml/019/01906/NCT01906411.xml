	<brief_summary>The broad aim of the study is to obtain a better understanding of alterations in mesolimbic reward pathways in adiposity based on the hypothesis of a hypofunctioning reward system in obesity. This will be achieved by integrating a functional neuroimaging (fMRI) with behavioral reward tasks and the modulation of the dopamine level by dopamine depletion.</brief_summary>
