	<brief_title>Restoring Arm and Hand Function With Non-invasive Spinal Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is to determine if non-invasive electrical stimulation of the spinal cord can help improve hand and arm function in people with paralysis who suffered a cervical spinal cord injury. The investigators hypothesize that this stimulation can revive spared function in the spinal cord of individuals who are clinically paralyzed, but who have some remaining connections between the brain and spinal cord. Our research has demonstrated that modifying the activation state of the spinal cord or awakening the spinal cord can benefit people with paralysis years after a spinal cord injury. This method and device have not yet been approved by the FDA for the treatment of paralysis and are under investigation. This study if successful will help provide further evidence that could be use to gain FDA approval.</detailed_description>
