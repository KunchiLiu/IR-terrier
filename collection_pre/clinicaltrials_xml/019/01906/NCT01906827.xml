	<brief_title>P-wave Duration and Dispersion in Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a pregnancy-specific liver disease. The most frequent laboratory abnormality is elevation of serum bile acid levels in ICP. Bile acids increases both maternal and fetal circulation in ICP. The bile acids has been demonstrated to cause arrhythmia and abnormal calcium dynamics in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Raised maternal bile acid levels have been associated with fetal distress and arrhytmia in fetus. P-wave dispersion (PWD) is defined as the difference between the maximum and the minimum P-wave durations measured on a 12-lead surface electrocardiogram (ECG). Increased P-wave duration and PWD have been reported in various clinical settings, including atrial flutter, coronary artery disease, hypertension, rheumatic mitral stenosis, mitral annular calcification, obstructive sleep apnea, and obesity. So the investigators think that bile acids may alter maternal cardiomyocyte function as fetus. The investigators hypothesized that PWD and p wave duration may affect in pregnancy with ICP. The aim of this study is to investigate maternal P-wave duration and dispersion changes in pregnant women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy .</detailed_description>
