	<brief_summary>This study should also raise questions about the interest and feasibility of establishing a permanent registry of CVA in the Antilles and Guyana. Indeed in coming decades, the expected doubling of the population of persons aged over 60 years and the foreseeable changes in lifestyle will increase the burden of this disease, in particular since the region is marked by a high prevalence of arterial hypertension and diabetes and a high level of precarity. In addition, this study will provide epidemiological information on CVA, its risk factors and management, which are non-existent for the department of French Guyana where the health environment is manifestly insufficient. These data should make it possible to better evaluate the resources available and the healthcare needs in Guyana.</brief_summary>
