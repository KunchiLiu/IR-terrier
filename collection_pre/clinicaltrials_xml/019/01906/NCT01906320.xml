	<brief_summary>The aim is to test the hypothesis that high-resistance training for 8 weeks, following the recommendations for healthy adolescents, is capable of eliciting increases in muscle strength, agility, skeletal muscle mass, and functional capacity without losing weight, body mass index (BMI) or fat mass in anorexia nervosa restricting type patients. Further, we hypothesize that the effects produced by the high-resistance training program will be maintained 4 weeks following the completion of the training program.</brief_summary>
