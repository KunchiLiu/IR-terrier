	<brief_summary>X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (X-CGD) is a rare inherited immune defect, which is caused by the inability of phagocytic cells to produce reactive oxygen species due to a defect in the gp91phox subunit of the NADPH oxidase complex. X-CGD patients suffer from recurrent and life-threatening infections and severe hyperinflammatory complications. The only curative treatment for X-CGD is allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, but this procedure implies severe risks and many patients lack an appropriate donor. Therefore alternative curative approaches are urgently needed. In this study, patients will be treated with gene-corrected autologous CD34+ cells, using a SIN gammaretroviral vector for ex-vivo gene-therapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Verified diagnosis of the Xlinked form of chronic granulomatous disease, with loss of gp91phox expression (Western Blot). Evidence of less than 5% of normal oxidase production in circulating neutrophil granulocytes as measured by dihydrorhodamine (DHR) and nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) assay History of severe chronic infections with lifethreatening course or severe steroid sensitive or steroid insensitive granulomatous disease, with necessity of inpatient treatment, without sustained improvement even under maximum conservative treatment measures No Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) identical (10/10 match) sibling or unrelated donor, or contraindications for allogenic stem cell transplantation in presence of a suitable donor. The lack of an HLAidentical (10/10 match) sibling or unrelated donor has to be confirmed by an unsuccessful search in national and international donor registers for at leat 3 months Normal organfunction: glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 60ml/min., Bilirubin ≤ 1.5fold upper referencelevel, normal parameters for liver enzymes and clotting (TPZ 75100%, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 3038sec, Fibrinogen 200400mg/dl), Leukocytes &gt; 3 x 10^9/l, Granulocytes &gt; 1.5 x 10^9/l, Thrombocytes &gt;100 x 10^9/l Contraception from start of GCSF application until 1 year after retransfusion of the genecorrected cells No interferongamma injection within two weeks prior to hematopoietic stem cell mobilization KarnofskyIndex &gt; 70% Signed informed consent Patients with noncontrolled acute infections Severe cardiac or pulmonary malfunctions: ejection fraction &lt; 60%, valvular heart disease &gt; II°, arrhythmia requiring therapy, forced expiratory volume at one second/vital capacity (FEV1/VC) &lt; 75% , diffusion capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) &lt;60% Bilirubin &gt; 1.5fold upper referencelevel HIV, Hepatitis B or C infection Contraindications for GCSF administration, as autoimmune vasculitis. Contraindications for stem cell apheresis, as low hemoglobin &lt; 8g/dl, cardiovascular instability or severe coagulopathy Pregnancy or breastfeeding Drug or alcoholabuse Lack of search for an unrelated donor Patients with a HLA 9/10 mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD) will be excluded, if a thorough riskbenefit analysis favors allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)</criteria>
