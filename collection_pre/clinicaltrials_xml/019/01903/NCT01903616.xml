	<brief_summary>This study investigates the longitudinal course of developmental patterns in movement and participation in life activities (MPLA) of young children with cerebral palsy (CP) in Taiwan. Additionally, the predictors in the initial stage in determining the final developmental patterns in movement and participation in life activities MPLA of these children will be identified.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Longitudinal Study of Movement and Participation in Life Activities of Young Children With Cerebral Palsy in Taiwan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most researches investigated the longitudinal study of functions in adolescent or adult with CP, however, few researches investigate these functions in children with CP. Knowledge of these developmental patterns in movement and participation in life activities MPLA may be helpful in understanding, anticipating, and managing the problems of these children. We hypothesize that the course of developmental patterns in MPLA of young children with CP evolves with their age. This study investigates the longitudinal course of developmental patterns in MPLA of young children with CP in Taiwan. This study includes a validity and reliability study and a prospective longitudinal study of young children with CP over one-year. This study will be executed in 4 years and a validity and reliability study in the first year.</detailed_description>
