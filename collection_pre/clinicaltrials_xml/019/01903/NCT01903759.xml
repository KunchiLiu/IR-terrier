	<brief_summary>The principal aim of this study is to help obstetricians to diagnose chorioamniotic infection early, in cases of premature rupture of the fetal membranes before 34 WA, by proposing earlier and more specific markers of infection than FBC and CRP. The aim is to reduce vital and functional risk of acute chorioamnionitis for the mother, the fetus or the newborn,. If the kinetics profile of one or several markers correlates strongly with the diagnosis of chorioamnionitis, it could be used in clinical practice, possibly in the context of another clinical study. The results of the study presented here are destined to be published in obstetrics journals.</brief_summary>
