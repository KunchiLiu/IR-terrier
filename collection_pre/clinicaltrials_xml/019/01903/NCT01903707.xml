	<detailed_description>The aim of this project is to undertake a randomized placebo controlled trial of cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) that focuses on working memory training in a sample of community based patients with schizophrenia. Pre and Post neuropsychological assessment and Magnetic Resonance Imagery (MRI) will be used to determine the effects of CR training on 1. Neuropsychological performance 2. Brain Structure using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) 3. Brain function using functional MRI (fMRI) 4. Social and occupational functioning The cognitive remediation intervention is a computerised programme whose training level is dynamically varied to suit participants individual ability level. Motivation to learn and generalization to real world function are a particular focus of the intervention and are supported with ongoing therapist interaction in addition to personal training.</detailed_description>
