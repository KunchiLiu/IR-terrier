	<brief_summary>Athletes using asthma medications called β2-agonists win a disproportionately high number of medals at Olympic Games. Due to a large variety in the genes that affect how individuals respond to β2-agonists, the investigators will look at variations in the genetic response to these medications by dividing athletes into high-responders and low-responders. The investigators will then compare athletic performance after the inhalation of β2-agonists to placebo. Furthermore, the investigators will analyze the effect of β2-agonists on breathing mechanics. Due to differences in their anatomy females may decrease the energy needed for breathing during high-intensity exercise to a greater extent compared to male athletes after the inhalation of β2-agonists.</brief_summary>
