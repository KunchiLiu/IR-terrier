	<brief_summary>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of setrobuvir in patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C. Treatment-naïve patients will be randomized to receive either setrobuvir (800 mg orally b.i.d loading dose followed by 200 mg orally .b.i.d.) or placebo in combination with standard of care Pegasys (peginterferon alfa-2a) and Copegus (ribavirin). Treatment duration will be 28 weeks or 48 weeks depending on response. Treatment-experienced patients categorized as relapsers, partial responders and viral breakthrough patients to previous pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy will be randomized to receive either setrobuvir or placebo in combination with Pegasys and Copegus for 48 weeks. Treatment-experienced patients categorized as null-responders to previous pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy will be assigned to treatment with setrobuvir plus Pegasys and Copegus for 48 weeks.</brief_summary>
