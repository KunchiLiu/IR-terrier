	<brief_summary>Principal objective: to evaluate the effect of the combination pravastatin - sorafenib versus sorafenib alone on overall survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma developing on Child-Pugh A cirrhosis who are unsuitable for curative treatment. Secondary objectives: evaluate the effect of this treatment on progression-free survival, the time to progression, the time to treatment failure and quality of life (QLQ-C30 et FACT HEP)</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosed by: either a histological examination or if histological evidence cannot be obtained (ascites, coagulation disorders) the diagnosis can be made in cases of cirrhosis according to EASL/AASLD 2005 criteria, by revealing a hepatic focal lesion of more than 10 mm on two dynamic imaging techniques (helical CTscan, MRI, contrastenhanced ultrasound) for tumours measuring less than 2 cm. The lesion must be characterised by hyperdensity during the arterial phase and washout during the delayed portal phase Patients who are not suitable for treatment with a curative intent (transplantation, resection, percutaneous destruction) or by chemoembolisation or with progressive hepatocellular carcinoma after the failure of specific treatment Prognostic CLIP score 0 to 4 ChildPugh Class A Transaminases ≤ 5 N and Creatininemia ≤ 1.5 N WHO: 0, 1 or 2 Age more than 18 years Foreseeable survival &gt; 12 weeks Possibility of regular followup Written informed consent Extrahepatic disease that could be lifethreatening in the short or medium term Another progressive cancer with the exception of in situ cervical cancer, a superficial bladder tumour and treated basocellular carcinoma. Any other cancer treated with a curative intent in the previous 3 years can be included in the study Heart failure (≥New York Heart Association class 2), uncontrolled AHT or arrhythmia, myocardial infarction in the previous 6 months Digestive haemorrhage in the previous month Patients who are receiving or have already received treatment with statins or sorafenib Pregnancy and breastfeeding. Women of childbearing age must use an effective method of contraception throughout the trial and for 3 months after the end of the treatment.</criteria>
