	<brief_title>Anti-inflammatory Effect of Aerobic Exercise in Individual With Increased Cardiovascular Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Observational studies suggest that exercise has anti-inflammatory effect, however this idea has not been definitively confirmed by randomized clinical trials. Objective: To test the hypothesis that aerobic exercise attenuates systemic inflammatory activity in individuals with cardiovascular risk. Methods: Randomized controlled trial, which included 68 sedentary individuals, with at least two risk factors for coronary heart disease or established cardiovascular disease. The volunteers were randomized to 3 months of supervised aerobic training or just advice when healthy lifestyles. C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured by the method of high sensitivity before and after 3 months of intervention.</detailed_description>
