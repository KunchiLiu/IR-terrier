	<brief_summary>The mechanisms of oxidative stress and inflammation involved in mood disorders are factors of chronicity and severity. These mechanisms induce a phenomenon of accelerated cellular senescence and are reflected by alterations in systemic gene expression detectable in leukocytes in peripheral blood. The genetic markers of these mechanisms are clinically significant markers. The identification of new genetic markers will make it possible to improve evaluations of the severity and somatic consequences of depressive syndromes.</brief_summary>
