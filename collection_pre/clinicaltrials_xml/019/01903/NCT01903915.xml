	<brief_summary>There were a few studies about the relationship of structural or functional abnormalities of brain and social cognitive dysfunctions in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, default network, which increases activity during mental explorations referenced to oneself including remembering, considering hypothetical social interactions, and thinking about one's own future, may be associated with social cognitive dysfunctions in patients with schizophrenia. Therefore, we will investigate the dysfunction of default network in patients with schizophrenia compared with healthy controls and the effect of default network dysfunctions on the social cognition in patients with schizophrenia.</brief_summary>
