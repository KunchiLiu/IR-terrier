	<brief_summary>The hypotheses of our research are based on the fact that various pathological states, infection, cancer, inflammatory disease, can induce an inflammatory syndrome, through different pathways, even though the clinical presentation can be identical. The identification of biological markers specific to an etiology would therefore allow a faster diagnosis and improve care for patients. We thus took an interest in the three groups of diseases most frequently responsible for an inflammatory syndrome, infections, cancers and auto-immune diseases. To achieve this, various methods will be used.</brief_summary>
