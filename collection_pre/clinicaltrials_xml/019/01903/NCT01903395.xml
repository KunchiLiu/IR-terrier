Nevertheless, participation in the German national screening program stagnates at 2-3 percent per year even in this high-risk population.

Study sites (clusters) are mainly certified cancer centers and office-based gastroenterologists from all over Germany. Index-patients with colorectal cancer of different stages are asked to hand over the study material to their relatives, consisting of an invitation to a nurse-led counseling on preventive colonoscopy and an one-to-one appointment with a clinical expert of one of the study sites next.</brief_summary>
