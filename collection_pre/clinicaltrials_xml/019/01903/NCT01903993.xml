	<brief_summary>This multicenter, open-label, randomized study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Atezolizumab compared with docetaxel in participants with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after platinum failure. Participants will be randomized to receive either Atezolizumab 1200 milligram (mg) intravenously every 3 weeks or docetaxel 75 milligram per meter square (mg/m^2) intravenously every 3 weeks. Treatment with Atezolizumab may be continued as long as participants are experiencing clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator, i.e., in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression.</brief_summary>
