	<brief_summary>This study is to confirm the potential effects and assess the safety of a new bio-product Pegylated Recombinant Consensus Interferon Variant Solution for Injection (PEG-IFN-SA) and Ribavirin（RBV） in the treatment of Chronic hepatitis C who have not been previously treated with Interferon.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of PEG-IFN-SA and Ribavirin to Treat Chronic Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total 720 subjects are divided into two groups and treated separately according to the HCV genotype（genotype 2,3 and non-genotype 2,3). With 2:1 ratio between experimental group and positive-control group (Peginterferon alfa-2a (Pegasys) plus RBV), 216 subjects for genotype 2,3 and 504 subjects for non-genotype2,3 will be enrolled. Accordingly, PEG-IFN-SA once weekly and RBV twice a day (bid) are given for 24 weeks and 48 weeks respectively to the HCV genotype 2,3 and the HCV non-genotype 2,3 .</detailed_description>
