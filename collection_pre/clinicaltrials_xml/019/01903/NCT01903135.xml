	<brief_summary>Rationale of the "BIO-OHS" study (Prevalence of Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome): The overall prevalence of Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (OHS) has never been directly assessed in the general population. Actually, this prevalence has been assessed in patients referred to sleep clinics with a potential diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing or in patients already diagnosed with sleep apnea. The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of Obesity Hypoventilation syndrome in obese patients referred to clinical laboratories for regular follow-up medical analysis.</brief_summary>
