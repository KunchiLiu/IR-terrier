	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to estimate the annualized relapse rate (ARR) over a 12-month period in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) who are treated with dimethyl fumarate (DMF) after suboptimal response to glatiramer acetate (GA). The secondary objectives of this study in this study population are to assess the impact of DMF over a 12-month period on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and health economic-related outcomes and to evaluate additional clinical outcomes at Month 12.</brief_summary>

Are being treated for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) with glatiramer acetate (GA) but, per the Prescribing Physician, have a suboptimal response (e.g., suboptimal efficacy, intolerance, or poor adherence) to GA or have stopped treatment with GA for relapsing forms of MS as a result of suboptimal response within 30 days of enrollment. Have decided to initiate treatment with dimethyl fumarate (DMF) under routine clinical care. The decision to initiate treatment with DMF must precede enrollment.

Are pregnant or breastfeeding, or are planning to become pregnant or breastfeed. Are receiving concomitant disease modifying therapies other than glatiramer acetate (GA) or have initiated treatment with a new diseasemodifying therapy since discontinuation of glatiramer acetate (GA). Are currently enrolled in any other clinical studies, with the exception of the dimethyl fumarate (DMF) Pregnancy Registry. Have received prior treatment with dimethyl fumarate (DMF).
