	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of JVS-100 Administered to Adults With Ischemic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>72 subjects with ischemic cardiomyopathy. The Phase I portion (n=12 subjects) will be open label. In the first cohort, six subjects will receive a single dose of 30 mg of JVS-100 with a minimum of 3 days between each enrollment. After seven days following the enrollment of the last patient of cohort 1, a safety assessment by the DSMC will be performed. Upon DSMC approval, the second cohort of six subjects will receive a single dose of 45 mg of JVS-100 with a minimum of 3 days between each enrollment. After seven days following the enrollment of the last patient of cohort 2, a safety assessment by the DSMC will be performed. Upon DSMC approval, up to 60 subjects will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive a single dose of 30 mg or 45 mg of JVS-100 or matching placebo.</detailed_description>
