	<brief_title>The Effect of Cipralex on Quality of Life, Adrenal Activity Glucose Metabolism, Physical and Mental Health in PCOS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We want to investigate the effect of Cipralex versus placebo on stress hormones, glucose metabolism, physical and mental health and quality of life in polycystic ovary syndrome(PCOS). PCOS is characterized by menstrual deregulation, high testosterone, mail hair growth and increased stress hormones from the adrenals. Furthermore there are changes similar to those seen in diabetes. Cipralex is known to decrease stress hormones. But no investigations are on the effect of cipralex on PCOS, or how the increased stress hormones affect the PCOS condition. We will examine 2x20 women with PCOS. They will be randomized to Cipralex or placebo. Treatment duration is 12 weeks.</detailed_description>
