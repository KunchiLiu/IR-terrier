	<criteria>Previous enrollment in 0910extension study evaluating intravitreal aflibercept injection (NCT 00964795) without early study discontinuation prior to sponsor early termination. Patients are enrolled within 90 days of site activation (all attempts will be made to ensure IAI is given once exited from the 0910extension and prior to enrollment). Willing and able to comply with clinical visits and study related procedures. Provide signed informed consent Prior treatment with verteporfin, or externalbeam radiation therapy, or transpupillary thermotherapy in the study eye Previous subfoveal focal laser photocoagulation involving the foveal center in the study eye History of vitrectomy, submacular surgery, or other surgical intervention for AMD in the study eye Any concurrent intraocular condition in the study eye (e.g. diabetic retinopathy or glaucoma) that, in the opinion of the investigator, could either require medical or surgical intervention during the study period to prevent or treat visual loss that might result from that condition, or if allowed to progress untreated, could likely contribute to loss of at least 2 Snellen equivalent lines of best corrected visual acuity over the study period Active intraocular inflammation (grade trace or above) in the study eye, or history of idiopathic or autoimmuneassociated uveitis in either eye Current vitreous hemorrhage in the study eye History of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or macular hole (Stage 3 or 4) in the study eye Active infectious conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, or endophthalmitis in either eye Aphakia, ACIOL, or unstable PCIOL Uncontrolled glaucoma in the study eye (defined as intraocular pressure â‰¥30 mmHg despite treatment with antiglaucoma medication) Pregnant or breastfeeding women Sexually active men* or women of childbearing potential** who are unwilling to practice adequate contraception during the study (adequate contraceptive measures include stable use of oral contraceptives or other prescription pharmaceutical contraceptives for 2 or more menstrual cycles prior to screening; intrauterine device [IUD]; bilateral tubal ligation; vasectomy; condom plus contraceptive sponge, foam, or jelly, or diaphragm plus contraceptive sponge, foam, or jelly) Contraception is not required for men with documented vasectomy.
