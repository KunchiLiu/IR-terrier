	<brief_summary>This study is being done to see if the investigators can measure changes that occur in breast tissue when women at risk of developing breast cancer start an exercise program. The investigators are interested in studying this because research shows that women who exercise regularly are less likely to develop breast cancer, but there is not very much information explaining how exercise could affect breast cells in a way to prevent cancer from occurring. In this research study the investigators will use a research technique called breast random fine needle aspiration (RPFNA) to test breast cells for their shape and how they look. The investigators will look at breast cells before and after a participant takes part in an exercise program to see if the investigators are able to see any changes in breast cells that could have happened due to the exercise program. This research will help us to develop larger projects to see if exercise programs could be helpful in preventing breast cancer.</brief_summary>
