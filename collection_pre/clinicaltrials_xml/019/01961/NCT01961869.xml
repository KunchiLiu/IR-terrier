	<brief_title>Black Raspberry Confection in Preventing Oral Cancer in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To select an optimal black raspberry confection based on altered gene expression and chemical profiles in healthy individuals exposed to 3 black raspberry-based amorphous functional confections with modulated bioactive release rate at two doses (4 g and 8 g). OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 6 arms after 2 weeks. ARM I: Participants receive black raspberry (BRB) confection 1 fast release orally (PO) 4-6 hours apart thrice daily (TID) for 2 weeks. ARM II: Participants receive BRB confection 2 fast release PO 4-6 hours apart TID for 2 weeks. ARM III: Participants receive BRB confection 1 intermediate release PO 4-6 hours apart TID for 2 weeks. ARM IV: Participants receive BRB confection 2 intermediate release PO 4-6 hours apart TID for 2 weeks. ARM V: Participants receive BRB confection 1 prolonged release PO 4-6 hours apart TID for 2 weeks. ARM VI: Participants receive BRB confection 2 prolonged release PO 4-6 hours apart TID for 2 weeks.</detailed_description>
