	<brief_summary>It was shown by some researchers that dietary nitrate such as beet root juice can lower oxygen consumption in men and act as a performance enhancing supplement. It was not shown, what the optimal dosage is and if there is any difference in oxygen consumption comparing beet root juice and inorganic nitrate. Therefore, the aim of the study is to conduct a study ingesting different sodium nitrate and beet root juice dosages. We would measure nitrate and nitrite concentrations in the blood at different time points and the subjects have to perform an exercise test measuring oxygen consumption 3 hours after the ingestion of nitrate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose and Response of Dietary Nitrate in Healthy and Active Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. The subjects have to ingest 7 different dosages of either beetroot juice or sodium nitrate on seven different occasions. Every hour a blood withdrawal is taken to measure nitrate and nitrite concentration in the blood. 2. The subjects have to ingest 7 different dosages of either beetroot juice or sodium nitrate on seven different occasions. Three hours after the intake of the supplement the subjects have to perform an exercise test on a bicycle. They have to cycle 5 min at 50% of maximal oxygen consumption and 8min at 80% of maximal oxygen consumption separated by a 5min break. Oxygen consumption would be measured during the whole exercise test. Blood withdrawal is taken before the ingestion, after 3 hours and after the test.</detailed_description>
