	<brief_summary>The occurence of a minor craniocerebral trauma in patients receiving vitamine K antagonist treatment leads to a high risk of bleeding. Current guidelines recommend to perform a CT scan, and, in case of intracranial bleeding, to reverse anticoagulation with concomitant administration of prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) and vitamin K. However, even if a reversion is performed, the prognostic of post-traumatic intracranial bleeding remain bad. The investigators hypothesize that, for patients admitted in an emergency department after a minor head trauma and receiving anticoagulant treatment, a systematic preventive reversion with PCCs can lead to a significant reduction of intracranial haemorrhage and can also improve the neurological prognostic of patients versus the current strategy. PREVACT will test this hypothesis, in an open label, randomized, multicentre, clinical trial involving 400 patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Admission in an emergency departement for a recent and isolated minor head trauma with at least one of the following characteristic : a period of alteration in the level of consciousness, a period of loss of consciousness (&lt; 30 min), a posttraumatic amnesia, persistant posttraumatic headache, repeated vomitting (at least 2 episodes) or any other neurological sign such a convulsion or a localised neurological sign... Subject receiving anticoagulant treatment with antivitamin K for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) Initial ED Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of ≥13 Achievable follow up Informed consent form signed by the patient or if he/she isn't able an emergency inclusion can be realised. Delay between the minor head trauma and the possible preventive PCC's administration &gt; 6h Subject receiving anticoagulant treatment other than anti vitamin K (heparin, fondaparinux, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban...) Subject receiving anticoagulant treatment for other reason than a AF Subject on antiplatelet treatment (except the use of low dose of aspirin (≤ 100 mg/day) Delocalised biology INR in capillary blood &lt; 1.5 if it's available (only in departement where this analyse is a usual practice) Haemorrhage or suspected haemorrhage other than intracranial which could led to a reversion of the anticoagulation Head trauma associated with one or further potential haemorrhagic traumatic lesions Subject who reject the use of products derived from human blood Women who are pregnant Subject with any condition that, as judged by the investigator, would place the subject at increased risk of harm if he/she participated in the study Subject without social security registered</criteria>
