	<brief_summary>This study is designed as a multi-centre, randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, phase III confirmatory study. The study will be partially double-blinded: the comparison between Group 1 (placebo group) and Group 2 (ICI35,868 without EES0000645/A) will be carried out in double-blind, but the comparison between Group 1 (placebo group) and Group 3 (ICI35,868 with EES0000645/A) will be carried out in single-blind. The efficacy and safety of ICI35,868 with and without EES0000645/A for the sedation to be moderate for a diagnostic gastrointestinal endoscopy and gastrointestinal endoscopic polypectomy will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
