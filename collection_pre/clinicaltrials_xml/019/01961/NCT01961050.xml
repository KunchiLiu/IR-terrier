	<detailed_description>The study is a two-arm, 20-site, site-randomized, controlled trial testing an intervention to reduce risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies in at-risk women (at-risk drinking childbearing age women who are heterosexually active, and not consistently using contraception). The trial will assess feasibility of a dual-focused (i.e. contraception use-drinking reduction) brief physician intervention (DFBPI) and determine whether physicians, trained in DFBPI and monitored for compliance, can foster greater reduction of women's risk behaviors compared to standard care. The intervention is specifically designed to be deliverable routinely by Obstetrics and Gynecology physicians(OB/GYN) to large numbers of women at women's clinics.</detailed_description>
