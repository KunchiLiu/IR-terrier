	<brief_summary>This research is to establish a simple and practical system to predict the prognosis of sever hepatitis B.Seven factors (level of serum total bilirubin, prothrombin time, severity of hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome,ascites ,infection and size of liver) which were easier to evaluate and more influential， were included to establish a prognosis scoring system．The scorings of a new score system and MELD were graded at the same time in the patients with sever hepatitis B. And then the distribution figures of survival rates and mortality rates were done according to the scores from low to high. The features of distribution figures of two score system in survival rates and mortality rates and significances of clinical application in certain score were interpreted.</brief_summary>
