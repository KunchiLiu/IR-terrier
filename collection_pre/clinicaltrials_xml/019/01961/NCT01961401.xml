	<brief_summary>Exercise training is recognized as effective in preventing and treating many chronic metabolic disorders (1), and long-term exercise programmes have similar effects on glucose control as long-term drug or insulin therapy in type 2 diabetic patients (2). The precise intensity and volume of aerobic exercise needed to produce the most wanted effects on targeted risk factors for subjects at risk of/with established type 2 diabetes, is still uncertain. In this study the investigators will investigate the acute effects of a single bout of moderate versus high intensity exercise on insulin sensitivity in pregnant women with and without gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The investigators think that very short bouts of high intensity exercise can be a way to reduce blood glucose in these women.</brief_summary>
