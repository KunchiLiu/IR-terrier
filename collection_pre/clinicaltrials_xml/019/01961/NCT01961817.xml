	<brief_title>Airway Management Via the Retromolar Route Access</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Management of the difficult airway is still an essential part of modern anaesthesia. Up to now, there have bee no clinical investigations comparing the intubation method via the retromolar route (RM), with the conventional intubation route (CM). For the present clinical investigation, 100 patients undergoing elective surgery will be investigated in the General Hospital of Vienna when for the anaesthesia intubation is required. In both intubation methods (RM and CM) the anaesthesiologist will visually determine the Cormack &amp; Lehane score in a randomly assigned sequence with and without a BURP-manoeuvre (= backwards, upwards and rightwards pressure). Thereafter intubation is performed in all patients by the CM method and if intubation fails the RM technique will be used. Of course, as per usual, every intubation trial is interrupted by a 20 second 100%-oxygen-ventilation period to reach a pulse oximetry oxygen saturation of at least 97% SpO2. Thereafter, if intubation fails again every other intubation technique will be applied, as necessary and called for.</detailed_description>
