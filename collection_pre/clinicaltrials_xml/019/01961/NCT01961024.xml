	<brief_summary>In thise study, we aim to determine the effect of meal fat on VLDL-TG kinetics in type 2 diabetic and healthy subjects matched for BMI in order to elucidate the potential pathophysiological differences in VLDL-TG FA channeling towards oxidation and storage in abdominal and leg subcutaneous adipose tissue. Specifically, we want to measure, by way of fat and muscle biopsies, the quantitative postprandial storage of VLDL-TG FA's in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue in relation to a series of tissue specific proteins and enzymes that might be involved in regulating skeletal muscle and adipose tissue FA storage.</brief_summary>
