	<brief_summary>Study Rationale: The insertion of a bandage contact lens or punctal plug in a defined group of patients admitted to the ICU may be more effective than standard care in decreasing the incidence of corneal injuries. Study Objectives: 1. To document the effect of a contact bandage lens and punctal plug in preventing corneal injuries in critically ill patients admitted to the ICU. 2. To assess the safety of a contact bandage lens and punctal plug in critically ill patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Between Bandage Contact Lens, Punctal Plugs and Standard Measures in Preventing Corneal Injuries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized study Study Population: Consecutive patients admitted to the General Intensive Care Unit of the Rabin Medical Center and Sharon Hospital Medical Center over a 6-month period who meet criteria for inclusion. Procedures: Consecutive patients meeting inclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. Patients will be randomized to 3 groups: the bandage contact lens group, who will be assigned to insertion of a bandage contact lens; the punctal plug group, who will be assigned to the insertion of punctal plugs; and the control group, who will be assigned to standard eye care as currently practiced in the ICU. In addition, patients in the study will be examined every 4 days by a physician from the ophthalmology department and at either discharge from the ICU or at time of death.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must be &gt; 18 years of age. Patients who meet the following criteria will be considered eligible for the study: i) require mechanical ventilation; ii) require continuous infusion of sedative medication with or without neuromuscular paralysis; iii) anticipated ICU stay &gt; 5 days. Patients will be excluded if there is any preexisting corneal disease or an ophthalmic injury related to the present admission (e.g. ophthalmic trauma) to the ICU.</criteria>
