	<brief_title>The Influence of a "Cooling Ice Spray " Application on the Time to Stability After a Forward Jump?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In sports are "Cooling Ice Spray" applications after an injuries one of the most common and popular methods used. It is very popular mainly because of its analgesic effect and easy application. It is assumed that such application will not affect the athletes. Nevertheless after an application of cold a reduced nerve conduction velocity was measured, resulting in a reduction in pain and a reduced transmission rate. Usually the static equilibrium or the perception of joint position was investigated and not the time to stability. As far as we have been known so far been no study that has examined the impact of a brief application of cooling ice spray on the time to stability after dynamic function. Therefore this study what's to investigate the influence of "Cooling Ice Spray" on the time to stability after a forward jump.</detailed_description>
