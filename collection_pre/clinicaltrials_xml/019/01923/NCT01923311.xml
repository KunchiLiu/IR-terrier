	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) and confirm the dose of ritonavir (RTV)-boosted elvitegravir (EVG/r). This study will also evaluate the safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of elvitegravir (EVG) administered with a background regimen containing a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r) in HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral (ARV) treatment-experienced pediatric participants. The study consists of 2 parts: Part A and Part B. Part A will enroll participants with suppressed viremia (HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL) or failing a current ARV regimen (HIV-1 RNA &gt; 1,000 copies/mL) to evaluate the steady state PK and confirm the dose of EVG. Part B will enroll participants who are failing a current ARV regimen (HIV-1 RNA &gt; 1,000 copies/mL) to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of EVG.</brief_summary>

Key Participants who meet any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in this study. Individuals with CD4+ cell counts at Screening of less than 50, 75, or 200 cells/mm3 dependent on age cohort An AIDS defining condition with onset within 30 days prior to screening Life expectancy of less than 1 year For Individuals with HIV1 RNA greater than 1,000 copies/mL at screening, prior treatment of any duration with an integrase strand transfer inhibitor. An ongoing serious infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy at the time of screening. Evidence of active pulmonary or extrapulmonary tuberculosis disease Anticipated requirement for rifamycin treatment while participating in the study. Have any serious or active medical or psychiatric illness which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with Individual's treatment, assessment, or compliance with the protocol. Individuals experiencing decompensated cirrhosis A history of or ongoing malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), basal cell carcinoma, or resected, noninvasive cutaneous squamous carcinoma. Pregnant or lactating females. Current alcohol or substance abuse judged by the Investigator to potentially interfere with individual's compliance. Have history of significant drug sensitivity or drug allergy. Known hypersensitivity to the study drug, the metabolites, or formulation excipients. Have previously participated in an investigational trial involving administration of any investigational agent within 30 days prior to the study dosing. Participation in any other clinical trial without prior approval from sponsor is prohibited while participating in this trial. Individuals receiving ongoing therapy with any medication that is not to be taken with EVG or a component of the BR, including drugs not to be used with ritonavir NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/ Exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
