	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I/IIa study evaluating the safety and feasibility of [89Zr]Df-IAB2M as an immunoPET tracer for metastatic prostate cancer. Individuals participating in this study will have a FDG PET scan, as well as four (4) PET scans (over a 3 day period) following the injection of [89Zr]Df-IAB2M PET tracer. Three different dosing levels will be explored. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the safety of [89Zr]Df-IAB2M, ability to detect prostate cancer, and optimal time point and dose level for imaging.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/IIA Study of PET Imaging With 89Zr-Df-IAB2M in Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IAB2M is an approximately 80 kDA molecular weight antibody fragment (a "Minibody"). Limited (Phase 0/Proof-of-concept) patient experience with this biologic targeting agent has been previously obtained with SPECT imaging Ex-US, demonstrating targeting of soft tissue and bone lesions in advanced metastatic prostate cancer.</detailed_description>
