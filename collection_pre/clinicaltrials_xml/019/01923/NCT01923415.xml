	<brief_title>A Non-drug Study Profiling Cutaneous Lupus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 0, multiple-center observational study of biomarkers and clinical parameters in patients with lupus, including discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), subacute cutaneous LE (SCLE) and active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). There is no study-related therapeutic intervention and this protocol will not restrict or introduce any medical interventions including medications. Study participants will undergo procedures that include collection of urine, blood samples, and skin biopsy. At least 30 participants (≥10 DLE, ≥10 SCLE, and ≥10 SLE) will be enrolled in this study. All participants will continue to be managed by their personal physicians per their standard of care. The data obtained in this study will help in the evaluation of new therapeutics for lupus and may facilitate lupus drug discovery. A blood sample for genomic analysis will be collected for research purposes from patients who provide consent and where local regulations permit. There will be a single sample collection time point for each patient. The safety assessments will include laboratory measurements (serum chemistry and hematology), monitoring of adverse events (AEs) related to study procedures, and physical examination.</detailed_description>
