	<brief_summary>This is a double-blind randomised controlled crossover study to investigate whether high frequency airflow oscillation (HFAO), delivered using Aerosure, improves sputum clearance in patients admitted to hospital with infective exacerbations of cystic fibrosis (CF). This study will test the hypothesis that the wet weight of sputum expectorated is greater following the use of Aerosure than following the use of a sham Aerosure device.</brief_summary>
