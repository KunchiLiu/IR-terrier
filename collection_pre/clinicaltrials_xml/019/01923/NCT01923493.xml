	<brief_title>Tuina for Patients With Chronic Neck Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: To evaluate whether tuina is more effective and cost-effective than no intervention waiting list to reduce neck pain measured on a visual analogue scale in patients suffering from chronic neck pain. Study Design: Open single-centre randomized two-armed controlled trial. Setting: The study will be performed at a University out-patient clinic specialized in Integrative Medicine, with experience in the treatment of chronic pain. Participants: 88 outpatients with chronic neck pain, who will be randomly allocated to two groups (tuina, or no intervention (control)). Intervention: Patients receive either six tuina treatments within 3 weeks or no additional intervention. Main outcome measure: The primary outcome is the mean neck pain intensity over the last seven days on a visual analogue scale (Huskisson, 1974) (VAS, 0-100 mm, 0 = no pain, 100= worst imaginable pain) after four weeks.</detailed_description>
