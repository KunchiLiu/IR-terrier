	<brief_summary>This study was conducted to develop biomarkers of tobacco effect that would indicate potential harm related to tobacco consumption. To gain a better understanding of chronic effects of tobacco consumption, this cross-sectional clinical study enrolled generally healthy, adult male consumers of cigarettes (SMK), moist snuff (MSC), and no tobacco products (NTC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development of Biomarkers of Effect From Chronic Tobacco Usage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single site, three-group (healthy, adult male smokers (SMK), moist snuff consumers (MSC), and non-tobacco consumers (NTC), single-blind, cross-sectional study, included one overnight confinement of study subjects for Test Visit (Visit #3). No lifestyle changes were required, inclusive of tobacco habits. In addition to the Screening Visit (Visit #1), two other visits (Acceptance Visit [Visit #2] and a Test Visit [Visit #3]) were conducted at the clinical study site.</detailed_description>

Smokers: Must have been exclusive full flavor (FF) (&gt;13 mg FTC [Federal Trade Commission] "tar") or full flavor low "tar" (FFLT) (6.0 to 10.3 mg FTC "tar") smokers who selfreported smoking at least 10 cigarettes daily for at least the past three years prior to screening and whose expired carbon monoxide (ECO) is 10 to 100 parts per million (ppm) at screening and study checkin. Note: Subjects with an ECO of 2 to 9 ppm may have been included upon joint review by the Sponsor and the Investigator. 2. Moist Snuff Consumers: Must have been exclusive moist snuff consumers of any brand (Copenhagen, Skoal, Grizzly, Kodiak, Timber Wolf, Longhorn, Red Man, etc.), any style (snuff cut, long cut, mid cut, fine cut, or pouch) and any flavor (natural, straight, mint, wintergreen, etc.) who reported using at least two can per week for at least the past three years prior to screening and whose ECO is 0 5 ppm at screening and study checkin. Note: Subjects with an ECO of 6 to 10 ppm may have been included upon joint review by the Sponsor and the Investigator. 3. NonTobacco Consumers: Must have been nonconsumers of any tobacco or nicotinecontaining products for at least five years prior to study screening and whose ECO is 0 to 5 ppm at screening and study checkin. Note: Subjects with an ECO of 6 to 10 ppm may have been included upon joint review by the Sponsor and the Investigator. 3. Subjects who are tobacco smokers: who did NOT intend to quit smoking nor intended to quit using moist snuff. "Intent to quit" was defined as planning a quit attempt within a month of screening. 4. All subjects must have met the American Red Cross Blood Donation Eligibility Guidelines (64) (inclusive of, but not limited to, age, blood pressure, bleeding conditions, recent donation, and weight) and have been generally healthy and felt well with no restrictions or limitations on activities. 5. Weighed at least 110 pounds. 6. Had a hemoglobin &gt;/= 12.5 g/dL and a hematocrit &gt;/= 38%. 7. Tested negative for drugs of abuse by urine drug screen at screening and at study checkin, unless subject was able to present proof of a corresponding prescription concomitant medication. 8. Performed a negative breath alcohol test at screening and study checkin. 9. Had a negative urine cotinine test at screening and study checkin for nontobacco consumers. 10. Had a positive urine cotinine test at screening and study checkin for tobacco consumers. 11. Subjects must, in the opinion of the Investigator, had been free of clinically significant health problems, including oral health. 12. Not taking daily medication for a chronic medical condition deemed clinically significant by the Investigator. 13. Not regularly taking creatine supplements. 14. Not have used aspirin (or related drugs, other than aspirin prophylaxis up to 81 mg/day) in the seven days prior to study checkin. 15. Tested negative for Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg), negative for Hepatitis C Antibody (HCAb), and had a negative Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) screen. 16. At least 60 days had passed since the subject's last whole blood (standard) donation. 17. Able to comprehend and willing to sign an Informed Consent Form (ICF). 18. Able to read and comprehend questionnaires in English. Subjects who met any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study: 1. Met cohort specific exclusions as follows: 1.

NOTE: Subjects who have smoked &lt; 6 cigars in the past 12 months prior to screening would NOT have been excluded. Subjects who received shortterm administration of a NRT as a temporary bridging treatment would NOT have been excluded. 2. Moist Snuff Consumers: For three years prior to the study through Day 1, the use of any other tobacco or nicotinecontaining product or device other than moist snuff, including tobaccoburning cigarettes, tobaccoheating cigarettes, ecigarettes, beedis, cigars, pipes, chewing tobacco, snus, dry snuff, or any NRT (e.g., patch, gum, lozenge, inhaler, spray, etc.). NOTE: Subjects who received shortterm administration of a NRT as a temporary bridging treatment would NOT have been excluded. 3. Non Tobacco Consumers: For five years prior to the study through Day 1, the use of any kind of tobacco products or the use of any nontobacco nicotinecontaining products (NRTs) or devices (e.g., ecigarettes). 2. Subjects who were tobacco consumers: expressed an interest in quitting smoking or using moist snuff (defined as planning a quit attempt within a month of screening). 3. Subjects who were MSC users or non tobacco consumers: an ECO &gt; 5 ppm at screening or study checkin (ECO of 6 to 10 ppm may not have been excluded based on joint review by the Sponsor and Investigator). 4. Subjects who were smokers: an ECO &lt; 10 ppm at screening or study checkin (ECO of 2 to 9 ppm may not have been excluded based on joint review by the Sponsor and Investigator). 5. Any chronic illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, is unstable. 6. A temperature above 99.5° F. 7. Poor peripheral venous access. 8.
