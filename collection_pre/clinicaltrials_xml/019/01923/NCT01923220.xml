	<detailed_description>This is a single-center, open-label, randomized, prospective study evaluating the safety and efficacy of HO/02/02 20µg topically applied daily for 15 minutes (with gauze) on treatment fields vs. standard of care (SoC), Aloe Vera treatment in addition to sterile water for irrigation applied daily for 15 minutes (with gauze) on treatment fields to create the same cooling effect as in treatment arm 1. Both treatment arms 1&amp;2 treatments will be applied topically once daily for up to 8 weeks to reduce radiation dermatitis in up to 90 breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant radiation therapy.</detailed_description>
