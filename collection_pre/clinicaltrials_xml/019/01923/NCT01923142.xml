	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the hypothesis that, in patients with stable vitiligo unresponsive to conventional treatments including traditional phototherapy and/or topical steroids, the application of a non-cultured autologous hair follicle outer-root-sheath melanocytes suspension in the area affected by the disease followed by targeted ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy can lead to a significant skin repigmentation. To assess the effect of the proposed treatment, a within-subject controlled study involving selected symmetric lesion areas localized to the back of the hands will be conducted.</brief_summary>
