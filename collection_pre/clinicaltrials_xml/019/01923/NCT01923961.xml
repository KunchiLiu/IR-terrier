	<brief_summary>An increase of the free fraction may allow a better removal of of protein-bound uremic toxins during dialysis. During predilution hemodiafiltration, the sodium chloride (NaCl) concentration will be increased in the infusion fluid at a target NaCl concentration and the effect on the removal of protein-bound toxins will be determined. Comparisons will be made to standard hemodialysis and hemodiafiltration.</brief_summary>
