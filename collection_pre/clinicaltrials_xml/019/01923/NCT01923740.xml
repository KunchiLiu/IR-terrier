Subject or a legally authorized representative must provide written Informed Consent prior to any study related procedure. 3. Subject must have evidence of myocardial ischemia (e.g., stable angina, unstable angina, postinfarct angina or silent ischemia) suitable for elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Subjects with stable angina or silent ischemia and &lt; 70% diameter stenosis must have objective sign of ischemia as determined by one of the following, echocardiogram, nuclear scan, ambulatory ECG or stress ECG.

Subject had an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) within 7 days of the index procedure and both creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase myocardialband isoenzyme (CKMB) have not returned to within normal limits at the time of index procedure. 5. Subject is currently experiencing clinical symptoms consistent with new onset AMI, such as nitrateunresponsive prolonged chest pain with ischemic ECG changes. 6. Subject has a cardiac arrhythmia as identified at the time of screening which at least one of the following criteria is met: 1. Subject requires coumadin or any other agent for chronic oral anticoagulation. 2. Subject likely to become hemodynamically unstable due to their arrhythmia. 3. Subject has poor survival prognosis due to their arrhythmia. 7. Subject has a known left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 30% assessed by any quantitative method. LVEF may be obtained within 6 months prior to the procedure for subjects with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). For subjects presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), LVEF must be assessed during the index hospitalization (which may include during the index procedure by contrast left ventriculography) but prior to randomization in order to confirm the subject's eligibility. 8. Subject has received CABG at any time in the past. 9. Subject has undergone prior PCI within the target vessel during the last 12 months or undergone prior PCI within the nontarget vessel within 30 days before the index procedure. 10. Subject requires future staged PCI either in target or nontarget vessels. 11. Subject has received any solid organ transplants or is on a waiting list for any solid organ transplants. 12. At the time of screening, the subject has a malignancy that is not in remission. 13. Subject is receiving immunosuppressant therapy or has known immunosuppressive or autoimmune disease (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus, systemic lupus erythematosus, etc.). Note: corticosteroids are not included as immunosuppressant therapy. 14. Subject has previously received or is scheduled to receive radiotherapy to coronary artery (vascular brachytherapy), or chest/mediastinum. 15. Subject is receiving or will receive chronic anticoagulation therapy (e.g., coumadin or any other anticoagulation agents). 16. Subject has a platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3 or &gt; 700,000 cells/mm3. 17. Subject has a known or documented hepatic disorder as defined as cirrhosis or ChildPugh ≥ Class B. 18. Subject has known renal insufficiency as defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73m2 or dialysis at the time of screening. 19. Subject is high risk of bleeding; has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy; has had a significant gastrointestinal or significant urinary bleed within the past six months; will refuse blood transfusions. 20. Subject has had a cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic neurological attack (TIA) within the past six months or any prior intracranial bleed, any permanent neurologic defect, or any known intracranial pathology (e.g., aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, etc.). 21. Subject has extensive peripheral vascular disease that precludes safe 6 French sheath insertion. Note: femoral arterial disease does not exclude the subject if radial or brachial access can be used. 22. Subject has life expectancy &lt; 2 years for any noncardiac cause or cardiac cause. 23. Subject is in the opinion of the Investigator or designee, unable to comply with the requirements of the study protocol or is unsuitable for the study for any reason. 24. Subject is currently participating in another clinical trial that has not yet completed its primary endpoint or protocolrequired medications or invasive procedures. Angiographic Inclusion Criteria Assessment of angiographic eligibility is per visual assessment by an investigator both for qualitative and quantitative variables. Online QCA is recommended to be used for appropriately sizing of the vessel. If online QCA cannot be used, visual estimation is required. 1. One or two de novo target lesions: 1. If there is one target lesion, a second nontarget lesion may be treated but the nontarget lesion must be present in a different epicardial vessel, and must be treated first with a successful, uncomplicated result prior to randomization of the target lesion. 2. If two target lesions are present, they must be present in different epicardial vessels and both satisfy the angiographic eligibility criteria. 3. The definition of epicardial vessels means the left anterior descending artery (LAD), the left circumflex artery (LCX), and the right coronary artery (RCA) and their branches. Thus, for example, the subject must not have lesions requiring treatment in both the LAD and a diagonal branch. 2. Target lesion must be located in a native coronary artery with a visually estimated or quantitatively assessed %DS of ≥ 50% and &lt; 100% with a thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow of ≥ 1 and one of the following: stenosis ≥ 70%, an abnormal functional test (e.g., fractional flow reserve, stress test), unstable angina or postinfarct angina. 3. Target lesion must have a Dmax (by online QCA) or reference vessel diameter (RVD) (by visual estimation) ≥ 2.50 mm and ≤ 3.75 mm (online QCA assessment is recommended). 4. Target lesion must have a lesion length ≤ 24 mm based on either visual estimation or online QCA. Angiographic Exclusion Criteria All exclusion criteria apply to the target lesion(s) or target vessel(s). All exclusion criteria are based on visual estimation. 1. Target lesion is located in left main. 2. Aortoostial RCA target lesion (within 3 mm of the ostium). 3. Target lesion located within 3 mm of the origin of the LAD or LCX. 4. Lesion involving a bifurcation with a: 1. Side branch ≥ 2 mm in diameter, or 2. Side branch with diameter stenosis ≥ 50%, or 3. Side branch requiring protection guide wire, or 4. Side branch requiring predilatation 5. Anatomy proximal to or within the lesion that may impair delivery of the Absorb BVS or XIENCE V, including: 1. Extreme angulation (≥ 90°) proximal to or within the target lesion 2. Excessive tortuosity (≥ two 45° angles) proximal to or within the target lesion 3. Moderate or heavy calcification proximal to or within the target lesion 6. Target lesion or target vessel involves a myocardial bridge. 7. Target vessel contains thrombus as indicated in the angiographic images. 8. Target vessel has been previously treated with a stent at any time prior to the index procedure such that the Absorb BVS or XIENCE V would need to cross the stent to reach the target lesion. 9. Target vessel has been previously treated with a stent and the target lesion is within 5 mm proximal to a previously treated lesion. 10. Target lesion which prevents complete balloon predilatation, defined as full balloon expansion with the following outcomes: 1. Residual %DS is &lt; 40% (per visual estimation), ≤ 20% is strongly recommended. 2. TIMI Grade3 flow (per visual estimation). 3. No angiographic complications (e.g. distal embolization, side branch closure). 4. No dissections National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) grade DF. 5. No chest pain lasting &gt; 5 minutes. 6. No ST depression or elevation lasting &gt; 5 minutes.</criteria>
