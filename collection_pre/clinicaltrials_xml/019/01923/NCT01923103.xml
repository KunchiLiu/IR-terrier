	<brief_summary>Dupuytren disease (DD) is a progressive fibromatosis of the palmar fascias of the hand and fingers, which may lead to extension deficits of the fingers. The disease can be very disabling in moderate and severe cases, whereby performing normal daily activities can become very problematic. The aetiology and pathogenesis are not completely understood. There is a genetic disposition and it is influenced by environmental factors. The disease is especially prevalent in white males of Northern European descent above 50 years of age. There is paucity of knowledge about the natural progression of the disease. Several studies have been conducted on progression of disease and from these studies it becomes obvious that the disease is progressive over several years. However, in most studies only one moment of follow-up has taken place, so the course of the progression over time is unknown. The aim of this study is to enhance our knowledge on the natural disease progression of DD at different stages.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective: - Primary objective: To study natural disease progress of Dupuytren Disease (DD) in different stages of disease in males and females above 18 years of age. - Secondary objectives: 1. To study the effect of potential risk factors for DD on natural disease progress. 2. To study at what stage of disease patients with DD experience problems in daily life. 3. To study the incidence and course of recurrent disease. Primary Hypothesis: The natural course of disease is an exponential function of time. - Study design: The study is designed as a prospective observational pilot study with a maximum follow-up of five years. - Study population: Males and females above 18 years of age with all stages of primary Dupuytren's disease - Main study parameters/endpoints: The natural course of progression of DD measured as the increase or decrease in size of nodules and cords in millimetres and/or increase of total passive extension deficit in degrees, from baseline to endpoint. - Secondary study parameters: Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHOQ) and Patient-Rated Wrist/Hand Evaluation (PRWHE)to measure hand function.</detailed_description>
