	<brief_summary>The respiratory epithelium plays a leading role in the development of allergic respiratory disease with barrier function alteration, its repair mechanisms, of anti-viral fight and the ability to induce by itself Th2 responses. The majority of allergic asthmatic patients have reached concomitant ENT: the concept of "one airway, one disease." Access to this material of epithelial study in the different phenotypes of the disease appears to be crucial. Nasal and bronchial epithelial tissues reveal essential differences in particular related to their environment (remodeling less intense and a lower sensitivity to the virus in the nose), but they nevertheless share many common cellular characteristics.</brief_summary>
