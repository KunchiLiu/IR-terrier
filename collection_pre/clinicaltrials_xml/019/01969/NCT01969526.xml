	<brief_summary>Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a multifactorial intervention program based on physical activity and diet, memory workshops and review of medication, to modify frailty parameters, muscle strength and physical and cognitive performance in people 65 years or older with a positive screening for frailty. Secondly, to assess changes in falls, hospitalizations, nutritional risk, disability and institutionalization or home-care. Methods: randomized clinical trial with a control group, of one year and a half of follow-up, conducted in eight primary care teams in Barcelona. Individuals to be included are 65 years or older with positive frailty screening, timed get-up-and-go less than or equal to 20 seconds, and cognitive Lobo test greater than or equal to 18. 165 patients will be selected in each group (difference to be detected on physical performance (Short physical performance battery (SPPB)): 0.5 units; common Standard Deviation : 1.42, 20% lost to follow-up). Intervention: consists in three different actions on frailty dimensions, applied to each subject in the intervention group, in groups of 15 participants: rehabilitative therapy plus intake of hyperproteic shakes, memory workshop and review of the medication. Evaluations will be blinded and conducted at 0, 3, 12 and 18 months. Analysis of variance for repeated measures to adjust for differences attributable to intervention effect and for potential confounders such as comorbidity, sensory limitations, social risk, other medical or social interventions, among others.</brief_summary>
