	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to investigate whether the combination of bihemispheric ("dual") transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and motor training on 5 consecutive days facilitates motor recovery in chronic stroke. Results will be compared to a matched group of patients undergoing anodal tDCS as well as a control group receiving sham tDCS. Functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before/after the intervention and during a 3 month follow-up will help investigating neural correlates of expected changes in motor function of the affected upper extremity.</brief_summary>
