	<brief_title>Pilot-Testing a Family-Based Intervention to Improve Child Outcomes and Increase Family Activity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low income ethnic minority youth tend to be at greater risk for obesity, physical inactivity, high risk behaviors such as tobacco and substance use and resulting cardiovascular and chronic disease. In this study we modified a tobacco and substance use risk prevention program to develop a tailored intervention (Healthy Families DC) that also included promotion of physical activity (PA) for DC middle-school students referred by school staff as over-weight and at risk for problem behaviors. The program included an initial family assessment, a family feedback session with family PA goal setting and 6 phone/text based booster sessions. A pilot study with 18 families, comprised of at least one caregiver and target child, was conducted to examine feasibility, acceptability, and trends in preliminary outcomes such as PA via self-report and accelerometry, health risk behaviors (e.g., tobacco use), health goal setting, and changes in family functioning (e.g., youth positive behaviors, parenting).</detailed_description>
