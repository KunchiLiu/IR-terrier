	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to assess the effect of a low-glycemic-load and milk-free diet on acne severity. IGF-1 and a phosphorylated product of the mTORC pathway (p70S6K) will be assessed in both groups to explore the mTORC signaling pathway, which is thought to be related to clinical improvement in previous studies.</brief_summary>
