Subject discontinued ABT199 administration before completing the prior study (due to disease progression, toxicity, withdrawn consent, other). Subject has any medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator places the subject at an unacceptably high risk for toxicities. Subject has not recovered to â‰¤ Grade 2 clinically significant adverse effect(s)/toxicity(ies) of previous therapy. Subject has been diagnosed with PostTransplant Lymphoproliferative Disease (PTLD), Burkitt's lymphoma, Burkittlike lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).</criteria>
