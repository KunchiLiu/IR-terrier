	<brief_summary>Our team has created an automated, real-time software based image analysis tool called Colometer to improve screening colonoscopy providing real time visual feedback on image quality. There are three components to this study. The first is to validate the bowel assessment preparation using the recorded colonoscopy videos from 50 consented normal risk patients. In the second phase, technological and machine user interface refinements will be identified and completed. Finally, the third phase will be a sham controlled prospective study of Colometer versus standard care in 100 consented average risk patients undergoing screening colonoscopy as performed by 10 consented endoscopists.</brief_summary>
