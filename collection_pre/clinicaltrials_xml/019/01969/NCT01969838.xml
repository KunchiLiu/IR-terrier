	<brief_summary>This study is to determine the efficacy of momelotinib (MMB) versus ruxolitinib in participants with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) or post-polycythemia vera or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (post-PV/ET MF) who have not yet received treatment with a Janus kinase inhibitor (JAK inhibitor). Participants will be randomized to receive either MMB or ruxolitinib for 24 weeks during a double-blind treatment phase, after which they will be eligible to receive open-label MMB for up to an additional 168 weeks. After discontinuation of study medication, assessments will continue for 12 additional weeks, after which participants will be contacted for survival follow-up approximately every 6 months for up to 5 years from the date of enrollment.</brief_summary>
