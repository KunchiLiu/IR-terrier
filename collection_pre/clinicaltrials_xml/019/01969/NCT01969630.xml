	<brief_summary>To determine in patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal lesions whether percutaneous revascularization with paclitaxel-eluting balloon angioplasty (PEB) and provisional nitinol stent is superior with respect to the 12-month incidence of restenosis compared to treatment with systematic paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) angioplasty</brief_summary>
