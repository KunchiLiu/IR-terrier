	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to establish efficacy and safety of Normia速 probiotic, used as an add-on therapy in treatment of H. Pylori infection with the standard triple therapy approach. The primary objective in the study is determination of efficacy of Normia速 probiotic as a supportive therapy in achieving a higher percentage of eradication of H. Pylori. The secondary objectives are to assess: - Safety profile of Normia速 probiotic in everyday use, e.g. reduction in number of side-effects and better compliance to the eradication therapy - Safety and efficacy of Normia速 probiotic in different demographic subgroups</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gastroenterologists and general practitioners have increasingly more possibilities of prescribing probiotic preparations as the only or (more often) adjuvant therapy in certain indications. A significant step forward was made in the current report of the European Helicobacter Study Group ,which states that "Certain probiotics and prebiotics show promising results as an adjuvant treatment in reducing side effects". At this stage,probiotics are classified as Grade D recommendation. That is precisely why the investigators believe that clinical studies are necessary in order for such effects to be objectively proven in a clinical setting. The investigators decided to conduct a clinical trial based on a clearly defined and sufficiently frequent indication,with a preparation of known probiotic composition that is easily available on the market, and in a real setting where such approach is bound to show both advantages and disadvantages.</detailed_description>
