	<brief_summary>The primary hypothesis of this study is to determine which of two incision sites (inframammary fold incision or the lateral radial incision) provides a more robust blood supply to the skin envelope during nipple-sparing mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. Following education about the trial and informed consent, patients will be randomized to one of the two incisions. If their surgeon recommends a particular incision, there is also a non-randomized cohort. Patients will complete the Breast Q, a questionnaire prior to surgery and three months after surgery to capture quality of life data. During the surgery, laser-assisted fluorescent angiography will be performed three times to look at blood perfusion with the Spy Elite imaging device. Patients will be required to return for postoperative follow up visits. All patients will be seen approximately one week, three weeks, and six weeks after surgery. Patients with a direct implant will finish the study at their three month post-operative visit. Patients with an expander will finish the study three months after their final implant is placed.</brief_summary>
