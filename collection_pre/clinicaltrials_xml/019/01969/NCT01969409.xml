	<brief_summary>Recent research studies have suggested that proteins called antibodies that are produced by the immune system might be involved in the lung damage of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Antibodies produced by the immune system normal help to fight infections by attacking bacteria and viruses without harming our own tissues. In patients with IPF, there is evidence that certain antibodies (called autoantibodies) attack the lung and contributes to the injury and scarring that occurs in IPF. Our recent studies have found that many IPF patients appear to have excessive autoantibody levels in blood and lungs that might make their disease worse. Rituximab is a medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of autoantibody diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Rituximab works by destroying B cells, a type of white blood cell, called a B-lymphocyte, which produce autoantibodies. In this research study, rituximab will be given into a vein to reduce the autoantibody levels that we believe might be contributing to the lung damage in IPF. This study is being conducted to determine if rituximab provides beneficial effects for IPF patients by decreasing further lung injury.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autoantibody Reduction Therapy in Patients With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blinded, Phase II trial in which 58 ambulatory IPF patients at any of four medical centers (University of Pittsburgh, University of Chicago, Geisinger Medical Center, and Temple University) will be randomized equally to 1. placebo or 2. two doses of rituximab 1 gm i.v., with a 14 day interval inbetween doses. Subjects will be followed for 9 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ambulatory patients with a diagnosis of IPF, not established &gt;5 years from the enrollment date, that fulfills ATS/ETS Consensus Criteria. Ability and willingness to give informed consent. Presence of autoantibodies against HEp2 cells, the assay for the primary endpoint. Age 5085 y.o. Diagnoses of current infection, proven or suspected by participating physicians based upon their clinical assessments. Presence of active hepatitis B or C, or HIV infection. Presence of positive CONVENTIONAL autoimmune serologic tests, e.g., ANA, RF, AntiRo, AntiLA, AntiRNP, AntiJo1. History of reaction to murinederived products or any of the trial medications, or prior exposures to humanmurine chimeric antibodies. Malignancy, excluding basal or squamous cell skin cancer and lowrisk prostate cancer, defined as stage T1 or T2a with PSA less than 10 ng/dl. Unwillingness to complete posttreatment surveillance for 9 months. Diagnosis of major morbidities (aside from IPF) expected to interfere with subjects' study participation for 9 months. Treatment for &gt;5 days within the preceding month with &gt;10 mg. prednisone (or equivalent corticosteroid) or any treatment during the preceding month with a potent cellular immunosuppressant (e.g., cyclophosphomide, methotrexate, mycophenolate, azathioprine, calcineurin inhibitors, etc.). Uncontrolled diabetes or hypertension that preclude safe treatment with methylprednisolone. Concurrent participation in other experimental trials. Pregnancy or unwillingness to use contraception during the duration of the study among female participants with childbearing potential. Ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) &lt;70% of predicted values.</criteria>
