	<brief_summary>The objective of the trial is to compare the lung function profile of once daily treatment with tiotropium+olodaterol FDC [2.5/ 5µg and 5/ 5µg] delivered by the RESPIMAT with the lung function profile of twice daily treatment with fluticasone propionate+salmeterol FDC [250/50µg and 500/50µg] delivered by the Accuhaler® after 6 weeks of treatment.</brief_summary>
