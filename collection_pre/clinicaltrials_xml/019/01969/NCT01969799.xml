	<brief_title>Aerosolized Amikacin and Fosfomycin in Mechanically Ventilated Patients With Gram-negative Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the amikacin fosfomycin inhalation system (AFIS). AFIS consists of amikacin solution and fosfomycin solution, delivered by aerosol to the lungs via the PARI Investigational eFlow Inline System (eFlow Inline System). All patients will receive a standardized course of intravenous (IV) antibiotics for a minimum of 7 days. Patients will be randomized to receive 10 days of treatment with either AFIS or placebo, in addition to the IV therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint is defined as the change from baseline in the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) during the randomized course of study drug.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males and nonpregnant, nonlactating females, ≥ 18 years and ≤ 80 years of age Intubated and mechanically ventilated Diagnosis of pneumonia, defined as presence of a new or progressive infiltrate(s) on the most recent chest radiograph prior to screening, as determined by the treating physician Signs of infection (within 24 hours prior to screening): 1. Fever (&gt; 38ºC or &gt; 100.4ºF); or 2. Leukopenia (&lt; 4,000 WBC/mm3) or leukocytosis (≥ 12,000 WBC/mm3) Impaired oxygenation (within 24 hours prior to screening): a. PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 350 mmHg Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score &gt; 10 (within 24 hours prior to screening) Presence, or high suspicion, of Gramnegative organism(s) by either Gram stain or culture of respiratory secretions from a sample obtained within the previous 7 days (enrollment can occur before culture results are available) History of hypersensitivity to amikacin, other aminoglycosides, fosfomycin, imipenem, meropenem, or colistin Received systemic antibiotic therapy for this episode of Gramnegative pneumonia for greater than 72 hours at the time of randomization PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 100 mmHg and diffuse infiltrates on Chest Xray Refractory septic shock (severe sepsis plus unstable hypotension, in spite of adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressors) Any of the following conditions that interfere with the assessment or interpretation of the diagnosis or response to therapy: 1. chest trauma with ongoing loss of stability of the thoracic cage following a fracture of the sternum, ribs, or both; 2. increased amounts of fluid in the lung cavities requiring chest tube drainage; 3. lung cancer within the last 2 years; 4. lung abscess(s); 5. anatomical bronchial obstruction; 6. suspected atypical pneumonia; 7. chemical pneumonitis (e.g., inhalation injury); 8. cystic fibrosis Immunocompromised patients, including those with neutropenia NOT due to the current infection (absolute neutrophil count &lt; 500/mm3), leukemia, lymphoma, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with CD4 count &lt; 200 cells/mm3, or splenectomy; those who are early posttransplantation (&lt; 3 months posttransplant, or &gt; 3 months posttransplant with evidence of organ rejection by clinical criteria, pathologic confirmation, or modification of immunosuppression within the past 4 weeks), are on cytotoxic chemotherapy, or are on highdose steroids (e.g., &gt; 40 mg of prednisone or its equivalent [&gt; 160 mg hydrocortisone, &gt; 32 mg methylprednisolone, &gt; 6 mg dexamethasone, &gt; 200 mg cortisone] daily for &gt; 2 weeks) Evidence of significant renal impairment (serum creatinine &gt; 4.0 mg/dL within 24 hours prior to screening). If serum creatinine is &gt;2.0 mg/dL, site must be capable of performing continuous renal replacement therapy, if clinically indicated. Patients with serum creatinine &gt; 4.0 mg/dL and being treated with continuous renal replacement therapy (continuous venousvenous hemofiltration or continuous venousvenous hemodialysis) or chronic hemodialysis are eligible Evidence of ototoxicity (history of hearing aid use prior to current hospitalization) Evidence of hepatotoxicity (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] or aspartate aminotransferase [AST] &gt;3X the upper limit of normal value within 24 hours prior to screening) Positive urine and/or serum betahCG pregnancy test (only in women of reproductive age) On mechanical ventilation for &gt; 28 days Glasgow Coma Scale score =3 at Screening Participating in or has participated in other investigational interventional studies (drug or device) within the last 30 days (or 5 times the halflife of the previously administered investigational compound, whichever is longer) prior to study treatment</criteria>
