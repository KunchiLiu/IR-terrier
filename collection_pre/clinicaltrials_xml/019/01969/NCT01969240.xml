	<brief_summary>Our long-term goal is to promote evidence-based patient-centered evaluation in the acute setting to more closely tailor testing to disease risk. To compare the use of risk stratification tools with usual clinical approaches to treatment selection or administration, we propose the following: 1. Test if Chest Pain Choice safely improves validated patient-centered outcome measures in a pragmatic parallel patient randomized trial. Hypothesis: The intervention will significantly increase patient knowledge, engagement, and satisfaction with no increase in adverse events. 2. Test if the decision aid has an effect on healthcare utilization within 30 days after enrollment. Hypothesis: The intervention will significantly reduce the rate of hospital admission, rate of cardiac testing, and total healthcare utilization.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. 18+ years of age (at least 18). 2. Admitted to emergency department for chest pain. 3. Being considered by the treating clinician for admission for cardiac testing. 1. Ischemic changes on the electrocardiogram not known to be old as determined by the treating clinician in real time. 2. Elevated cardiac troponin (cTn) above the 99th percentile reference limit. 3. Known coronary artery disease as defined by consensus guidelines on risk stratification studies for ED patients with potential ACS (â‰¥ 50% stenosis on cardiac catheterization; prior electrocardiographic changes indicative of ischemia, e.g., STsegment depression, Twave inversion, or left bundle branch block; perfusion defects or wall motion abnormalities on previous exercise, pharmacological, or rest imaging studies; previous documentation of acute myocardial infarction; or, if no records are available, patient selfreport of coronary artery disease). 4. Cocaine use within the previous 72 hours by clinician history. 5. Pregnancy. 6. Referral to the emergency department by a personal physician for admission. 7. Patients who indicate that a hospital different than the site hospital is his or her "hospital of choice" in the event of a return ED visit. 8. Patients undergoing medical clearance for a detox center or any involuntary court or magistrate order. 9. Homelessness, outoftown residence or other condition known to preclude followup. 10. Patients in police custody or currently incarcerated individuals. 11. Patients who have, in their clinician's best judgment, major communication barriers such as visual or hearing impairment or dementia that would compromise their ability to give written informed consent (or use the decision aid).</criteria>
