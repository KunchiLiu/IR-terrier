	<brief_summary>This pilot study will adapt and test the feasibility and estimate the effect size parameters of Kazakhstani Family Together (KFT), a family-based multi-media intervention designed to reduce sexual and drug-related risks for HIV infection among at-risk 14-17 year old females and males living in communities highly affected by heroin trade and use in Almaty, Kazakhstan.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to adapt an evidence-based HIV and substance use prevention intervention for most at-risk adolescents and their caregivers (parents or other adult family members) from drug-risk communities in Kazakhstan. Located on major drug trafficking routes (between Afghanistan, the world's largest opium producer, and Russia), Central Asia and Kazakhstan, in particular, face one of the fastest growing rates of HIV infection in the world disproportionately affecting young people ages 15-29. Youth exposed to drugs at home and in the community are particularly at risk. The country's HIV prevention efforts for youth are limited to a knowledge-based approach, which does not equip at-risk youth with skills required to deal with situations of risk exposure. Parents or other caregivers, who represent a significant protective force in a family-oriented culture of Central Asia, are largely excluded from youth prevention efforts in Kazakhstan. KFT is a family-based multi-media intervention designed to reduce sexual and drug-related risks for HIV infection among at-risk adolescents. To address the dual risk of HIV and substance use, the proposed intervention combines empirically tested skills-based and family involvement approaches and utilizes multi-media computer technology to develop an engaging and potentially cost-effective tool with high fidelity and easy scalability. During each of the sessions, youth and caregivers will participate in interactive computer activities to learn skills and have conversations focused on risky behaviors. During the development stage, the US and Kazakhstani investigative team will conduct formative research and will work closely with the local Community Collaborative Board to adapt the intervention to the cultural context of at-risk families in Kazakhstan. Further, the KFT intervention will be tested in a pilot Randomized Controlled Trial with 248 adolescents and 248 of their caregivers. Intervention arm adolescent-caregiver pairs will receive three 45-minute interactive multi-media sessions with avatars customized to participants' gender that will focus on risk reduction self-efficacy, resistance to peer pressure, and caregiver-adolescent communication, support and monitoring. Adolescents from both intervention and control arms will receive the usual care services available for at-risk youth, which includes health education sessions on HIV and drug use delivered by peer educators and outreach workers.</detailed_description>
