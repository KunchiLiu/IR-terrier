	<brief_summary>Maintaining the patency of upper airway in sedated and anesthetized patients is challenging especially when patients are ready to be weaned from mechanical ventilation. Impairment of airway patency is a common cause of extubation failure and opioids and hypnotics can adversely affect airway patency. Ketamine, a noncompetitive antagonist of N-methyl-D- aspartate (NMDA), unlike other anesthetics activates respiratory effort and promotes bronchodilation. At subanesthetic plasma concentration, ketamine reduces both opioid and propofol requirements. Recent animal data suggests that when added to propofol in a sedation regimen, ketamine decreased hypoventilation when compared to propofol alone because ketamine can increase genioglossus phasic activity while abolishing the coupling between loss of consciousness and upper airway dilator muscle activity. However, this relationship has not been examined in human in combination of other drugs. The purpose of this pharmaco-physiological interaction trial is to evaluate the effects of ketamine on breathing and electroencephalography in mechanical ventilated patients. Spirometry will be utilized to evaluate upper airway patency. Polysomnography (PSG- Alice PDx) will be used to evaluate the effects of ketamine on EEG during wakefulness and sleep. An esophageal balloon will be inserted to measure esophageal pressure, which enables us to measure the effects of ketamine on transpulmonary pressure. A volumetric capnography, NICO noninvasive device from Respironics will be used to measure anatomical dead space, CO2 production, mean expiratory CO2 and slope of the alveolar plateau of the volumetric capnogram</brief_summary>
