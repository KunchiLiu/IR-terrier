	<brief_summary>Over the past few years, several studies have been made on various outcomes about the incidence of lymphedema. Because the outcomes can be came out differently each study by measurement, criteria, treatment period, treatment method and morbid extremities of lymphedema. Therefore it is required for understanding about the incidence, risk factor and physical progress for to be treated and prevented of lymphedema. Also it is necessary that to understand characteristics of lymphedema measurements and to establish diagnostic criteria of lymphedema through comparative study. The aim of this study was to analyze the incidence and risk factor of lymphedema through prospectively observation, and to determine effects on the quality of life of lymphedema after breast cancer surgery with ALND.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Observational Study of Lymphedema in Breast Cancer With Axillary Lymph Node Dissection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives: - To analyze incidence rate of lymphedema using tape measurements, perometre, bioimpedance, spectroscopy. Secondary Objectives: - To determine the risk factor of lymphedema in postoperative breast cancer. - To understand that lymphedema has an effect on quality of life and physical function in postoperative breast cancer. - To complete uestionnaire about physical and quality of life in postoperative breast cancer with ALND patients.</detailed_description>
