	<brief_summary>This is an open-label multicenter, study to assess the pharmacokinetic interaction of ketoconazole with ABT-199 in up to 12 subjects with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Effect of Ketoconazole on the Metabolism of ABT-199</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1 study designed to assess how the body processes the study drug ABT-199 when taken alone and in combination with ketoconazole and to assess the safety of ABT-199 in combination with ketoconazole. Subjects may enroll in a separate extension study to continue receiving ABT-199 after completion of this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject must have relapsed or refractory nonHodgkin's lymphoma. Subject must have histologically documented diagnosis of nonHodgkin's lymphoma as defined by a Bcell neoplasm in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification scheme except as noted in the exclusion criteria. Subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 0 to 2. Subject must have adequate bone marrow (independent of growth factor support per local laboratory reference range), coagulation, renal and hepatic function: Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1000/µL (without growth factor support unless neutropenia is clearly due to underlying disease); Platelets greater than or equal to 75,000/mm3 (unless thrombocytopenia is clearly due to diseaserelated immune thrombocytopenia or to underlying disease; entry platelet count must be independent of transfusion within 14 days of Screening); Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.0 g/dL (unless anemia is clearly due to underlying disease; entry hemoglobin must be independent of transfusion within 14 days of Screening); If cytopenias are present, no evidence of myelodysplastic syndrome or hypoplastic bone marrow; Subject must have activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin time (PT) not to exceed 1.5 × the upper normal limit (ULN); Calculated creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 50 mL/min using a 24hour urine collection for creatinine clearance or per the CockcroftGault equation; Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less than or equal to 3.0 × ULN of institution's normal range; Bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 × ULN. Subjects with Gilbert's Syndrome may have a bilirubin greater than 1.5 × ULN per discussion with the AbbVie medical monitor. Subject has been diagnosed with PostTransplant Lymphoproliferative Disease (PTLD), Burkitt's lymphoma, Burkittlike lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Subject is receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV (due to potential drugdrug interactions between antiretroviral medications and ABT199, as well as anticipated ABT199 mechanism based lymphopenia that may potentially increase the risk of opportunistic infections). Subject has hypersensitivity to ketoconazole. Subject has a cardiovascular disability status of New York Heart Association Class greater than or equal to 2. Class 2 is defined as cardiac disease in which patients are comfortable at rest but ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitations, dyspnea or anginal pain. Subject has a significant history of renal, neurologic, psychiatric, endocrinologic, metabolic, immunologic, cardiovascular, or hepatic disease within the past 6 months that in the opinion of the investigator would adversely affect his/her participating in this study. Subject has malabsorption syndrome or other condition which precludes enteral route of administration (e.g., prior surgical resection). Subject has undergone an allogeneic stem cell transplant.</criteria>
