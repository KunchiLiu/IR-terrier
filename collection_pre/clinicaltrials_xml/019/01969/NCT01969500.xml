	<brief_summary>The goal of the proposed project is to develop and pilot a mobile Self-Management of Schizophrenia (SOS) system that will administer interventions targeting persistent symptoms of psychosis, social dysfunction, and poor medication adherence, with the long-term goal of creating a widely-available system that can be deployed by users as needed, in their own environments. The hypothesis is that this intervention group will show stronger improvement in the areas of psychiatric systems, social function, and medication adherence compared to treatment as usual.</brief_summary>
