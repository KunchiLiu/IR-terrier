	<brief_title>A Study of PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) Versus Rituximab in Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Leukemia/Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (individuals assigned to study treatment by chance), open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known) study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib versus rituximab in adult Asia Pacific region patients with relapsed/refractory CLL or SLL with active disease requiring treatment who have failed at least 1 prior line of therapy and are not considered appropriate candidates for treatment or retreatment with purine analog-based therapy. Approximately 150 patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:2 ratio into 2 treatment arms to receive either intravenous rituximab (Treatment Arm A) for 6 cycles or oral ibrutinib (Treatment Arm B) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first. The study will include screening, treatment, and follow-up phases. Treatment will extend from randomization until study drug discontinuation. Follow-up will consist of 2 phases: post-treatment (from the discontinuation of treatment for reasons other than disease progression until the patient has progressive disease) and post-disease progression (subsequent anticancer therapy and survival status will be recorded until death, lost to follow-up, consent withdrawal, or study closure). Patients in the rituximab arm with disease progression or who meet the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) criteria for requiring subsequent anti-CLL therapy may be considered for cross over to receive ibrutinib 420 mg orally, daily until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal from study, or until study end whichever occurs earliest. Efficacy evaluations will assess for disease response and progression in accordance with International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia 2008 criteria. Serial pharmacokinetic (study of what a drug does to the body) blood samples will be collected in the ibrutinib treatment group. Safety will be assessed throughout the study.</detailed_description>
