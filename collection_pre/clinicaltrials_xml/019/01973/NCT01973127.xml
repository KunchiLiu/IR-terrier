	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on the right side of the head will make craving towards alcohol less severe in recently detoxified alcohol addicted patients. Although there are successful treatment option to detoxify patients form their alcohol use, many patients tend to relapse. This relapse is mainly caused by a high level of (uncontrollable) craving towards alcohol. This aspect of addiction is with the existing options hard to treat, there is a great need of new successful treatment modalities. rTMS is a FDA approved treatment method for depression. Recently some small scale studies have shown promising results on rTMS in the treatment of addiction. In this study the investigators focus on alcohol addiction since it is the addiction with the highest morbidity and mortality in the Netherlands.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this study the investigators focus on three levels of interest: the biological level, the functional level and the clinical level. The investigators will measure the effect of rTMS directly on brain activity through EEG recording. The investigators investigate its effects on cognitive performance through the use of neuropsychological computer tasks. The investigators will address clinical behavior (craving and alcohol use) with questionnaires.</detailed_description>
