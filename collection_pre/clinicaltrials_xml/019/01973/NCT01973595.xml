	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether incorporating almonds into the diets of families with young children will induce beneficial changes in gastrointestinal function, the fecal microbiota profile, and immune and inflammatory processes of the adults and children resulting in improved quality of life. The investigators anticipate finding an increase in beneficial bacteria, improved intestinal function, and decreased inflammation during the almond intervention.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, crossover study. After obtaining informed consent, healthy adults aged 18-40 years with children aged 3-6 years will be randomized to either consume almonds and almond paste during the first arm of the study or during the second arm of the study. During the intervention period, adult participants will consume 1.5 ounces of almonds per day, and children will consume 0.5 ounces of almonds per day for 3 weeks. After a 4-week washout period, participants will be crossed to the other treatment (no almond consumption or almond consumption). Participants will complete daily questionnaires throughout the intervention period, and one week before and after each intervention period. Blood samples will be collected from adults at the baseline and final time points of each intervention. Stool samples will be collected during the pre-baseline and final weeks of each intervention. Dietary intake will be assessed weekly during each intervention period. Gastrointestinal symptoms questionnaires will be completed weekly during each intervention.</detailed_description>
