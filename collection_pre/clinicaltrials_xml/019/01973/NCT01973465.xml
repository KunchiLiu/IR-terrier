	<brief_summary>This study was developed in response to the July, 2013 FDA draft guidance regarding FMT for CDI. The weight of the evidence in the literature suggests that FMT is the most effective treatment for ambulatory outpatients affected by recurrent CDI who fail conventional therapy. The anticipated benefits to research patients enrolled in this study include resolution of chronic diarrhea, return of bowel habits and nutritional status to normal, and resolution of chronic recurrent CDI. FMT involves the endoscopic instillation of freshly obtained stool with millions of live bacteria into the recipient's colon by endoscopic lavage. With any endoscopic procedure, there is a risk of perforated viscous. This is very rare, but the risk is increased with severe CDI. The risk of acquisition of communicable enteric or blood borne pathogen appears to be negligible.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patients &gt; 18 years of age 2. The patient has been treated with appropriate antimicrobial therapy for CDI. 3. The patient has documented relapse/recurrence of infection as demonstrated by positive stool culture, or cytotoxin assay, or PCR toxin assay. 4. Since this study does not involve treatments that have potential teratogenicity, and in general avoidance of antimicrobial treatment during pregnancy is advised (metronidazole is pregnancy category C), women of childbearing age may be included in the study. Patients will be excluded from study participation if one of the following categories of exclusion criteria applies: 1. Patient is &lt; 18 years of age 2. Patient has an absolute neutrophil count &lt; 750 cells/mm3. Stool donors must: 1. be &gt; 18 years of age 2. Complete a screening questionnaire: a. Onetime donors: Table 1 b. Designated, prescreened donors: Table 2 3. Be tested for communicable bloodborne and enteric pathogens: 1. Onetime donors: Table 3 2. Designated, prescreened donors: Table 4 Table 1: Questionnaire to screen onetime stool donors prior to FMT. You have been identified as a potential stool donor by __________________ , your (spouse/ son/ daughter/ mother/ father/ life partner), who has been referred for fecal transplantation. Prior to performing the transplantation procedure, the OSF/Saint Francis Medical Center Infection Control Committee requires completion of a screening questionnaire by all potential stool donors: Your name: ___________________________________________ Date: ___/___/ 2013 Your relationship to the patient: ___________________________ YES / NO 1. Have you ever been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile colitis? 2. Are you currently taking antibiotic medications? 3. Have you been prescribed antibiotics in the past six weeks? IF the potential stool donor answers YES to questions 1, 2, or 3 please STOP.
