	<brief_summary>Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI), first described by Albright in 1942, is defined as an increase in Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), an insufficiency of the ovarian function leading to an early menopause (&lt;40 years of age).Today, only 35% of POI's etiology can be explained. Causes enlightening POI may be enumerated as follows, according to their frequency: genetic mutations, autoimmune defects and abnormalities detected on the X chromosome.The purpose of the study is to determine the frequency of the genetic abnormalities and polymorphisms described above in the POI Turkish population</brief_summary>
