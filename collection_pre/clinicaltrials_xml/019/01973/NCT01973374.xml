	<brief_summary>Maternal diabetes in pregnancy can negatively impact fetal well-being and contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Much of the morbidity associated with diabetes in pregnancy can be minimized with tight glucose control. A number of studies in non-pregnant populations have highlighted the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of text messaging interventions for improving diabetic compliance and control. This study will investigate whether a text messaging intervention is feasible and effective in an urban, diabetic, obstetric clinic and whether this intervention can improve compliance with diabetes care, glucose control and pregnancy outcomes. The study will also assess satisfaction with the intervention itself.</brief_summary>
