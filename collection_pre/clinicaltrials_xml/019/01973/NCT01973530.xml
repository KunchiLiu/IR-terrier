	<brief_summary>We hypothesize continuous adductor canal block with steroid adjuvant would offer no inferior analgesics and rehabilitation ability than continuous femoral nerve block for postoperative patients receiving total knee arthroplasty.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Femoral Nerve Catheter and Adductor Canal Block With Steroid Adjuvant in Total Knee Replacement (TKR)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 80 patients who will undergo total knee arthroplasty will be randomized into two groups: Treatment groups Treatment details Femoral Group (40 patients) Continuous femoral nerve block (bolus: 0.5% Ropivacaine 10-15 ml ; infusion of 0.15 % Ropivacaine 4-6ml/h) Adductor Group (40 patients) Adductor canal block with steroid adjuvant (bolus: 0.5% Ropivacaine 10-15ml; Dexamethasone 4mg) (Total 80 patients will be recruited) - All patients will receive single shot tibial nerve block with local anaesthetics (0.5% Ropivacaine 5-8ml) before surgery for analgesia of posterior knee. - All patients will receive the same preemptive and postoperative multimodal medications for perioperative analgesia. - All groups will receive standardized method of spinal anaesthesia and standardized method of intraoperative sedation for the surgery. - Intravenous patient controlled analgesia (PCA) with morphine will be given for 48h to patient as rescue analgesia.</detailed_description>
