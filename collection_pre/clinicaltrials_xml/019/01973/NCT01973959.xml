	<brief_summary>Anaesthesiology plays a key role in promoting safe perioperative care. This includes the perioperative phase in the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) where problems with incomplete information transfer may have a negative impact on patient safety and can lead to patient harm. The objective of this study is to analyse information transfer during postoperative handovers in the PACU. With a self-developed checklist information transfer during postoperative handovers will be documented and subsequently compared with patient information in anaesthesia records.</brief_summary>
