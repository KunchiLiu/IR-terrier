	<detailed_description>Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) has been determined, up to 10 patients may be enrolled in the cohort-expansion phase to better characterize the safety, tolerability and PK of vantictumab combined with paclitaxel. Up to approximately 34 patients may be enrolled into the study.</detailed_description>
