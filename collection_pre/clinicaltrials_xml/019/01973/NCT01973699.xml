	<brief_summary>Adequate visualization during shoulder arthroscopy is of great importance for the procedure to be efficiently and effectively performed. The use of dilute epinephrine in irrigation fluid has been historically utilized to help with visualization. Given the potential safety issues documented in the literature related to epinephrine use, as well as the significant improvements in technique and instrumentation over the last decade, the need for this additive should be reexamined. The objective of the current study was to compare surgeon determined visualization in shoulder arthroscopy using irrigation fluid with and without epinephrine.</brief_summary>
