	<brief_summary>The present study aims to investigate whether the dosage of the GnRH agonist used for triggering final oocyte maturation affects the maturity of the oocytes retrieved in high risk for OHSS patients undergoing ovarian stimulation for IVF using GnRH antagonists and recombinant FSH.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Optimal Dose of GnRH Agonist for Triggering Final Oocyte Maturation in High Risk OHSS Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Three different doses of GnRH agonist (0.1mg, 0.2mg or 0.4 mg) will be used randomly to trigger final oocyte maturation. The primary outcome measure will be the percentage of mature oocytes retrieved. Secondary outcomes will include: number of oocytes retrieved, oocyte recovery rate (number of oocytes retrieved/ number of follicles &gt;11mm in diameter on the day of triggering), fertilization rates and OHSS occurrence. Serum LH, FSH, E2, PRG levels will be assessed at 8-36 hours following agonist administration and on days 3-4-7-10 after triggering final oocyte maturation.</detailed_description>
