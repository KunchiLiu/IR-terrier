	<criteria>Confirmed diagnosis of GHD (growth hormone deficiency) as defined by two different GH (growth hormone) stimulation tests, peak GH level below or equal to 7.0 ng/ml. For children with three or more pituitary hormone deficiencies only one GH stimulation test will be needed. If in accordance with country specific practice, growth hormone deficiency can be defined by only one GH stimulation test, peak GH level below or equal to 7.0 ng/ml. Prepubertal children at screening. Boys: Tanner stage 1 and age above or equal to 6 years and below 13 years. Girls: Tanner stage 1 and age above or equal to 6 years and below 12 years Body weight above or equal to 16.0 kg and below or equal to 50.0 kg Stable GH replacement treatment for at least 3 months History or presence of malignancy Overt diabetes mellitus (fasting blood glucose above or equal to 7.0 mmol/l)</criteria>
