	<brief_summary>The IUB (Intrauterine ball) is a copper releasing intrauterine contraceptive device consisting of copper beads on a flexible NiTinol wire. It was designed to reduce the pain and bleeding caused by traditional T-shaped copper IUDs and to reduce expulsions. In an initial pilot of 15 women, there were no complications during the 12 months. This observational pilot study of 50 women will determine that the early expulsion rate is not greater than 10% and that there is patient and physician acceptance, so that we can plan a larger randomized controlled trial for efficacy and safety.</brief_summary>
