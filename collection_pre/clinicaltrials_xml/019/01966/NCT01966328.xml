	<brief_title>A Safety and Efficacy Assessment of Resolvine for Treatment of Vitreomacular Attachment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research is studying the effect that Resolvine injection will have on patients with vitreomacular adhesion. The investigators propose that intravitreal injection of Resolvine® 36% will: 1)Result in release of the vitreous adhesion to the macula in subjects with symptomatic vitreomacular attachment (VMA). 2)The Release of the VMA will create a measurable and favorable retinal change. 3) The release of vitreomacular traction may also result in visual acuity improvement within the short time frame of this study.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Male or female subjects, 18 years of age or older 2. Willing and able to return for all study visits 3. Willing and able to provide written informed consent 4. Have symptomatic VMA. 5. If both eyes are found to have Anatomic VMA the eye with lower visual acuity will be declared the study eye. 1. Subjects with high myopia in the study eye (axial length greater than or equal to 26.0 millimeters by ultrasound or spherical equivalent at the spectacle plane greater than 8.0 diopters) 2. Subjects who have monocular vision or contralateral vision of 20/400 or worse BCVA in the nonstudy eye 3. Subjects with a history of retinal detachment or tear in the study eye 4. Subjects who have PVD in the study eye at Baseline (Grade III or greater PVD by Bscan) 5. Subjects with unstable IOP (i.e. &gt; 30 mmHg in the past six months) or IOP of &gt; 21 mm Hg at enrollment, under medical control. Subjects may be on topical medications to control their IOP but may not stop or start a prostaglandin type or epinephrine based drug during the study. 6. Subjects with an aphakic study eye or if pseudophakic, cataract extraction surgery less than 6 months prior to study enrollment 7. Subjects with a history of ocular trauma of any type in the study eye 8. Subjects with media opacities or abnormalities that would preclude observation of the retina in the study eye per the investigator's judgment 9. Subjects that have undergone any previous vitrectomy (either anterior or pars plana vitrectomy) in the study eye 10. Subjects with a history of cataract surgery complications in the study eye 11. Subjects that have undergone previous photocoagulation of the retina in the study eye 12. Subjects with any evidence or history of either nonproliferative or proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) or (PDR) in the study eye 13. Subjects with an anticipated need for cataract extraction in the study eye within the next 6 months 14. Subjects with congenital eye malformations 15. Subjects with recurrent uveitis or history of uveitis in either eye 16. Subjects with ongoing ocular infection or inflammation in the study eye 17. Subjects who are pregnant or nursing. Subjects of child bearing ages will undergo pregnancy testing. 18. Subjects that are currently participating in any other investigational research study 19. Subjects who are too ill to be likely to complete the entire study 20. Subjects who have undergone major surgery within the last 6 months (systemic or ocular) or who are likely to require major surgery in the upcoming 6 months 21. Subjects who are uncontrolled diabetics (HbA1/C &gt; 10%) with significant morphological pathology at the time of enrollment 22. Subjects with macular holes Stage 2 or greater as determined by OCT, Bscan ultrasound and clinical examination 23. Subjects with epiretinal membrane (ERM) at the area of attachment as determined by OCT 24. Subjects that have received other intravitreal injection therapy within thirty (30) days of treatment with Resolvine® 25. Subjects that have received more than one Jetrea injection in the study eye</criteria>
