	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness and Safety of CNTO6785 in Patients With Moderate to Severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, randomized (study medication is assigned by chance), placebo-controlled (effect of the study medication will be compared with the effect of placebo [inactive substance]), double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives), parallel-group study (each group of participants will be treated at the same time). This study consists of 3 phases: a screening phase (within 3 weeks prior to the start of study medication), a treatment phase (12 weeks), and a follow-up phase (12 weeks after the last administration of study medication). Approximately 170 participants will be enrolled in this study to receive CNTO6785 or placebo in 1:1 ratio. Safety will be evaluated by the assessment of adverse events, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram, physical examination, early detection of active tuberculosis, and clinical laboratory tests which will be monitored throughout the study. The total duration of study participation for a participant will be 30 weeks.</detailed_description>
