	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to develop, evaluate, and optimize an interactive website (the SMART portal). The SMART portal will use IBD-specific and general assessments and interventions to reduce the burden of common barriers to treatment adherence and enhance self-management skills. This study aims to build and revise the SMART portal according to feedback and testing from participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Self-Management Assistance for Recommended Treatment (SMART) Portal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consists of three phases for development and evaluation of the SMART portal. Phase 1 is the development of online assessments and intervention components. There will be no participant interaction with the portal during Phase 1. Phase 2 will consist of one, individual interview with patients, caregivers, and clinicians/nurses to interact with a portal prototype and provide feedback. Phase 3 will contain an open trial for patients and caregivers with baseline, 2-6 months interacting with the portal and progressing through applicable intervention components, and post-treatment. Patient test data will also be loaded into the portal during Phase 3 for clinicians/nurses to interact with for 2-6 months. Feedback from all users will be collected at post-treatment for optimization of the portal.</detailed_description>
