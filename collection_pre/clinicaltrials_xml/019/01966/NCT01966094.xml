	<brief_summary>It is estimated that over 1 million people in the United States have HIV infection. While HIV is treatable, there are still high rates of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). HAND is defined by low scores on memory testing. To meet the criteria for HAND, an HIV-infected individual has to have a low score on at least two different memory tests. It is estimated that 20-50% of people living with HIV have HAND. It is therefore still a common problem. While individuals with HAND typically improve on antiretroviral therapy for HIV, often this improvement is incomplete. Also, there are over 20 antiretroviral medications approved for HIV in the US. It is not clear if the specific choice of antiretroviral medication makes a difference in the improvement of HAND. The investigators have designed a small preliminary study in which subjects with and without HAND who have never been on treatment for HIV or have been off treatment for at least 6 months are followed for the first 12 months after starting antiretroviral therapy.The investigators will enroll a maximum of 46 subjects (23 subjects in each arm). Subjects will also be followed by their primary HIV medical provider. For the study, subjects will be followed for 48 weeks. There are three followup visits: 12 weeks, 24 weeks, and 48 weeks. Memory testing will be performed at baseline and each followup visit. Blood will also be taken at baseline and the three followup visits to measure changes in inflammation. A lumbar puncture will be performed at baseline and at 24 weeks to measure changes in inflammation and amount of HIV virus in the spinal fluid. There is also an optional lumbar puncture at the last study visit of 48 weeks</brief_summary>
