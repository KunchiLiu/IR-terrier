	<detailed_description>A recent review has moreover suggested that the content (the mental and physical demand or challenge, and the behavioral aspects of the activity) and the context (the social context) of activities are key elements when distinguishing various types. Social activity affects wellbeing or survival by reducing the risks of social isolation and by supplying emotional intimacy, socio-emotional support, reinforcement for one's self-concept and social roles, and the sense of being valued. On the other hand, productive activity may influence health and wellbeing through satisfaction with outcomes, economic gains, mental stimulation, comforting personal routines, sense of purpose, and increased self-efficacy or self-esteem. There are significant relationships between QoL and attitudes toward aging in older adults. It has been in fact demonstrated that a proactive attitude (i.e., exercise, planning ahead, and marshaling support) influences QoL outcomes (i.e., depressive symptomatology and social activities). Evidence has moreover shown that exist gender differences in engage physical activities and in mood state in ageing. In fact, aged women are less engaged in physical activity than men, probably due to menopausal transition (MT) state. Literature has suggested that women who experience longer MT and increased symptoms have higher stress and increased risk of depression , that in turn may affect their engagement in physical activities. Starting from current literature, we hypothesize that specific physical activity, WBV, may promote psychological well being and quality of life in female aged subjects. Moreover and therefore, we assume an improvement in proactive attitude and happiness when compared to and Multi-component training control group.</detailed_description>
