	<brief_summary>Succinylcholine is commonly used for neuromuscular relaxation for short procedures such as rigid bronchoscopy. A alternative is the application of low dose mivacurium, reversed with neostigmine. The investigators compare the intubating conditions, incidence of postoperative myalgia (POM), patient satisfaction and the postoperative performance with respiration exercise device for these two muscle relaxants.</brief_summary>
