	<detailed_description>The study was performed as a randomized, multicentre, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel-group, phase III trial with BF-200 ALA and placebo in seven centres in Germany. A total of 94 patients were screened in this study; 87 were randomized (55 patients received BF-200 ALA, 32 received placebo). Patients received one PDT.
