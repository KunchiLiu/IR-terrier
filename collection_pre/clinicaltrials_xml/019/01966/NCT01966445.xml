	<brief_summary>Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 3 (HER3) expression is seen across a wide variety of solid malignancies and is associated with poor prognosis. Up-regulation of HER3 expression and activity is also associated with resistance to multiple pathway inhibitors. GSK2849330, a monoclonal antibody targeting HER3, is a new agent for subjects whose tumors express HER3. This study is a phase I, first time in human, open-label, dose escalation study. The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of GSK2849330 in subjects with advanced HER3-positive solid tumors. The study will be conducted in two parts. Part 1 (Dose-Escalation Phase) will include dose escalation and PK/PD cohorts to evaluate safety, PK, and PD to guide selection of dose regimen(s) for Part 2. In Part 2 (Expansion Cohorts), up to 3 cohorts will be enrolled at the dose regimen(s) selected based on Part 1 data, to evaluate safety in a larger cohort of subjects at the recommended dose regimen and also to evaluate preliminary evidence of clinical benefit.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Males and females &gt;=18 years of age (at the time consent is obtained). Written informed consent provided. Performance Status score of 0 or 1 according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale. Sufficient archival tumor specimen is available for HER3 immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis, or subject is willing to undergo a fresh tumor biopsy for HER3 IHC analysis. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of one of the following solid tumor malignancies for which no standard therapeutic alternatives exist: bladder cancer, breast cancer, castrateresistant prostate cancer, cervical cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC), gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), melanoma, nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, squamous cancers of the head and neck region (including parotid and nasopharynx). Subjects with leptomeningeal or brain metastases or spinal cord compression. Prior HER3 directed treatment (HER2 or EGFRdirected treatment is acceptable). Concurrent medical condition that would jeopardize compliance. Receiving chronic immunosuppressive therapies (includes daily steroid doses in excess of 20 milligrams [mg]/day of prednisone).</criteria>
