	<brief_title>The Synergy Trial: Methylphenidate Plus a CFS-Specific Nutrient Formula as a Treatment for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Synergy Trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a currently available medication (methylphenidate) combined with a CFS-specific dietary supplement (CFS Nutrient Formula) to treat Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). The CFS Nutrient Formula to be used in this trial is a broad-spectrum micronutrient supplement that provides CFS patients with vitamins, minerals, and other cofactors (amino acids, antioxidants, and mitochondrial cofactors) to complement the low-dose Central Nervous System (CNS) stimulant (methylphenidate). In other words, therapeutic dosages of micronutrients are provided to support the functioning of the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems to a level at which a lower than customary dosage of methylphenidate can produce positive clinical effects on CFS symptoms and also be well tolerated. Methylphenidate is the generic form of Ritalin®. The dose being tested in this study is relatively low (5-10mg twice daily). This drug has been in clinical use for over 50 years for the treatment of Narcolepsy and Attention Deficit Disorder and has a well-described safety profile when used as recommended. Methylphenidate alone has been studied as a treatment for CFS in the past and has been shown to produce mild benefits and be well-tolerated. When provided as innovative therapy, methylphenidate plus this CFS Nutrient Formula has produced substantial improvements in CFS symptoms in a limited number of patients, and demonstrated excellent tolerability. Use of low dose methylphenidate hydrochloride coadministered with a CFS Nutrient Formula has not been previously evaluated in a controlled clinical study. The risk to patients using this combination is believed to be low, especially in the context of a well-controlled clinical study. Furthermore, this combination is not expected to increase the incidence or severity of adverse events associated with methylphenidate hydrochloride.</detailed_description>
