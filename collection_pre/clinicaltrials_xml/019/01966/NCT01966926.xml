	<brief_summary>Scant data have been reported on the effects of weight self-monitoring during weight control. The purpose of this pilot project was to consider the questions: Is it possible to assign participants to engage in daily weight self-monitoring, and are there differential effects on mood of daily versus weekly weighing?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Self-Weighing Instruction Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study tested the feasibility of assigning participants to daily or weekly weighing, monitored adherence to weighing instructions, and tracked additional behavioral and psychosocial indicators over a period of six months. It was hypothesized that there would be no differences in mood or adherence between daily versus weekly weighing conditions. Knowledge about the benefits of frequent self-weighing may shape public health recommendations for regular weighing as a weight reduction or obesity prevention strategy.</detailed_description>
