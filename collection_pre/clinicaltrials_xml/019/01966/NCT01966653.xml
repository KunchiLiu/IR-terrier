	<brief_summary>Developed before the establishment of a structured process for drug assessment, nitrofurantoin is now being prescribed frequently given the rise in multi-resistant gram-negative pathogens. Doubts remain regarding fosfomycin's long-term clinical effectiveness. A randomized, controlled trial is needed to explore the clinical effectiveness and better define the side effect profiles of both nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin. This multi-center open trial will randomize 600 non-pregnant women at three international sites (200 each in Poland, Switzerland, and Israel) at increased risk for carriage of resistant uropathogens and with suspicion of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection to receive either oral nitrofurantoin 100 mg three times daily for 5 days or a single 3g dose of oral fosfomycin. Patients will be followed for clinical and bacteriologic response at days 14 and 28 post therapy completion. The study hypothesis holds that nitrofurantoin will be superior to fosfomycin in clinical efficacy at final follow-up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing Nitrofurantoin to Fosfomycin for Acute Urinary Tract Infection in Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Developed before the establishment of a structured process for drug assessment, nitrofurantoin is now being prescribed frequently given the rise in multi-resistant gram-negative pathogens. Doubts remain regarding fosfomycin's long-term clinical effectiveness. A randomized, controlled trial is needed to explore the clinical effectiveness and better define the side effect profiles of both nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin. From autumn 2013 through summer 2016, this multi-center open trial will randomize 600 non-pregnant women at three international sites (200 each in Poland, Switzerland, and Israel) at increased risk for carriage of resistant uropathogens and with suspicion of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection to receive either oral nitrofurantoin 100 mg three times daily for 5 days or a single 3g dose of oral fosfomycin. Patients will be followed for clinical and bacteriologic response at days 14 and 28 post therapy completion. The study hypothesis holds that nitrofurantoin will be superior to fosfomycin in clinical efficacy at final follow-up.</detailed_description>
