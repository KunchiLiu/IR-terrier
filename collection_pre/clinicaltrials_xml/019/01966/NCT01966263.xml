	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine whether either a femoral nerve block (FNB) or local infiltration analgesia (LIA) is a better anesthetic technique to achieve optimal functional outcome after one year in patients receiving a total knee arthroplasty and following a fast track rehabilitation protocol.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fast Track Total Knee Arthroplasty: Local Infiltration Analgesia vs Femoral Nerve Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For an optimal and fast recovery after total knee arthroplasty (TKA), a fast track rehabilitation protocol has been developed. The literature is not yet conclusive about the optimal anesthestic technique. The optimal technique should support fast mobilization by giving good pain relieve with minimal side effects such as nausea, drowsiness and muscle weakness. If pain relieve is optimal, the patient mobilizes fast and length of stay is shortened. But does fast recovery lead to better functional outcome? The objective of this study is to determine whether either a femoral nerve block (FNB) or local infiltration analgesia (LIA) is a better anesthetic technique to achieve optimal functional outcome after one year in patients receiving a total knee arthroplasty and following a fast track rehabilitation protocol.</detailed_description>
