	<brief_summary>REACH is a prospective, phase I/II open-label dose escalation trial of hydroxyurea for children with confirmed SCA between 12 months and 10 years of age. The short-term goal is to obtain critical pilot data regarding the feasibility, safety, and benefit of hydroxyurea for children with SCA in multiple distinct research settings in Africa. Based on that information, the longer-term goal is to make hydroxyurea more widely available for children with SCA in Africa, particularly those identified with SCA through expanded newborn screening programs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Realizing Effectiveness Across Continents With Hydroxyurea (REACH)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES 1. To assess the feasibility of conducting a prospective research study using hydroxyurea therapy for SCA in sub-Saharan Africa (including adherence to monthly clinic visits and laboratory assessments, and medication compliance) 2. To monitor the safety of hydroxyurea therapy, specifically documenting hematological toxicities (cytopenias) and serious infections (bacterial and malarial) 3. To evaluate the benefits of hydroxyurea therapy, using both laboratory (e.g., fetal hemoglobin, hemoglobin, white blood cell count) and clinical parameters (e.g., pain, hospitalization, growth) 4. To investigate the effects of hydroxyurea dose escalation on laboratory and clinical parameters</detailed_description>
