	<brief_summary>Protease inhibitors (PI) have been associated with an acceleration of bone mineral density loss in HIV-infected individuals because of an enhanced osteoclast activity, although some controversial data have been also published. A first study suggest an increase of bone mineral density after switching from PI to raltegravir, the first generation integrase inhibitor, but there are no more data about this subject. Based on data that PI decrease bone mineral density by accelerating osteoclast cells and that the discontinuation of this drugs could improve bone mineralization, we propose a randomized prospective multicenter study to assess the impact of switching from PI to dolutegravir on bone mineral density in patients with low bone mineral density receiving a PI-containing regimen. At the same time, the study will help to assess the antiviral efficacy and safety of a PI-sparing regimen including dolutegravir as a simplification strategy in virologically suppressed patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multicentre Study To Assess Changes In Bone Mineral Density Of The Switch From Protease Inhibitors To Dolutegravir In HIV-1-Infected Subjects With Low Bone Mineral Density</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The second generation integrase inhibitor dolutegravir has demonstrated good virological and immunological outcomes in antiretroviral-naive subjects, compared with efavirenz, (SPRING 1 study). As well, it is active against HIV strains resistant to first-generation inhibitors raltegravir and elvitegravir in heavily treatment-experienced patients (VIKING study). Additionally, it was safe and well tolerated after two years of use. It is administered once daily with no need for boosting, no food requirements and has a long half-life. The easy posology and its pharmacokinetics, together with the antiviral potency, make this drug a good alternative as a simplification approach. However, no clinical data are available supporting the switch of protease inhibitors or no nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors to dolutegravir in virologically suppressed HIV-treated subjects. Protease inhibitors (PI) have been associated with an acceleration of bone mineral density loss in HIV-infected individuals because of an enhanced osteoclast activity, although some controversial data have been also published. A first study suggest an increase of bone mineral density after switching from PI to raltegravir, the first generation integrase inhibitor, but there are no more data about this subject. Based on data that PI decrease bone mineral density by accelerating osteoclast cells and that the discontinuation of this drugs could improve bone mineralization, we propose a randomized prospective multicenter study to assess the impact of switching from PI to dolutegravir on bone mineral density in patients with low bone mineral density receiving a PI-containing regimen.
