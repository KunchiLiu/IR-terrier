	<brief_summary>Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in 40% of children following heart surgery. Serum creatinine (Scr) is a late biomarker of AKI, rising 24-48 hours after surgery. Thus, for medicines excreted in the urine, AKI could potentially lead to toxic levels in the blood. Urinary biomarkers have the ability to detect AKI earlier. Whether early detection of AKI through urinary biomarkers can predict altered drug levels is unknown. Milrinone is used to improve heart function after surgery, but accumulates in AKI resulting in low blood pressure. Dose adjustments are not currently possible because of the late rise in SCr, and are based on clinical parameters that may lead to clinically relevant over or under-dosing. Thus, this study will address an important knowledge gap being the first to use elevations of AKI biomarker concentrations to anticipate increased milrinone levels.</brief_summary>
