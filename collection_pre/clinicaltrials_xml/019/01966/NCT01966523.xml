	<brief_summary>To conduct a pilot study of cluster randomized clinical trial of an practice intervention to improve the quality of care for suspected lower respiratory and and urinary tract infections among 60 nursing home residents with advanced dementia living in 4 facilities (2 matched intervention/control pairs) for 12 months. We hypothesize that 1. In the intervention compared to the control facilities there will be a trend towards a greater proportion of infections for which antimicrobials were initiated appropriately, and 2. in the intervention compared to the control facilities there will be a trend towards higher proxy satisfaction with decision-making, fewer hospital transfers, and lower antimicrobial exposure.</brief_summary>
