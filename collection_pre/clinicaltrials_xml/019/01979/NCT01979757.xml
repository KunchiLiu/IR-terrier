	<brief_summary>Breast-conserving treatment (BCT) leads to a progressive and deteriorating breast deformity. Fatgrafting is ideal for breast reconstruction after BCT. The most frequently utilized technique for fat processing is centrifugation. The PureGraft device (Cytori Therapeutics, USA) is a new method that involves washing and filtering the fat to prepare the graft. The investigators compared the subjective and objective outcomes of two fat-processing methods, centrifugation and PureGraft filtration. Thirty patients underwent breast reconstruction performed by a single surgeon (OM) after BCT in our department between April 2011 and September 2012. The patients were preoperatively divided into two groups randomly: 15 received fatgrafts processed by centrifugation, and 15 received fatgrafts processed by washing in PureGraft bags. The patients were followed up for 12-30 months.To measure the subjective outcome, the investigators distributed the BREAST-Q questionnaire to all the patients both preoperatively and one year postoperatively. The BCCT.core software evaluated the objective outcome of breast reconstruction by fatgrafting.</brief_summary>
