	<brief_summary>The pathogenesis of AVN includes a defective blood supply to the knee joint. Local nitrates induce peripheral vasodilation and may improve blood supply to the affected tissue. This study aims to test whether the use of a nicotine patch may accelerate the healing process from AVN of the knee.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nitrate Patch Use as Treatment of Knee AVN</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main purpose of this study is to examine whether treatment with a local nitrate patch will improve MRI findings and clinical outcomes in patients with AVN of the knee. This is a double-blind prospective study that will include 50 adult volunteers, randomly assigned to a "nitrate" group that will be given a nitrate patch, and a "placebo" group that will be given a placebo patch. The following outcomes will be measured: - MRI findings before and after the patch treatment - Use of analgesics - Subjective pain relief.</detailed_description>
