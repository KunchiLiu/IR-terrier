	<brief_summary>It was well known that the mirror therapy could decrease pain of upper-limb amputated patients. The mirror therapy is known to make a plastic change some parts of the brain perceiving the painful body part and modulating its signal by feedback of visual information mirrored with the corresponding contra-lateral normal parts. In this study, post-operative analgesic efficiency of the virtual reality using a mirror therapy after total knee arthroplasty will be evaluated. This clinical trial will be performed in the form of prospective, single-blind (i.e. assessor-blind), parallel group, randomized (allocation ratio 1:1), single cohort.</brief_summary>
