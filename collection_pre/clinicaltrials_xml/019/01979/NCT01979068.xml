	<brief_summary>- Vascular Inflammation is a key factor in both the pathogenesis and outcome of atherosclerosis. 18FDG-PET is a promising novel tool for identifying and quantifying vascular inflammation within atherosclerotic plaque - Recently, unique subsets of obese individuals, such as metabolically obese but normal weight (MONW) and metabolically healthy obese (MHO), have been getting an attention - Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the relationship of vascular inflammation,measured by FDG-PET, with various body sized phenotypes</brief_summary>
