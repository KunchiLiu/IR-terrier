	<detailed_description>Patients undergoing laser refractive surgery will will be investigated in means of Pentacam testing and IOL master biometry both preoperative and 6 weeks postoperative to determine which IOL calculation formula is the nearest and most accurate to preoperative records in different refractive sittings.</detailed_description>
