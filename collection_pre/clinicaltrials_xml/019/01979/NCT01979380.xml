	<brief_title>Phase I Clinical Trial to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics of KD101 in Healthy Male Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial is a dose block-randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled, single ascending dose, food interaction study. AEs, PE, Vital signs, ECGs and clinical lab tests will be assessed to evaluate the safety and tolerability, and blood and urine will be collected to evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters. This single ascending dose, food interaction study will be conducted with the KD101 dose of 200, 600, 1000 and 1400 mg. After evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetic parameters in the single dose KD101 group of 200mg, next higher dose of KD101 will be administered and evaluated and food interaction will be evaluated in the KD101 group of 600mg.</detailed_description>
