	<brief_title>Trendelenburg Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single site, prospective, non-blinded, non-randomized, non-interventional study designed to evaluate the hemodynamic and cardiovascular effects of the steep Trendelenburg position on non-invasive or minimally invasive monitors used in the operating room during surgical procedures requiring this patient position. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) Observe the hemodynamic and cardiovascular changes associated with the change from the supine to the steep Trendelenburg position. 2) Observe the hemodynamic and cardiovascular changes during intra-abdominal insufflation used during laparoscopic surgical procedures. HYPOTHESIS: Hemodynamic and cardiovascular changes during alterations in position from supine to steep Trendelenburg and intra-abdominal insufflation measured by non-invasive and minimally invasive monitors will correlate with transthoracic echocardiographic measurements.</detailed_description>
