	<brief_title>Physician Clinical Trial Policy (CTP) Neurological Ischemia Lower Extremity Pain and Swelling</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although there are a number of pain disorders, associated with back, or lower extremity pain and swelling, the American Association of Sensory Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AASEM/ DTSC) study programs will accumulate received data following a protocol of treatment performed for the purpose of eliminating pain, reducing swelling, and accelerating recovery periods as well as to record the success or failure and/or improvement of the malfunctioning body part. - Condition: Neuropathic Pain, Tingling or Numbness derived from neurological Ischemia - Intervention: Treatments of Monochromatic Infrared Photo Energy (MIRE) in combination with Electronic Signal Treatment (TENS) therapy - Study Type: Interventional - Study Design: 1. Allocation: Non-Randomized 2. Endpoint Classification: Efficacy Study 3. Intervention Model: Single Group Assignment 4. Masking: Open Label 5. Primary Purpose: Scientific record of treatment success or failure</detailed_description>
