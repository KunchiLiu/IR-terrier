	<brief_title>Cancer &amp; Chemotherapy Symptom Management Using an Automated Telephone Reporting System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of a computer-based automated symptom monitoring telephone system used by patients who received chemotherapy for their cancer to communicate unrelieved symptoms they experienced to their oncology providers. The symptoms monitored in the project were nausea/vomiting, pain, sore mouth, diarrhea, constipation, depressed mood, anxiety, trouble sleeping, and fatigue. The study randomly assigned participants into either the intervention group or the group that received usual care from their oncology providers without alert notifications. All participants called the automated system daily to report their symptom presence, severity, and distress. When participants in the intervention group rated symptoms at moderate (4-7) to severe (8-10) levels an e-mail alert report of their symptom information was sent to the participant's medical oncologist and oncology nurse. The usual care group also reported symptoms daily to the automated system but their information was not sent to the providers. Participants in the usual care group were told daily to call their oncology provider if they had concerns about their symptoms. The two study groups were compared over chemotherapy cycles 2 and 3 on symptom presence, severity, and distress. Functional status, patient reported degree of symptom interference with normal activities, and work attendance if they had indicated that they worked during their treatment were also recorded. In addition, the groups were compared for the number and purpose of unscheduled patient-provider contacts, visits to the emergency department or urgent care facility, and unscheduled hospitalizations.</detailed_description>
