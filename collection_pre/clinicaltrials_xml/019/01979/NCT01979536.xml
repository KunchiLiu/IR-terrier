	<brief_summary>This partially randomized phase II trial studies how well brentuximab vedotin or crizotinib and combination chemotherapy works in treating patients with newly diagnosed stage II-IV anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Monoclonal antibody-drug conjugates, such as brentuximab vedotin, can block cancer growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Crizotinib and methotrexate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known whether brentuximab vedotin and combination chemotherapy is more effective than crizotinib and combination chemotherapy in treating anaplastic large cell lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brentuximab Vedotin or Crizotinib and Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage II-IV Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the tolerability of brentuximab vedotin given in combination with standard chemotherapy (anaplastic large cell lymphoma [ALCL]99) and to determine the tolerability of crizotinib given in combination with chemotherapy (ALCL99). II. To estimate the event free survival (EFS) of Arm brentuximab vedotin (BV) and Arm crizotinib (CZ) and contrast these to historical control data. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the prognostic significance of minimal disseminated disease (MDD) at diagnosis and minimal residual disease (MRD) as measured by real-time (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in peripheral blood. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned or randomized into 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM BV: COURSE A (COURSES 1, 3, AND 5): Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1, dexamethasone orally (PO) twice daily (BID) or IV on days 1-5, ifosfamide IV over 60 minutes on days 1-5, methotrexate IV over 3 hours on day 1, cytarabine IV over 1-30 minutes every 12 hours for 4 doses on days 4 and 5, and etoposide IV over 2 hours on days 4 and 5. COURSE B (COURSES 2, 4, AND 6): Patients receive brentuximab vedotin, dexamethasone, and methotrexate as in Arm BV, Course A. Patients also receive cyclophosphamide IV over 15-30 minutes on days 1-5 and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 1-15 minutes on days 4 and 5. ARM CZ: COURSE A (COURSES 1, 3, AND 5): Patients receive crizotinib PO BID on days 1-21 and dexamethasone, ifosfamide, methotrexate, cytarabine, and etoposide as in Arm BV, Course A. COURSE B (COURSES 2, 4, AND 6): Patients receive crizotinib as in Arm CZ, Course A and dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and doxorubicin hydrochloride as in Arm BV, Course B. In all arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months.</detailed_description>
