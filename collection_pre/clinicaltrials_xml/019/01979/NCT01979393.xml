	<brief_summary>This study aims to investigate a drug called Cabozantinib which belongs to a family of drugs that have effects on tumour growth, blood supply, invasion and spread. Therefore, we want to find out whether taking cabozantinib after treatment with surgery and chemotherapy is effective and safe for patients who responded or had stable disease after their chemotherapy. All participants will receive 4-6 cycles of standard chemotherapy. Those with stabilization or response to the standard chemotherapy will be split into 2 groups (cabozantinib or placebo).</brief_summary>
