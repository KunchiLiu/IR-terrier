	<brief_summary>It is well established in studies across several countries that tobacco smoking is more prevalent among schizophrenic patients than the general population. Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are becoming increasingly popular with smokers worldwide. To date there are no large randomised trials of e-cigarettes in schizophrenic smokers. A well-designed trial is needed to compare efficacy and safety of these products in this special population.</brief_summary>
