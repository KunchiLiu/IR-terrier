	<brief_summary>This pooled analysis will assess data from the Phase 3 belimumab registration studies BLISS-52 (aka BEL110752) and BLISS-76 (aka BEL110751). The analysis was pre-planned and agreed prior to the unblinding of either study. The primary objective is to evaluate the impact of belimumab treatment on a more severe subpopulation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) subjects from BLISS-52 and BLISS-76 to aid physicians and payers in decision making. Subjects are from the modified Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population defined as randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study agent. This more severe subpopulation will have renal, neurological, haematological, or cardiovascular/respiratory organ domain involvement (as defined by a British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) domain score of A, B or C in at least one of the domains) at baseline AND anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (anti-dsDNA) positive (≥ 30 IU/mL) at baseline OR low C3 and/or C4 complement relative to the normal range at baseline.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Eligible subjects for BLISS52 and BLISS76 included: clinical diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria "active" (systemic lupus erythematosus) SLE disease, defined as a safety of oestrogen in lupus national assessment (SELENA) systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI) disease activity score of at least 6 at screening an unequivocally positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) test result, from 2 independent time points within the study screening period or 1 positive historical test result and 1 positive test result during the screening period. ANA test results obtained in the screening period were only considered positive if the ANA titer ≥ 1:80 and/or antidsDNA serum antibody was ≥ 30 IU/mL on a stable SLE treatment regimen for at least 30 days prior to Day 0, which consisted of any of the following (alone or in combination): prednisone or equivalent (from 0 to 40 mg/day when used in combination with other SLE treatment or from 7.5 to 40 mg/day alone), antimalarials, nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or any immunosuppressive therapy (i.e., methotrexate, azathioprine, leflunomide, or mycophenolate calcineurin inhibitors, sirolimus, oral cyclophosphamide, 6mercaptopurine, or thalidomide). Additional inclusion criteria for the purpose of this analysis: subpopulation of patients from the pooled modified IntenttoTreat population from BLISS52 and BLISS76 who have renal, neurological, haematological, or cardiovascular/respiratory organ domain involvement (as defined by a BILAG domain score of A, B or C in at least one of the domains) at baseline and 1 of the following: are antidsDNA positive (≥ 30 IU/mL) at baseline, OR have low C3 and/or C4 complement relative to the normal range at baseline. Key exclusion criteria for BLISS52 and BLISS76 included: severe active lupus nephritis or Central Nervous System (CNS) lupus pregnancy receipt of any B cell target therapy at any time receipt of an investigational agent within 60 days prior to Day 0 for nonbiologics and within 1 year for biologics receipt of abatacept (within 1 year), intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide (within 6 months), antitumor necrosis factor (antiTNF) therapy, anakinra, IV immunoglobulin (IVIG), prednisone &gt; 100 mg/day, or plasmapheresis within 3 months, or live vaccine within 1 month.</criteria>
