	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if resveratrol can improve heart function and quality of life. Although, population studies have revealed that a mild to moderate intake of red wine reduces cardiovascular disease risk in humans, clinical studies that evaluate the potential heart benefits of resveratrol in patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy have not been previously reported. Accordingly, this research is being done because it will fill this deficiency in the information available in the literature and establish the clinical benefits of resveratrol in patients with this type of heart disease.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators will conduct a randomized double blinded placebo controlled study of 40 adults (â‰¥18 to 90 years old). Twenty (20) subjects will be included in the placebo arm, and 20 in the treatment arm. Patients will be randomly allocated to receive placebo or resveratrol. After randomization, the two groups of subjects will be followed up in exactly the same way, and the only differences between the care they receive will be those intrinsic to the treatment being compared. The randomization will minimize allocation bias, balancing both known and unknown prognostic factors, in the assignment of treatments.</detailed_description>
