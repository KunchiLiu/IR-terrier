	<brief_title>Dose-adjusted EPOCH-R in MYC Positive DLBCL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prognosis of MYC positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is very poor even treated with R-CHOP regimen. Recently, dose-adjusted EPOCH-R was shown to be effective in patients with DLBCL and relapsed/refractory Burkitt lymphoma. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of dose-adjusted EPOCH-R in patients with MYC positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.</detailed_description>
