	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to add to the knowledge of mechanisms of immune health. Parameters of the immune system will be followed over time in volunteers allergic to dust mites and bee sting after receiving immunization therapy. This information will be compared to healthy volunteers without allergy. We aim to bring new understanding of immune processes by this comparison.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunological Mechanisms of Allergy Immunotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The process of immunization as a treatment for allergic disease brings about changes that are not all well understood and the understanding about them is developing constantly. In our study we plan to check a large number of immunological parameters to broaden the scope of knowledge of evaluating individuals for immune health across multiple sub fields of medicine and for advancing a basic understanding of immune cell signaling. The study will involve 70 participants between ages 18-45 of both sexes. Persons enrolled to the study will have been diagnosed with allergic rhinitis caused by dust mite or persons who developed a systemic reaction following bee sting who are candidates to be treated by immunization. After verification of diagnosis of allergic condition and decision to start immunizations, blood samples will be drawn from participants before immunization weekly for 24 weeks. Blood samples will be analyzed in order to identify immune cell subset differences that change in response to allergy immunotherapy. Comparisons will be made of baseline and stimulation-induced status of protein phosphorylation individuals over the time-series course in which they receive allergy immunotherapy to pinpoint molecular mechanisms underlying desensitization. Evaluations will be made of cellular mechanisms of allergy immunotherapy by comparing over time and between groups, through serum cytokine profiling and blood gene expression of individuals undergoing allergy immunotherapy shots.</detailed_description>

Autoimmune disease (including rheumatoid arthritis treated with immunosuppressive medication such as Plaquenil, methotrexate, prednisone, Enbrel) which, in the opinion of the investigator, might jeopardize volunteer safety or compliance with the protocol.
