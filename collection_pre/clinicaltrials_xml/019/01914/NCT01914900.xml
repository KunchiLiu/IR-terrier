	<brief_summary>This is a phase II study of preoperative chemotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TPF) in locally advanced resectable oral cavity squamous cell cancer. The aim is to improve the rate of pathological complete response to induction chemotherapy in a molecular enriched population, consisting of patients with tumour harbouring a functional p53 protein and/or showing low expression of beta-tubulin II.</brief_summary>
