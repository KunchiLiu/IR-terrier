	<brief_summary>Retinitis pigmentosa is an eye disease in which there is damage to the retina. The retina is the layer of tissue at the back of the inner eye that converts light images to nerve signals and sends them to the brain.Autologous Bone Marrow derived Mono Nuclear Stem Cell (BMMNCs) is used for this condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of BMMNC in Retinitis Pigmentosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will involve about 8 visits over 1Â½ years .Each participant will be enrolled in study as per inclusion and exclusion criteria .Informed consent will be taken from subject before including in study. Subject will be underwent for specific tests of the participant's vision and health. These visits may include visual exams, blood draw for laboratory testing, brief medical history and exam, and occasionally a questionnaire (survey), in addition to the visit for the surgical procedures. The primary outcome for this study will be a visual acuity score after one year of stem cell therapy . Follow-up visits will be required regularly to determine the effectiveness of Autologous Bone Marrow derived Mono Nuclear Stem Cell (BMMNCs) in RP.</detailed_description>
