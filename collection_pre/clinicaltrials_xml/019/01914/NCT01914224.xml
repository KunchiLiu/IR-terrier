	<brief_summary>Reduction in sodium consumption is important approach in public health care. In general population, reduction of sodium intake can reduce the future development of hypertension and cardiovascular event. Meanwhile, enhancement of potassium consumption is also important to reduce blood pressure and cardiovascular events. We hypothesized that combined education of low sodium and high potassium consumption is more effective in reducing blood pressure compared to dietary education of low sodium consumption only. The present survey study was designed to test the effectiveness of combined education of low sodium and high potassium consumption in blood pressure reduction and improvement of other variables.</brief_summary>
