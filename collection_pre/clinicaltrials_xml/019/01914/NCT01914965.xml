	<brief_summary>The influence of bupropion compared to placebo on the change of apathy as quantified by the apathy evaluation scale (AES-I, where I [informant] is a friend or family member familiar with the daily activities of the subject) in patients with HD after ten (10) weeks of treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Apathy Cure Through Bupropion in Huntington's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The safety and tolerability of Bupropion in HD. The influence of Bupropion compared to placebo on the: - change of apathy as quantified by the AES-C (clinician) or the AES-S (self), - change of motor symptoms (UHDRS) and quantitative grip force motor assessment, - change of cognitive symptoms (UHDRS and MMSE), - change of psychiatric symptoms (UHDRS, HADS), - change of activities of daily living (UHDRS), - change of the NPI caregivers' distress score (NPI-D), - change of ventral striatal and ventromedial prefrontal activation in response to a reward paradigm as quantified by fMRI.</detailed_description>
