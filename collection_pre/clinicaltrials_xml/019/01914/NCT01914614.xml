	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of Working Women and Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients enrolled will be interviewed three times over a six month period. They will be asked questions about their experiences in managing their cancer while taking care of their job responsibilities. Patients will be asked to complete a survey that asks questions about their breast cancer treatment, their job, and how they manage their responsibilities while undergoing cancer treatment. The first initial meeting will be conducted at a time and location that is convenient for the patient. This meeting should last about an hour to an hour and a half. Three and six months after the initial interview, study participants will be asked to complete a follow-up survey by either telephone or Internet/Web, depending on their preference. These telephone surveys will last between 15-30 minutes.</detailed_description>
