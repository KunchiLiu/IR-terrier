	<brief_summary>The current proposal will determine if blocking carbohydrate intake in the small intestine with Acarbose can be a possible therapy for older adults with (PPH) Post Prandial Hypotension (a drop of blood pressure after eating), which can result in falls.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acarbose and Older Adults With Postprandial Hypotension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Blocking the absorption of carbohydrates at the brush border of the small intestine with acarbose (an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor) seems a promising possibility as a potential therapeutic agent. Although designed as a second-line diabetes drug, this medication has very little risk of hypoglycemia in older adults. In fact the risk of hypoglycemia is extremely low even in patients concurrently taking concurrent hypoglycemia agents (including insulin), and there is almost no risk of hypoglycemia in subjects not on other diabetes medications. Acarbose suppresses postprandial glycemia by slowing small intestinal digestion and absorption of carbohydrate, and has been shown to slow gastric emptying Acarbose has yet to be examined in a prospective fashion in older adults, despite the prevalence of PPH in this patient population. Preliminary, pilot work done in our laboratory on older adults with PPH has demonstrated that the hypotensive response over 90 minutes to a standardized meal was significantly reduced by the administration of acarbose</detailed_description>
