	<brief_summary>Preeclampsia is a frequent pathology. His etiology is doubtful. Targets : The study target is to identify a risk of preeclampsia group obtained with transcriptom analysis from circulating peripheric cells. Design: Multidisciplinary study (Gynaecology-Obstetric, Immunology, North CIC). The study of the transcriptional history of peripheral blood cells of 2patients groups: - A patient group with a preeclampsia before 34 SA - A patient group with a normal pregnancy paired on main confusion factors. Blood sampling will be collected at the diagnosis and 8 weeks after delivery. Results and perspectives - Obtain a transcriptionnal signature of preeclampsia - To identify new mechanism of the disease - Identification of a specific transcriptom analysis with the comparison after delivery For long-term, the target is to identify risk patient in order to conduct easily preventive clinical trials in preeclamsia (primary prevention) and to consider a specific follow-up for risk patients.</brief_summary>
