	<brief_summary>This study will determine the safety and tolerability of PF-06412562 given orally to healthy volunteers. To determine the optimal dose for future studies, the concentration of the drug over time will be determined by periodic blood samples. The rate of eye blinks will be measured as an indicator of PF-06412562 action on the receptors of interest in the brain.</brief_summary>
