	<brief_summary>Kallmann syndrome (KS), also known as congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH), is a rare endocrine disorder that is characterized by failure to undergo puberty combined with infertility. KS/CHH patients face a number of psychosocial burdens related to delays in diagnosis, inadequate access to expert care, and lack of information about the condition. As such, there is some evidence to suggest that KS/CHH patients have unmet health needs. This study aims to identify the needs of patients and understand the issues that must be overcome to achieve improved health and quality of life.</brief_summary>
