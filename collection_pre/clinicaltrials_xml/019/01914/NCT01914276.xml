	<brief_summary>Objectives: (1) To determine the incidence of lower-extremity lymphedema after staging surgery for endometrial cancer; (2) to describe lymphedema-related morbidity after staging surgery for endometrial cancer and (3) to evaluate pre- and post-operative quality of life in women with endometrial cancer who undergo staging surgery. Data analysis and risk/safety issues: The proposed study will consist of a convenience sample of women who undergo minimally invasive surgery for endometrial cancer over a 1 year period. The investigators anticipate enrollment of 75 to 100 women. Frequency tables and difference with its 95% exact confidence intervals between pre-and post-operative lower extremity lymphedema measurements and quality of life questionnaires will be estimated.</brief_summary>
