	<brief_summary>This study aims to investigate the benefit and feasibility of providing pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing as part of a standard medication therapy management (MTM) session for patients taking multiple medications, a high-risk population for adverse drug reactions and non-response. Research participants will attend two MTM sessions and undergo PGx testing to inform the MTM plan. Participants will also complete 2 surveys pre and post-MTM/PGx testing. Data analysis will assess the impact of MTM/PGx testing on recommendations for drug dosing, clinical outcomes, patient satisfaction, and feasibility of service delivery. Safety issues are minimal with the primary risks being associated with loss of confidentiality, typical discomfort associated with acquiring blood samples, and genetic discrimination.</brief_summary>
