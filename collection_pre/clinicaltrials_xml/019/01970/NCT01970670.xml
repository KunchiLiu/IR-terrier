	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to determine how accurately one can estimate the size of the index tumor on preoperative imaging in patients with known breast cancer, using pathology as a reference standard. The primary endpoint, which will be measured on CEDM,and CE-MRI, is the maximum diameter (mm) of the index tumor.</brief_summary>
