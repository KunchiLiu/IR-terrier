	<brief_title>Evaluating the Safety and Immune Response to Three Different Prime-Boost HIV Vaccine Regimens in Healthy, HIV-Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immune response to three different HIV-1 prime-boost vaccine regimens in healthy, HIV-1-uninfected adults. The regimens will differ by the type of HIV-1 envelope insert (Nat-B env, CON-S env, or Mosaic env) contained in both the DNA prime vaccine and the NYVAC boost vaccine. The study will enroll 180 healthy, HIV-1-uninfected adults in two stages (Part A and Part B). After Part A of the study is fully enrolled, study researchers will evaluate study immunogenicity data to determine whether to enroll participants into Part B. The study design and vaccination schedule for both parts of the study will be the same. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups and receive either one of the experimental vaccine regimens or a placebo vaccine regimen. Participants will receive four total injections: on Day 0 and Day 28 (DNA vaccine or placebo) and on Day 84 and Day 168 (NYVAC vaccine or placebo). Group 1 participants will receive DNA Nat-B env and NYVAC Nat-B env vaccines, Group 2 participants will receive DNA CON-S env and NYVAC CON-S env vaccines, and Group 3 participants will receive DNA Mosaic env and NYVAC Mosaic env vaccines. Total study duration will be either 3 years after enrollment (for participants in the United States) or 5 years after enrollment (for participants in Switzerland). For all participants, study visits will occur on Days 0, 14, 28, 42, 84, 98, 168, 175, 182, 273, 357, and 364. After the last study visit, participants will be contacted annually by phone or e-mail for a total of 3 (U.S. participants) or 5 (Switzerland participants) years to answer questions about their health. At screening, participants will give a medical history; undergo a complete physical exam, blood collection, urine collection, and an electrocardiogram (ECG); and receive risk reduction counseling. At most follow-up visits, participants will undergo an abbreviated physical exam, blood collection, urine collection, and receive risk reduction counseling. Participants will have additional ECGs on Days 98 and 182. At all visits, female participants who were born female will be assessed for pregnancy prevention, and at select visits, will undergo a pregnancy test.</detailed_description>

NonU.S. sites may use locally available assays that have been approved by HVTN Laboratory Operations. Negative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) Negative antihepatitis C virus antibodies (antiHCV), or negative HCV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if the antiHCV is positive Normal urine: Negative urine glucose, negative or trace urine protein, and negative or trace urine hemoglobin (if trace hemoglobin is present on dipstick, a microscopic urinalysis with red blood cells levels within institutional normal range) Participants who were born female: negative serum or urine beta human chorionic gonadotropin (Î²HCG) pregnancy test performed prior to vaccination on the day of initial vaccination Reproductive status: A participant who was born female must agree to consistently use effective contraception for sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy from at least 21 days prior to enrollment through the last required protocol clinic visit. More information on this criterion can be found in the protocol. Participants who were born female must also agree not to seek pregnancy through alternative methods, such as artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization until after the last required protocol clinic visit Blood products received within 120 days before first vaccination Investigational research agents received within 30 days before first vaccination Body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 40; less than or equal to 18; or greater than or equal to 35 with 2 or more of the following: age greater than 45, systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg, current smoker, or known hyperlipidemia Intent to participate in another study of an investigational research agent during the planned duration of this study Pregnant or breastfeeding HIV vaccine(s) received in a prior HIV vaccine trial. For participants who have received control/placebo in an HIV vaccine trial, the HVTN 099 Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT) will determine eligibility on a casebycase basis and the identity of the study control/placebo must be obtained. NonHIV experimental vaccine(s) received within the last 5 years in a prior vaccine trial. Exceptions may be made for vaccines that have subsequently undergone licensure by the FDA. For volunteers who have received control/placebo in an experimental vaccine trial, the HVTN 099 PSRT will determine eligibility on a casebycase basis. For volunteers who have received an experimental vaccine(s) greater than 5 years ago, eligibility for enrollment will be determined by the HVTN 099 PSRT on a casebycase basis.
