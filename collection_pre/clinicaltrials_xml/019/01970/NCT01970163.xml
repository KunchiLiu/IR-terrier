	<brief_title>DermACELL in Subjects With Chronic Wounds of the Lower Extremities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of DermACELL in the treatment of chronic wounds of the lower extremities. DermACELL will be compared to conventional care in both subjects with diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) and subjects with venous stasis ulcers (VSU). In addition, DermACELL will be compared to an active comparator, GraftJacket, in subjects with diabetic foot ulcers. DermACELL and GraftJacket are both made from donated human skin (dermis). These products have been processed so that cells are removed and bacteria and viruses are destroyed. This processing provided a supporting structure, an acellular dermal matrix, into which cells can migrate and divide during the wound healing process.</detailed_description>
