	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies the side effects and how well surgery and heated chemotherapy with or without non-heated chemotherapy after surgery works in treating patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, uterine, or peritoneal cancer. Giving a dose of heated chemotherapy into the abdomen during surgery that is done to remove ovarian, fallopian tube, uterine, or peritoneal cancer may help lower the risk of the cancer coming back. Giving unheated chemotherapy drugs directly into the abdomen after surgery may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgery and Chemotherapy With or Without Chemotherapy After Surgery in Treating Patients With Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, Uterine, or Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) followed by postoperative normothermic intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy is feasible and safe to administer, as measured by toxicities occurring during treatment or follow-up. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine quality of life (QoL) and compare the outcomes to a historical control of IP chemotherapy (no HIPEC) for women with ovarian cancer. II. To determine whether cytoreductive surgery with HIPEC alone is feasible and safe to administer, as measured by toxicities occurring during treatment or follow-up. III. To estimate progression-free survival (PFS). IV. To collect biospecimens and perform correlative translational studies focused on understanding the mechanisms of action of HIPEC on ovarian cancer and micro ribonucleic acid (RNA) profiling of ovarian cancer and ex vivo evaluation of oncolytic virus replication. OUTLINE: Patients undergo surgery and receive hyperthermic cisplatin intraperitoneally (IP) over 60 minutes. Beginning at least 3 weeks after surgery, patients may receive carboplatin, paclitaxel, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, or gemcitabine hydrochloride IP or intravenously (IV) at the discretion of the medical and gynecologic oncologists. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3-6, 6-9, 9-12, and 12-15 months; every 3 months for 1 year; and then every 4 months for 1 year.</detailed_description>
