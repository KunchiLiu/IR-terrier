Acupuncture and BVA treatments will then be performed on the study group, and sham acupuncture and normal saline injections will be performed on the control group twice a week for 12 weeks. The waiting group does not receive any added treatment during the 12 weeks. The initial assessment will be repeated after 12 weeks in all groups. In the study and the control groups, an additional assessment will be repeated after 16 and 20 weeks.</detailed_description>
