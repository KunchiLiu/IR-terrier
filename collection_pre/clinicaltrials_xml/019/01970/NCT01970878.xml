	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, chronic dosing, active-controlled, 28-week safety extension study of the two pivotal 24-week safety and efficacy studies (Studies PT003006 and PT003007). This study is designed to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of Glycopyrrolate (GP) and Formoterol Fumarate (FF) combination (GFF) metered dose inhaler (MDI), GP MDI, and FF MDI in subjects with moderate to very severe COPD over a total observation period of 52 weeks. Open-label Spiriva is included as an active control. To be eligible for this study, a subject must complete participation in Study PT003006 (NCT01854645) or Study PT003007 (NCT01854658).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Participant in/completion of previous 24week PINNACLE Phase III Trial. Male or female subjects at least 40 years of age and no older than 80 at Visit 1. Subjects with an established clinical history of COPD as defined by the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) Current or former smokers with a history of at least 10 packyears of cigarette smoking. Subjects with FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of &lt;0.70 and FEV1 &lt;80% predicted normal and ≥750 mL if FEV1 &lt;30% of predicted normal value. Subjects willing and, in the opinion of the investigator, able to adjust current COPD therapy as required by the protocol Key Significant diseases other than COPD, i.e. disease or condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, may put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or may influence either the results of the study or the subject's ability to participate in the study Current diagnosis of asthma or alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency Other active pulmonary disease such as active tuberculosis, lung cancer, bronchiectasis, sarcoidosis, idiopathic interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, primary pulmonary hypertension, or uncontrolled sleep apnea Hospitalized due to poorly controlled COPD within 3 months prior to screening or during the Screening Period Poorly controlled COPD, defined as acute worsening of COPD that requires treatment with oral corticosteroids or antibiotics within 6 weeks prior to screening or during the Screening Period Lower respiratory tract infections that required antibiotics within 6 weeks prior to screening or during the Screening Period Unstable ischemic heart disease, left ventricular failure, or documented myocardial infarction within 12 months of enrollment. Recent history of acute coronary syndrome, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass graft within the past three months Congestive heart failure (CHF) New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III/IV) Clinically significant abnormal 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) Abnormal liver function tests defined as alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminanse (AST), or total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 times upper limit of normal at Visit 1 and on repeat testing Cancer not in complete remission for at least five years History of hypersensitivity to β2agonists, glycopyrronium or other muscarinic anticholinergics, lactose/milk protein or any component of the MDI Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
