	<brief_summary>Vitreous floaters are tiny, cloudy, clumps of cells that appear in the otherwise clear fluid (vitreous) that fills the back 3/4 of the eye. Floaters are commonly caused by eye conditions such as posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), vitreous syneresis and asteroid hyalosis. While these symptoms are considered physiological in nature, they can be of considerable inconvenience to many patients which affect essential activities. The investigators wish to assess the safety and efficacy of floater treatment in patients with highly symptomatic floaters using an FDA approved nanosecond infrared yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) lasers.</brief_summary>
