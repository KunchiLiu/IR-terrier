	<brief_summary>The proposed project will pilot the use of IGF-1 as a novel treatment for core symptoms of autism. We will use a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial design in five children with autism to evaluate the impact of IGF-1 treatment on autism-specific impairments in socialization, language, and repetitive behaviors. We expect to provide evidence for the safety and feasibility of IGF-1 in ameliorating social withdrawal in children with Autistic Disorder. Further, we expect to demonstrate that IGF-1 is associated with improvement on secondary outcomes of social impairment, language delay, and repetitive behavior, as well as on functional outcomes of global severity.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>IGF-1 is an FDA approved, commercially available compound that crosses the blood-brain barrier and has beneficial effects on synaptic development by promoting neuronal cell survival, synaptic maturation, and synaptic plasticity. IGF-1 is effective in reversing mouse and neuronal models of Rett syndrome and Phelan McDermid syndrome, both single gene causes of ASD and may therefore be effective in treating autism spectrum disorders (ASD) more broadly.</detailed_description>
