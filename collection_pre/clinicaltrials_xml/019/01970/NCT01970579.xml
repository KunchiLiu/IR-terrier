	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the paclitaxelreleasing balloon catheter SeQuent® Please P to treat de novo and restenotic lesions in the superficial femoral artery and the proximal two segments of the popliteal artery with reference diameters ≥ 4mm &amp; ≤ 7mm and lesion lengths ≥ 4 cm &amp; ≤ 27 cm. It is the intention of this trial to treat suitable target lesions with DCB only.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Willingness to treat the target lesion according to the DCB only concept Patients in Rutherford classes 2 through 4 (corresponding to Fontaine stage IIb to III) Patients eligible for peripheral revascularization by means of PTA Patients must be ≥ 18 years of age Patients who are mentally and linguistically able to understand the aim of the study and to show sufficient compliance in following the study protocol Patients must agree to undergo the 6month angiographic and clinical followup Patients must agree to undergo the 1 and 2 year clinical followup Patient is able to verbally acknowledge an understanding of the associated risks, benefits, and treatment alternatives to therapeutic options of this trial. The patients, by providing their informed consent, agree to these risks and benefits as stated in the patient informed consent document. Peripheral lesions in the native SFA or popliteal artery with reference vessel diameters between ≥ 4.0 and ≤ 7.0 mm, lesions lengths ≥ 4 cm and ≤ 27 cm as angiographically documented Diameter stenosis preprocedure must be ≥ 70% Target lesion in the SFA or popliteal artery (first two proximal segments)*. * as far as applicable distance of the target lesion to a previously implanted stent should be about 1cm Vessels must have adequate runoff with at least one vessel to the foot. Treatment of max. two lesions is permitted. Patients with Rutherford class 5 or 6 Women who are known or suspected to be pregnant. Hence, patients will be advised to use an adequate birth control method up to and including the 6month followup. Patients with an expected life span of less than 24 months Patients with bleeding diathesis in whom anticoagulation or antiplatelet medication is contraindicated Patients who had a cerebral stroke &lt; 6 months prior to the procedure Patients with unstable angina pectoris Patients with acute myocardial infarction within the past 2 weeks Patient participates in other clinical trials involving any investigational device or drug that interfere with the effects to be studied in this trial. Interventional treatment at the contralateral leg within 2 weeks prior to or after the study intervention Untreated hyperthyroidism Patient has presence or history of severe renal failure (GFR &lt; 30ml/min) and is therefore not eligible for angiography. Post transplantation of any organ or immune suppressive medication Other disease to jeopardize followup (e.g. malignoma) Addiction to any drug or to alcohol (WHO definition) Patients with clinically significant aneurysmal disease of the popliteal, femoral or iliac artery and patients with history of clinically significant abdominal aortic aneurysm Patients with any type of surgical/interventional procedures within 4 weeks prior to or planned after study intervention (if those may interfere with the peripheral study intervention and/or patient's ability to perform the follow up examinations) Conditions which prevent the intake of the double antiplatelet therapy for two months Patients with contraindication for drugeluting balloon angioplasty given in the instruction for use Patients under administrative or judicial custody (§20 Act on Medical Devices, Germany) Strongly calcified lesions with circumferential presence of calcifications and a lesion length of &gt; 4 cm Chronic total occlusions longer than 10 cm Lesion below the knee requiring treatment Target lesion within a bypass graft Instent restenosis Lesions treated with DCB Concomitant use of atherectomy, cryoplasty or laser therapy Inflow lesion (proximal to the study lesion) with flow limitation not being successfully treated prior to the study lesion</criteria>
