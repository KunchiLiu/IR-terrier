	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of different doses of TA-8995, a cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor, on the elevation of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), alone and in combination with statin therapy. The secondary objectives of this study are to determine the safety and tolerability of TA-8995 in patients with mild dyslipidaemia.</brief_summary>
