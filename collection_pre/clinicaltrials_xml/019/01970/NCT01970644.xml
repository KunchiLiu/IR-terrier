	<brief_summary>Cancer which spreads to the brain (brain metastases) is a common and significant problem. Historically, whole-brain radiotherapy has been used to treat these patients but has a negative effect on cognition. Radiosurgery is an alternative treatment with potential for fewer cognitive side effects. The impact of radiosurgery alone on the cognitive function of patients with multiple brain metastases is not well studied. We propose a pilot study at the Winnipeg Centre for Gamma Knife Surgery to examine this issue.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neurocognition After Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for Multiple Brian Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with &gt;=4 brain metastases will undergo Gamma Knife radiosurgery to a dose of 15-20 Gy, depending on the maximum tumour diameter and number of metastases. A number of neurocognitive, quality of life, and toxicity assessments will be performed at baseline and at 6 weeks post-radiosurgery, then at months 4, 6, 12, 18, and every 6 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
