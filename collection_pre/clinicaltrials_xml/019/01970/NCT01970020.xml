	<brief_title>A Study to Investigate the Absorption, Metabolism, and Excretion of JNJ-38518168 After a Single Oral Dose in Healthy Male Participants.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-center, single-arm (single group), and single-dose study. This study will include a screening period of 21 days prior to study medication administration. Six men will be enrolled and admitted to the clinical study unit on the morning of Day -1. On Day 1, participants will receive a single oral solution dose containing 30 mg of 14C JNJ-38518168 given as an oral solution. The participants will be confined to the clinical study unit for at least 360 hours after dosing ie, Day -1 through Day 14 and they will be discharged on Day 15; however, participants who, by Day 15, do not meet the discharge criteria will extend their residency in the study unit for up to Day 21. They will return to the study center 7 to 10 days after discharge for the final safety follow-up. The study will include the following safety evaluations: adverse event, vital sign, 12-lead electrocardiography, physical examination, and clinical laboratory test. For each participant the total duration in the study is approximately 6 weeks (including screening and safety follow-up) or 7 weeks for participants who extend the residence up to Day 21.</detailed_description>
