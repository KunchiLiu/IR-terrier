	<brief_title>Observational Study Providing 12 Months of Safety Follow-Up From First Exposure to HP802-247</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study expects subjects to transition immediately upon exit from the 802-247-09-032 trial into a longer period of observation, ensuring a total of 12 months of safety and wound status data are obtained from the time of the first application of HP802-247. This study provides consecutive visits at intervals of 8 weeks until a total of 12 months of safety follow-up has been achieved, using the date of first application of Investigational Medicinal Product as reference start date and the exit from the 802-247-09-032 trial to determine the number of follow-up visits needed in this study to total 12 months of follow-up. Specifically, this study examines all new and unresolved ongoing adverse events.</detailed_description>
