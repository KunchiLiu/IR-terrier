	<brief_summary>To evaluate the clinical safety and effectiveness of the ARO Spinal System and to assess preliminary cost/benefit analysis in patients undergoing decompression surgery for symptomatic lumbar disc herniations. The general hypothesis is that the ARO significantly improves outcomes in patients undergoing decompression surgery for symptomatic lumbar disc herniations.</brief_summary>

Nerve root irritation i. positive nerve root tension sign straight leg raise positive between 30 and 70 degrees, or ii. positive femoral tension sign, or iii. neurologic deficit asymmetrical depressed reflex or decreased sensation in a dermatomal distribution or weakness in a myotomal distribution. 2. Primary onelevel posterolateral herniation in the lower lumbar spine (L4L5 or L5S1 only) as shown by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (protrusion, extrusion or sequestered fragment) consistent with the clinical symptoms (both level and side). 3.
