	<brief_summary>The main goal of the study is to evaluate if the ad libitum use of the THS 2.2 Menthol (mTHS 2.2) for 5 days in confinement and after 85 days of product use in an ambulatory setting, by Japanese adult healthy smokers results in a reduction in the levels of biomarkers of exposure for selected harmful and potentially harmful smoke constituents (HPHCs) compared to smokers continuing smoking their own preferred brand of menthol conventional cigarette (mCC) and smoking abstinence (SA). Smokers who remained abstinent from SA were used as a benchmark to provide context to the exposure reduction.</brief_summary>
