	<brief_summary>This study is being done to compare the effects of bucindolol hydrochloride (bucindolol) to metoprolol succinate (Toprol-XL) on the recurrence of symptomatic atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter in patients with heart failure who have a specific genotype for the beta-1 adrenergic receptor.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal of the GENETIC-AF trial is to demonstrate the superiority of pharmacogenetically targeted bucindolol compared to metoprolol for the prevention of symptomatic atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in a genotype-defined population with heart failure and/or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction at high risk of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter recurrence.</detailed_description>
