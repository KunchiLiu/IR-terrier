	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the patient experience when using gabapentin with other pain control medications after posterior spinal fusion surgery for scoliosis in adolescents. These results will be compared to patients who underwent the same procedure during the study period and received the same standardized pain control regimen excluding gabapentin. Effects on pain level, opioid use, satisfaction and narcotic use after discharge from the hospital will be measured. Opioid side effects including nausea, sedation and urinary retention (inability to empty one's bladder) will also be recorded.The null hypotheses are as follows: 1. There is no significant difference in pain control when adding gabapentin to a multimodal pain management protocol in pediatric post-operative posterior spinal fusion patients. 2. There is no significant difference in the amount of opiate medication required for pain control in pediatric post-operative posterior spinal fusion patients.</brief_summary>
