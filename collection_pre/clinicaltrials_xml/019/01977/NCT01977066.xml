	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of two specific exercise interventions and one standard care control arm on physical functioning.The investigators expect that supervised training is most beneficial to the patients. However, they also expect some benefit for patients in the home-based training.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise Intervention Study for Pancreatic Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The randomized-controlled balanced-parallel-group trial included 65 adult pancreatic cancer patients (stage I-IV) from the University Surgery Clinic in Heidelberg. The study compared two specific exercise interventions and one standard care control arm. The intervention programs were (1) a 6-month supervised moderate-to-high-intensity, progressive resistance training, and (2) a 6-month home-based exercise training. Thus, the two interventions differed primarily by the intensity and mode-of-administration of the intervention. Both interventions started at the earliest 8 weeks after surgery to allow for wound healing until Maximum 12 months after the surgery. The supervised progressive training started with only moderate-intensity training during the first 4 weeks. Only patients without comorbidities that preclude participation in the intervention arms (e.g. severe pain, heart insufficiency, reduced standing or walking ability) were eligible. The primary objective is to compare the effects of the different interventions on physical functioning, measured as change from baseline to 6 months. Additional endpoints are overall quality of life, fatigue, endurance, and strength performance, adherence to the interventions, discontinuation of adjuvant therapy, body weight and composition, disease progression, overall and progression-free survival. All outcomes has been assessed every 3 months for a minimum follow-up period of 12 months.</detailed_description>
