	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of Comprehensive Chromosome Screening(CCS) on patients with low ovarian reserve in an effort to improve success during in vitro fertilization and decrease the time to successful pregnancy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Screening of Low Responders for Aneuploidy to Improve Reproductive Efficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will undergo a stimulated IVF cycle culminating with an ultrasound guided egg retrieval procedure and either a fresh or frozen embryo transfer as clinically appropriate and without regard to study. All embryology laboratory procedures will be conducted per routine. Once the embryo(s) have reached the blastocyst stage of development patients will be randomized into either the study group or the control group. The SOLAIRE Trial is "blinded" which means neither patients nor the RMANJ study doctor/staff will know to which group the embryos were randomized. The study group will have their embryo(s) biopsied for CCS on day 5, if appropriate, for a fresh day 6 embryo transfer. The control group will not have CCS testing performed on their embryo(s) and may proceed with a fresh or frozen embryo transfer as clinically appropriate. The maximum amount of embryos that can be transferred is two per RMANJ protocol. All post-transfer care and pregnancy monitoring will be identical and per routine protocol regardless of study participation.</detailed_description>
