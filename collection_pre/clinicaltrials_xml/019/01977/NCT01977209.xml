	<brief_summary>The investigators' experimental study found that gossypol was the natural inhibitor of apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) and clinical study observed that high expression of APE1 was relative to the platinum-resistance in non-small cell lung cancer. Thus the purpose of this study is to find out whether gossypol can improve the sensitivity of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in the non-small cell lung cancer with apurinic apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) high expression</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologic or cytologic diagnosis of NSCLC, Stage IIIB/IV. Males or females between 18 Years to 75 Years. No prior cisplatinbased chemotherapy, if the surgery or radiotherapy has been administered, the interval is at least above four weeks. The interval for targeted therapy such as EGFR TKI is above 2 weeks. Performance status of 0, 1 on the ECOG criteria. Expected survival is above three months. At least one unidimensional measurable lesion meeting Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST. 2000). Patients can have the brain / meningeal metastasis history, but the metastasis must be treated by operation or radiotherapy), and clinically stable for at least 2 months. Adequate hematologic (neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/uL, platelets &gt;= 100,000/uL), hepatic (transaminase =&lt; upper normal limit(UNL)x2.5, bilirubin level =&lt; UNLx1.5), and renal (creatinine =&lt; UNL) function. Patient compliance that allow adequate followup. Informed consent from patient or patient's relative. APE1 IHC (++ or +++). If female: childbearing potential either terminated by surgery, radiation, or menopause, or attenuated by use of an approved contraceptive method (intrauterine device [IUD], birth control pills, or barrier device) during and for 2 months after trial. If male, use of an approved contraceptive method during the study and 2 months afterwards. Females with childbearing potential must have a urine negative HCG test within 7 days prior to the study enrollment. No concomitant prescriptions including cyclosporin A, valproic acid, phenobarbital, phenytoin, ketoconazole. Inability to comply with protocol or study procedures. Medically uncontrolled serious heart, lung, neurological, psychological, metabolic disease. Second primary malignancy that is clinically detectable at the time of consideration for study enrollment. Pregnant or breastfeeding. Enrollment in other study within 30 days. Brain metastasis with symptoms. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis history.</criteria>
