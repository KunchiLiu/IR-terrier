	<brief_summary>Among all patients hospitalized for Threatened Premature Delivery (TPD), the rate of premature birth (PB) before 37 weeks is about 42%, which reflects the inability to accurately identify patients at high risk of PB. Currently, no clinical or biological marker is recognized as the most reliable in predicting the real risk of AP in case of MAP. The purpose of this study is to improve the knowledge of predictors of preterm delivery compared with conventional blood markers by estimating serum procalcitonin according to premature delivery or not in patients hospitalized for preterm labor .</brief_summary>
