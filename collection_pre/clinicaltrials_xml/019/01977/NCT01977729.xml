	<brief_title>Sequencing CBT for Child Anxiety: CBT Plus Sertraline Versus Switch to Sertraline</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project proposes to conduct a pilot study to collect preliminary data on a 'personalized adaptive treatment' approach for children and adolescents with anxiety disorders. All youth patients in this two site study will first receive CBT and all then will be re-assessed at mid-treatment (8 sessions). Patients who show a partial response or no response following 8 sessions of CBT will be randomized to either a switch to SRT alone or CBT augmentation with SRT.</detailed_description>

If participating in Phase II of the project (i.e., sertraline [SRT] vs. CBT + SRT) and they are sexually active, they must be using an appropriate method of birth control. Of additional note is that it is an allowable possibility to include children who have coexisting psychiatric diagnoses of lesser severity than the three target disorders including attention deficithyperactivity disorder (ADHD) while receiving stable doses of stimulant, obsessive compulsive, posttraumatic stress, oppositional defiant, and conduct disorders. meet for primary diagnosis of any DSM5 disorder other than GAD, SOP, and SAD have any of the following disorders (e.g., primary, secondary, tertiary) Pervasive Developmental Disorders, Mental Retardation, Selective Mutism, Organic Mental Disorders, Bipolar Disorder, Tourette's Disorder, Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders.
