	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to analyze peritonitis rate and peritonitis bacteriology as risk factors for loss of residual renal function, technique failure and mortality in chronic kidney disease patients. Secondary objectives are: To know the current rate of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis population and to understand the bacteriological profile of peritonitis. To know the rate and risk factors other than peritonitis involved in the loss of residual renal function. To analyze the utility of alternative diagnostic tests, such as reagent strips, for early detection of peritonitis when traditional tests are not available. To analyze the simultaneous measurement of serum creatinine and cystatin-C as alternative measurements of peritoneal clearance and residual renal function.</brief_summary>
