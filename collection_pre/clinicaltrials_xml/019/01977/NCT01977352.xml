	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the quality and duration of pain relief after shoulder surgery provided by a single injection of liposomal bupivacaine versus standard bupivacaine when administered as an interscalene brachial plexus block. It is hypothesized that the liposomal bupivacaine formulation will provide more effective pain relief than standard bupivacaine.</brief_summary>
