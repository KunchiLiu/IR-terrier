	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of topical tacrolimus 0.05% twice a day in the treatment of ocular graft versus host disease (GVHD). A secondary objective is to compare the efficacy of topical tacrolimus 0.05% drops compared with topical methylprednisolone sodium succinate 0.5% drops in patients with ocular GVHD. 40 patients with ocular GVHD who meet the inclusion criteria of the study as determined by a screening visit will be divided into two equal groups. In addition to their current medication, one group will receive the topical tacrolimus 0.05% drops and the other group will receive the topical methylprednisolone sodium succinate 0.5% drops. The participants will then have two follow-up visits at the week 5 and week 10 markers after their screening visit. To evaluate the purpose of the study as well as the patient's safety, the following procedures will be performed at each visit: a comprehensive eye examination, tear break-up time (TBUT), Schirmer's test, intraocular pressure (IOP), fundoscopy and grading scores of lid margin and corneal fluorescein staining. The following questionnaires will be administered at each visit: Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye (SANDE). Impression cytology specimens will be taken only at the screening visit and at the week 10 visit.</brief_summary>
