	<brief_title>To Study the Safety and Clinical Outcomes of the Absorb Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (BVS) System in Patients With de Novo Lesions in Previously Untreated Vessels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ABSORB UK registry is a prospective, single arm, post-market registry designed to: - Provide ongoing post-market surveillance for documentation of safety and clinical outcomes of the Absorb Everolimus Eluting BVS System in daily percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) practice per Instructions for Use (IFU, on-label use). - Collect additional information (e.g. acute success) to evaluate handling and implantation of Absorb BVS by physicians under a wide range of commercial use conditions and following routine clinical practice.</detailed_description>
