	<brief_title>Rest-exercise Transition Training to Improve Cardiac Vagal Tone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allocating in the admission for a supervised exercise program all subjects evaluated with low cardiac vagal tone (cardiac vagal index ≤ 1,30), it is expected that from a sample of almost 150 subjects (all over 18 years-old, ranging mostly from 40 to 50), we will compare 50 subjects that adhered to the supervised exercise program ( more than 65% of expected presence). Patients with pacemaker on unable to exercise in the bicycle will be excluded from the study, as well as those who does not adhere to at least more than 65% of the expected presence in the supervised exercise program. All the sample will be randomized to performed 8 weeks of a specific sudden rest-exercise training and after 8 weeks will discontinue the protocol, or will do the opposite ( 8 weeks of no specific protocol, followed by 8 weeks of specific sudden rest-exercise training). The cardiac vagal will be evaluated at every 8 weeks to measure the cardiac vagal index between both phases. During all the time, all clients will perform aerobic, strength and flexibility exercises as part of the supervised exercise program.</detailed_description>
