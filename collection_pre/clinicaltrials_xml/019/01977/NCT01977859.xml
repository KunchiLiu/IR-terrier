	<brief_title>BNP Pharmacodynamics and Effects on Metabolism in Lean and Obese Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity is major metabolic health concern and the potential beneficial effects of natriuretic peptides, specifically B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) on adipocyte biology, energy expenditure and body weight could be of great significance. This study will provide insight into the mechanisms of dysregulation of the natriuretic peptides system in obesity and will contribute to delineate the roles and the clinical importance of BNP in the treatment of obesity.</detailed_description>
