	<detailed_description>This novel intervention, delivered to mothers primarily through private Facebook groups, will promote behavior change through peer and self-modeling photo/video activities. In this study, we will implement an abbreviated 2-month version of the intervention with a single peer group of up to 10 mothers. We will assess the feasibility and acceptability of both the intervention and our intended outcome measures, in preparation for a randomized pilot trial of the full intervention.</detailed_description>
