	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the quality and duration of pain relief after a total knee replacement provided by a single shot of standard bupivacaine versus a single shot of liposomal bupivacaine, at the site of the femoral nerve. It is hypothesized that the liposomal bupivacaine formulation will provide more effective pain relief than standard bupivacaine.</brief_summary>
