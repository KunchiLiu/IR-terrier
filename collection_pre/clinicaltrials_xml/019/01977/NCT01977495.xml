	<brief_summary>The investigator plans to assess enrollment rates among two different enrollment methods, while providing a behavioral economic intervention to enhance the uptake of home-health monitoring devices to lower hemoglobin A1C among patients with uncontrolled diabetes. The study is focusing on enrollment methods since the standard randomized control trial only reaches 15% of the population. The study is seeking to understand the effectiveness of a behavioral intervention, when rolled out in a larger population.</brief_summary>
