	<brief_summary>This is an open-label non-randomized, multicenter, phase II study of BGJ398 administered to adult patients with histologically confirmed GBM and/or other glioma subtypes with FGFR1-TACC1, FGFR3-TACC3 fusion and/or activating mutation in FGFR1, 2 or 3.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study of BGJ398 in Patients With Recurrent GBM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be enrolled in two groups. Group 1 will enroll patients who are not candidates for surgery. Group 2 will enroll patients who are surgical candidates. Patients from both groups will be evaluated for tumor response and progression by MRI every 8 weeks until disease progression or discontinuation from study using RANO criteria.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Patients with histologically confirmed GBM and/or other glioma subtypes at the time of diagnosis or prior relapse. 2. Written documentation of local or central laboratory determination of amplification or translocation to FGFR1TACC1, FGFR3TACC3 fusion and/or activating mutation in FGFR1, FGFR2,or FGFR3 3. RANO defined tumor progression by MRI in comparison to a prior scan 4. Patients must have received prior external beam radiotherapy and temozolomide. Exclusion criteria: 1. History of another primary malignancy 2. Prior or current treatment with a FGFR inhibitor 3. Neurological symptoms related to underlying disease requiring increasing doses of corticosteroids 4. Patients must not be taking Enzyme Inducing AntiEpileptic Drug (EIAED). If previously on an EIAED, the patient must be off of it for at least two weeks prior to study treatment.</criteria>
