	<brief_summary>Evaluate efficacy and safety of 16 weeks of titrated dose treatment with BAY85-3934 versus epoetin alfa/beta as measured by hemoglobin (Hb) levels. Fixed starting doses of 25, 50,75 and 150 mg of BAY85-3934 titrated at the scheduled dose control visits. Titration will be based on the subject's Hb response and tolerability of the prior dose. Planned doses include 15, 25, 50, 75, 100,150 and 200 mg/day</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Eligible subjects will have a diagnosis of anemia associated with CKD(chronic kidney disease). Women without childbearing potential Male or female subject ≥ 18 years of age with anemia of CKD at screening On dialysis, defined as regular longterm hemodialysis, with the same modality of dialysis for ≥ 3 months before randomization Dialysis vascular access via native arteriovenous fistula, synthetic graft, longterm catheters, or longterm tunneled catheters Treated with epoetin alfa (US or Japan) or epoetin beta (Japan) via intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) route, on stable dosing defined as a &lt; 50% change from the maximum prescribed weekly dose with no change in the prescribed frequency during the last 8 weeks prior to randomization At least one kidney Mean screening Hb concentration 9.0 to 11.5 g/dL inclusive (mean of all local laboratory Hb measurements [at least 2 measurements must be taken ≥ 2 days apart] during the 4 week screening period, AND none of the measurements can be &lt; 9.0 g/dL or &gt; 12.0 g /dL Serum ferritin levels ≥ 100 μg/L OR transferrin saturation ≥ 20% at screening. Iron substitution is allowed Folate and vitamin B12 levels above the lower limit of normal. Supplementation is allowed Subjects with significant acute or chronic bleeding, such as overt gastrointestinal bleeding Hereditary hemoglobinopathies (including, but not limited to, sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia, and thalassemia major) which may be the primary cause of anemia Chronic lymphoproliferative diseases Any allograft (including renal allograft) in place and on immunosuppressive therapy, or a scheduled kidney transplant within the next 16 weeks (being on a waiting list does not exclude the subject) Chronic inflammatory disease that could impact erythropoiesis (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosis, rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease) Subjects treated with immuno or myelosuppressive therapy within 8 weeks prior to randomization: e.g., everolimus, sirolimus, rituximab, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid, cyclosporine,methotrexate, and tacrolimus, chemotherapeutic agents and other anticancer agents, and systemic steroids (except inhaled steroids) for 7 days RBCcontaining transfusion within 8 weeks before randomization History of cardio (cerebro) vascular events (e.g., unstable angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) within the last 6 months from the initial screening visit Sustained, poorly controlled arterial hypertension or hypotension at screening, defined as a mean BP ≥ 180/110 mmHg or systolic BP &lt; 95 mmHg, respectively Severe rhythm or conduction disorder (e.g., HR &lt; 50 or &gt; 110 bpm, atrial flutter, prolonged QT &gt;500 msec, second or third degree atrioventricular [AV]block if not treated with a pacemaker) New York Heart Association Class III or IV congestive heart failure Severe hepatic insufficiency (defined as alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], or gammaglutamyl transferase &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN], total bilirubin &gt; 2 mg/dL, or ChildPugh B or C) or active hepatitis in the investigator's opinion A scheduled surgery that may be expected to lead to significant blood loss</criteria>
