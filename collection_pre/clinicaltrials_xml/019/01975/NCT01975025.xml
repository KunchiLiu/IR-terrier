	<brief_summary>The aim of this clinical research project is to test the hypothesis that daily dialysis has favorable effects on the calcification propensity of human serum, when determined by the investigators' newly developed in vitro serum test. The investigators' hypothesis is that shorter interdialytic intervals will result in an improved calcification propensity of serum. The determination of serum calcification has the potential to become a novel measure of dialysis quality in the future.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background The serum calcification test has been established and validated by A. Pasch and coworkers, the expertise to perform the necessary statistical analyses is present in the investigator's department, all patient-related procedures necessary for this project are routinely performed in the investigator's department. Objective Does short daily hemodialysis strengthen the calcification-inhibitory forces inherent in hemodialysis patient sera, when compared to conventional three-times weekly hemodialysis? Methods Serum calcification test</detailed_description>
