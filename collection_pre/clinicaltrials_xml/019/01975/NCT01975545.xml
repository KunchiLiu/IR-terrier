	<brief_summary>Patients with trisomy 21 are in greater danger of developing caries. It has been hypothesized that adding silver nanoparticles to fluor varnishes could promote remineralization of the teeth. A split-plot randomized controlled trial will be performed to address this question.</brief_summary>
