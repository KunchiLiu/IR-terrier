	<brief_summary>To determine if treatment of significant depressive symptoms identified in individuals attending a family practice improves either psychiatric outcome, overall health care costs, or Quality of Life (QOL). Two previously developed treatment approaches - an internet-based approach and a comprehensive depression pathway - will be compared to two control groups (those who have treatment as usual after screening for depression and measurement of QOL, and a second control group who will have QOL data only collected). The investigators hope to help Alberta Health Services identify which approach is best as rapidly as possible so that the best approach can be implemented throughout the province of Alberta.</brief_summary>
