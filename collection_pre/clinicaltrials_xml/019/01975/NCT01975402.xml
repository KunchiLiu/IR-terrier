	<brief_title>Evaluation of the BodyGuardian End-to-end Remote Monitoring Platform in an Outpatient Heart Failure Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall objective of our research is to test, adapt, refine and validate the BodyGuardian technology and related end-to-end remote monitoring system to be used outside usual medical care environments to reduce hospital readmissions and facilitate independent living for HF patients. An important component of our overall strategy for continued development and refinement of the remote monitoring system is the incorporation of iterative behavioral evaluations to facilitate assessment and refinement in order to optimize adherence, utilization, and usability for patients as well as efficiency and functionality for providers.</detailed_description>
