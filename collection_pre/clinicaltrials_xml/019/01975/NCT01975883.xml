	<brief_title>Glycemic Instability After Spine Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Blood glucose (BG) dysregulation is a well-known situation in medical or surgical severe circumstances. However BG levels following spine surgery have never been described before. Our primary purpose is to measure postoperative changes in BG levels of non-diabetic patients undergoing spine surgery. Methods: Non-diabetic consecutive adult patients undergoing spine surgery are going to be prospectively included during a 6 months period. BG capillary measures are collected from the preoperative fasting period to the end of postoperative day 3, six times a day. Three main glycemic parameters are calculated: Delta Day 0 (DD0), Day 2 mean (D2), and Hyperglycemic Index (HGI). In the peri operative period, no change in oral intake nor in intravenous fluids is prescribed. Patients are followed-up for three months postoperatively for any early adverse event, requiring or not surgical revision.</detailed_description>
