	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Health Program Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Through improvements in lifestyle choices regarding diet, exercise, sleep and stress management, the CHP Registry expects to find improvements in calculated risk for heart disease and stroke. Upon entry to the CHP Registry, subjects are given a detailed assessment of CVD risk through their reported past medical history, family history, review of systems, physical examination, laboratory data including lipid profile and glucose metabolism, electrocardiogram and/or exercise stress test, and carotid ultrasound for intima-medial thickness. Framingham risk score is calculated and in combination with other factors, a global score for CVD risk is appraised. Subjects then attend a half-day workshop on heart healthy behaviors including a cooking demonstration that promulgates a Mediterranean Diet. At approximately monthly intervals over a 6-month timeframe, subjects consult in 20 minute onsite appointments with a dietician, exercise physiologist, and stress management coach to work on behavioral improvements to encourage heart health. These onsite visits are then followed by 6 months of telephonic lifestyle coaching. At program's end, typically 12 months after enrollment in the Registry, subjects repeat their CVD risk assessment to receive a personal report card detailing the results of their therapeutic lifestyle changes.</detailed_description>
