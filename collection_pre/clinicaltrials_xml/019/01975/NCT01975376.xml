	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the PCSK9 inhibitor, Bococizumab (PF-04950615;RN316), compared to placebo, in reducing the occurrence of major cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and unstable angina requiring urgent revascularization, in high risk subjects who are receiving background lipid lowering therapy and have cholesterol laboratory values of LDL-C &gt;/= 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) or non-HDL-C &gt;/= 100 mg /dL (2.6 mmol/L).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Evaluation of Bococizumab (PF-04950615;RN316) in Reducing the Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Events in High Risk Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial was terminated prematurely on November 1, 2016, due to the emerging clinical profile and the evolving treatment and market landscape for lipid-lowering agents. These indicated that bococizumab was not likely to provide value to patients, physicians, or shareholders. The decision was not based on a recommendation by the independent Data Monitoring Committee to stop the program.</detailed_description>
