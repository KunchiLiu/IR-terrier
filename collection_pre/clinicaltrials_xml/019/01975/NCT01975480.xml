	<brief_summary>This is an open-label flexible-dose pilot study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Pristiq (desvenlafaxine) in outpatient subjects diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) with or without comorbidities that are secondary to the GAD. Primary trial objective is to evaluate the efficacy of Pristiq (desvenlafaxine) SNRI treatment 50 to 100 mg once daily in the treatment of GAD with or without comorbidities. Secondary trial objective is to determine whether or not treatment outcome in GAD is related to changes in cortical prefrontal activity of norepinephrine.</brief_summary>

Those who have been on fluoxetine, will have been off of it for at least 5 weeks. Patients who have been on a herbal or alternative treatment judged to be potentially anxiolytic or with psychobiological activity (e.g. St. John's Wort, Sadenosylmethionine), will have terminated usage of the agent more than two weeks prior to entering the study. Scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) &gt; 15, at screening visit 1 Laboratory values at screening or in medical history that may be considered through clinical interpretation to be significant. Diseases that could through clinical interpretation interfere with the assessments of safety, tolerability and efficacy. Serious illness: Liver or renal insufficiency, cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurological, infectious, neoplastic or metabolic disturbance. If female, the subject is pregnant or lactating or intending to become pregnant before, during or within 30 days after participating in this study; or intending to donate ova during such time period. The subject has received electroconvulsive therapy, vagal nerve stimulation, or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation within 6 months prior to Screening.
