	<brief_summary>This is a 2 by 2 cross-over study to evaluate pharmacokinetics of telmisartan and rosuvastatin FDC compared to reference telmisartan and rosuvastatin coadministered in two groups enrolling healthy adult male and female subjects under fasting conditions. Subjects will be admitted to the clinic in the evening before Day 1. All subjects will receive a single oral dose of telmisartan/rosuvastatin FDC or telmisartan and rosuvastatin co-administered in the morning on Day 1. All the subjects will remain in the clinical unit until completion of all assessments on Day 2 including collection post-dose PK sample. Subjects will return to the clinic for pharmacokinetic samples at scheduled time. The two treatment periods will be separated by a washout period.</brief_summary>
