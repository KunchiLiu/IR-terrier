	<detailed_description>Skill-based approaches are effective in reducing stigma in health professionals Objective: Review skill-based approaches to reducing stigma in health professionals Overview: The NS Department of Health and Wellness and the Mental Health Commission of Canada launched a demonstration project in Nova Scotiaâ€”Adult Mental Health Practice Support Program. Originating in British Columbia, it uses a novel learning platform which supports primary healthcare providers with treatment and management of mental illness. We hypothesized that enhanced skills in program participants would lead to increased comfort on the part of practitioners, diminished social distance and stigmatization. Methods: 110 NS family physicians and their office staff were assigned to intervention or control group in a double blind, parallel-cluster RCT to determine program's impact on stigma, comfort level providing mental illness treatment, clinical outcomes, and economics. Intervention group participants attended 3 half-day workshops with a "6-week action period" between workshops to practice learnings. Practice support was provided through diagnostic assessment tools, evidence based self-management tools, and on-site practice support coordinator support. Results: We will review impact on stigma, comfort level providing mental illness treatment, clinical outcomes, economics, best practice integration approaches contributing to programs feasibility and sustainability. Conclusion: Reducing stigma is key to improved patient care, and greater collaboration between the formal mental health and primary care system. Skill-based strategies can be a promising approach to diminish stigma in health care providers. These results will encourage a broader adoption of the program provincially and nationally.</detailed_description>
