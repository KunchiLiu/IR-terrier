	<brief_summary>Patients with metastatic breast cancer considered HER2 negative are screened for HER2-amplified circulating tumor cells. If at least HER2-amplified circulating tumor cell is detected, patients are treated by Trastuzumab - Emtansine (T-DM1) in a single arm phase II with an adaptive design.</brief_summary>
