	<brief_summary>Question: Does manual diaphragm release change kinematics and respiratory function of elderly subjects? Design: Randomized controlled trial with concealed allocation and double-blinding. Participants: 17 volunteers over 60 years old randomized into two groups: 09 in the Control Group (CG) and 08 in the Intervention Group (IG). Intervention: The manual diaphragm release technique was used on the IG, in two sets of ten deep breaths, with a one minute interval between them. The CG underwent a sham protocol (light touch), with same sets and time of interval. Outcome measures: The groups were evaluated using spirometry, manovacuometry and optoelectronic plethysmography (OEP), in that order, before and immediately after the intervention.</brief_summary>
