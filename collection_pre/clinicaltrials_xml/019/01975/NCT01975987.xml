	<brief_title>Characteristics to Predict Successful Intubation With the Bonfils Fiberscope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endotracheal intubation is an important act in the practice of anesthesiology. Direct laryngoscopy is the most commonly used technique to accomplish this task. Airway characteristics predicting difficult intubation with direct laryngoscopy are well defined. Physical findings, such as Mallampati classification or measurements of the thyromental distance, mouth opening, and neck extension have been validated to help anticipate difficult situations. When direct laryngoscopy is strenuous, early conversion to an alternative technique might reduce the risk of airway compromise and associated morbidity. Many intubation devices are now available and part of the anesthesiologist's task is to select the alternative approach best suited to each patient's specific features. Despite its use for both elective and unexpectedly difficult intubation, predictive criteria for successful airway management with the Bonfils fiberscope have not been proposed. The purpose of this study is to identify patients' features, if any, that could predict successful intubation when using the Bonfils fiberscope for perioperative orotracheal intubation in an elective surgical population.</detailed_description>
