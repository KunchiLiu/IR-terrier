	<brief_summary>The anorectal manometry is the gold standard in the evaluation of anorectal function. Several techniques are currently used (balloons, perfused catheters) and are always performed in the supine position. Few studies have reported the evaluation of sphincter function in the upright position, whereas symptoms of fecal incontinence occur in this position. Recently developed, high-resolution manometry, thanks to its many mechanical sensors, allows topographic analysis and evaluation of anorectal function more acurate. In addition, the rigid nature of the probe should allow stability measures / recording, which is not possible with probes perfused catheters example. We therefore propose to compare anal sphincter pressure in supine and standing, measured in high-resolution manometry.</brief_summary>
