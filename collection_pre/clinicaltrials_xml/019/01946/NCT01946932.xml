	<brief_summary>This is a steering group approved substudy to the Target Temperature Management trial (TTM, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01020916). TTM compares the effect of two strictly controlled temperature regimes for survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The primary aim of this sub-study is to compare the amount of cognitive impairment in cardiac arrest survivors treated with 33 degrees and 36 degrees and with a matched group of control patients with myocardial infarction. Our secondary aims are: - To investigate the impact of cognitive impairment on our patients' ability to participate in society and their health related quality of life. - To investigate the relationship between our patients cognitive impairments and their relatives/informants health related quality of life and feelings of burden. - To test the hypothesis that the simple cognitive screening battery used in the TTM main trial is sensitive enough to detect all patients with significant cognitive disability.</brief_summary>
