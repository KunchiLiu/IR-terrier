	<criteria>ICD10 diagnosis of schizophrenia (F20.0020.39, F20.5, F20.9) who have had the disorder for at least 5 years and who are on disability pension. (This means that their treatment response is not satisfactory and for the purpose of this study, the subjects are potentially treatment resistant). Clinical Global Impression (CGI) severity score of at least 3. No changes in schizophrenia treatment within 12 weeks before study inclusion. Written informed consent The subjects must fulfil schizophrenia criteria both according to DSM IV (295.10, .20, .30, .60, .90) (American Psychiatric association) and the Research Diagnostic Criteria for schizophrenia (RDC) [40]. They must also have at least mild residual symptoms (CGI 3 points). The DSMIV diagnosis will be verified by use of the SCIDI [41]. The DSMIV is clearly the most commonly used in psychiatric research, so this is important to be able to generalize the findings. However, several previous studies have used the RDC, so to be able to compare the results, we will diagnose the patients according to both systems. Women of childbearing age will be included only of they use adequate contraception, or if we can otherwise verify that the subject is not pregnant (sHCG), the possibility of pregnancy is negligible (e.g. the personnel of the housing facility reports that the person has not had sexual relationships for years) and the subject approves to remain sexually abstinent for the duration of the study. Epilepsy or a history of unclear seizures, stroke, Parkinson's disease, AIDS History of substance addiction or abuse within 3 months prior to enrolment. Individuals who are deemed at risk for aggressive behaviour or suicide If their laboratory tests, EKG or other clinical observation warrants exclusion, they will be excluded Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding subjects will not be included in the study. Patients with any serious unstable physical illness will also be excluded Patients who have been deemed to be legally incapacitated according to Finnish or Swedish law. Regular Uuse of H2antagonists as prescribed by a physician. Known allergy to famotidine or any other component of interventional drug will be excluded. Ongoing treatment with clozapine and dixyrazine. Clinical condition "very much improved" or "much improved", assessed by CGI, during the placebo leadin Renal insufficiency (Pcreatinine not within normal range. Glomerular filtration rate &lt;30 ml/min according to the CockcroftGault formula. ) Liver insufficiency (SALAT elevated more than 2fold above the laboratory specific normal range)</criteria>
