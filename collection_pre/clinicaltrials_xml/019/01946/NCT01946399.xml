	<detailed_description>To determine whether Ozurdex implant can offer an efficacious alternative for treatment of macular edema in the setting of retinal vein occlusion when treatment with intravitreal bevacizumab (Avastin),ranibizumab (Lucentis), and/or aflibercept (Eylea) have not demonstrated significant response.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patients with Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) with available initial imaging and documented treatment failure with bevacizumab, ranibizumab, or aflibercept. Treatment failure is defined as lack of anatomic improvement (persistent intraretinal cystic changes/macular edema with central subfield thickness greater than 250 microns on timedomain OCT or greater than 275 microns on spectral domain OCT) with lack of visual improvement (less than 2 lines of visual gain by Snellen acuity), despite 3 to 6 intravitreal antiVEGF treatments over the preceding 6 months. Coexisting or preexisting macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema, or other confounding disease processes Interval surgical intervention, such as cataract surgery, that may confound visual outcomes. Pregnancy Coexisting conditions that would represent relative or absolute contraindications usage of ozurdex implant, including: Ocular or periocular infections (including viral disease of the cornea and conjunctiva such as active epithelial herpes simplex keratitis, vaccinia, varicella, mycobacterial infection, and fungal diseases) Advanced glaucoma Aphakic eyes with rupture or missing posterior lens capsule Eyes with anterior chamber intraocular lens and missing posterior lens capsule Patients with known hypersensitivity to components of this product</criteria>
