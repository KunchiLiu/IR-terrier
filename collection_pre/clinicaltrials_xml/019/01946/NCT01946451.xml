	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of selected genes both in epiretinal membranes (ERMs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with primary and secondary epiretinal membranes in proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Possible correlations between messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels of these genes were also identified.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Caucasian race, both males and females, aged â‰¥ 55 years, suffering from idiopathic ERMs or secondary ERMs in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Presence of ERM was proven in optical coherence tomography (OCT) examination. Exclusion criteria: aged &lt; 55 years, systemic connective tissue disease, active inflammatory process</criteria>
