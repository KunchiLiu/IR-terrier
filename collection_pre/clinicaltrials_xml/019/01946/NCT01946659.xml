	<brief_summary>This is a randomized controlled Trial to evaluate effect of a culturally and linguistically tailored, telephone-delivered behavioral intervention on adherence to recommended assessment and treatment of sleep apnea in Blacks with Metabolic Syndrome. The investigators believe low awareness of Sleep Apnea and the risk it imposes to an individual health plays an important role in underdiagnosis and low adherence to treatment among Blacks. Hence, culturally and linguistically tailored health education will decrease the knowledge gap and improve adherence to recommended assessment and treatment of sleep Apnea. the investigators believe the effect of adherence to treatment of Sleep apnea is shown to improve the components of Metabolic syndrome and hence promote well control of Hypertension, Diabetes, weight, triglyceride and cholesterol.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary aim: To evaluate effect of a culturally and linguistically tailored, telephone-delivered behavioral intervention, versus an attention-control condition, on adherence to recommended assessment and treatment of sleep apnea. Secondary aims: 1) To evaluate the maintenance of intervention effects on adherence 6 months post-intervention; and 2) To assess treatment effects on components of the metabolic syndrome (waist circumference, blood pressure, lipid level, and fasting plasma glucose/HbA1C). Exploratory aim: To identify the mediators of adherence to recommended sleep apnea assessment and treatment following exposure to the intervention.</detailed_description>
