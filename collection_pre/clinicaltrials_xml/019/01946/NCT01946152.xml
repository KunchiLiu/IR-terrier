	<brief_summary>The goal of Part 1 of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of pomalidomide that can be given in combination with dexamethasone and neupogen (filgrastim) to patients with relapsed or refractory MM. The goal of Part 2 of this study is to learn if the drug combination can help to control MM. The safety of this drug combination will be studied in both parts.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone With Growth Factor Support in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study group based on when you join this study. Up to 7 groups of up to 6 participants each will be enrolled in Part 1 of the study and up to 19 participants will be enrolled in Part 2. Induction Phase: If you are enrolled in Part 1, the dose of pomalidomide you receive will depend on when you joined this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of pomalidomide. Each new group will receive a higher dose of pomalidomide than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. Up to 7 dose levels will be studied. If you are enrolled in Part 2, you will receive pomalidomide at the highest dose that was tolerated in Part 1. All participants will receive the same dose level of dexamethasone and filgrastim. The induction phase will last for 6 cycles. Maintenance Phase: After Cycle 6, participants in both parts will enter the maintenance phase. You will receive a lower dose of pomalidomide then you were receiving during induction. You will receive the same dose level of dexamethasone that you were receiving during induction. You will not receive filgrastim during the maintenance phase. Study Drug Administration: Each cycle is 28 days. During Induction: - You will take pomalidomide by mouth on Days 1-21. - You will take dexamethasone by mouth on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22. - You will receive filgrastim through a needle under the skin on Days 22-28. During Maintenance: - You will take pomalidomide by mouth on Days 1-21 of every cycle. - You will take dexamethasone by mouth on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of every cycle. If you miss a dose of pomalidomide, take it as soon as you can that same day. If you miss a day completely, do not make up the dose up the next day. If you take more than your prescribed dose of pomalidomide, seek emergency medical care, if needed, and contact your study doctor right away. Pomalidomide should be taken without food, at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after a meal. You or your caregiver will be given instructions on how to administer the filgrastim injection at home. Study Visits: Induction Phase: On Day 1 of Cycles 1-6: - You will have a physical exam. - You will have a neurological exam. - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - Blood (about 1 teaspoon) and/or urine will be collected to check the status of the disease. If urine is collected, you will collect the urine over a 24-hour period. You will be provided with a container to collect the urine in. - If you can become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1½ tablespoons) or urine pregnancy test. On Days 8, 15, and 22 of Cycles 1-6: - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - If you can become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1½ tablespoons) or urine pregnancy test. Maintenance Phase: On Day 1 of every cycle: - You will have a physical exam. - You will have a neurological exam. - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - Blood (about 1 teaspoon) and/or urine will be collected to check the status of the disease. If urine is collected, you will collect the urine over a 24-hour period. You will be provided with a container to collect the urine in. - If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow biopsy and/or aspiration to check the status of the disease. - If you can become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1½ tablespoons) or urine pregnancy test. - If you were found to have plasmacytomas at screening, you may have CT scans, PET/CT scans, or MRI to measure them. If you are not at MD Anderson, the routine blood draws can be done at your regular doctor's office. Length of Study: You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed your long-term follow-up. End-of-Study Drug Visit: After you finish taking the study drugs: - You will have a physical exam. - You will have a neurological exam. - You will have an EKG. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests and to check your thyroid. - Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check how well your blood clots. - Blood (about 1 teaspoon) and/or urine will be collected to check the status of the disease. If urine is collected, you will collect the urine over a 24-hour period. You will be provided with a container to collect the urine in. - If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have x-rays of your entire body to check for any bone fractures or tumors in the bone. - If you can become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1½ tablespoons) or urine pregnancy test. - If you were found to have plasmacytomas at screening, you may have CT scans, PET/CT scans, or MRI to measure them. Long Term Follow-Up: After your end-of-study drug visit, you will be called every 3 months for 1 year and every 6 months after that to see how you are doing. These calls will take about 2-3 minutes. This is an investigational study. Pomalidomide is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of multiple myeloma in patients whose disease has not gotten worse within 60 days after receiving at least 2 prior therapies (including lenalidomide and bortezomib).The combination of pomalidomide, dexamethasone, and filgrastim to treat MM is investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study drug(s) are designed to work. Up to 55 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
