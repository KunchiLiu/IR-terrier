	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether combination of TS-1 and concurrent and short-course radiotherapy is feasible in metastatic pancreatic cancer. The rationale of this study primarily bases on the good efficacy of gemcitabine plus TS-1 and the great potential of local control of concurrent chemoradiotherapy in pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
