	<brief_summary>Acute renal failure is a common complication in intensive care unit patients. In 10% of cases renal replacement therapy becomes necessary. Current devices have increase filter patency and efficacy. However, magnesium, calcium and phosphate are eliminated as well. However, the extend of this elimination hase not been quantified. Thus, we want to 1. record retrospectively how often abnormal values for phosphate, magnesium and calcium occurred during routine renal replacement therapy in 2011 and 2012. 2. prospectively evaluate the same parameters during routine treatment in 2013 and 2014</brief_summary>
