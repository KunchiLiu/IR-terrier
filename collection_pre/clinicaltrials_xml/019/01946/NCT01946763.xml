Elligibles patients are informed and consented by anesthesiologist. Patients are randomized in 2 groups (G1: educated, G2:non-educated) Patient of G1 are educated in OR before starting anesthesia. This education includes : information about anesthesia emergence, recovery and extubation. Anesthesia and education are conducted by the same anesthesiologist. All patients are operated by the same surgeon. All patients receive same balanced general anesthesia protocol. The recovery starts immediately after the end of the procedure, when the patient has BIS ≥90 and TOF≥9. Recovery assessment and data recording is done by a blinded anesthesiologist.</detailed_description>
