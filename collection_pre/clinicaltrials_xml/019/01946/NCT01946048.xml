	<brief_title>Umbilical Cord Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Therapy in Ischemic Cardiomyopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a common disorder that can lead to heart failure. Not all people with CAD are eligible for today's standard treatments. One new treatment approach uses umbilical cord blood derived mesenchymal stem cells—specialized cells capable of developing into other types of cells—to stimulate growth of new blood vessels for the heart. The aim of the present study is to investigate safety and efficacy of intramyocardial implantation of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy .</detailed_description>
