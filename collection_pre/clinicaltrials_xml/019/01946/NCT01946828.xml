	<brief_summary>The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the FIM optimal configuration and confirm the safety and performance/efficacy of the FIM when exposed to a larger and more varied population of users.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the FIM - a Non Invasive Device for Temporarily and Quick Pupil Dilation (Mydriasis)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>70 Eligible subjects will be enrolled to the study and examined with the FIM to determine the degree of pupil dilation/Contraction resistance. The study will be conducted in two main stages: 1) pupil dilation measuring and 2) functional examination. The tests' sequence will be randomized, at least 30 minutes between each test.</detailed_description>
