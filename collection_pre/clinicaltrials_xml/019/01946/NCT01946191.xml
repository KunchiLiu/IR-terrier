	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test whether online tracking tools and weight maintenance coaching visits for patients and real-time electronic progress reports for primary care providers (PCPs) [Continued Coaching (CC)] will support more successful weight maintenance than online tracking tools alone [Tracking Only (TO)] in a group of primary care patients who have lost â‰¥ 5% of their body weight.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators aim to address the key problem of how to implement U.S.Preventive Services Task Force obesity treatment recommendations in a cost-effective manner. The investigators propose a Randomized Clinical Trial - Maintaining Activity and Nutrition through Technology-Assisted Innovation in Primary Care (MAINTAIN-PC) - to test whether a group of primary care patients who have lost at least 5% of their body weight in the past year will be more likely to maintain their weight loss with a multifaceted intervention that includes online tracking tools, web-based "coaching" visits, and PCP engagement through real time electronic progress reports with counseling tips than when using online tracking tools alone. By integrating this intervention within an existing electronic health record and clinical flow, the investigators maximize potential for future dissemination. The MAINTAIN-PC study draws upon recommendations for the design of practical clinical and behavioral trials. The investigators will assess multiple relevant outcomes across clinically meaningful treatment strategies. The investigators will recruit a sample that is diverse in terms of gender, BMI and co-morbidity status, with a racial/ethnic mix reflective of the region, and that includes Agency for Healthcare Research Quality priority populations. The investigators will include clinical practices with diverse characteristics, and have selected interventionists who reflect the level of training typically seen among primary care clinic staff. The investigators will recruit 30-40 participants a month, with recruitment lasting 5-6 months, and each participant in both CC and TO arms receiving a 30 month intervention. The last year of the study will focus on analyses, including cost-effectiveness analyses.</detailed_description>
