	<brief_summary>Transient elastography (TE)is the reference method to identify liver stiffness (LSM) but fails to obtain a measurement in 3% of cases and results are considered unreliable in 16%. The aim of this study is to evaluate the applicability and diagnostic accuracy of TE performed by trained operators (&lt;500 explorations), after a second evaluation by experienced explorers (&gt;500 explorations) and after a third exploration using XL probe. Inadequate LSM will be re-evaluated by experienced operators with the M (standard size) probe. A third register will be performed with XL (obese size) probe in those patients with inadequate M probe determination. Diagnostic accuracy will be estimated in patients with liver biopsy to identify significant fibrosis with a TE cut-off value of 7.6 kPa (kilo pascal).</brief_summary>
