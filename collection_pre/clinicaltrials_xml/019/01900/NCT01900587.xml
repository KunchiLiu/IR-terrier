	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate bio-equivalence of tapentadol extended-release (ER) tamper-resistant formulation (TRF) tablet, to the current tapentadol ER, prolonged-release formulation 2 (PR2) tablet, in healthy participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pivotal Study to Evaluate the Bio-equivalence of the Tapentadol Extended-Release (ER) Tamper-resistant Formulation (TRF) Tablet to the Current Tapentadol ER Prolonged-release 2 (PR2) Tablet</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-dose, open-label (a medical research study in which participants and researchers are told which treatments the participants are receiving, "unblinded"), single-centre, randomized (like the flip of a coin; 50/50 chance of receiving a study treatment), and 2-way crossover (groups of participants receive two or more interventions in a particular order) study of a single-dose tapentadol in healthy participants under fasted conditions. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening (2 to 21 days before the study commences), Open-label Treatment (single-dose treatment on Day 1 of each period separated with wash-out period of 7 to 14 days) and End of study (Day 3 of treatment Period 2). The duration of participation in the study for an individual participant will be up to 5.5 weeks (including Screening). Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the 2 treatment sequence groups. Participants assigned to the first treatment sequence will receive tapentadol TRF 50 milligram (mg) tablet, and after a washout period, participants will receive tapentadol PR2 50-mg tablet. Participants assigned to the second treatment sequence will receive tapentadol PR2 50-mg tablet, and after washout period, participants will receive tapentadol TRF 50-mg tablet. Bio-equivalence will be primarily evaluated by pharmacokinetics parameters. Participant's safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Participants deemed healthy on the basis of prestudy physical examination, medical history (including smoking habits), 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, and clinical laboratory parameters (serum chemistry, serology and hematology) performed within 21 days before study drug administration Female participants must be postmenopausal, surgically sterile, or, if of childbearing potential/sexually active, be practicing an effective method of birth control throughout the study. Women must have a negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test at Screening and on Day 1 of each treatment period. Men must not impregnate their partners Participants with body mass index (BMI) (weight [kilogram {kg}]/height [meter {m}^2]) inbetween 20 to 28 kg/m^2, inclusive, and body weight not less than 50 kg Participants with blood pressure between 100 and 140 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) systolic, inclusive, and between 50 and 90 mmHg diastolic Participants who smokes no more than 10 cigarettes, or 2 cigars, or 2 pipes of tobacco per day for at least 6 months before the first study drug administration Participants with history of seizure disorder or epilepsy or mild or moderate traumatic brain injury, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or brain neoplasm within 1 year of screening, or severe traumatic brain injury within 15 years of screening, or severe traumatic brain injury resulting in ongoing squealed suggesting transient changes in consciousness or symptoms Participants with history of a gastrointestinal disease affecting absorption, gastric surgery or history of or current significant medical illness including cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac disease, hematologic disease, coagulation disorders, lipid abnormalities, significant pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, renal or hepatic insufficiency, thyroid disease, neurologic or psychiatric disease, infection, or any other illness that the Investigator considers should exclude the participants Participants who received an experimental drug or used an experimental medical device within 30 days or within a period less than 10 times the drug's halflife, whichever is longer, before the first dose of the study drug is scheduled or to participate in an investigational drug study for at least 60 days after completion of the study Participants who have positive test for drugs of abuse, such as cannabinoids, alcohol, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, benzodiazepines, or barbiturates at Screening or Day 1 of each treatment period Participants who donated blood or blood products or had substantial loss of blood (greater than 500 milliliter) within 2 months before the first administration of study drug</criteria>
