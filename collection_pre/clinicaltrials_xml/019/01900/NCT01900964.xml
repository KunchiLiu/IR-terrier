	<brief_summary>A non-resorbable PTFE (teflon) membrane will be compared to a resorbable collagen membrane when used for a post-extraction ridge preservation procedure to prevent the bone loss that typically occurs. The hypothesis is that there will be no difference in the clinical and histologic results between the two membranes.</brief_summary>
