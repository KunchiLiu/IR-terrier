	<brief_summary>For post-menopausal women diagnosed with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer tumors, aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are the standard adjuvant hormone treatment to prolong disease-free survival and time-to-recurrence. Unfortunately, joint pain/stiffness/achiness (arthralgia) is a common side-effect of AIs. This "proof-of-concept" study explores how an evidence-based physical activity (PA) program- the Arthritis Foundation's Walk with Ease (WWE) program- can be adapted for breast cancer survivors on AI therapy to: 1) Help them maintain or achieve recommended levels of PA, 2) reduce their joint pain/stiffness/achiness, and 3) thereby enable them to remain on AI therapy as prescribed.</brief_summary>
