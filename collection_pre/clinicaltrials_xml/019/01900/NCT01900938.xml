	<brief_title>Comparison Between Continuous Infusion and Intermittent Bolus Injection of Propofol for Deep Sedation During ERCP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patients undergone ERCP were randomly assigned to either continuous infusion of propofol (continuous group) or midazolam plus intermittent bolus injection of propofol (intermittent group) for deep sedation. In the continuous group, propofol was continuously administered via infusion pump and the doses were determined by sedation assistants monitoring the patients. In the intermittent group, a loading dose of 2 mg of midazolam and 0.4 mg/kg of propofol was initially injected and repeated bolus injection of 20 mg of propofol was followed according to patients' sedation level. Sedation related parameters (total dose of propofol, induction/recovery time, patients' cooperation) and adverse events during the procedure were evaluated. Satisfaction scores by endoscopist, assistant, and patients and difficulty scores of maintaining the sedation by assistants were also graded after the procedure.</detailed_description>
