	<brief_summary>To evaluate tolerance to and efficacy of bevacizumab in the treatment of MCRC in elderly patients, we propose a phase II randomised study comparing a chemotherapy + bevacizumab arm with a chemotherapy alone arm in the first-line treatment of MCRC in patients aged 75 years and older. This study is destined to continue as a phase III trial if both arms meet the selection criteria to show or not the benefits of treatment with bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients aged 75 years or older ECOG ≤2 histologically proven unresectable metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma Measurable lesion according to RECIST criteria Absence of prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Adjuvant chemotherapy following resection of the primary tumor is authorized if completed more than 6 months previously Patients treated with anticoagulants (coumadin, warfarin) can be included if close surveillance of the INR can be ensured.
