	<brief_summary>The purpose of this proposal is to compare the effectiveness of community health worker (CHW) support vs. usual primary care for helping chronically-ill, low-SES patients to improve control of chronic conditions. Upon enrollment each patient will select one of their multiple chronic conditions as a focus for the trial and work with his/her PCP to set a chronic disease management goal. Patients are then randomized to receive usual primary care vs. CHW support for moving towards that goal.</brief_summary>
