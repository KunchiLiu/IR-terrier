	<brief_summary>The project will specifically focus on the examination of the influence of substantial weight loss due to bariatric surgery on brain functions. Our hypothesis is that substantial weight loss after Bariatric Surgery (BS) is also accompanied by changes in the balance of reward and inhibitory networks in diabetic subjects. Therefore the investigators will conduct a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigating functional measures.</brief_summary>
