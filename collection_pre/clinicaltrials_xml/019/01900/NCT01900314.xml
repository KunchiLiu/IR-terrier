	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to learn more about how rTMS works to reduce the symptoms of depression. This information can be used to improve the effectiveness of the treatment. The study will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine changes in brain function after treatment with rTMS. fMRI is a safe and painless technique that allows investigators to observe the brain "at work." The investigators will use fMRI to see what regions of the brain become active when you perform a concentration task and how that activation is changed after rTMS.</brief_summary>
