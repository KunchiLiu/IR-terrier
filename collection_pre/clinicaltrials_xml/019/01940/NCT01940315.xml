	<brief_summary>This Phase 3 clinical trial is a double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter investigation of rBV A/B in male and female healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 3, Randomized, Safety, Lot Consistency and Clinical Benefit Study of Recombinant Botulinum Vaccine A/B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently, there are no licensed vaccines or pre-exposure prophylactic medical countermeasures available to provide protection against botulism. The rBV A/B is under development to provide protection of adults 18 to 55 years of age from fatal botulism caused by inhalational intoxication with botulinum neurotoxin complex (BoNT) serotype A, subtype A1 (BoNT/A1) and botulinum neurotoxin complex serotype B, subtype B1 (BoNT/B1). Volunteers will not be exposed to botulism. Protective antibody titers will be measured in serum after vaccination.</detailed_description>

The volunteer received any investigational vaccine in the previous 6 months. 8. The volunteer received or intends to receive any licensed nonliving vaccine within 14 days before or after a scheduled administration of study product. 9. The volunteer received or intends to receive any licensed live vaccine, including FluMist® within 60 days before or after a scheduled administration of study product. 10. Vaccination with commercially available inactivated or nonliving influenza vaccine preparations (other than FluMist®) if received 14 days before and after a scheduled administration of study product. 11.
