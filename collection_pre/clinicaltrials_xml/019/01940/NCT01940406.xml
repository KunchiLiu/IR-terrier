	<brief_summary>The current study is designed to test the hypothesis that targeted electrical stimulation will result in upper limb tremor reduction in ET and PD patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Essential Tremor (ET) and Parkinson Disease (PD) Tremor Acute Stimulation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate the effect of Rainbow Medical's stimulation procedure methodology that will be applied temporarily to patients suffering of tremor. This will be evaluated by assessment of reduction of tremor using accelerometer measurements, patient tremor evaluation diary, tremor rating scale, and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPRDS) part III.In addition,tasks for patient with tremor will be conducted before during and after the treatment. The above measurements will provide data on the stimulation procedure effect as compared to baseline.</detailed_description>
