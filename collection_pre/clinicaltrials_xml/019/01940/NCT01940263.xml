	<brief_summary>Oxidative stress and inflammation are involved in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Anthocyanins from different plant foods have been shown to improve features of experimental NASH, such as oxidative stress, dyslipidemia, liver steatosis, and inflammation in rodents. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether purified anthocyanin supplementation beneficially alters oxidative, inflammatory, and apoptotic biomarkers in adults with features of NAFLD.</brief_summary>
