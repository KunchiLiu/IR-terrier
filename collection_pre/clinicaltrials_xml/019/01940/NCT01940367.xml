	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether transcutaneous sacral nerve stimulation (TENS SNS) versus percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) is a more effective therapeutic option for subjects with idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB) who have failed conventional therapy. Our primary hypothesis is that TENS therapy is a more effective treatment option due to ease of use and improved subject compliance with this form of therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Electrical Nerve Stimulation for Overactive Bladder a Comparison of Treatments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To compare the long-term efficacy, subject compliance, and subject satisfaction of percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) therapy versus transcutaneous electrical sacral nerve stimulation (TENS) for the treatment of subjects with idiopathic overactive bladder. Previous short-term studies suggest that these therapies have equal efficacy in improving OAB symptoms, but we hypothesize that long-term efficacy and success is actually higher in the TENS group due to ease of use, since subjects can self-administer this therapy. Secondary goals are to evaluate subject quality of life improvement scores, bladder diary scores (change in the frequency of urination), and changes in urodynamic studies while undergoing these therapies.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Female Age &gt;18 years Predominant complaint urge urinary incontinence (3 or more episodes per week) OR overactive bladder (8 or more voids per day, and/or 2 or more voids per night) Failed trial of conservative therapy (bladder training, fluid modification, diet modification, caffeine restriction, pelvic floor training) Failed trial of anticholinergic either due to inability to take the medication, adverse reaction to medication, or no improvement on medication Willing and mentally competent to participate in study Willing to complete study questionnaires No contraindications to undergoing PTNS or TENS therapy Age &lt; 18 years Presence of urinary fistula Male. (Males will be excluded because of the different etiology of overactive bladder for males which is primarily caused by prostate problems for men versus the primarily idiopathic cause in women). Recurrent or current urinary tract infection (5 or more infections in the last 12 months) Bladder stones Bladder cancer or suspected bladder cancer Hematuria Pregnancy or planning to become pregnant during the study (urine pregnancy test will be administered to those who are premenopausal and who have not had a hysterectomy) Central or peripheral neurologic disorders such as Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, spina bifida, or other spinal cord lesion Metal implants such as pacemaker, implantable defibrillator, or metal implants where PTNS or TENS device needs to be placed (sacrum or ankle/leg). Uncontrolled diabetes Diabetes with peripheral nerve involvement On anticoagulants Current use of anticholinergics or use within the last 4 weeks Current use of botox bladder injections or bladder botox injection within the last year Current use of interstim therapy or currently implanted interstim device or leads Bladder outlet obstruction Urinary retention or gastric retention Painful Bladder Syndrome/Interstitial Cystitis</criteria>
