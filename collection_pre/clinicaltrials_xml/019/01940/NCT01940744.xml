	<brief_summary>This study is designed to compare the outcomes of two types of manual therapy techniques on patients with low back pain. Both immediate- and long-term outcomes will be examined. The investigators hypothesize there will be no differences between the two applied treatment techniques in immediate and longer-term assessments.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prescriptive Mobilization Versus a Pragmatic Mobilization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized clinical trial is designed to compare the outcomes of a prescriptively applied non-thrust manipulation to a pragmatically applied non-thrust manipulation on subjects with mechanical low back pain. The study has two primary aims. Specific Aim 1 examines immediate effect differences between a pragmatically applied localized non-thrust manipulation versus a prescriptively applied, non-localized non-thrust manipulation in subjects with mechanical low back pain. Specific Aim 2 examines longer-term differences between a pragmatically applied localized non-thrust manipulation versus a prescriptively applied, non-localized non-thrust manipulation in subjects with mechanical low back pain. The investigators hypothesize there will be no differences between the two applied treatment techniques in immediate and longer-term assessments.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients will need to be 18 years of age or older with mechanically producible LBP. They will require a minimum Modified Oswestry Disability Index score of 20% and a baseline pain score of &gt;2.0/10 on the numeric analog scale for pain, and a within session change (improvement during the visit) in pain and/or range of motion during the assessment phase of the clinical examination. The presence of any red flags (i.e., tumor, metabolic diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, prolonged history of steroid use, etc.), or signs consistent with nerve root compression (reproduction of low back or leg pain with straight leg raise at less than 45Â°, muscle weakness involving a major muscle group of the lower extremity, diminished lower extremity muscle stretch reflex, or diminished or absent sensation to pinprick in any lower extremity dermatome). Other exclusion criteria include prior surgery to the lumbar spine and current pregnancy. Lastly, if patients are enrolled in the study but do not receive a second outcome measure (follow up visit) they will be excluded from the final analyses.</criteria>
