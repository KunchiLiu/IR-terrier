	<brief_title>Comparison of AccuCath IV Catheter and Conventional IV Catheter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to evaluate user/physician preference as it relates to use of a 510(k) cleared vascular access peripheral IV catheter device compared with peripheral IV conventional needle/catheter devices, in terms of first stick success rates, adverse events and overall user and patient satisfaction. As noted above, the study is designed to formally test the hypothesis that the AccuCath™ System will exhibit superiority in terms of the rate of successful first attempt peripheral IV placement and higher user and patient satisfaction compared to Conventional IV Catheters.</detailed_description>
