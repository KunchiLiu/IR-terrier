Previous studies have found that POP molecular regulation mechanism of kidney Yang deficiency syndrome may be associated with LTBP1 gene expression. This topic using RT-PCR and Western Blot detection POP of kidney Yang deficiency group and healthy group LTBP1 mRNA and proteion's expression level,validate LTBP1 relevance to POP the kidney Yang deficiency syndrome.To provide a scientific basis for clinical treatment.</brief_summary>
