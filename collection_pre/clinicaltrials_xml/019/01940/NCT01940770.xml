	<detailed_description>To confirm the safety and efficacy of Bydureon (hereinafter referred to as Bydureon) in long-term use in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus under actual drug use. 1. Primary Objective To confirm the safety profile in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving Bydureon under daily practices. 2. Secondary objective As the secondary objective of this S-CEI, the following items are to be investigated. - Frequencies of AEs related to cardiovascular events, hypoglycaemia, digestive symptoms, and injection site reaction. - Development of pancreatitis, renal impairment (especially acute renal failure), hypersensitivity reaction, and malignant tumour (especially thyroid tumour and pancreatic malignancy) - Safety in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment - Changes of weight, blood pressure, pulse rate, fasting blood sugar, fasting insulin, HbA1c, and blood lipids - Bydureon administration under daily practices focusing on the patient's demographics and clinical characteristics of diabetes mellitus (duration of diabetes mellitus, treatment duration, complications, Bydureon administration, etc) - Anti-exenatide antibody titer in AE cases (hypersensitivity, loss of control of blood sugar)</detailed_description>
