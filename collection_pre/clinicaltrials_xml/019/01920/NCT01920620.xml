	<brief_summary>In this study we sought to determine whether inpatient weight loss counseling with post discharge phone follow-up would result in weight loss at six months. Secondary endpoints included weight change from baseline, changes in waist-to-hip ratios, assessment of weight perceptions and changes in patient reported health outcome measures. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized trial designed to evaluate the effects of an obesity intervention with post-discharge follow-up in an inpatient general medicine population.</brief_summary>
