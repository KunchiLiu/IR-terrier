	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to compare the clinical efficacy of intra-articular injections of autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP) vs hyaluronic acid (HA) for symptomatic early osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip. Secondarily, this study aims to determine the feasibility and safety of treating early OA of the hip with HA and PRP.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Platelet Rich Plasma vs Hyaluronic-Acid in Hip OA (Osteoarthritis)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common, painful condition affect adults and causes mobility disability in the United States and Europe. Unfortunately, there is no agents available that halt OA progression. Analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have suboptimal effectiveness, and there is concern of systemic side effects. A large challenge is the development of appropriate and effective therapy in patients with OA. Currently, the most suitable route for administering OA therapy appears to be intra-articular injections that allow accumulation of critical doses of the drug within the damaged area and also reduce the risk of systemic side effects. The primary objective of this study is to compare the clinical efficacy of intra-articular injections of Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) vs. Hyaluronic Acid for symptomatic early OA of the hip. Secondarily, the study aims to evaluate the safety and feasibility of both medications delivered. Patients, which meet inclusion criteria, are confirmed eligible, and agree to enroll in the study, would be randomized and treated with either three intra-articular PRP injections or three intra-articular Hyaluronic Acid injections. If the patient has OA in both hips, they will be randomized to receive the same injection in both hips. The Primary investigator will be unblinded to the treatment that the subject is randomized to. The PI will only be involved in the initial assessment of the patient and the actual injections. All of the follow up visits, clinical assessments and outcome scores will be performed by the sub-investigator, who will also be the examining physician. The sub-investigator will be blinded to the treatment throughout the study. All of the study subjects will be blinded to which treatment that they are assigned to. Physical exams will be performed to assess range of motion of the hip joint. The difference in ranges of motion will be statistically compared at different time points between the two groups to determine the difference in improvement between the two compared to baseline. The primary efficacy outcome will be defined as the percentage of patients having a 50% decrease in the summed score for the WOMAC pain subscale from baseline to week 24. We will measure this outcome by applying the WOMAC questionnaire compared with baseline therapy. The secondary efficacy outcomes will also include IHOT and Non Arthritic Hip Score. An anterior posterior hip radiograph will be performed at 12 months and 24 months to assess Kellgren-Classification and compared to baseline.</detailed_description>

Patients with polyarticular disease. Patients with major conditions such as poorly control diabetes, Cardiac Heart Failure (CHF), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) or untreated depression Patients with known blood disorders (Blood disorders (thrombopathy, thrombocytopenia, anemia with hemoglobin &lt;9g/dL). Patients who had intraarticular treatment with steroids within 6 months of randomization in this study or received more than 3 previous intraarticular steroid injections to the effected hip. Patients who are pregnant or nursing at the time of consent. Patients with inflammatory arthritic conditions (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) NonEnglish speaking patients. (Scores used for evaluation have not been validated in Spanish) Patients who had previous hip surgery Additional disabilities in any of the lower limbs that would interfere with any of the clinical assessments. Chronic use of NSAID (defined as taking NSAID regularly every week for the last 6 months), steroids or chemotherapy drugs Treatment with NSAIDs within 2 days prior to randomization in this study Patients with a BMI over 30. Due to the fact that this study utilize an injection technique which may be inaccurate in obese subjects.</criteria>
