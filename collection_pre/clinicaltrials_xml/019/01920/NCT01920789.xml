	<brief_summary>A randomized phase II study for medically inoperable stage I non-small cell lung cancer where stereotactic body radiotherapy in three fractions to 66 Gy is compared with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy to 70 Gy in 35 fractions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Precision And Conventional Radiotherapy Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter Scandinavian randomized phase II study of stereotactic hypofractionated radiotherapy with body frame versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for stage I medically inoperable non-small cell lung cancer patients. There is a 1:1 randomization between arm A: Stereotactic radiotherapy to a dose of 66 Gy with 22 Gy per fraction at the isocenter (45 Gy covers the PTV) in 3 fractions during one week with body frame fixation and a planning target volume with a 5 mm margin around the macroscopic tumour, and arm B: Conventionally fractionated radiotherapy to a dose of 70 Gy with 2 Gy per fraction in 35 fractions during 7 weeks with fixation in a vacuum pillow and a planning target volume with a 2 cm margin around the macroscopic tumour.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Nonsmall cell lung cancer stage I: T12 N0 M0. Medically inoperable patients or patients refusing surgery. Morphologically verified. If that is impossible there must be increased tumour size in repeated CT scans and positive PET. Patients should have a life expectancy of &gt; 6 months. WHO performance status 02. Signed written informed consent obtained. Patient should be feasible for both study arms. Patients with central tumour growth adjacent to trachea, main bronchus or esophagus. Maximal tumour diameter &gt; 6 cm. Patients with prior malignancy within the last five years (except basal cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ carcinoma of the cervix). Any prior antitumoral treatment of the present lung cancer. Previous irradiation that included part of the lung. Pregnant women.</criteria>
