	<brief_summary>Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a rare, chronic, debilitating, and potentially life-threatening autoimmune disorder that is characterized by mucocutaneous blisters. Ofatumumab is a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb) that specifically binds to the human CD20 antigen, which is expressed only in B lymphocytes. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of ofatumumab injection for subcutaneous use (ofatumumab SC) 20 milligrams (mg) administered once in every 4 weeks, (with an additional 20 mg loading dose [i.e. 40 mg total] at both Week 0 and Week 4) in subjects with PV. It is anticipated that with sustained B-cell depletion in the presence of ofatumumab SC, and the resultant reduction of pathogenic anti Dsg (desmoglein) autoantibodies in PV, that clinical remission of the disease will result.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria Adults (18 through 70 years of age) with clinicallydocumented diagnosis of PV for &gt;2 months and &lt;10 years. History of biopsy consistent with PV (Hematoxylin and Eosin staining and direct immunofluorescence). If no history, a biopsy may be performed during the Screening Period. At least 1 previous episode of a failed steroid taper (ie, disease flare/relapse) at a prednisone/prednisolone dose &gt;10 mg/day. The following criteria must have been met as evidence of disease severity at the time of the failed steroid taper: a) A Pemphigus Severity of Clinical Disease score of moderate (2) or severe (3) (may be historical/retrospective assessment). b) Required a treatment change at the time of the failed steroid taper of at least one of the following: i) A steroid increase to &gt;=20 mg/day OR ii) The addition of immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory agent/treatment OR iii) A dose increase of immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory agent/treatment Screening antiDsg antibodies consistent with a diagnosis of PV (ie, elevated antiDsg3 antibodies). Has initiated and received a stable dose of prednisone/prednisolone from a minimum of 20 mg/day (example: 0.25 mg/kg/day for an 80 kg person) up to a maximum of 120 mg/day or 1.5 mg/kg/day (whichever is higher) for &gt;=2 weeks prior to randomization. Has exhibited PV disease control, defined as no new lesions for &gt;=2 weeks. A female subject is eligible to enter the study if she: Is of nonchild bearing potential, who is either surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or posthysterectomy) or is postmenopausal without menses for &gt;2 years. Women who are &lt;2 years postmenopausal are required to have menopausal status confirmed by folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels at the screening evaluation. If FSH and estradiol levels do not provide confirmation of menopause, subject will be considered to be of childbearing potential; Is of childbearing potential, defined as a woman who has functional ovaries, ducts, and a uterus with no documented impairment that would cause sterility. This includes women with oligomenorrhea (even severe), women who are perimenopausal, and women who have just begun to menstruate. Subject must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and must agree to the consistent and correct use of acceptable methods of contraception during heterosexual intercourse, beginning when the subject provides informed consent and lasting until 12 months after last dose of investigational product. Acceptable methods of contraception are limited to the oral contraceptives (either combined or progesterone only), injectable progesterone, levonorgestrel implants, estrogenic vaginal ring, percutaneous contraceptive patches, intrauterine device or intrauterine system with a documented failure rate of &lt;1% per year, male partner sterilization (vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia) prior to the female subject's entry into the study; this male must be the subject's sole partner, double barrier method (condom and an occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps] with a vaginal spermicidal agent [foam/gel/film/cream/suppository]) and complete abstinence from heterosexual intercourse, For Japan subjects, in the list of acceptable methods of contraception, the following methods are not applicable in Japan: oral contraceptives with progestogen alone, injectable progesterone, levonorgestrel implants, estrogenic vaginal ring, percutaneous contraceptive patches, vaginal spermicidal foam, gel, film, and cream French subjects: In France, a subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if either affiliated to or a beneficiary of a social security category. Diagnosis of pemphigus foliaceus, paraneoplastic pemphigus, or other autoimmune blistering disease (other than pemphigus vulgaris). Past or current history of hypersensitivity to components of the investigational product or medically significant adverse effects (including allergic reactions) from cetirizine (or antihistamine equivalent) or paracetamol/acetaminophen. Prior treatment with rituximab without achieving disease control within 6 months of initiating rituximab dosing. Prior treatment with with any of the following within the specified periods: any time: ofatumumab, total body irradiation, bone marrow transplantation, antiCD4 ; within 2 weeks: systemic steroids (except for prednisone/prednisolone) ; within 6 weeks: live vaccine ; within 8 weeks: azathioprine, cyclosporine, dapsone, mycophenolate, methotrexate and tacrolimus; within 6 months:cladribine, cyclophosphamide, plasmapheresis, immunoabsorption or immunoglobulin therapy, alemtuzumab, mitoxantrone; and within 18 months: Rituximab or other drugs affecting the number and function of Bcells Confirmed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), or neurological findings potentially consistent with PML Evidence or history of clinically significant infection including: Chronic or ongoing active infectious disease requiring long term systemic treatment, including, but not limited to, chronic renal infection, chronic chest infection with bronchiectasis, or active hepatitis C; Positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).
