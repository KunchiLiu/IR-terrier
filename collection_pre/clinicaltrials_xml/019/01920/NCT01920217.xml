	<brief_summary>Sepsis is a common cause of death in intensive care unit, timely and accurate diagnosis and treatment directly affect the survival rate. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was promising genetic biomarker for sepsis patients. The present study was designed to screen several SNP by whole exome sequencing which evaluate the sepsis related snp site in order to be a new target for the treatment of sepsis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identification Sepsis Related Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) by Whole Exome Sequencing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a non-intervention, prospective observational study. Purpose of this sudy is to screening several SNPs by whole exome sequencing which can be used as genetic marker for sepsis patients. We will collect whole blood samples from patients with sepsis inRespiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU), the Emergency Intensive Care Unit (EICU), or the Department of Surgery's ICU 301 Hospital since January 2013, and then whole exome sequencing was used to Screen SNPs which were related to sepsis. Then another 500 sepsis patients and 500 normal controls were used to validated the sequencing results.</detailed_description>
