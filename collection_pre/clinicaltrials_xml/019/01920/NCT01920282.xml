	<brief_summary>Numerous anti-hypertensive drugs have been reported to be efficacious in reducing central arterial stiffness and these effects may contribute to improved outcomes in hypertensive patients. However, the results of several studies suggest that beta-blockers may actually increase arterial stiffness. In contrast, there is limited evidence to suggest that nebivolol, a third generation beta-blocker that augments release of vascular nitric oxide, reduces central arterial stiffness in hypertensive individuals. Unfortunately, only a few studies have addressed this issue and all of these studies relied on indirect, blood pressure dependent measures of arterial stiffness. In addition, none of these studies focused on middle-aged and older, obese hypertensives, a population with accelerated arterial stiffening and at risk for cardiovascular diseases. Thus, the potential utility of nebivolol as a therapy to reduce large artery stiffness, particularly among the latter population, remains unclear.</brief_summary>
