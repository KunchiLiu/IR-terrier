	<brief_summary>The objective of this trial is to compare the safety, the efficacy and the cost-effectiveness of 2 therapeutic strategies (optimal standard of care therapy alone versus percutaneous MitraClip procedure and optimal standard of care therapy) in patients with severe secondary mitral regurgitation. This trial is a French, multicenter and randomized trial. Patients enrolled will be clinically followed for 2 years (phone call at 1 month, clinical visit at 6 months, 12 months and 24 months).</brief_summary>
