	<brief_summary>This study is looking at the efficacy, durability, safety, and tolerability of multiple single doses of Ketamine vs. active placebo for treating patients with treatment resistant depression who are taking an antidepressant that is not working for them.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Ketamine Therapy in Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to investigate whether all doses (0.1 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, and 1.0 mg/kg) of ketamine are superior to active placebo (midazolam 0.045 mg/kg) therapy in the acute treatment of patients with treatment resistant depression within 72 hours (Day 3), when added to ongoing and stable antidepressant therapy.</detailed_description>
