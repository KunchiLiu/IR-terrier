	<brief_summary>Women having abortions are at high risk for subsequent unintended pregnancy and repeat abortion. Clearly, encouraging contraceptive use after abortion is a high priority. Long acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs, Implants and intrauterine contraception) are the most effective methods to help women avoid a repeat unwanted pregnancy and abortion. Studies in surgical abortion patients, show that "quickstart" of a LARC - i.e., inserting it during the surgical procedure - is associated with substantially greater use of that method six months later than requiring women to return later to get the device. However, today a majority of women chose medical abortion. The clinical routine is to insert LARCs at the follow up 2 to 3 weeks after the abortion treatment. Frequently women choose to do part of the abortion treatment at home and do not return for a follow up. Thus, the possibility to quick start a contraceptive method in medical abortion would be a major advantage especially if this could be done at the time of administration of mifepristone.</brief_summary>
