	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate PF-05212384 (PI3K/mTOR inhibitor) in combination with either docetaxel, cisplatin or dacomitinib in select advanced solid tumors. The study will assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these combinations in patients with advanced cancer in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose in each combination.</brief_summary>
