	<criteria>Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥45% by echo during screening epoch or within 6 months prior to study entry. Symptom(s) of heart failure (HF) and requiring treatment with diuretic(s) for HF at least 30 days prior to study entry. Current symptom(s) of HF Structural heart disease (left atrial enlargement or left ventricular hypertrophy) documented by echocardiogram. Elevated NTproBNP Any prior measurement of LVEF &lt; 40%. Acute coronary syndrome (including MI), cardiac surgery, other major CV surgery within 3 months , or urgent percutaneous coronary intervention within 3 months or and elective PCI within 30 days prior to entry. Any clinical event within the 6 months prior to entry could have reduced the LVEF (e.g., MI, CABG), unless an echo measurement performed after the event confirms a LVEF ≥45%. Current acute decompensated HF requiring therapy. Patients who require treatment with 2 or more of the following: an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or a renin inhibitor. Alternative reason for shortness of breath such as: significant pulmonary disease or severe COPD, hemoglobin (Hgb) &lt;10 g/dl, or body mass index (BMI) &gt; 40 kg/m2. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 180 mmHg at entry, or SBP &gt;150 mmHg and &lt;180 mmHg at entry unless the patient is receiving 3 or more antihypertensive drugs, or SBP &lt; 110 mmHg at entry. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
