	<brief_title>Therapeutic Effects of Monochromatic Infrared Energy Therapy on Patients With Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methodsï¼š70 participants with chronic LBP will be included. Participants received six 40-min sessions of hot pack therapy combined active or placebo monochromatic infrared energy therapy over the low back (wavelength = 890 nm, radiant power output = 6.24 W, power density = 34.7 milliwatt/cm2 for 40 min, total energy 83.2 J/cm2) followed by 20-min supervised therapeutic exercise, for 3 times per week for a 4-week duration. Patients will be assessed at before treatment and follow-up assessments, including after 2 week of treatment; after 4 weeks of treatment; and 1 and 3 months, respectively, after treatment is terminated. Main Outcome Measures: Patients will be assessed periodically with pain, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, postural stability (using the postural stability evaluation system: Biodex Stability System), and Fear-Avoidance Behavior Questionnaire.</detailed_description>
