	<brief_summary>Nevus flammeus is a congenital vascular malformation. Nevus flammeus is traditionally treated with pulsed dye lasers (PDL); however, around 20 percent of patients are poor responders and do not get satisfactory results from pulsed dye laser treatments. Small studies with alexandrite lasers indicate that this may be an alternative treatment for individuals with nevus flammeus. This study assesses the clinical effect and side effects of alexandrite laser treatment for nevus flammeus using different treatment settings.</brief_summary>
