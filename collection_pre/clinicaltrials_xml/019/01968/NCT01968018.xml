This should not exceed more than 3 doses of a strong immediate release opiod in last 7 days, and none in last 24 hours Participants with significant abnormalities in hepatic or renal function which would in the opinion of the investigator, prevent the participants involvement in the study Participants with a history of allergy or hypersensitivity to tramadol or acetaminophen Participants who, at entry have treatments planned which may alter abruptly, the degree or nature of pain experienced (eg radiotherapy, neurological techniques surgery) Participants with a history of abuse of opioid analgesics prior to their diagnosis of cancer</criteria>
