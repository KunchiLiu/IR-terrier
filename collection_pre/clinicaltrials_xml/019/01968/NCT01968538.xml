	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer is a common disease in men treated using surgery, radiation therapy and/or hormonal therapy. Clinical prognosis relates to stage and grade of disease. Recent advances in omic analysis may offer additional information to the physician about prognosis and radiation response. We propose to establish a protocol to incorporate omic analysis into the evaluation and treatment of patients with prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
