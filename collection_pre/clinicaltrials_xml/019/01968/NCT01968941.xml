	<brief_summary>A multi-centre randomized controlled open-label trial in medically inoperable patients with biopsy-proven early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Eligible and consenting patients will be randomly allocated to receive stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) or conventional radiotherapy (CRT) in a 2:1 ratio. Radiotherapy will be administered as soon as possible following randomization and subjects will be followed for 5 years post-randomization for cancer recurrence, toxicity and survival. The primary outcome is local control (LC). The trial will be conducted at 16-20 clinical centres throughout Canada.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. T1/T2a N0 M0 NSCLC, either by: (a) histological confirmation (squamous cell, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, or not specified) and CT thorax and/or PETCT evidence, or (b) a suspicious growing nodule on serial CT imaging, with malignant PET Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity, for which a biopsy would be extremely risky. 2. Deemed medically inoperable (as reviewed by a thoracic surgeon and defined as surgically resectable but, because of underlying physiological medical problems [e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease], surgery is contraindicated) or Radiotherapy is preferred by the patient due to high operable risk. 1. Less than 18 years of age. 2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 3 or higher. 3. Prior invasive malignancy within the past 5 years (excluding nonmelanomatous skin cancer). 4. History of ataxia telangiectasia. 5. Previous radiotherapy (RT) in the vicinity of the tumour, such that significant overlap could occur. 6. Diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. 7. Planned for other anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, biological targeted therapy). 8. Female, who is currently pregnant or lactating. 9. Geographic inaccessibility for followup. 10. Unable to provide informed consent.</criteria>
