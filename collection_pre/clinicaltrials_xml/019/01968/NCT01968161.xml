	<brief_summary>We propose a use of a unique facility, the databank at the CNDV, to examine the impact of switching subjects to asenapine in an open-label naturalistic setting. This offers the following advantages: i) providing data on a particularly important population, i.e., subjects who are at the inception of treatment for a psychotic disorder and who are likely to remain on a given drug on a long-term basis; ii) its inclusion in a rich clinical setting, with a clinical team dedicated to provide innovative interventions; iii) its naturalistic design, that will allow to obtain data that will be applicable to "real-life" clinical settings; indeed, subjects who will be switched to asenapine within the current project are those we would switch to this drug in our daily practice.</brief_summary>
