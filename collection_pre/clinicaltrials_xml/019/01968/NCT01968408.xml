	<brief_title>Lactobacillus Reuteri DSM 17938 in Preventing Nosocomial Diarrhea in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nosocomial diarrhea is a common problem in hospitalized children. Previously, it has been documented that the administration of L reuteri DSM 17938 at a dose of 10(8) colony forming units (CFU) compared with placebo had no effect on the overall incidence of nosocomial diarrhea (Wanke &amp; Szajewska, J Pediatr 2012). Whether higher doses of L reuteri DSM 17938 have such effects needs to be substantiated in further randomized trials.</detailed_description>
