	<brief_summary>We are doing this research study to find out if intravenous (in your vein, "IV") lidocaine can lessen pain from endometriosis. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved intravenous lidocaine to treat irregular heart beats, but the FDA has not approved intravenous lidocaine to treat pain from endometriosis. Intravenous lidocaine has been used for more than 25 years to treat different acute and chronic pain conditions but has not yet been studied for endometriosis pain. This is a cross-over trial over two months where one month you will receive the active medication (lidocaine) and one month you will receive the active placebo (diphenhydramine, commonly known as benadryl). We will compare the effect on pain from endometriosis of lidocaine to active placebo.</brief_summary>
