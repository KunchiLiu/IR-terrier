	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate an oral fixed-dose, once daily product that combines pramipexole and rasagiline for the treatment of early Parkinson's disease. Animal studies support the therapeutic advantage of combining low doses of rasagiline and pramipexole and suggest further improvement when both are administered in a sustained fashion. Both rasagiline and pramipexole are well known marketed drugs for Parkinson's disease with a good safety profile. combining the drugs in low doses and controlled release may provide better symptom management than the existing drugs alone or together.</brief_summary>
