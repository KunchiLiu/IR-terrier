	<brief_title>Speckle-tracking Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Use of speckle-tracking echocardiography to validate tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion measurements with transesophageal echocardiography. 2. This study intends to validate the use of speckle-tracking echocardiography to measure the distance the tricuspid annulus moves during the systolic phase. The guideline articles regarding right ventricular function suggest m-mode measurements from the transthoracic approach and the same measurements may underestimate the actual distance on transesophageal echocardiography. This speckle-tracking technology will allow this distance to be measured despite its often non-parallel motion to the ultrasound beam, which otherwise limits the reliability of the valve recorded. 3. All subjects undergoing a planned surgical procedure in which the use of transesophageal echocardiography would be used regardless for their management. 4. No interventions, only evaluation of the measurements obtained with transthoracic echocardiography compared to transesophageal echocardiography. 5. No follow-up, study will be completed at the time of image acquisition.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All subjects who are scheduled to undergo general anesthesia and concurrently will be managed with intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography will be included in potential subjects. Subjects who do not have adequate transesophageal and/or transthoracic imaging windows to allow for accurate analysis of tricuspid annular motion.</criteria>
