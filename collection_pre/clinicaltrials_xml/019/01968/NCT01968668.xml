	<brief_summary>This study will be conducted in Japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and the clinical diagnosis of Diabetic Nephropathy( DN) using a multi-center, randomized, adaptive, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design. Primary objective of the study is investigate the change of Urinary Albumin to Creatine Ratio (UACR) after treatment with different oral doses of BAY94-8862 given once daily from baseline to Visit 8 (Day 90)</brief_summary>
