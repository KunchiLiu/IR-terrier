	<brief_title>Neurobiological Aspects of the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Assess the neurobiological aspects evidenced by the amount of brain electrical activity observed by the amplitude of waves through graphs in patients with ADHD, using quantitative electroencephalography; 2. Study the contribution of transcranial direct current stimulation compared with sham in the adequacy of inhibitory control in ADHD patients through neuropsychological test-Go/No Go; 3. Assessing the efficacy of tDCS in neurobiological parameters evidenced by quantitative EEG in patients with ADHD; 4. Perform the Reconstruction of the Functional Brain Network of each subject based on the quantitative EEG data through computational and mathematical modeling; 5. Register indicators of quality of life in adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder through the Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adults with ADHD (AAQoL).</detailed_description>
