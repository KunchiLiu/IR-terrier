	<brief_summary>nanOss Bioactive is approved for use in the U.S. The purpose of this study is to compare fusion results in the posterolateral spine using nanOss Bioactive mixed with autograft bone and bone marrow aspirate (BMA) on one side and autograft alone on the opposite side of the treated level(s). It is hypothesized that the use of nanOss Bioactive will result in fusion at 12 months, with CT evidence of bridging trabecular bone, less than 3mm of translational motion, and less than 5 degrees of angular motion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of nanOss Bioactive With Autograft and Bone Marrow Aspirate to Autograft in the Posterolateral Spine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The post market clinical investigation is designed to assess instrumented posterolateral fusion (PLF) using nanOss Bioactive bone void filler with autograft bone and bone marrow aspirate in patients with symptomatic spinal stenosis secondary to degenerative disc disease with up to Grade 1 spondylolisthesis at one or two adjacent levels from L2-S1. Preoperatively, the participant will provide his/her medical history and complete self assessment forms. The investigator will perform a clinical evaluation and x-rays will be performed if recent x-rays are not available. Participants will undergo instrumented PLF with an interbody fusion device (with autograft or allograft) using nanOss Bioactive in combination with autograft bone and bone marrow aspirate in one posterolateral gutter and autograft alone in the opposite posterolateral gutter. Following surgery, operative and discharge information will be collected and a clinical evaluation will be performed prior to discharge. Participants will be evaluated 6 and 12 months postoperatively. One investigational site will participate in long-term followup of 24 months. Each participant will complete x-rays and self assessment documents. A CT scan performed at the 12 month postoperative visit will be evaluated by an independent radiologist to assess fusion results. Complication data will be recorded throughout the study.</detailed_description>
