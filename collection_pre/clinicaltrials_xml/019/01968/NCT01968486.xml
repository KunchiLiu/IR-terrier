	<brief_summary>To demonstrate the efficacy of ranibizumab in combination with reduced-fluence verteporfin photodynamic therapy (RF-PDT) in patients with subfoveal choroidal neovascularization secondary to pathologic myopia (PM).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reduced-fluence Verteporfin Photodynamic Therapy Plus Ranibizumab for Choroidal Neovascularization in Pathologic Myopia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sixty patients received ranibizumab 0.5 mg combined with reduced fluence (RF) verteporfin PDT. Ranibizumab was first administered to patients followed after seven days by RF-PDT. Subsequently intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) was injected as needed (pro re nata). All patients were evaluated every 4 weeks for 48 weeks. Main Outcome Measures: Mean change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline at 48 weeks, reduced mean central foveal thickness (CFT) analyzed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and improved macular sensitivity registered at microperimetry (MP) evaluation.</detailed_description>
