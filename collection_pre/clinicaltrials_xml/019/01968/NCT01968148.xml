	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to describe the mechanisms of ultra-acute hyperglycemic response after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in patients suffering out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The investigators hypothesize that ischemia and reperfusion injury leads decreased secretion of insulin and glucose-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). Two blood samples will be drawn: (1.) Immediately after ROSC and (2.) 60 minutes after first sample. Concentrations of glucose, insulin, glucagon and GLP-1 will be compared between the samples. Metabolic profile will be compared between: (1.) diabetic and non-diabetic patients and (2.) survivors and non-survivors.</brief_summary>
