	<brief_summary>The ASPREE Cancer Endpoint Study (ACES), an ancillary study of the ASPirin in the Prevention of Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) Study, will allow for the examination of the effect of daily low-dose aspirin (100 mg) compared to placebo, on specific DNA biomarkers and selected specific incident and recurrent cancer and metastases. The establishment of this ACES biobank will allow for the exploration of DNA-related molecular mechanisms of aspirin's protective effect against cancer, cancer associated mortality and metastases, using blood or saliva DNA specimens, urine, and tumor tissue.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The ASPREE Cancer Endpoint Study (ACES) is an ancillary study of the ASPirin in the Prevention of Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) Study, a 5 year randomized placebo- controlled trial of 100 mg of daily aspirin in 19,000 elderly in Australia and the US to determine whether the benefits of low dose daily aspirin outweigh the bleeding risks. The primary outcome of ASPREE is defined as prolongation of "disability-free life", measured as survival without physical disability or dementia. At present, the primary purpose of ACES is to: 1) collect information about participant cancer screenings, cancer diagnosis, and family history of cancer and to 2) establish a biologic specimen repository (biobank) for DNA and tumor tissue, and urine from the ASPREE large healthy aging population in the US and Australia for future use by ASPREE, NIA and NCI investigators, and academicians from the broader research community. At a time in the future and under separate application, the stored blood or saliva, urine, and tumor tissue, together with other information obtained about these participants (in relation to their health, lifestyle and other circumstances) will be analyzed to address specific questions regarding the association of biomarkers and major health outcomes including cancer.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Open Only to Participants in Parent ASPREE study 1. Inclusion criteria: Men and women 65 years and older in US (African American or Hispanic), and 70 years of age and over in Australia (Caucasian, Asian, other minorities). Based on NIAs discretion, select US sites may be recruiting Caucasians 70 and older or 75 and older. 2. Exclusion criteria: (please see www.ASPREE.org for more detailed list of exclusion criteria) i. History of diagnosed dementia or score &lt; 78 on the Modified Mini Mental State Exam at the second prerandomization (baseline) visit. ii. Disability, defined as dependence in one or more Katz activity of daily living. iii. Cardiovascular events, intercurrent illness likely to cause death within the next 5 years, a current or recurrent condition with a high risk of major bleeding, e.g. cerebral aneurysm, cerebral AV malformation, any bleeding diathesis, recent peptic ulcer and liver disease. iv. Anemia, i.e. hemoglobin level below the normal value (males: 12 g/dL, females: 11 g/dL). 3. Participants eligible for the ASPREE Cancer Endpoints Study (ACES) include any participants recruited into the parent ASPREE study in the United States and Australia. ACES participants will be asked to consent to: i. Collection and storage of blood or saliva DNA samples and urine and data for future use. If ASPREE participants are unwilling to contribute biological samples, this will not in any way jeopardize their continued enrolment in ASPREE. ii. Collection of cancer tumor specimens and storage and data for future use.</criteria>
