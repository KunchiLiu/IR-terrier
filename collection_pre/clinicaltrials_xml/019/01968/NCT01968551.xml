	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) fixed dose combination (FDC) plus DRV relative to current antiretroviral regimens (ARV) in virologically suppressed, HIV-1 positive participants with HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL at Week 24. This study consists of 48 weeks of open-label phase followed by an optional extension phase in which all the participants will receive E/C/F/TAF+DRV.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form History of at least two prior antiretroviral regimens, and history of resistance to at least two different classes of antiretroviral agents Plasma HIV1 RNA levels &lt; 50 copies/mL at screening. Virologically suppressed on the current antiretroviral regimen containing darunavir 600 mg twice a day or 800 mg once daily continuously for ≥ 4 months preceding the screening visit and have maintained documented undetectable plasma HIV 1 RNA levels (&lt; 50 copies/mL) and must have documentation of genotype/phenotype prior to current regimen which shows no darunavir associated resistance mutation. Currently receiving raltegravir, elvitegravir, or dolutegravir (50 mg once daily, but not twice daily)or available documentation of genotype/phenotype within 12 months prior to current regimen which must shows no evidence of resistance to integrase inhibitors Normal ECG Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 50 mL/min according to the Cockcroft Gault formula for creatinine clearance Hepatic transaminases (AST and ALT) ≤ 5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL, or normal direct bilirubin Adequate hematologic function (absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mm3; platelets ≥ 50,000/mm3; hemoglobin ≥ 8.5 g/dL) Serum amylase ≤ 5 × ULN (individuals with serum amylase &gt; 5 × ULN will remain eligible if serum lipase is ≤ 5 × ULN) A female individual is eligible to enter the study if it is confirmed that she is: Not pregnant or nursing Of nonchildbearing potential (i.e., women who have had a hysterectomy, have had both ovaries removed or medically documented ovarian failure, or are postmenopausal women &gt; 54 years of age with cessation (for ≥ 12 months) of previously occurring menses), or Of childbearing potential and agrees to utilize highly effective contraception methods or be nonheterosexually active or practice sexual abstinence from screening throughout the duration of study treatment and for 30 days following study drug dosing. Female individuals who utilize hormonal contraceptive as one of their birth control methods must have used the same method for at least three months prior to study dosing. Male individuals must agree to utilize a highly effective method of contraception during heterosexual intercourse or be nonheterosexually active, or practice sexual abstinence from first dose throughout the study period and for 30 days following the last study drug dose. Male individuals must agree to refrain from sperm donation from first dose until at least 30 days after the last study drug dose. A new AIDSdefining condition diagnosed within the 30 days prior to screening (except CD4 cell count and/or percentage criteria) Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive Individuals receiving drug treatment for Hepatitis C, or individuals who are anticipated to receive treatment for Hepatitis C during the course of the study. Must not have Q151M, T69ins, or &gt; 3 TAMS present on documented historic genotype report Individuals experiencing decompensated cirrhosis Females who are breastfeeding Positive serum pregnancy test Have an implanted defibrillator or pacemaker Current alcohol or substance use that may interfere with individual's study compliance A history of malignancy within the past 5 years or ongoing malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), basal cell carcinoma, or resected, noninvasive cutaneous squamous carcinoma. Active, serious infections (other than HIV1 infection) requiring parenteral antibiotic or antifungal therapy within 30 days prior to Day 1 visit Any other clinical condition or prior therapy that would make the individual unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with dosing requirements Participation in any other clinical trial (including observational trials) without prior approval from the sponsor is prohibited while participating in this trial Individuals receiving ongoing therapy with any of the disallowed medications, including drugs not to be used with elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, TAF, or DRV; or individuals with any known allergies to the study drugs.</criteria>
