	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>(i) Patients diagnosed with renal or prostatic disease who are will undergo an elective laparoscopic renal surgical procedure or laparoscopic prostatectomy; (ii) ASA class IIII (iii) &gt; 18 years of age; (iv) Ability to give oral and written informed consent. (i) Known or suspected neuromuscular disorders impairing neuromuscular function; (ii) Allergies to muscle relaxants, anesthetics or narcotics; (iii) A (family) history of malignant hyperthermia; (iv) Women who are or may be pregnant or are currently breast feeding; (v) Renal insufficiency, as defined by serum creatinine x 2 of normal, or urine output &lt; 0.5 ml/kg/h for at least 6 h. When available, other indices will be taken into account as well such as glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60 ml/h and proteinuria (a ratio of 30 mg albumin to 1 g of creatinine). (vi) Previous retroperitoneal surgery at the site of the current surgery. (vii) Body mass index &gt; 35 kg/m2 (viii) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease GOLD 24 or a FEV1 less than 70% predicted or VC less than 70% predicted (ix) chronic pulmonary disease with altered lung physiology (eg. sarcoidosis, cycstic fibrosis, obstructing pulmonary tumors, previous lung surgery)</criteria>
