	<brief_summary>The overall objective of this exploratory, laboratory study is to evaluate whether noninvasive fluorescence microendoscopic imaging of tissue can assist clinicians in detecting dysplastic (precancerous) areas during standard surveillance. This is a study designed to evaluate the feasibility of using prototype imaging technology to enhance the detection of precancerous changes in various tissues. The results of this laboratory study will be used to further develop the technology for clinical application. The primary aim of this project will be to investigate what digital image analysis criteria can be used to best detect dysplasia in various types of resected tissue.</brief_summary>
