	<brief_summary>The utilization of transthoracic echocardiography in the United States has been increasing. This has resulted in increased costs to the healthcare system. In an effort to curb excessive utilization of this technology, the American College of Cardiology created Appropriate Use Criteria to help guide clinicians to use this diagnostic imaging modality more appropriately. The investigators previously showed that an educational intervention can reduce the rate of inappropriate echocardiograms ordered by physicians-in-training. It is unknown if such an intervention would be successful in attending, staff level of physicians. The investigators hypothesize that an educational and feedback intervention will reduce the rate of inappropriate outpatient transthoracic echocardiograms ordered by staff cardiologists and internal medicine physicians.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Education and Feedback Intervention to Reduce Inappropriate Transthoracic Echocardiograms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In response to increasing utilization of echocardiography, the American Society of Echocardiography along with the American College of Cardiology released Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) for transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in 2007, and these have been subsequently updated in 2011. TTE ordering patterns have been evaluated and have shown that between 15-30% of TTE ordered are inappropriate. The highest rate of inappropriate TTE is found in the outpatient environment, where routine or "surveillance" studies are common. These studies have also found that internists and cardiologists order the majority of TTE. The investigators previously documented that an AUC-based educational and feedback intervention reduced the rate of inappropriate TTE by cardiology and internal medicine physicians-in-training. Whether this type of intervention can improve TTE ordering of attending level physicians is not known.</detailed_description>
