	<brief_summary>The overall objective of this study is to utilize heart rate variability and respiratory rate variability in patients with sepsis to predict clinical deterioration and death. Our specific objectives are: 1. To study the ability of a change in composite variability (∆CVI) assessment to act as a prognostic aid in predicting disease progression in sepsis. 2. To study the effect that standard resuscitation interventions will have on the direction and magnitude of ∆CVI in patients with sepsis. B. Hypotheses H1: In the initial resuscitation of sepsis, a low or declining multi-parameter composite variability index (CVI) over 4 hours will predict a significant increase in the combined outcome of overt shock, organ dysfunction, and mortality. H2: In the initial resuscitation of sepsis, low volume fluid resuscitation (&lt;20 cc/kg) over 4 hours will be associated with a low or declining CVI.</brief_summary>
