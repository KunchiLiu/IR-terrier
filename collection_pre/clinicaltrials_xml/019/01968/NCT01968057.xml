	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of ciclosporin on the amount of baricitinib that is absorbed into the blood stream and the time it takes to remove baricitinib from the body. The study will also look at how well-tolerated and safe baricitinib is, when given alone and in combination with ciclosporin. Side effects will be documented. The study will last approximately 6 days from the first dose to the end of the study (not including screening or follow-up).</brief_summary>
