	<brief_summary>BIOFLOW-IV is a prospective, international, multicenter, randomised controlled trial. The purpose of this trial is to compare the Biotronik Orsiro drug eluting stent system with the Xience Prime / Xience Xpedition (Xience)drug eluting stent system in de novo coronary lesions. The study is powered for non-inferiority with respect to Target Vessel Failure(TVF)at 12 months.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Main Subject must provide written informed consent The target reference vessel diameter (RVD) is ≥ 2.50 mm and ≤ 3.75 mm assessed either visually or by online QCA. Target lesion length is ≤ 26 mm (assessed either visual estimate or by online QCA) and can be covered by one study stent Single de novo lesion with ≥ 50% and &lt; 100% stenosis in up to 2 coronary arteries Main Subject has evidence of myocardial infarction within 72 hours prior to the index procedure Planned intervention of nontarget vessel(s) within 30 days after the index procedure Planned intervention of target vessel(s) after the index procedure Target lesion is located in the left main Target lesion is located in or supplied by an arterial or venous bypass graft Target lesion involves a side branch &gt; 2.0 mm in diameter by visual estimate or by online QCA Proximal or distal to the target lesion located stenosis that might require future revascularization or impede run off</criteria>
