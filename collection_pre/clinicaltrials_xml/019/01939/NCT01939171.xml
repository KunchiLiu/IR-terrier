	<brief_summary>To determine the efficacy and Security of Thymoglobuline in cadaveric donor Efficacy: To demonstrate that in cadaveric donor, Thymoglobuline diminished graft alloreactivity by decreasing expression of inflammatory markers in graft biopsies Security:To demonstrate that the administration of Thymoglobulin does not have side effects in renal recipients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thymoglobulin in Cadaver Donor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is randomized controlled Multicenter phase II clinical trial promoted by members from IdiPAZ. At least two hospital (La Paz and Santa Maria from Lisbon, will be involved. A per nature pilot study will recruit 10 cadaver donors from each hospital, and randomized half-to-half per center, for study and control groups. The RCT initiated in 2009 and finished in 2013. Cadaver donor from the study group will receive 3 mg/kg iv. Thymoglobulin 3-6 hours prior to organ procurement. The randomization process recruits 1:1 study/control donors. Kidney biopsies will be taken from each kidney before transplantation to examine the expression of pro-inflammatory and HLA molecules (anti-DR, VCAM, ICAM, E-selectin) at tubular cells by immunohistochemical techniques under blinded conditions. Recipients will be managed as usual and expressly followed up for one year, recording the incidence of delayed graft function and rejection and graft survival at the first year. A comparison between the results obtained in kidney biopsies and patients transplanted in each group will permit differentiate whether Thymoglobulin administered in cadaver modifies the expression of antigens by kidney tubular cells and the results obtained with transplantation, in terms of graft function, rejection and survival.</detailed_description>
