	<brief_summary>The use of fundal pressure in management of the second stage of labor is controversial. The aim of this study is both to evaluate the effectiveness of fundal pressure in shortening the second stage of labor and to examine the related neonatal and maternal outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Of Kristeller Maneuver On Maternal And Neonatal Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be randomly allocated to two groups by using a computer-generated random number chart: Kristeller maneuver intervention (study) group (n=140) and control group (n=140). Umbilical artery blood gas will obtained to assess the newborn's acid-base status. The umbilical artery levels of creatinine kinase, creatinine kinase with myocardial specific isoform, aspartate amino transferase, alanine amino transferase, lactate dehydrogenase and lactic acid will be measured. Length of episiotomy and length of vagina will be measured at 45 degrees from the midline. Each patient's vaginal laceration, cervical laceration, length of episiotomy and vagina before and after delivery and duration of the second stage of labor in minutes will be recorded. Neonatal information will include: infant birth weight, apgar scores, babies requiring pediatric help, and admission of neonatal intensive care units.</detailed_description>
