	<brief_title>Traditional Chinese Medicine for Treatment of Chronic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure (HF) can be defined as an abnormality of cardiac structure or function leading to failure of heart to deliver oxygen at a rate commensurate with the requirements of the metabolizing tissues, despite normal filling pressures (or only at the expense of increased filling pressures). And according to the nature of the clinical presentation, HF is divided into acute or chronic HF. In 2003, a random sample survey of 15,518 urban or rural residents between 35 and 74 years old was made in China: the prevalence rate of heart failure was 0.9%, and according to the result, there was about 4,000,000 HF subjects in China. In China, the integrative treatment of western and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for HF is common and has been developed as a treatment model. TCM has been used in China and other south and east Asia countries for thousands of years. Syndrome differentiation and treatment variation are the basic principles in understanding and treatment of diseases. Investigators would like to test the hypothesis that it is efficacy and safety for patients to take TCM granules according to syndrome differentiation. The specific aims for the study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TCM in treating chronic heart failure (CHF).</detailed_description>
