	<brief_summary>Many conditions and cardiovascular diseases (including stroke) are better managed with regular exercise training. The expected effects are partial reversal of adverse effects on heart and blood vessel structure and function, improved glycemic, tension and weight control. Physiologically, the aorta maintains low left ventricular after-load, promotes optimal sub-endocardial coronary blood flow, and transforms pulsatile into laminar blood flow. Increased aortic stiffness may ultimately contribute to left ventricular dysfunction. Regular exercise training is likely to decrease the pulse wave velocity (a measure of the aortic compliance). Some subjects seem more responsive than others, and they may not expect the same benefit of exercise training. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been explained yet.</brief_summary>
