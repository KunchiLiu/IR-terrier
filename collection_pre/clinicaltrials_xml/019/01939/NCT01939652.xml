	<brief_summary>Elective minilaparatomy abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair is associated with a significant number of complications involving respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and central nervous system, and mortality ranging up to 5%. In our study, we tested the hypothesis that intraoperative and postoperative intravenous restrictive fluid regime reduces postoperative morbidity and mortality and improves the outcome of the treatment of minilaparotomy AAA repair.</brief_summary>
