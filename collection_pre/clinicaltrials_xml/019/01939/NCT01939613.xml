	<brief_title>Colloid Improves Organs Function in Resuscitation of Extensive Burn Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Extensive burn patients are some of the most challenging critically ill patients who may have multiple-system organ failure with life-threatening complications.Over time, several resuscitation formulae have been proposed to guide burn resuscitation and the best known ones are Parkland and Evans formulae. The main controversy between the two formulae also focuses on whether to infuse the colloid in the first 24 h.Controversy continues and the conflicting results left many clinicians unsure about the effect of colloids on fluid resuscitation in extensive burn patients who suffer higher risk of hypovolaemia, abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS), multiple organs dysfunction and mortality. To address this uncertainty, we conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial to compare fluid resuscitation in extensive burns guided by Parkland formulae with TMMU formulae as a modified Evans formula routinely used in China.</detailed_description>
