	<brief_summary>It is increasingly clear that the environment in which a child lives, plays, and goes to school has a significant impact on their health. With the implementation of a Community to Clinic Linkage Program (CCLiP) in the SFGH Pediatrics Clinics, we will routinely address Social Determinants of Health when families present. We will randomize patients to receive either the CCLiP intervention or standard of care. We will evaluate programmatic outcome, health care utilization data and return on investment data. We hypothesize that by addressing the environmental and social factors that contribute to health within the setting of the medical home, we will be able to better connect families to community resources, enable more appropriate use of healthcare resources, improve health status, and enhance patient satisfaction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Community to Clinic Linkage Program at SFGH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We are proposing a 4-arm, 18 month randomized control clinical trial to address social determinants of health, improve health status and health care satisfaction, and change health care utilization patterns in the Pediatric Urgent Care and Primary Care Clinics at San Francisco General Hospital. We will compare our CCLiP protocol to standard of care in both the Pediatric Primary Care Clinic &amp; Urgent Care. All arms (intervention and control) include a baseline survey including social needs assessment, health care status, health care satisfaction and health care utilization assessment; and two telephone-based follow up surveys at 3 and 6 months. Patients in the intervention arms (whether in urgent care or primary care) will receive a maximum of 3 months of intervention protocol which includes a 30 minute on-site intervention at time of enrollment in addition to twice monthly follow-up phone calls for up to 3 months to help address social needs. Patients in all arms will receive 3 and 6-month follow up surveys.</detailed_description>
