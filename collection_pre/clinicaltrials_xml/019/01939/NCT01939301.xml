	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double blind study to treat subjects diagnosed with pulmonary embolism with inhaled nitrix oxide. In this clinical trial investigators will randomized patients to receive inhaled nitric oxide or sham (nitrogen + oxygen) for 24 hours. Patients must have a submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) and evidence of right ventricular (RV) heart dysfunction. Investigators hypothesize that the administration of inhaled NO + oxygen to patients with severe submassive PE will improve RV function, reduce RV strain and necrosis and improve dyspnea (difficulty breathing) more than sham oxygen treatment.</brief_summary>
