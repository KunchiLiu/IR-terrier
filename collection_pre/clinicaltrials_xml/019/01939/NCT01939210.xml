	<brief_summary>This randomized pilot clinical trial studies the effects of meditation-based breathing training on patients' control of their breathing patterns and breathing-related movement, as well as on their psychological distress and treatment experience during radiation therapy. Meditation-based breathing training may decrease breathing-related movement and the amount of stress by improving breathing patterns in patients with abdominal or lung cancer undergoing radiation therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Meditation-Based Breathing Training in Improving Target Motion Management and Reducing Distress in Patients With Abdominal or Lung Cancer Undergoing Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the influence of regular breathing cycles using breathing relaxation techniques on efficacy of the respiratory-gated treatment as measured by: (1) real-time position management (RPM) parameters; (2) end inspiration or expiration length; (3) changes in gate width. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the effect of breathing relaxation techniques on: (1) psychosocial outcomes; (2) treatment compliance. OUTLINE: PHASE I: Patients and staff members complete structured interviews at baseline. PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Patients participate in 3 50-minute breathing training sessions, including a psycho-educational component and meditation-based breathing training, over 10 days. Patients then undergo four dimensional computed tomography (4D-CT) on day 14 and undergo image-guided stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or standard radiation therapy 5 times a week for up to 5 fractions or 25 fractions, respectively. ARM II: Patients receive standard care over 10 days. Patients then undergo 4D-CT on day 14 and undergo image-guided SBRT or standard radiation therapy 5 times a week for up to 5 fractions or 25 fractions, respectively. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 or 5 weeks.</detailed_description>
