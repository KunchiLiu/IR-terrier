	<brief_summary>Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a new, minimal-invasive image-guided treatment method for tumors not amenable for surgical resection or thermal ablation, due to vicinity near vital structures such as vessels and bile ducts. With IRE, multiple electrical pulses are applied to tumorous tissue. These pulses alter the existing transmembrane potential of the cell membranes, and create 'nanopores', after which the cell dies through loss of homeostasis. The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety of percutaneous IRE in the treatment of patients with locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma (LAPC). Other objectives are feasibility and efficacy of IRE based upon symptomatic response and tumor response. Fourty patients with histologically confirmed locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma (&lt;5cm) will undergo percutaneous irreversible electroporation of the tumor using CT and ultrasound guidance. After IRE, patients will be carefully monitored and any (serious) adverse events are registered. Follow-up will consist of frequent CT scanning, as well as serum CA19.9 tumor marker. We hypothesize that IRE in the pancreas will induce good symptom palliation and local tumor control, without causing severe complications.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Screening must be performed no longer than 2 weeks prior to study inclusion. Radiologic confirmation of LAPC by at least ceCT of chest and abdomen (with the upper abdomen scanned according to a dedicated 3mm slice multiphase pancreatic tumor protocol), performed maximum 2 weeks prior to the procedure; Maximum tumor diameter ≤ 5 cm; Histological or cytological confirmation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma; Age ≥ 18 years; ASAclassification 0 3 Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks; Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function as assessed by the following laboratory requirements to be conducted within 7 days prior to definite inclusion; Hemoglobin ≥ 5.6 mmol/L; Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm3; Platelet count ≥ 100*109/l; Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN); ALT and AST ≤ 2.5 x ULN; Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or a calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min; Prothrombin time or INR &lt; 1.5 x ULN; Activated partial thromboplastin time &lt; 1.25 x ULN (therapeutic anticoagulation therapy is allowed if this treatment can be interrupted as judged by the treating physician); Written informed consent; Resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma as discussed by our multidisciplinary hepatobiliary team; Extrapancreatic metastases; Successful down staging after (radio)chemotherapy from previous unresectable/borderline tumor to resectable tumor; Stage IV pancreatic carcinoma; History of epilepsy; History of cardiac disease: Congestive heart failure &gt;NYHA class 2; Active Coronary Artery Disease (defined as myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to screening); Cardiac arrhythmias requiring antiarrhythmic therapy or pacemaker (beta blockers for antihypertensive regimen are permitted); Uncontrolled hypertension. Blood pressure must be ≤160/95 mmHg at the time of screening on a stable antihypertensive regimen; Compromised liver function (e.g. signs of portal hypertension, INR &gt; 1,5 without use of anticoagulants, ascites); Uncontrolled infections (&gt; grade 2 NCICTC version 3.0); Pregnant or breastfeeding subjects. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test performed within 7 days of the start of treatment; Immunotherapy ≤ 6 weeks prior to the procedure; Chemotherapy ≤ 6 weeks prior to the procedure; Radiotherapy ≤ 6 weeks prior to the procedure; Concomitant use of anticonvulsive and antiarrhythmic drugs (other than beta blockers used for antihypertensive); Allergy to contrast media; Any implanted stimulation device; Any implanted metal stent/device within the area of ablation that cannot be removed; Any condition that is unstable or that could jeopardize the safety of the subject and their compliance in the study; Of note, patients with contraindications for MRI will not be excluded from participation: in this case radiologic followup will consist of CTscanning according to protocol.</criteria>
