	<brief_summary>At hemodynamic level, the greater affinity of bisoprolol by the beta 1 receptor in theory could improve the peripheral arterial perfusion and could have a greater antihypertensive effect. At the same time, this could carry objectifiable improvements in the vascular tree, such as the level of arterial stiffness. This study attempts to mark the hemodynamic differences in the same individual with hypertension and metabolic syndrome who will be exposed to both drugs at different moments. Parameters will be objectified with impedance cardiography, pulse wave velocity and central blood pressure assessment before and after taking each one of the drugs. The results will be compared to the baseline data and between themselves.</brief_summary>
