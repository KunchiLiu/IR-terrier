	<brief_summary>Nimotuzumab is an IgG1 humanized monoclonal antibody that recognized an epitope located in the extra cellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), inhibiting tyrosine kinase activation. This is a randomized, controlled, open-Label, multicenter, phase Ⅱ clinical trial of nimotuzumab plus Docetaxel and Capecitabine（TX）versus Docetaxel and Capecitabine（TX）as first-line treatment in patients with recurrent/metastatic triple negative breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nimotuzumab Plus Docetaxel and Capecitabine Versus Docetaxel and Capecitabine in the Treatment of Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The control group received docetaxel + capecitabine regimen;Experimental group received Nimotuzumab combined docetaxel + capecitabine regimen.The main purpose is to evaluate Nimotuzumab Plus Docetaxel and Capecitabine（TX）as First-Line Treatment in Patients With Recurrent/Metastatic triple negative breast cancer would improve objective response rate (ORR ) comparing with Docetaxel and Capecitabine（TX）.</detailed_description>
