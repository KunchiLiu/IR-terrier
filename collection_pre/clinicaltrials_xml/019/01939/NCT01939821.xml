	<brief_summary>The investigators are planning to do a cluster randomized trial to test the effect of different educational programs for staff according to nursing home patients FI (fecal incontinence). Since there are very few published trials of treatment of FI in older people, and no rigorously evaluated studies on interventions for FI in nursing homes, or rigorously evaluated continence education program for staff concerning continence care, a pilot study is necessary. The aim for the pilot study is to evaluate feasibility, acceptability and adherence according to the educational intervention, methods used and outcome measures. This is designed to be an external pilot study. External pilot studies are small scale versions of the main study which are not intended to be part of the main study. The pilot intervention period is 3 month.</brief_summary>
