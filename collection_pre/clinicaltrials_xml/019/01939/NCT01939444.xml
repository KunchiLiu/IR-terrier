	<brief_summary>The overall is aim of this pilot study is to give a preliminary estimation of key parameters of the pharmacokinetics of a proper formulation of intranasal naloxone. These data will be used to design a well justified protocol for the final estimation of these parameters: - Preliminary estimation of bioavailability of this intranasal naloxone in human, healthy volunteers - Preliminary estimation of the maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of this formulation - Preliminary estimation of the time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax) of this formulation - Safety of the formulation</brief_summary>
