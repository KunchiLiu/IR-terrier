	<brief_summary>To assess efficacy and safety of omalizumab treatment during 12 months in order to reduce the use of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) in pediatric and adult patients with severe IgE-mediated asthma inadequately controlled with high doses of corticosteroids.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Omalizumab Treatment on ICS Reduction for Severe IgE-mediated Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicentric, open label, randomized, parallel-group study with a 12-month treatment period. Patients will be assigned to one of the 2 treatment groups, omalizumab plus budesonide/formoterol or budesonide/formoterol alone. The study comprises 4 phases: During the 4-week run-in phase adult patients will receive budesonide 800 mg and formoterol 24 mg. If a patient complies with all inclusion and exclusion criteria and has been receiving the according-to-age run-in proposed doses during the last month, the patient may continue to the stable-steroid phase. During the 16-week stable-steroid phase, adult and pediatric eligible patients will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups. During the 8-week steroid-reduction phase, adult and pediatric patients will reduce 25% of the budesonide baseline dose every 2 weeks, depending of the asthma control, until reaching a 100% reduction of the baseline dose. The clinical control of asthma is defined according to criteria (GINA 2012)</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Male and female between 6 and 55 years old. If female, patient of childbearing potential must use a safe and efficacious birth control method. Asthma is considered as not wellcontrolled if patient has 3 or more of the following conditions: 1. Persistent day symptoms with current therapy twice at week or more, (siblings, dyspnea, cough, chest pain, thoracic oppression). 2. One or more nighttime awakenings over the last 4 weeks. 3. Any limitation of ageappropriated habitual activities. 4. Need of rescue medication (short acting β2 agonist) for two or more occasions per week during the last 4 weeks before screening and 2 consecutives weeks within the 4 weeks before selection. 5. PEF or VEF1 &lt;80% predicted or personal best (if known) this is not mandatory for pediatric patients (under 18 years old). Despite continuous treatment with highdose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) or oral corticosteroids (OCS) (CSO≥ 1 mg/kg/day) with or without controllers (As per GINA 2012 definition), the subject is receiving high doses of ICS (budesonide or its equivalent) and a longacting β2agonists(LABA) (formoterol) for the past 12 weeks at visit 0. At last one documented asthma exacerbation (defined as increase asthma symptoms requiring systemic corticosteroid rescue therapy) that requires visits to the emergency room or to be hospitalized in the past 12 months. It is also considered asthma exacerbation a nonplanned visit that required rescue medication (β2agonists and/or steroid nebulization every 20 minutes or β2agonists inhaler shots every 20 minutes). Positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen, documented during the 12 months previous screening. IgE total concentration ranging from 30 to 1500 UI/ml. Body weight between 20 to 150 kg Exclusion Criteria Pregnant or lactating female or without safe and efficacious birth control method if of childbearing potential. Currently smokers or history of smoking 10 or more packs per year. Exsmokers with a history of more than 10 years of smoking. As an exception, a patient with this criterion will be considered as eligible if the FEV1 reversibility of the first spirometry reaches 12%. Active lung disease other than asthma. Use of methotrexate, gold salts, troleandomycin, cyclosporine, immunosuppressants, gammaglobulin or any other type of monoclonal antibody used during the 6 months prior to the initial visit. Use of omalizumab during the 4 months prior to de screening visit. History of renal disease, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, hematologic disease, gastrointestinal disease, as well as immunodeficiency or cerebrovascular disease currently under treatment but notcontrolled. History of hepatic, neurologic, oncologic or autoimmune disease. Patient under suspicion of having cancer. Patients with history of hypersensitivity to sucrose, histidine, polysorbate 20 as well as to monoclonal antibodies or gammaglobulin. Hypersensitivity to omalizumab or its excipients. Abnormal values of the blood chemistry laboratory tests, over 2 times the upper limit normal, that are considered clinically significant. Underage patient or any patient under vulnerable conditions who does not live with their parents or legal guardian.</criteria>
