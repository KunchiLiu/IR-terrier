	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study for the Treatment of BPH (Enlarged Prostate)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a prospective, controlled, randomized single blind clinical trial of subjects with benign prostatic hyperplasia, which will allow for an interim analysis for sample size adjustment. Subjects first will be randomized in a 2:1 proportion in favor of the Treatment arm. Subjects in the Control arm will be allowed to crossover to have the Rezūm treatment after the 3-month follow-up examination.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male subjects &gt; 50 years of age who have symptomatic BPH. 2. International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) score ≥ 13. 3. Peak urinary flow rate (Qmax): ≥ 5ml/sec to ≤ 15 ml/sec with minimum voided volume of ≥ 125 ml. 4. Postvoid residual (PVR) ≤250 ml. 5. Prostate volume &gt; 30 and ≤ 80 gm. 1. History of clinically significant congestive heart failure (i.e. NYHA Class III and IV). 2. History of diabetes not controlled by a stable dose of medication over the past three months. Patients with a Hemoglobin A1c that is &lt;8.0% are allowed. 3. History of significant respiratory disease where hospitalization for the disease is required. 4. History of immunosuppressive conditions (e.g., AIDS, posttransplant). 5. Cardiac arrhythmias that are not controlled by medication or medical device. 6. An episode of unstable angina pectoris, a myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, or a cerebrovascular accident within the past six months. 7. Any significant medical history that would pose an unreasonable risk or make the subject unsuitable for the study. 8. Presence of a penile implant or stent(s) in the urethra or prostate. 9. Any prior invasive prostate intervention (e.g., radio frequency (RF) ablation, balloon, microwave, or laser) or other surgical interventions of the prostate. 10. Currently enrolled in any other preapproval investigational study in the USA (does not apply to longterm postmarket studies unless these studies might clinically interfere with the current study endpoints (e.g., limit use of studyrequired medication, etc.)). 11. History of confirmed malignancy or cancer of prostate or bladder, however, high grade PIN is acceptable. 12. History of cancer in nongenitourinary system that is not considered cured (except basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin). A potential participant is considered cured if there has been no evidence of cancer within five years of randomization. 13. Previous pelvic irradiation or radical pelvic surgery. 14. Diagnosed with active Lyme Disease (borreliosis). 15. PSA &gt; 10 ng/ml unless prostate cancer is ruled out by biopsy. If PSA is &gt; 2.5 ng/ml and ≤ 10 ng/ml with free PSA &lt;25%, prostate cancer for the subject must be/had been ruled out through a negative biopsy prior to enrollment. 16. Has undergone prostate biopsy within 60 days prior to treatment date or has an imminent need for surgery. 17. Previous rectal surgery (other than hemorrhoidectomy) or known history of rectal disease. 18. Active urinary tract infection by culture within 7 days of treatment or two documented independent urinary tract infections of any type in the past 6 months. 19. Verified bacterial prostatitis within last 12 months documented by culture or nonbacterial prostatitis within the last 5 years. 20. Active or history of epididymitis within the past 3 months. 21. Neurogenic bladder, sphincter abnormalities, or poor detrusor muscle function. 22. Diagnosed or suspected primary neurologic conditions such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease or other neurological diseases known to affect bladder function, sphincter function or poor detrusor muscle function. 23. Urethral strictures, bladder neck contracture, unusual anatomy or muscle spasms that would prevent the introduction and use of the device. 24. Diagnosed bladder, urethral or ureteral stones or active stone passage in the past 6 months. Stones that are known to be in the kidney and have been stable for a period exceeding 3 months are permissible. 25. Postvoid residual (PVR) &gt; 250 ml. 26. Diagnosed or suspected bleeding disorder, or coagulopathies. 27. Use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication except low dose aspirin (≤81 mg/day) within 10 days prior to treatment. 28. Visible hematuria with subject urine sample without a known contributing factor. 29. Subject interested in maintaining fertility. 30. Use of betablockers, anticonvulsants, and antispasmodics where the dose is not stable. (Stable dose is defined as having the same medication and dose in the last six months). 31. At the time of baseline assessment, in the absence of a qualifying exception, subjects who are using or have used the following medications, and are unable or unwilling to discontinue using these medications for the prescribed washout period: 1. Use of antihistamines within 1 week of treatment unless there is documented evidence of stable dosing for last 6 months (no dose changes). 2. Use of the alpha blockers for BPH and anticholinergics or cholinergics (except for topical anti cholinergic eye drops), or within 4 weeks of baseline assessment. 3. Use of Type II, 5alpha reductase inhibitor (e.g., finasteride (Proscar, Propecia) within 3 months of baseline assessment. 4. Use of a dual 5alpha reductase inhibitor (e.g., dutasteride (Avodart)) within 6 months of baseline assessment. 5. Use of estrogen, drugproducing androgen suppression, or anabolic steroids within 3 months of baseline assessment. 6. Use of daily dose PD5 Inhibitors (e.g.Viagra, Levitra or Cialis) within 4 weeks of baseline assessment. 32. Subjects who have had an incidence of spontaneous urinary retention either treated with indwelling transurethral catheter or suprapubic catheter six months prior to baseline. A provoked episode now resolved is still admissible. 33. Compromised renal function defined as serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl. 34. Inability to provide a legally effective Informed Consent Form (ICF) and/or comply with all the required followup requirements. 35. Any cognitive or psychiatric condition that interferes with or precludes direct and accurate communication with the study investigator regarding the study or affect the ability to complete the study quality of life questionnaires.</criteria>
