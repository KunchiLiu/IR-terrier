	<brief_summary>The main purpose of the study is to test if taking a study drug called emricasan (also known as IDN-6556 and PF-03491390) will affect overall patient survival after one month of treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study will also see if overall patient survival is affected at 6 months, and if the study drug improves liver function.</detailed_description>

Biochemical parameters of severe disease as evidenced by MELD score &gt;20 but &lt;35, or MELD score 3540 if the SOFA score is &lt;10 4. Willingness to utilize 2 reliable forms of contraception (for both males and females of childbearing potential) from screening to 1 month after the completion of study treatment 5. Patients with established contraindications to steroid use including but not limited to the following: 1. GI bleed 2. Active infection, including spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, based on positive blood culture, urine culture, or chest xray (if positive, must have been on antibiotics for at least 24 hours prior to study entry) 3. Acute pancreatitis (increased lipase &gt; 3x ULN or radiologic evidence) 4. Positivity for hepatitis B (HBsAg+) or C virus (HCV+), and 5. Renal failure 1. Other or concomitant cause of liver disease as a result of: 1. Autoimmune liver disease (positive antimitochondrial antibody and smooth muscle antibody, positive reading on antinuclear antibody titer &gt;1:160) 2. Metabolic liver disease (abnormal ceruloplasmin levels) 3. Vascular liver disease 4. Drug induced liver disease Note: Concurrent viral hepatitis is not excluded. 2. Coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 3. Sepsis as evidenced by positive blood or urine culture, or pneumonia as confirmed by xray 4. History of renal transplant and/or on dialysis at time of entry into study 5. Inflammatory bowel disease 6. Diagnosed or suspected systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and/or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 7. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at entry into the study 8.

History or presence of clinically concerning cardiac arrhythmias, or prolongation of screening (pretreatment) QT or QTc interval of &gt;480 milliseconds (msec) 11. Significant systemic or major illness other than liver disease, including coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, pulmonary disease, renal failure, serious psychiatric disease, that, in the opinion of the Investigator would preclude the patient from participating in and completing the study 12. Patients requiring the use of vasopressors or inotropic support 13. Liver biopsy, if carried out, showing findings not compatible with alcoholic hepatitis 14. Any patient that has received any investigational drug or device within 30 days of dosing or who is scheduled to receive another investigational drug or device in the course of the study Note: Investigational drug includes any drug that is used offlabel. 15. If female, known pregnancy, or has a positive urine or serum pregnancy test, or lactating/breastfeeding 16. If male, if partner is known to be pregnant at time of entry into study or becomes pregnant while patient is on study drug or up to 1 month after completion of study drug 17.
