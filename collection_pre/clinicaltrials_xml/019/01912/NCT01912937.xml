	<brief_summary>To describe the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in the blood delivered from a paclitaxel coated percutaneous angioplasty balloon catheter as a result of treatment of de novo or restenotic lesion(s), occluded/stenotic or re-occluded/restenotic lesion(s).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study of Drug-coated Angioplasty Balloons in the Superficial Femoral or Popliteal Arteries:</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study investigates the inhibition of restenosis using the CVI Paclitaxel-coated PTA Catheter in the treatment of de-novo occluded/stenotic or re-occluded/ restenotic superficial femoral or popliteal arteries. The proposed clinical study will be a prospective, non-randomized, single arm, multi-center, pharmacokinetic study. The objective of the study is to describe the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in the blood delivered from the CVI Paclitaxel-coated PTA Catheter as a result of de novo occluded/restenotic or re-occluded/restenotic lesion(s).</detailed_description>
