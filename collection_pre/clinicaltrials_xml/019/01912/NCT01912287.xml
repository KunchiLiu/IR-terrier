	<brief_title>GATE: Generalized Anxiety - A Treatment Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We are currently conducting a treatment study to reduce stress and anxiety in people with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). This study will not use a medication, but instead will involve weekly stress reduction classes that use different strategies to reduce anxiety. The study involves having a formal psychiatric interview, filling out questionnaires, ECGs, saliva samples, a urine test for drugs of abuse, and study visits over 12 weeks. Each study visit will take a few hours. Qualified participants will be compensated for time and travel.</detailed_description>
