	<brief_summary>It is well-known that preterm delivery can be accompanied by complications. One of these complications is Intraventricular Hemorrhage (IVH). There are four degrees of IVH, according to severity. It is known that IVH Grades 3-4 can cause severe neurodevelopmental outcomes, including cerebral palsy (CP), hemiplegia, lower motor and cognitive skills and social difficulties. It is not known whether IVH Grades I-II have any of these effects and the aim of this study is to determine whether they do have any neurodevelopmental outcomes.</brief_summary>
