	<detailed_description>Next Steps is a community based pilot intervention study conducted in collaboration between community leaders, the University of Minnesota, Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC) and The Family Partnership. The study collaborators will develop and test a new program designed to help low-income multiethnic families with overweight or obese children achieve long-term maintenance of healthful behaviors following completion of HCMC's 16-week intensive obesity management course (Taking Steps Together (TST)). Next Steps, the focus of this study, will comprise a network of parent-led, community-based health maintenance programs that will be offered to TST graduate families. Project Aims: Aim 1: Establish a core parent leadership group and health maintenance program network that is self-sustaining and can serve the community for years to come. Aim 2: Test the feasibility, acceptability and sustainability of the Next Steps programs. Aim 3: Assess the impact of the Next Steps programs on helping participant families sustain or improve healthful behaviors and achieve or maintain healthy body mass index (BMI).</detailed_description>
