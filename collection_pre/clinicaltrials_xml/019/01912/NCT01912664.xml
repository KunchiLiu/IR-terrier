	<brief_summary>The mission of this project is to develop novel systems of care that can provide efficacious, scalable, cost-effective, participant friendly technology assisted behavioral interventions (TABIs) for the treatment of depression in adults. The investigators define TABIs as interventions that use information and telecommunications technologies such as the internet, mobile or traditional phones, computers and/or other technologies to support and deliver psychological and behavioral interventions. Through usability testing, focus interviews, and field trials, investigators may modify the technologies and intervention based on immediate usage data. The goal of this field trial is to tailor, and test, a peer networked intervention in adults 65 years of age or older. Two versions have been created and will be tested, one with and one without an online social network. The purpose of this study is to pilot a novel intervention, examine methods to improve adherence to Internet based interventions (e.g., peer network), and ultimately, to overcome the numerous barriers to treating depression in later life.</brief_summary>
