	<brief_summary>Surgery for malignant pleural mesothelioma is complex and prolonged, and may involve significant blood loss with considerable blood and product transfusion. Thromboelastography (TEG) is a global assay of coagulation that uses whole blood to produce a tracing that records kinetic changes in clot formation. This study aims provide a better understanding of the coagulation profile of these patients, and will form the basis of a TEG-based transfusion algorithm for future surgeries for mesothelioma.</brief_summary>
