	<brief_summary>This pilot study is a non-randomized controlled cohort study evaluating the impact of social network-based HIV education on antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, clinical outcomes, food security, social support, HIV knowledge, and risk behaviors among people living with HIV/AIDS, as well as members of their associated social support networks. The intervention, known as the Mfangano Health Net Microclinic Pilot Program, consists of a 6-month education program on HIV biology, interpersonal communication and community mobilization for both HIV positive individuals and their self-selected social network members selected irrespective of HIV status. Investigators hypothesize that participation in the microclinic program will improve ART adherence, cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count, social support, HIV knowledge and food insecurity and will reduce HIV-related stigma, as compared to participants in control communities.</brief_summary>
