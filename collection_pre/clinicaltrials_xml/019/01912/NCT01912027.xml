	<brief_summary>The open Latarjet techniques has benn considered as an effective treatment on anterior shoulder instability.Over the past decade there has been a shift from open to all-arthroscopic technique in many surgeries. The arthroscopic technique may result in less postoperative stiffness and faster rehabilitation. So we hypothesized that the arthroscopic Latarjet techniques would have better clinical and radiographic outcomes than the open Latarjet Techniques on anterior shoulder instability.</brief_summary>
