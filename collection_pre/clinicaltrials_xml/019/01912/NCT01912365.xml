	<brief_summary>Elbow fractures are very common in young children. Type I supracondylar fractures are stable fractures to the elbow that are treated conservatively across the world and typically heal very well without complications. There are several treatment options, including an above elbow cast or long arm splint. This study aims to determine if one treatment is no worse than the other in order to standardize the treatment of these fractures at our institution. The investigators hope to save families from extra hospital visits and reduce the amount of x-rays required for treatment of these fractures.</brief_summary>
