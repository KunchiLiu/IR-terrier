	<brief_summary>It is now established that indomethacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, at a dose of 100 mg, is effective in reducing the frequency and severity of pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in high risk patients. However, the optimal dose required is not known. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a dose of 200 mg, administered as rectal suppositories, is more effective than the standard dose of 100 mg. An ERCP procedure is a scope procedure where a lighted tube with a camera is passed down the patient's throat and allows for evaluation of the bile duct and/or pancreatic duct. The most common side effect of this procedure is post-ERCP pancreatitis, or swelling of the pancreas. Some patients are at higher risk for this complication than others. Our hypothesis is to compare the efficacy of these two dose regimens (100 mg vs 200 mg) of prophylactic rectally-administered indomethacin on the frequency and severity of post-ERCP pancreatitis in high-risk patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After obtaining informed consent, subjects will undergo ERCP per clinical protocol. All procedure-related clinical decisions and interventions will be dictated by the performing physician as he or she sees fit. At the end of the procedure, it will be determined by the endoscopist and research coordinator whether the patient meets inclusion criteria. If inclusion criteria are met, subjects will be randomized by concealed allocation to receive either 100mg or 150mg indomethacin, in the form of two or three 50mg rectal suppositories. Those patients who are randomized to receive the 100mg dose will receive an additional glycerin suppository. Four hours later, those patients who were randomized to the high-dose group will then receive an additional 50mg suppository while in the recovery area. At this same time point, subjects who were randomized to the standard-dose group, will receive a glycerin suppository in the recovery area. All participating patients will receive a total of 4 suppositories.</detailed_description>
