	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to determine if nasal naloxone is inferior to standard care for naloxone administration in a pre-hospital setting. Ambulance squads in Adams, Clermont, and Scioto counties in southern Ohio will be randomized to provide either standard care or nasal (IN) naloxone as the initial response to a suspected opioid overdose. Standard care includes administration of naloxone by intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM) or intraosseus (IO) methods.</brief_summary>
