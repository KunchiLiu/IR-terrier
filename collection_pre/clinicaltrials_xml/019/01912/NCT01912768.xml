	<criteria>Normal eyes (other than correction for visual acuity); Successful history of silicone hydrogel or soft contact lens wear in both eyes in one of the following brands: Soflens® 38, Proclear DW, Frequency 55, Acuvue® Oasys™, Air Optix Aqua, O2 OPTIX, Air Optix for Astigmatism, Air Optix Aqua Multifocal, Biofinity®, PureVision®, PureVision®2; Best spectacle corrected distance visual acuity greater than or equal to 20/25 in each eye; Other protocoldefined inclusion criteria may apply. Any ocular or systemic medical condition that may, in the opinion of the investigator, preclude safe administration of the investigational products or affect the results of this study; Need to wear contact lenses on an extended wear basis (ie, overnight) during the study; Use of a daily cleaner and/or an enzyme cleaner to care for lenses at least 7 days prior to Visit 1; History of intolerance or hypersensitivity to any component of the investigational products; Use of all overthecounter (OTC) or prescribed topical ocular medications within 7 days prior to Visit 1; Moderate, severe, abnormal, or other ocular findings; Current or history of ocular infection, severe inflammation, or disease within 6 months prior to Visit 1; Any systemic disease at Visit 1 (including allergies, respiratory infections or colds) that may affect the eye or be exacerbated by use of contact lenses or contact lens solutions; Use of systemic medications that may contribute to adverse ocular effects unless on a stable dosing regimen; Ocular surgery within the last 12 months; Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
