	<brief_summary>The mission of this project is to develop novel systems of care that can provide efficacious, scalable, cost-effective, participant friendly behavioral intervention technologies (BITs) for the prevention of depression in adolescents. The investigators define BITs as interventions that use information and telecommunications technologies such as the internet, mobile or traditional phones, computers and/or other technologies to support and deliver psychological and behavioral interventions. Through usability testing, focus interviews, and field trials, investigators may modify the technologies and intervention based on immediate usage data.</brief_summary>
