	<brief_summary>Periprocedural treatment with high-dose statins is known to have cardioprotective and pleiotropic effects, such as anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory actions. -Objective: to determine whether preoperative rosuvastatin loading is independently associated with reduced myocardial ischemia and clinical outcomes in patients with stable angina undergoing isolated off-pump coronary bypass (OPCAB) in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Study design - Prospective, double-blinded, single-center study of each 117 subjects enrolled - Subjects with acute coronary syndrome who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled preoperatively. - Eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to A) High-dose rosuvastatin (n=117) vs. B) Placebo (n=117). - The amount of preoperative administration of high-dose rosuvastatin will be 60mg of a total - All subjects will undergo OPCAB procedure. - The primary and secondary endpoints will be compared at 30 days and 2 years postoperatively between two groups</brief_summary>
