	<brief_summary>Although effective treatments for psychosocial symptoms and disorders are available, patients frequently do not receive the most appropriate and effective treatment for their symptoms because of inappropriate and unstructured diagnostics of psychosocial symptoms in general practice. The hypothesis is that by using the intervention SGE-PsyScan the clinical symptoms of patients can be assessed more uniformly and earlier as opposed to the GPs' assessment in usual care. As a result, patients are supposed to start earlier with a treatment that fits the type and severity of their symptoms better. The patients will be randomly assigned to either receive the SGE-PsyScan or usual care.</brief_summary>
