	<brief_summary>The objective of this randomized controlled trial is to describe the effect of two osteopathic techniques - "high velocity, low amplitude" (HVLA) and muscle energy (ME) - on thickness, activation, strength, pressure pain threshold (PPT) of the paravertebral muscles at the lumbar spine, as well as the peak plantar pressures immediately and after a two-day follow-up. The muscle thickness of the paravertebral muscles at the lumbar spine, namely internal oblique, external oblique and transversus abdominis can be altered after the application of 'high-velocity low-amplitude'(HVLA)and 'muscle energy' (ME)techniques immediately and after a two-day follow-up.</brief_summary>
