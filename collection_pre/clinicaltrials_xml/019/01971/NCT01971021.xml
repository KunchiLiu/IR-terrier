	<brief_summary>As of today there is very limited scientific knowledge in whicj of the two vascular access devices (PICC-line or venous ports) that offers the lowest complicationrates in cancerpatients. The study group wants to clearify this unsolved matter by comparing the two systems. Our primary endpoint is the presens of catheter related venous thrombosis. We are also looking at all catheter related complications and patient satisfaction.</brief_summary>
