	<brief_summary>Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD) is the most prevalent female sexual dysfunction in society and is strongly linked to the quality of life of women. The androgen hormones decline over age in the premenopausal period, which occurs around 20 years. Tribulus terrestris is a plant native to India, recommended in the treatment of infertility, low libido and impotence. Its main active ingredient is the protodioscin, which has been attributed to an increase in testosterone levels and improved sexual function. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of Tribulus Terrestris in premenopausal women with HSDD.</brief_summary>
