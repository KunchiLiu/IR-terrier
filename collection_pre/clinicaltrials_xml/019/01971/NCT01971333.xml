	<brief_summary>The arterial system compliance is compromised in liver cirrhotic patients. Dynamic preload variables are either pressure-based (e.g.pulse pressure variation; PPV), flow-based (e.g. stroke volume variation; SVV), or volume-based (plethysmographic variability index; PVI). It is not yet clear that dynamic preload parameters based on which mechanism will be accurate to predict fluid responsiveness in the cirrhotic patients. Therefore, this study aimed to claried which dynamic preload parameters would be more accurate during the liver transplantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dynamic Preload Parameters During Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fluid management is crucial during liver transplantation. Patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension have an altered blood volume distribution and pooling in the splanchnic circulation. Excess administration of intravenous fluid may increase portal hypertension due to splanchnic venous congestion and may also aggravate coagulopathy by dilution. On the other hand, fluid restriction may risk systemic and especially renal hypoperfusion. Traditional static fluid parameter, such as central venous pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, have been reported inaccurate to predict fluid responsiveness. In comparison, the recent developed dynamic fluid parameters based on heart-lung interaction were reported to be good preload indicators in a variety of different surgical settings. However, the validity of such dynamic fluid parameters is highly dependent on The arterial system compliance is compromised in liver cirrhotic patients.
