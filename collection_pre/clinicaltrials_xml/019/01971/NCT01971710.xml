	<brief_title>Advancing Community Level Action for Improving MCH/PMTCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will undertake a three-arm randomized trial in Swaziland, Uganda and Zimbabwe. Districts/regions (n=9) with 45 PMTCT-implementing health facilities and their catchment areas (populations 7300-27500), will be randomly allocated to three intervention arms: 1) community leader engagement, 2) community leader engagement with community days, or 3) community leader engagement with community days and male and female community peer groups. The primary study outcome is HIV exposed infants (HEI) returning to the health facility within two months for early infant diagnosis (EID) of HIV. Secondary study outcomes include: gestational age of women attending for first antenatal care, male partners tested for HIV, and HEI receiving nevirapine prophylaxis at birth. Changes in community knowledge, attitudes, practices and beliefs on MCH/PMTCT will be assessed through household surveys.</detailed_description>
