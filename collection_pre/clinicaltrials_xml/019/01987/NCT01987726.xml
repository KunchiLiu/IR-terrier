	<brief_title>Comprehensive Gene Sequencing in Guiding Treatment Recommendations Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the feasibility and logistics associated with a clinical trial utilizing the Foundation Medicine Incorporated (FMI) test in an academic therapeutic setting. II. To determine the proportion of patients who will receive a cancer-related therapy based on the results provided by the FMI test. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore and report estimates of progression free survival (PFS) of the regimen administered after the FMI test results are revealed and the PFS of the most recent regimen administered before the FMI test results were received. II. To determine the feasibility of performing Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) on metastatic tumor tissue. III. To determine the feasibility of administering cancer-related drugs that are proposed by the results of NGS that are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for a patient's specific cancer diagnosis. IV. To collect and report the molecular alterations discovered by NGS of advanced breast and colorectal cancer. V. To determine in an exploratory manner the concordance of the genomic alterations detected by the FMI test in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to the genomic alterations detected by FMI test in tumor tissues collected from the same patient. OUTLINE: PART I: Within 10 weeks of beginning a treatment regimen, tumor tissue samples and CTCs from patients are collected for NGS and FMI testing, respectively. Patients remain on current line of therapy until a change in treatment is warranted. The physician's treatment recommendation is documented prior to the release of the FMI results. PART II: Physicians are furnished with FMI test results when patients become eligible for a change in therapy and new treatment recommendations are documented. Treatment is dependent on preferences of the physician, patient, and/or results of the FMI test. After completion of study, patients are followed up for at least 18 months.</detailed_description>
