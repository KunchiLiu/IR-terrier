	<brief_summary>Four months of interval walking training (IWT) is superior to energy-expenditure matched continuous walking training (CWT) with regards to weight loss and improvements in glycemic control. The reason for this is unclear. One potential explanation for the differential outcome in weight loss is excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), which is defined as the elevated oxygen consumption measured during the hours following an exercise bout. A large EPOC means greater energy expenditure which, if energy intake does not change, leads to a greater weight loss. This weight loss may subsequently improve glycemic control - Aim 1: To assess the effect of an acute bout of IWT vs. an acute bout of CWT on glycemic control in type 2 diabetics and to assess mechanisms responsible for differences (if any). It is hypothesised that IWT will be more advantageous for improving glycemic control. - Aim 2: To examine the effect of an acute bout of IWT vs. an acute bout of CWT on EPOC. It is hypothesised that IWT will produce an EPOC of larger magnitude than CWT.</brief_summary>
