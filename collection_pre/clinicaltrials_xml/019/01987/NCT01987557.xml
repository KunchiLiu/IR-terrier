	<brief_summary>Treadmill training has been shown to be beneficial for reducing motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). The mechanisms for the therapeutic effects of treadmill training remain unknown. However, specific types of intrinsic feedback generated from muscle spindles (detect changes in length of muscle) and golgi tendon organs (detect muscle force) seem to be an important factor for achieving the reductions in motor scores. This study will compare a treadmill program that generates a high rate of intrinsic feedback to a treadmill program focused on generating a high magnitude of intrinsic feedback.</brief_summary>
