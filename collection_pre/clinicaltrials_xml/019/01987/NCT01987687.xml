	<brief_summary>Postprandial glycaemic control is an important risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Previous research has demonstrated that exercise performed in the postprandial state paradoxically results in a deterioration in glucose tolerance in the immediate post-exercise period (Gonzalez et a. 2013; Gonzalez and Stevenson 2013). This study aims to assess the timecourse of this post-exercise effect.</brief_summary>
