	<brief_summary>This research proposal is submitted to fulfill the requirement of the PHD degree of Community Medicine Saudi Board at the Joint Program of Family and Community Medicine in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Background: Cupping is an ancient treatment remedy that has been used for many centuries in many parts of the world. In the Middle East, Wet cupping "Hijama" is still a popular treatment because of its religious background. Despite of that, it still has little scientific evidence that proves its efficacy. Many hijama healers claim that they have observed dramatic improvement in Blood pressure control of hypertension patients. Not many studies support that. This study should help to prove or disprove this hypothesis. Objectives: - To determine the efficacy of wet cupping on blood pressure among high blood pressure patients. - To assess the incidence of wet cupping side effects in the intervention group. Methods: The study design is a randomised controlled trial. There will be an intervention group of high blood pressure patients who will perform hijama in addition to their usual management, and a control group of high blood pressure patients who will receive their usual anti-hypertension management only. There will be 8 weeks follow up period. After that, data entry, analysis and interpretation will take place. Hypothesis: Wet cupping has an effect on blood pressure in adult hypertension patients</brief_summary>
