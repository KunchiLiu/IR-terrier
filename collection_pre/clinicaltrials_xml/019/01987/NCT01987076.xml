	<brief_summary>Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a rare and severe multiorgan adverse drug reaction occurring within 2 to 6-8 weeks after a new drug intake. DRESS syndrome is defined by the combination of clinical manifestations, cutaneous, visceral and biological disturbances. Its prognosis is directly linked to severity of visceral involvement, with a mortality evaluated above 10%. Considering curative treatment, there is no consensus. Until now, no controlled trial has been performed. Systemic steroids are mainly used in first intention, in particular for management of visceral involvements, whatever their severity. From clinical practice, topical steroids are often used and could be helpful in the therapeutic management of DRESS. We propose to evaluate systemic steroids versus very potent topical steroids in a multicentric randomized controlled trial including defined moderate DRESS, ie the non-inferiority of very potent topical steroids in terms of remission of visceral involvement at Day30 and the superiority of very potent topical steroids in terms of delay to remission of skin involvement.</brief_summary>
