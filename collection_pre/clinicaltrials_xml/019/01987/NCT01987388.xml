	<brief_summary>The objective is to develop a new metabolic flexibility biomarker, which has application in the study of changes diet and exercise on fuel management in humans. The new biomarker involves the characterization of an individual's metabolic flexibility utilizing room calorimeters rather than the current method, which is based on glucose clamp data. It is hypothesized that this new metabolic flexibility method will be a useful and noninvasive biomarker for measuring adaptation to exercise and diet challenges.</brief_summary>
