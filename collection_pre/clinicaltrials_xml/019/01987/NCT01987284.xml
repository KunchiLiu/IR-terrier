	<brief_summary>Isolated Systolic Hypertension (ISH)is the dominating hypertensive disease in elderly people. Much attention has recently been drawn to the strong relationship between the systolic blood pressure and cardiovascular morbidity. In previous clinical studies carried out in individuals with normal blood pressure at baseline SER100 decreased primarily the systolic blood pressure. It is hypothesized that the effect on systolic blood pressure in hypertensive patients will be larger or equal to the fall seen in normotensive patients.</brief_summary>

Subjects with upper arm circumference ≤24 cm or ≥ 42 cm. Any general condition, serious disease or current evidence of any mental or physical disorder or collaboration attitude (e.g. dementia, substance abuse) which, in the judgment of the investigator makes the subject unsuitable for enrollment, and/or may interfere with the study evaluations or affect subject's safety and/or may cause risk for poor protocol compliance Pregnant or lactating women.
