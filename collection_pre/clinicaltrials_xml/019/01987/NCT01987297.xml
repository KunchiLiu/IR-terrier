	<brief_title>Combined Retinoic Acid,Arsenic Trioxide and Chemo for Newly-diagnosed APL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this prospective randomized study for patients with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia. For induction, all patients will be randomized into two groups which received treatment composed of retinoic acid combined with arsenic trioxide versus retinoic acid combined with chemotherapy. For consolidation, the experimental group recieved 2 cycles of ATRA+arsenic and control group recieved two cycles of ATRA+idarubicin or daunorubicin. After consolidation, all patients achieved molecular remission will recieved 5 cycles of maintenance treatment with ATRA and arsenic. In case of intermediate or high-risk disease, cytarabine will be add for consolidation.</detailed_description>
