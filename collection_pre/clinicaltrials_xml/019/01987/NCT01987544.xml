	<brief_summary>Home ergometer training combined with online monitoring and regular telephone support could prove to be a cost-effective method to improve physical performance and quality of life in COPD patients. The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate a significantly higher daily workout time in patients that are monitored during home ergometer training with telephone support compared to conventional home ergometer training. Consequently we expect an increased quality of life related to the illness and a decreasing BODE-Index. A post-interventional lower BODE-Index correlates with a reduced risk of hospitalisation and mortality.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Ergometer Training With Telemonitoring in Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) After Exacerbation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis: There will be an increased prevalence, morbidity and mortality of COPD during the next decades. On the other hand there is a clear correlation between life expectancy and physical activity in this disease. Telemedicine concepts promise new treatment strategies with favourable impact on the long-term process of COPD.</detailed_description>
