	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that the use of an allograft adjuvant to partial repair will lead to improved shoulder outcome measure scores compared to partial repair alone in massive rotator cuff tears.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Allograft Reconstruction of Massive Rotator Cuff Tears vs Partial Repair Alone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 30 patients will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will be randomized into two arms, either (1) Partial Repair/Debridement or (2) Allograft Reconstruction. The patients will complete a structured clinical examination conducted by a sports medicine fellowship trained orthopaedic consultant, Pre-operatively and Post-operatively at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12, 24 months. The examination will consist of range of motion testing by goniometer as well as strength testing by hand dynamometer. The patient will also complete the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC) questionnaire. The main benefit of this procedure is that patients who have currently irreparable massive, chronic rotator cuff tears may acquire a means for their cuff to be repaired. This may aid in improving function of the shoulder, restoring ability to complete activities of daily living, while decreasing pain and sleep disturbances. This would allow the participant to become more functional after rehabilitation. It is our belief that this study could provide new information in helping to understand this relationship, which would in turn lead to future study in this area of orthopaedic surgery.</detailed_description>
