	<brief_summary>This open-label, single-arm, phase IIIb study will evaluate the safety of switching from intravenous (IV) to subcutaneous (SC) administration of MabThera/Rituxan during first-line treatment for patients with CD20+ non-Hodgkin's follicular lymphoma (FL) or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who have already received at least one full dose of MabThera/Rituxan IV. Patients with FL will be given 1400 mg MabThera/Rituxan SC during induction therapy (once monthly for 4-7 cycles) and maintenance therapy (once every 2 months for 6-12 cycles). 1400 mg SC of MabThera/Rituxan will be given to patients with DLBCL once monthly for 4-7 cycles. Treatment duration is expected to last up to 7 months for patients with DLBCL and up to 32 months for patients with FL.</brief_summary>
