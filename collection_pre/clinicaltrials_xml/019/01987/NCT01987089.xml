	<brief_summary>Insomnia is a highly prevalent disorder in those recovering from alcoholism. It has been associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as an increased risk of relapse back to the drinking. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), a non-pharmacologic approach is the recommended standard of care for insomnia. Some preliminary studies have shown that CBT-I may be efficacious for insomnia during recovery. The current study proposes to use a standard 8-week CBT-I to treat the insomnia with a post-treatment follow-up at 3- and 6-months (after treatment). Further, it will evaluate if an improvement in the insomnia is associated with an improvement in the underling alcoholism and the daytime functioning. On an exploratory basis, the association of a first-degree family history of alcoholism with the insomnia severity and treatment response will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eligible subjects will be Veterans with alcohol dependence during their first year of recovery, 21-65 years old, with ISI total score of 15 or more, medically and psychiatrically stable, and without dependence on other drugs (with the exception of nicotine and marijuana). The proposed study will consist of a single-blind trial comparing CBT-I against a behavioral placebo intervention (Quasi-Desensitization Therapy, QDT). Baseline assessments conducted over a month will comprehensively evaluate for the addiction, psychiatric, sleep and medical disorders, as well as for a family history of alcohol dependence. Once the subject is seen to be eligible for the study he will be randomized to either the CBT-I or the QDT arm, and treated for the next weeks. The primary outcome measure for insomnia will be the Insomnia Severity Index. The primary outcome measure for alcohol dependence will be the percent days abstinent (on the Time Line Follow Back measure, TLFB), and the daytime symptoms will be assessed using the Short Form-12 item scale (SF-12, for self reported well-being), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, for depressive symptoms), and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI, for anxiety symptoms). After completion of the treatment phase, subjects will be followed up 3 months and 6 months later, to assess for changes over time in their insomnia, alcohol use, and daytime functioning.</detailed_description>
