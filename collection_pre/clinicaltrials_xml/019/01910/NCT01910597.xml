	<brief_summary>Soluble Beta-Glucan (SBG) is a compound prepared from commercial active dry Baker's yeast which is then proceeded through a multi-step laboratory processes invented by Prof. Rapepun Wititsuwannakul, Faculty of Science, Prince of Songkla University, Thailand. Based upon pre-clinical data, SBG has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis and probably enhance immune function, leading to shrinkage of tumor size in athymic nude mice injected by hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) and cervical cancer cells. Therefore, the investigators expect to see the safety and anti-cancer property of SBG in patients with advanced cancer whom no available therapy can be offered.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I, Dose-Escalation Study of Soluble Beta-Glucan (SBG) in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Diagnosis of histologically or cytologically documented, advancedstage, primary or metastatic solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapy or for which no available standard therapy exists. Evidence of measurable or evaluable disease. Age must be at least 18 years. ECOG performance status must be 0 or 2. Received only best supportive care. Patient must meet protocolspecified laboratory values. Second primary cancer diagnosed within 5 years, except cervical carcinoma in situ, basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma which completed curative treatment. Concurrent therapy with any other investigational agent. Severe, acute, or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or studydrug administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, make the subject inappropriate for this study. Allergy to study drug.</criteria>
