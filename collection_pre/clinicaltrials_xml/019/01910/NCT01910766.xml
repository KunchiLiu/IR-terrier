One hundred ten infertile women with PCOS resistant to CC were randomized to either combined CC/CoQ10 (51 patients, 82 cycles) or CC 150 mg/day alone (50 patients, 71 cycles) for ovulation induction in patients with CC-resistant PCOS. Main outcome measures: Number of follicles, serum E2, serum P, endometrial thickness, pregnancy rate (PR) and miscarriage rate.</brief_summary>
