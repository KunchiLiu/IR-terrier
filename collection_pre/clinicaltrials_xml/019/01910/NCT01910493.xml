	<brief_summary>Mobile phone SMS are increasingly used to promote positive health behaviour with an aim to improve health outcomes. However, robust data on the efficacy of SMS on health seeking behaviour and patient outcomes in resource-limited settings is sparse. The SMSaude study aims to assess whether regular SMS-reminders improve retention on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) programmes in Mozambique.</brief_summary>
