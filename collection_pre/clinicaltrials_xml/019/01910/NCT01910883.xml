	<criteria>Subjects will be males or females of any ethnic origin between 18 and 65 years of age and with a body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 and 32.0 kg/m2 inclusive. Female subjects must be of nonchildbearing potential, and are defined as follows: Female subjects 50 years of age or less must be surgically sterile or postmenopausal (defined as at least two years post cessation of menses and/or follicular stimulating hormone &gt;40 mIU/mL and serum oestradiol &lt;110 pmol/L). Female subjects of more than 51 years of age must be surgically sterile or postmenopausal (defined by a value of follicular stimulating hormone &gt;40 mIU/mL and no spontaneous menstruation for at least one year before the first dose). Subjects must be in good health, as determined by a medical history, physical examination, 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory evaluations. Subjects will have given their written informed consent to participate in the study and to abide by the study restrictions. Male subjects who are not willing, or whose partners are not willing, to use appropriate contraception (such as condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository) from the time of the first dose until 3 months after the final dosing occasion. Subjects who have received any prescribed systemic or topical medication within 14 days (or corticosteroids within 4 weeks) of the first dose administration (for female subjects, stable hormone replacement therapy is acceptable) unless in the opinion of the Investigator the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise safety. Subjects who have used any nonprescribed systemic or topical medication (including herbal remedies) within 7 days of the first dose administration (with the exception of vitamin/mineral supplements) unless in the opinion of the Investigator the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise safety. Subjects who have received any medications, including St John's Wort, known to chronically alter drug absorption or elimination processes within 30 days of the first dose administration unless in the opinion of the Investigator the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise safety. Subjects who are still participating in a clinical study (e.g. attending followup visits) or who have participated in a clinical study involving administration of an investigational drug in the past 3 months. Subjects who have donated any blood, plasma or platelets in the 3 months prior to randomisation or who have made donations on more than two occasions within the 12 months preceding the first dose administration. Subjects with a significant history of drug allergy as determined by the Investigator. Subjects with a current or history of allergy to antibiotics as determined by the Investigator. Subjects who have out of range values for Liver Function Tests. Subjects with nonhaemolytic bilirubinaemia (Gilbert's syndrome). Subjects who have any clinically significant allergic disease (excluding nonactive hayfever) as determined by the Investigator. Subjects who have a supine blood pressure and supine pulse rate higher than 140/90 mmHg and 100 beats per minute (bpm), respectively, or lower than 90/50 mmHg and 40 bpm, respectively, confirmed by a repeat assessment. Subjects who consume more than 28 units (males) or more than 21 units (females) of alcohol per week or who have a significant history of alcoholism or drug/chemical abuse as determined by the Investigator (1 unit of alcohol equals Â½ pint [285 mL] of beer or lager, 1 glass [125 mL] of wine, or 1/6 gill [25 mL] of spirits). Subjects with a positive urine drug screen or alcohol breath test result at screening or first admission. Subjects who smoke more than 10 cigarettes or the equivalent in tobacco per day. Subjects with, or with a history of, any clinically significant neurological, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, psychiatric, respiratory, metabolic, endocrine, haematological or other major disorders as determined by the Investigator. Subjects with a history of tendon rupture or tendonitis. Subjects who have had a clinically significant illness within 4 weeks of the start of dose administration as determined by the Investigator. 19. Subjects who are known to have serum hepatitis, or who are carriers of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibody, or who have a positive result to the test for HIV antibodies. Subjects who have an abnormality in the 12lead ECG that, in the opinion of the investigator, increases the risk of participating in the study, such as QTcB interval &gt;450 msec (male) or greater than 470 msec (female), 2nd or 3rd degree Atrioventricular block, complete left bundle branch block, complete right bundle branch block or WolffParkinsonWhite Syndrome, defined as PR&lt;110 msec, confirmed by a repeat ECG. Subjects who have previously taken part in or withdrawn from this study. Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, should not participate in the study.</criteria>
