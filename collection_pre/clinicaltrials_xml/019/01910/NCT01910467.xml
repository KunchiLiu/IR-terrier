	<brief_summary>Objectives Firstly to examine in preterm neonates, whether it is possible to reduce number of hypotensive episodes and use of catecholamines by applying cerebral/peripheral near infrared spectroscopy in combination with predefined interventions and secondly to explore the potential impact on cerebral injury and mortality. Hypothesis By using predefined interventions for changes in cerebral/peripheral oxygenation ratio investigators will reduce hypotensive episodes and use of catecholamines which will reduce cerebral injury and mortality. Methods Cerebral (cTOI) and peripheral-muscle (pTOI) tissue-oxygenation-index (NIRO 300) will be measured for 24h starting &lt;6 hours postpartum. When cTOI/pTOI ratio increases &gt;5% within a 6h period, predefined interventions will be performed. Primary outcome parameter will be duration of hypotensive episodes and use of catecholamines during the first 48h after birth. Secondary outcome parameters will be cerebral injury and mortality.</brief_summary>
