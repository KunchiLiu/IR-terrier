	<brief_title>Efficacy of Shinabro in Hand Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis (OA) as a common musculoskeletal disease affects more than 30% of the elderly population. It frequently involves knees, hips, spines and hands. In hands, the distal and proximal interphalangeal and the first carpometacarpal joints are affected, leading often to significant disability and limitation in the daily activity. The chronic progressive nature of the disease requires a life-long treatment. The mainstay treatment of hand OA targets pain control. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used. However, they are frequently associated with significant gastrointestinal side effects including gastritis, peptic ulcer diseases, and bleeding, especially with long term use. Further, they do not ameliorate pain completely, requiring additional medications such as acetaminophen or opioid-based analgesics. Shibaro is a mixture of purified oriental herbs consisting of Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Acanthopanacis Cortex, Cibotii Rhizoma, Glycine Semen, and Eucommiae Cortex. These herbs have been used for the treatment of diverse inflammatory conditions in Chines traditional medicine. All 6 herbs show an excellent safety profile and their anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects have been studied in both animals and humans. As such, given the excellent safety profile, anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, Shinbaro might be ideal in the treatment of OA. This study will investigate the efficacy and safety of Shinbaro in the treatment of hand OA in a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, multi-center trial.</detailed_description>
