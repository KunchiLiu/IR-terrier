	<brief_summary>Saturated fat leading to elevated low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is considered a cardiovascular risk factor. The properties associated with α- cyclodextrin, allow it to selectively reduce saturated fat and calories which will have a medically beneficial effect on LDL cholesterol and obesity. The purpose of the research is to evaluate this effect of α- cyclodextrin. It is hypothesized that alpha cyclodextrin supplementation will increase fecal fat on a high saturated fat diet compared to the same diet supplemented with a digestible carbohydrate control</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Oral Alpha-Cyclodextrin on Fecal Fat Excretion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alpha-cyclodextrin which functions as a soluble dietary fiber, has been shown to a form a stable emulsion with dietary fat in the ratio of 1:9, with a higher affinity for saturated fat compared to unsaturated fat. In humans, supplementation with α-cyclodextrin has been shown to lead to a significant weight loss regardless of whether energy intake was maintained or increased.The aim of this study is to evaluate the results of a 72 hour fecal fat test using stool markers on the last three days of each of three six-day feeding periods. Subjects will be served a weight maintaining diet containing 40% fat (of which 40% will be saturated), 30% protein and 30% carbohydrate for 18 days. Subjects will also consume 1 gram alpha cyclodextrin with 1 gram of starch, 2 grams of alpha cyclodextrin, or 2 grams of starch in capsule form before breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day in each of the three six-day feeding periods. At this dose, alpha-cyclodextrin is recognized as safe by the FDA. All stools will be collected over a 72 hour period at the end of each feeding period and analyzed for fecal fat excretion.</detailed_description>
