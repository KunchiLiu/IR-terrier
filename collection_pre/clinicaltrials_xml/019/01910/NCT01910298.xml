	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, parallel design comparing a primary efficacy endpoint between subjects undergoing immediate post-mastectomy breast reconstruction with a breast implant and Strattice™ Reconstructive Tissue Matrix (TM) and subjects undergoing immediate, two-stage post-mastectomy breast reconstruction, where the initially placed expander will be exchanged for a breast implant only, without any type of reinforcement.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Single Stage Breast Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of immediate single-stage post-mastectomy breast reconstruction with Strattice™ TM, otherwise referred to as direct to implant (DTI) as compared to immediate two-stage post-mastectomy breast reconstruction where the initially placed expander will be exchanged for a breast implant only, without any type of reinforcement. The objective will be achieved by prospectively assessing the number of planned and unplanned post-mastectomy surgical interventions A within 12 months of the mastectomy. Two-stage breast reconstruction will include the initial placement of a tissue expander in a total or partial submuscular position. In the case of partial muscle coverage, this will be without the support of any mesh or autologous flap to reinforce the lower pole. The expander will be inflated over approximately the next one to six months, and then replaced with an implant.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Female 18 years or older 2. A candidate for both arms of the study involving immediate breast reconstruction postskin sparing mastectomy (unilateral or bilateral) (DTI with the use of Strattice TM, 2 stage with use of Tissue Expander through exchange to Implant without support of a mesh or autologous tissue) 3. An American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification of 1 or 2 4. Estimated life expectancy &gt; 3 years 5. Able and willing to return for all scheduled and required study visits 6. Able to provide written informed consent for study participation 1. Clinically significant systemic disease, as determined by the Investigator, which could affect study participation or study results 2. Received neoadjuvant, inductive chemotherapy (except Herceptin, or other targeted therapy) within 4 weeks prior to mastectomy 3. Previous radiation therapy to either breast at any time 4. Predicted permanent implant size that is greater than or equal to 500 gms, per Investigator assessment 5. BMI &lt;17 or &gt; 30 6. Comorbid factors which predispose to postoperative infection, e.g. diabetes, collagen vascular disease, chronic steroid (except inhalers)/immunosuppressant use, immune deficiency, or coexistent infection 7. Pregnant or lactating 8. 3rd degree ptosis 9. Prior breast surgery including: breast reduction, augmentation, mastopexy, quadrectomy, and partial mastectomy with reduction of the skin envelope 10. Prior use of a device (mesh or matrix) in the Breast 11. Concomitant unrelated condition of breast/chest wall/skin that, as determined by the investigator, could adversely affect the surgical outcome (e.g. significant chest wall abnormalities including pectus excavatum or pectus carinatum) 12. Planned autologous tissue flap in addition to prosthetic implant 13. Use of permanent expander implants such as Becker expanders or the Natrelle Anatomical Permanent expander 150 14. Current alcohol abuse, illicit drug use, significant mental illness, physical dependence to any opioid, or drug abuse or addiction 15. Currently enrolled or plans to enroll in another clinical trial unless it is: a registry, a retrospective study, a neoadjuvant chemotherapy trial (as long as the chemotherapy regimen has been stopped 4 weeks prior to mastectomy), or a hormone/antihormonal therapy trial 16. Any of the conditions identified within the labeled contraindications, i.e. sensitivity to porcine derived products or polysorbate 20.</criteria>
