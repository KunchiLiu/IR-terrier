	<brief_summary>The main objective is the comparison of intubation conditions after anesthetic induction bolus of propofol-sufentanil when compared to injection of propofol-remifentanil in patients undergoing surgery for tooth extraction. Intubation without myorelaxant with propofol and sufentanil is classic but less efficient than induction with curare on achieving perfect intubation conditions. The use of a protocol without curare is sometimes justified for short gestures or when you want to avoid allergia. Remifentanil often provides excellent intubation conditions without myorelaxant. However, remifentanil was never compared to sufentanil in terms of intubating conditions without muscle relaxant.</brief_summary>
