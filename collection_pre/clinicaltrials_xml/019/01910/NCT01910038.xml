	<brief_summary>The usual percentage of patients receiving 0.1 mg/Kg/d or less of prednisone after 6 months of treatment is approximately 40%. We believe that adding tocilizumab to the corticotherapy in this protocol could increase the percentage from 40 to 70%. From an immunological point of view, we believe we will see not only a fall in the Th17 response (as with corticoids alone), but also a rise in Treg lymphocytes.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age &gt; 50 ans Diagnosis of Horton's disease defined according to ACR criteria (annex 1). Newlydiagnosed disease and corticotherapy started for less than 14 days (exceptionally, + 7 additional days in case of a delay in obtaining results of the BAT) Biopsy of the temporal artery (TAB) compatible with the diagnosis of HD: nonnecrotising giantcell arteritis with a granulomatous inflammatory infiltrate, usually located at the intimamedia junction, made up of lymphocytes, macrophages and multinucleated giant cells; or at least evidence of a chronic inflammatory infiltrate made up of lymphocytes and a few neutrophils or eosinophils without giant cells. For men and women of a childbearing age, an effective method of contraception must be used by the patient or his or her partner throughout the treatment with tocilizumab (or placebo) and for 3 months after the end of the treatment. Breastfeeding is not authorised until 3 months after the end of treatment with tocilizumab.

Patients on longterm corticoids for another disease Start of treatment for Horton's disease with one dose &gt; 1 mg/Kg whatever the duration Infections: Chronic (or acute) viral hepatitis B or C Infection with HIV Persistent or severe infection requiring hospitalisation or IV antibiotherapy during the 30 days preceding inclusion Infection requiring oral antibiotics in the 14 days preceding inclusion History of active tuberculosis, histoplasmosis or listeriosis Signs of latent tuberculosis (based on a history of untreated contact, opacity of more than 1 cm in diameter on a lung Xray, or a positive in vitro test (Quantiferon Gold or TSpotTB) History of sigmoiditis complicating diverticulosis, a history of peritonitis Unstable disease: uncontrolled diabetes with a history of recurrent infections, unstable ischemic heart disease, Heart failure ≥ stage III/IV of the New York Heart Association , recent cerebrovascular accident, or any other severe disease that may, because of participation in the study and in the opinion of the investigator, lead to a risk for the patient. Patients with a vascular risk Patients with a high cardiovascular risk: proven history of coronary artery disease or vascular disease, type 2 diabetes with a high cardiovascular risk *, vascular risk &gt;20% at 10 years (Framingham equation) Severe dyslipidemia not controlled by lipidlowering treatment Active liver disease and hepatocellular insufficiency Neutropenia (&lt;500/mm3) or thrombopenia (&lt;50 000/mm3) Demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (current or past) Neoplasia of less than 5 years, except skin cancer (other than melanoma) with complete R0 resection</criteria>
