	<brief_summary>Vocal Cord Dysfunction (VCD) is characterized by involuntary closure of the vocal cords while inhaling. Children and adolescents with VCD may experience multiple symptoms, including difficulty breathing, coughing, wheezing, neck tightness, and voice changes. There is limited information on optimal management of VCD. In our proposed study, we will use cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques to change how patients respond to their VCD symptoms. Measurements of airflow during breathing as well as symptom frequency and intensity will be examined prior to and following a series of four therapy sessions with a clinical psychologist that are focused on teaching patients strategies to decrease symptom reactivity.</brief_summary>
