	<brief_summary>Hospitalized trauma patients frequently suffer from blood clots in the legs or lungs. To minimize the risk of these blood clots developing, patients may be given a blood-thinner drug such as enoxaparin. Until now, a set dose of enoxaparin has been given to a patient, regardless of his or her weight. However, a recent study suggests that for obese patients, the set dose may be inadequate. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether or not a dose of enoxaparin that is based on the patient's weight will help to prevent the formation of blood clots. The information gathered through this study will help doctors to understand the best way to prevent blood clots in future trauma patients. The potential risks of participating in this study include the minor risks of blood draws and ultrasounds, as well as the more significant risks of bleeding as a side effect of the enoxaparin.</brief_summary>
