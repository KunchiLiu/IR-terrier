	<brief_summary>Gynecologists are currently using laparoscopy to perform many surgeries traditionally approached by laparotomy. The technical skills required for laparoscopic surgery are different than the skills required for laparotomy, causing a prolonged learning curve. Currently there is no standardized laparoscopy curriculum for gynecology residents. This study aims to develop a specific evidence-based surgical skills gynecologic curriculum that could be instituted in residency programs at a national and international level. The investigators will then validate the curriculum using Obstetrics and Gynecology residents through a cognitive examination, a technical skills examination, and a video recording of performance in the operating room. HYPOTHESIS: The investigators aim is to design a standardized evidence-based comprehensive laparoscopic curriculum that focuses on cognitive knowledge, surgical skills, and team training exercises. The investigators hypothesize that residents in the experimental curriculum-trained group will perform better than the residents in the traditional residency curriculum-trained group on a cognitive examination, a technical skills examination, and in the operating room. The operating room performance will be judged by blinded experts on a previously validated evaluation tool.</brief_summary>
