	<brief_summary>This purpose of this study is to determine the ability of an 18F-fluoro-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-DOPA) PET scan to detect a focal lesion of hyperinsulinism and determine the location in patients with congenital hyperinsulinism, Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome and suspected insulinoma. Safety data will be collected.</brief_summary>
