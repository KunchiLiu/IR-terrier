	<brief_summary>This study involves adolescents operated with arterial switch procedure for transposition of the great arteries during the neonatal period. The purpose is to evaluate the coronary arteries and direct and indirect findings of coronary artery disease/complications with 3 tesla magnetic resonance imaging.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI Study After Arterial Switch Operation in Patients With Transposition of the Great Arteries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study involves adolescents operated with arterial switch procedure for transposition of the great arteries during the neonatal period. The patients were operated with two different methods of re-implantation of the coronary arteries ("trap-door"/non-"trap-door", see description below).</detailed_description>
