	<brief_title>Differences in Response to the Flu Vaccine Among Adults With HIV and Without HIV in Uganda</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This longitudinal, observational cohort study will be conducted at the Makerere University- Johns Hopkins University Research Collaboration, at the Mulago National Referral Hospital complex in Kampala Uganda. The study will consist of 2 groups. One group will consist of 25 healthy HIV uninfected adults and the other arm will consist of 35 HIV infected adults. Within the HIV infected arm there will be two groups, 25 HIV infected adults and 10 long term non-progressors. Vaccinees will receive a primary immunization at day 0, and blood samples will be obtained at days 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 28 and 100 after immunization. We will analyze the early molecular signatures (identified by microarray analyses, as well as by FACS analyses of innate immune cells and luminex analyses of cytokines and chemokines) that correlate and predict the later immune responses.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. For HIV uninfected group Confirmation of HIV1 infection from medical records 2. For HIV infected on HAART group Confirmation of HIV1 infection from medical records Participants must be on HAART for at least 6 months prior to enrollment A CD4 Tcell count available in the last 6 months CD4 Tcell count &gt;350 cells/μL on the eligibility blood specimen 3. Longterm nonprogressor group HIV infected for more than 7 years No evidence of opportunistic infections in the medical records Never received antiretroviral therapy (except antiretrovirals for prevention of mothertoinfant transmission of HIV) A CD4 Tcell count available in the last 6 months CD4+ Tcell count slop of ≥0 cells/µl blood from entry into the MUJHU cohort until the most recent available CD4+ Tcell count. 1. Current moderate or severe acute illness, history of fever or temperature ≥37.5oC within 48 hours prior to vaccination (participants can be reevaluated at a subsequent visit) 2. History of systemic disease, including: GuillainBarré Syndrome; known hepatitis B, or hepatitis C infection; cardiac disease; uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (including gestational diabetes); chronic liver condition; clinically significant renal impairment; clinically significant neurological disorders; active TB within the last year; Cancer. This information will be based on selfreporting and (where possible) will be confirmed by hospital medical records 3. Received immunoglobulin or other blood product within the preceding 3 months or expected receipt of blood products during the 3 months of followup 4. History of anaphylactic hypersensitivity reactions to egg proteins (eggs or egg products), or any other component of the vaccine including traces (formaldehyde, octoxinol 9 (Triton X100) and neomycin) 5. History of severe reaction (including hypersensitivity) after receiving any vaccine 6. Currently pregnant 7. In the opinion of the study team it would be unsuitable for the study subjects to receive the vaccine or participate in the study.</criteria>
