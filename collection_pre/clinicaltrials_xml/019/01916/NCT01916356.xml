	<brief_title>Improving Knowledge About Infertility; an Online Educational Tool</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is being conducted to assess how a short, online educational video changes knowledge about fertility and infertility in couples attending an infertility clinic for the first time. Participants will complete a questionnaire testing knowledge about infertility and general demographic information (age, gender, previous information sources on infertility, etc.) will be collected. Participants will then be directed to a short video on infertility. One week later, participants will return to the site to complete the infertility test questions a second time in order to test memory retention. The focus of both the questionnaire and educational video will be basic reproductive biology, infertility risk factors, etiologies and treatments and fertility myths.</detailed_description>
