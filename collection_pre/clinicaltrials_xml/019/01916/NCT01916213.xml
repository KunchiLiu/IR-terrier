	<brief_summary>The investigators would like to assess whether selecting mature sperm using PICSI (selecting for sperm that bind hyaluronan) can optimize the IVF outcome of ICSI . Aim 1. Primary outcome: To compare routine sperm selection using ICSI with sperm selection using PICSI plates in terms of implantation and fertilization rates for couples with male factor fertility 2. Secondary outcome : To compare live birth rates ,ongoing pregnancies and miscarriage rates for couples with male factor infertility using routine sperm selection with ICSI compared to using PICSI plates for sperm selection Hypothesis: Sperm selected for ICSI using (PICSI) will reveal increased implantation rates in comparison to sperm selected for conventional ICSI</brief_summary>
