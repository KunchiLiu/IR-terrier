	<brief_summary>The ultimate goal of the PCDIAB project is to develop a bi-hormonal pump (insulin and glucagon) substituting for the pancreas and facilitating tight euglycemic control in patients with T1DM.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial to Compare the Relative Pharmacodynamic Properties of Different Glucagon Dosages</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is planned as open, randomised 3-period cross-over in patients with T1DM. The study will include a total of 6 completing patients. The study is not blinded due to the exploratory nature. At each of the 3 periods, different blood glucose level will be established in 4 steps (8, 6, 4, and 2.8 mmol/L), and a prefixed glucagon dose will be given per glucose level. The sequence of glucagon dose strength for the three dosing days will be randomized.</detailed_description>
