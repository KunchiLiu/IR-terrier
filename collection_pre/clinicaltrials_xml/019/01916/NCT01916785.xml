	<brief_summary>This protocol is a multicentric interventional phase II study from the French CML Intergroup (FILMC). The core of the protocol is to explore the efficacy and safety of an optimization strategy consisting in the modulation of the dasatinib daily dose according to the results of repeated plasmatic levels of dasatinib. The objective of this strategy is to improve the overall results of the treatment of early CP-CML in order to avoid the development of resistance and BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase mutations. The study will be conducted in selected FILMC and Canadian centers. The study is sponsored by the Hôpitaux de Versailles and supported by Bristol-Myers Squibb. The dasatinib treatment will be provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb until marketing authorization is granted in that indication.</brief_summary>
