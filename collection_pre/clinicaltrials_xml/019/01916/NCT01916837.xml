	<brief_title>Genomic Grade Index (GGI): Feasibility in Routine Practice and Impact on Treatment Decisions in Early Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of implementing Genomic Grade Index (GGI) in community hospitals in Belgium for breast cancer patients with node negative and 1-3 node positive early breast cancer. GGI would be considered a feasible genomic test if results were obtained in &gt; 70% of evaluated patients.</detailed_description>
