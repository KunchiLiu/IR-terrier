	<brief_summary>The Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative (ANGI) is the largest and most rigorous genetic investigation of eating disorders ever conducted. Researchers in the United States, Sweden, Australia, and Denmark will collect clinical information and blood samples from over 13,000 individuals with anorexia nervosa and individuals without an eating disorder. ANGI represents a global effort to detect genetic variation that contributes to this potentially life-threatening illness. The goal of the research study is to transform knowledge about the causes of eating disorders to work toward greater understanding and ultimately a cure. If you have suffered from anorexia nervosa at any point in your life, you can help us achieve this goal. Your contribution would include a brief questionnaire and a blood sample. If you have never had anorexia nervosa, but still want to contribute, we invite your participation as well.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participation in this genetics study requires participants to answer some questions online, about eating behaviors (about 15-30 minutes) and to provide a single blood sample that should take only a few minutes. To obtain the blood sample, investigators will mail you a kit which participants would take to their primary care provider or your local laboratory to have them draw a small sample of blood (about 40 mL, which is less than three tablespoons). The study is also working with a mobile phlebotomy company that can come to your home or location of your choice to draw your blood and ship it at no cost to you. Once the sample is drawn, participants or the mobile phlebotomist will place it in a box and contact FedEx for pick up. There is no cost for the FedEx shipment. Participants will also fill out the reimbursement form and send it and the receipt to our office. Investigators will reimburse participants for the cost of the blood draw. The samples will be studied directly or reprogrammed prior to further study.</detailed_description>
