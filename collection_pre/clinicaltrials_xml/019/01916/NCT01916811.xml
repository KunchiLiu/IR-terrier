	<brief_title>Load Quantitative MRI Study of Incipient LBP Patients.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low back pain is a common clinical disease seriously affects the quality of people's lives. And this disease takes up a large proportion in the crowd. Incipient lumbago is hard to diagnose and often hidden morbidity. If early symptoms are ignored by patients, it will greatly influence the quality of life in the future. This study will use 3.0T MRI to distinguish the difference of lumbar small joints, intervertebral discs, ligaments and muscle between the normal and the pain. Firstly, we recruit nurses with low back pain in one group, with the normal as control. Then the subject will accept 3.0T MRI scanning at the same time. Before scanning we will determine the MRI sequence to make sure the imageis are clear enough. At last, we will analysis the photos in the image processing workstation, reconstruct the anatomical structure in the scanning area. All of this is to find a possible reason or explanation in the occurrence of incipient lumbago through the comparison of two group`s images.</detailed_description>
