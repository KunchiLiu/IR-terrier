	<brief_title>Efficacy Analysis of Complete Laparoscopic Resection of Recurrent Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators conducted a prospective study of 64 patients who were diagnosed with recurrent HCC and underwent surgical resection at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center from June 2014 to November 2014; 31 patients were enrolled in the laparoscopic group and underwent complete laparoscopic resection of HCC, and 33 patients were enrolled in the control group and underwent open surgical resection. The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, shortest distance between the tumor edge and normal liver tissue, postoperative pain scores, postoperative time until the patient could walk, postoperative time until the patient could pass gas, hospital stay, and inpatient costs were compared between the two groups. The patients were followed up for one year after surgery, and the relapse-free survival was compared between the two groups.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. recurrent HCC after open surgery 2. recurrent HCC located in any part of the left lateral lobe or the diaphragm side of the right lobe and near the surface of the liver, which resulted in an easier operation 3. no significant surgical contraindications 4. no major vessel or bile duct tumor invasion and metastasis 5. grade A or B liver function or grade C liver function that recovered to grade A after liverprotective treatment; 6. the patient and his/her family was willing to undergo laparoscopic resection. 1. major vessel or bile duct tumor invasion 2. recurrent HCC located in the right liver parenchyma and near secondary vessels and bile ducts, resulting in a difficult operation 3. grade C liver function 4. significant surgical contraindications 5. the patient and his/her family declined laparoscopic hepatectomy.</criteria>
