	<brief_summary>The rationale for this study is to provide additional treatment with NEOD001 for subjects who complete Study NEOD001-001, and to continue to evaluate long term safety and tolerability. All subjects in the current NEOD001 trials are being dosed at 24 mg/kg, which will be continued in this study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open-label Extension Study of NEOD001 in Subjects With Light Chain (AL) Amyloidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rationale for this study is to provide additional treatment with NEOD001 for subjects who complete Study NEOD001-001, and to continue to evaluate long term safety and tolerability. All subjects in the current NEOD001 trials are being dosed at 24 mg/kg, which will be continued in this study. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate long-term safety and tolerability of NEOD001 and the secondary objectives are to assess the immunogenicity of NEOD001 and to incorporate serum NEOD001 concentrations in a population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis.</detailed_description>

Has adequate bone marrow reserve, hepatic and renal function, as demonstrated by: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.0 ×109/L Platelet count ≥75 × 109/L Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL Total bilirubin ≤2 times the upper limit of normal (× ULN) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤3 × ULN Estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥30 mL/minute 4. Seated systolic blood pressure 90 to 180 mmHg 5. ECOG Performance Status 0 to 2 6. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 28 days prior to the first administration of study drug and agree to use highly effective physicianapproved contraception from 30 days prior to the first study drug administration to 90 days following the last study drug administration 7. Male subjects must be surgically sterile or must agree to use highly effective physicianapproved contraception from 30 days prior to the first study drug administration to 90 days following the last study drug administration 1. Any new medical contraindication or clinically significant abnormality on physical, neurological, laboratory, vital signs, or electrocardiogram (ECG) examination (e.g., atrial fibrillation; with the exception of subjects for whom the ventricular rate is controlled) that precludes continued or initiation of treatment with NEOD001 or participation in the study 2. History of Grade ≥3 infusionassociated adverse events (AEs) or hypersensitivities to NEOD001 or any of its excipients 3. Treatment with any anticancer therapy (standard or investigational) within the 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug. In addition, subjects must have fully recovered (i.e., National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] Grade 1 [exception: subjects with prior bortezomib may have CTCAE Grade 2 neuropathy]) from the clinically significant toxic effects of that treatment 4. Received any of the following within the specified time frame prior to the first administration of study drug: Hematopoietic growth factors, transfusions of blood or blood products within 1 week Major surgery within 2 weeks Radiotherapy within 2 weeks Transplant within 8 weeks Investigational drug other than NEOD001 within 4 weeks Another experimental antiamyloid therapy other than NEOD001 within 2 years 5. Uncontrolled symptomatic orthostatic hypotension 6. Myocardial infarction, uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia, within 6 months prior to the first dose of study drug 7. Uncontrolled infection 8. Secondary malignancy, with the exception of: Adequately treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or in situ cervical cancer Adequately treated stage I cancer from which the subject is currently in remission Any other cancer from which the subject has been diseasefree for ≥3 years 9. Uncontrolled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C infection 10. Women who are lactating</criteria>
