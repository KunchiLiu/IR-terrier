	<brief_summary>Coughing is a common adverse reaction of thyroid surgery,which could result in postoperative bleeding.Postoperative bleeding is a serious and potentially life-threatening complication，which could result in acute upper airway obstruction due to neck hematoma and increase the need for re-operation.The purpose of this study is to investigate whether dexmedetomidine can reduce the incidence of postoperative coughing and contribute to postoperative recovery in patients undergoing tyroid surgery with general anesthesia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Dexmedetomidine on Cough Response and Postoperative Recovery Quality in Patients Undergoing Thyroid Surgery With General Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thyroid surgery is a common clinical surgery,the incidence of postoperative coughing is up to 32.4%.Coughing response could result in postoperative bleeding,even cause respiratory tract obstruction,affect patients' postoperative recovery .Dexmedetomidine,an α2 adrenergic agonist,has hypnotic,analgesic, anxiolytic,antisympathetic effects,which could facilitate the sedation of patients while maintaining their consciousness and keep respiration and circulation stable .For these benefits,dexmedetomidine was widely used for general anesthesia.However,whether dexmedetomidine can reduce the incidence of postoperative coughing is unclear.Therefore,the investigators conduct this randomized controlled double-blind trial,to investigate the effects of dexmedetomidine on coughing and postoperative recovery quality in patients undergoing tyroid surgery with general anesthesia.</detailed_description>
