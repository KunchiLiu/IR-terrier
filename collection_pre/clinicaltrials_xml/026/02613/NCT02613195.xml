	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of Hydrogen-Rich Celsior Solution Applied in Aging DBD Liver/Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The organ shortage has been rising to impede the development of organ transplantation.To find a solution, transplantation center is working on the application of marginal grafted liver or renal, especially the aging grafts. The most common inducement of organ dysfunction during the perioperation is liver/renal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, caused by the generation of cytotoxic oxygen radicals. Hydrogen gas is a kind of reducing gas, which has been reported to display antioxidant properties and protective effects against organ dysfunction induced by various I/R injuries. Investigators will investigate whether hydrogen-rich Celsior solution improve the quality of aging grafts in liver/ kidney transplantation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Donors: 1. Age of the donor ≥60 yrs. 2. The donor has no historical records of drug abuse, alcoholic abuse, homosexual,or drug addiction, etc. 3. Evaluate infections and infectious disease of the donor. 4. History of malignant tumor; 5. History of hypertension, diabetes, hemophilia, or other anticoagulant disease,kidney donor should not have a history of kidney disease. 6. Daily urine volume is approximately normal. 7. Donor should be subjected to physical examination by medical doctor of OPO stuff before donation; the OPO stuff should realize whether the potential donor has infected lesion or not, such as abscess, ulcer, lymphadenectasis， etc., and evaluate infectious risk of recipient postoperationally. 8. OPO stuff should realize the dynamic change of body temperature, as well as various intensive care parameters of the potential donor, it shall be very important to be sure whether the potential donor has pulmonary/ systemic infections or not,especially for whom has longer ICU duration (&gt; 7 Days). 9. The potential donor should has a systolic blood pressure ≥ 50 mm Hg (1mmHg=0.133 kPa) and arterial SaO &gt; 80%. 10. Liver Biochemistry: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 6ULN, total bilirubin (TBil) ≤ 50umol/L;Kidney Biochemistry: serum creatinine (sCre) ≤ 2ULN; 11. Negative antiHIV antibody; 12. Negative bacterial and fungal culture in blood; 13. Ultrasonic diagnosis of fatty liver, trauma, hematoma, lithiasis, etc., as well as size of both kidney, hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, etc. if possible. 14. Graft liver should be soft, normal color and even, no tumor or other abnormity;steatosis ≤ 30% by liver biopsy.Graft kidneys should have complete renal capsule with no congestion or bleeding;proximal tubular necrosis ≤ 50%, without obvious structural damage.Organ (liver and kidney) cold ischemia time (CIT) is determined as the time duration from cold preservation of organs to transplant reperfusion. CIT of aging DBD liver and kidney graft should be ≤ 10 and16 hours, respectively. Recipients： 1. Aged between 1865 years old 2. MELD score ≤25,BMI≤25 3. Patients with tumor,the expected lifetime≥6 months 4. Agree to anticipate the trial and sign the informed consent Donor's age ＜ 60 yrs; The donor has historical records of drug abuse, alcoholic abuse, homosexual, or drug addiction, etc. The donor is HIV infected, or has severe infection, or positive bacterial and/ or fungal culture results; Uncontrollable hypertension, diabetics; Malignant tumor; Unstable hemodynamic response or SaO status, such as systolic pressure ＜50 mm Hg (1mmHg=0.133 kPa) , or arterial SaO＜80%. Liver Biochemistry: alanine aminotransferase (ALT)＞6ULN, total bilirubin (TBil)＞50umol/L; Graft liver has a steatosis ＞30%, or graft kidney has a proximal tubular necrosis＞50% or obvious glomerular sclerosis.</criteria>
