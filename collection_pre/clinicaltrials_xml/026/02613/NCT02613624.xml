	<brief_summary>The study is being conducted to develop an intervention to assess the feasibility of implementing Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) for low birth weight (LBW) and preterm babies in a community setting. A prototype intervention package will be developed using information obtained from in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and other qualitative research techniques. These interviews will help us identify current behaviours, barriers to adoption of KMC and effective ways to promote KMC in the community. The prototype intervention will be refined by conducting acceptability studies (household trials) with few mothers. The study team are identifying LBW and preterm infants, demonstrating to mothers how to practice KMC and following up till KMC is stopped. The process is being documented using observations and interviews. Information is obtained on acceptability of KMC, number of hours per day and number of days KMC was given, breastfeeding practices and support provided by other family members.</brief_summary>
