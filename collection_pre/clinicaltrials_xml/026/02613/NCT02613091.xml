	<brief_summary>In a1972 study in the French Annals of Pharmaceuticals, Laroche and Laroche reported that the drug clemastine has a negative effect on patients' color discrimination, which is the ability to distinguish different hues and arrange them in the correct order. In an upcoming clinical trial studying the effect of clemastine on vision outcomes, our lab aims to assess color visual performance adding assessment of color defectiveness as a clinical endpoint. Color defectiveness is the ability to see certain colors, and is commonly referred to as color-blindness. Color discrimination and defectiveness can be related, but do not always correlate. This study aims to detect the effect, if any, that clemastine has on color defectiveness in healthy controls, which could confound its use as an outcome endpoint in future clinical trials relating to clemastine.</brief_summary>
