	<brief_summary>This study is an open-label, multicenter, randomized, phase II non-inferiority trial (proof of concept study). Its purpose is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of extrafascial hysterectomy plus pelvic-lymph node dissection compared with the standard modified radical hysterectomy in patients with stage IA2-IB1 cervical cancer ≤ 2cm.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LESs Surgical Radicality for EaRly Stage Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of extrafascial hysterectomy compared with modified radical hysterectomy, both plus level 1 pelvic lymph-node dissection, in patients with early stage IA2-IB1 cervical cancer ≤ 2cm. The experimental procedure will be considered to be promising for treatment of stage IA2-IB1 cervical cancer ≤ 2cm if the Bayesian posterior probability of "the difference of the 3-y DFS rate is less than the non-inferiority margin of 5%" is at least 50%. Thus, using this proof of concept design, the planned sample size is 40, with 20 cases per arm, which provides 72% chance of satisfying the above criteria, under the hypothesis that the lowest 3-y DFS rate in each arm is 90%. As required, adjuvant therapy will include cisplatin-based chemo-radiation or pelvic radiation alone (EBRT +/- intracavitary brachytherapy) indicated according to the #GOG92 and #GOG109 criteria.</detailed_description>
