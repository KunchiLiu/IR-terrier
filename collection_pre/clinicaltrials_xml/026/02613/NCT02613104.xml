	<brief_summary>Previous research suggests that people with bipolar disorder have trouble accurately identifying emotions. The goal of this study is to test a novel intervention, emotion recognition modification (ERM), to help improve the ability of young people with bipolar disorder to identify emotions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Emotion Recognition Modification for Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Procedure: Participants will be recruited through the University Clinic, affiliated psychiatric hospitals and outpatient psychiatric clinics in the area, and public websites. Interested participants will be interviewed on the phone to determine initial eligibility; those who meet criteria will be invited for a comprehensive evaluation. For potential participants under the age of 18, parents/caregivers will be asked the eligibility questions about their child. If the child meets initial eligibility criteria, both s/he and the parent/caregiver will be invited to the baseline appointment. The baseline appointment will take place at Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine or at Long Island Jewish Hospital. Following the informed consent/assent process, participants will be interviewed by a trained research assistant to assess clinical and treatment history, and to determine diagnostic eligibility, using the SCID. Participants who meet eligibility criteria will proceed to complete other baseline measures. Emotion recognition baseline procedure. The baseline task allows for the measurement of each participants' baseline balance point, the point at which they are equally likely to see a given face as happy or sad (or angry). Each participant will complete 45 trials of the emotion recognition task in which each face from a morph sequence of happy and sad (or angry) faces is presented, the participant is then forced to decide whether a face is sad (or angry) or happy. Imaging paradigm. Following the baseline assessment, a subgroup of participants (n =15) will complete a task that provokes the emotion processing system of the brain while in the scanner, allowing for the measurement of brain activation and connectivity during the task. Additionally, diffusion tensor imaging will be used to assess structural changes in the brain. The task, which asks participants to identify the gender of faces displaying either happy or fearful expressions, has been used previously in studies designed to measure emotion generation regions (specifically hyperactivity in amygdala) and emotion regulation and control regions (hypoactive PFC) (Godlewska, Norbury, Selvaraj, Cowen, &amp; Harmer, 2012). After completing the ERM intervention (two weeks after the baseline session), interested participants will be scanned again with the same imaging procedures. Activity extracted from the ROI's will be compared on a within-subject basis to assess changes in brain activation and functional connectivity following treatment. A final follow-up scan will be performed ten weeks after the baseline assessment to determine whether any changes in brain function are maintained over time. Intervention: Once the baseline measures are completed, participants will be randomized to the sad-to-happy condition, the angry-to-happy condition, or a control condition (n =20 per group). Participants in the intervention conditions will complete the training task three times over three in-person sessions. The task will be similar to the baseline procedure; participants will view faces and be asked to judge the expression, however they will now be given feedback (e.g. "Incorrect! That face was happy."), in order to shift the category of happy faces to include those faces two morph steps beyond the participant's baseline balance point. Participants in the control condition will repeat the baseline task, with feedback consistent with their baseline performance (i.e. the faces they judged as happy initially will be called "correct" when judged happy again. The intervention will be administered a total of three times (once at baseline, once at the first follow-up, once at the second follow-up). Follow-Up: After the final training session, participants will complete the first follow-up. This will consist of the clinician-administered YMRS, as well as online questionnaires, including the LEE, PANAS, GBI, social network task, Perceived Social Support, feasibility questionnaire. Eight weeks after completing the final training session, participants will return to the research lab for the final follow-up, which will include the following measures, LEE, PANAS, GBI, social network task, Perceived Social Support, emotion recognition task, YMRS, and BDI-II to assess changes in mood episode over the study follow-up period. Participants will also be asked to complete a brief form about whether they liked the intervention and found it convenient to assess burden and feasibility.</detailed_description>
