	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if RecoverMI care can help to shorten the time that patients are in the hospital after surgery and if it can help them recover sooner. RecoverMI includes the following parts: - Preoperative Education - Early oral intake - Early mobilization - Telemedicine</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Accelerated Enhanced RECOVERy Following Minimally Invasive Colorectal Cancer Surgery (RecoverMI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one group is the same, better, or worse than the other group. - If you are assigned to Group 1, you will receive standard enhanced care after your surgery. - If you are assigned to Group 2, you will receive routine care after surgery, but you will also receive accelerated recovery, early discharge, and Telemedicine. Participants will be loaned an iPad to use for video-conferencing and text messaging in this study. This is an investigational study. The study doctor can explain how RecoverMI is designed to work. Up to 32 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
