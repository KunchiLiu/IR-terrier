	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the short-term and long-term efficacies and the safeties of pirarubicin plus docetaxel(AT group) and pirarubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel(AC-T group) in neoadjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Analysis of the Efficacies in Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy of Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based on the results of NSABP(National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project) B27 trial, anthracyclines(A) and Taxanes(T) are most commonly recommended in neoadjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer. Pirarubicin is one of anthracyclines and by embedding the DNA double stranded, which inhibits DNA replication and RNA synthesis, thereby impedes the rapid growth of cancer cells. Docetaxel in one of taxanes and by strengthening the tubulin polymerization, inhibiting of microtubule depolymerization and leading to the formation of stable non functional microtubule bundles, which destroys mitosis of tumor cells.</detailed_description>
