	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study for the Safety and Efficacy of Panitumumab in Combination With TAS-102 for Patients With Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the combination of panitumumab and TAS-102 in patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) refractory to standard chemotherapy (oxaliplatin, fluoropyrimidines, irinotecan and anti-VEGF therapy). Patients who are judged eligible for the study based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be received panitumumab (6 mg/kg) every 2 weeks and TAS-102 (35 mg/m² given orally twice a day in a 28-day) in 2-week cycle of 5 days of treatment followed by a 2-day rest period, and then a 14-day rest period. A maximum of 58 subjects will be enrolled.</detailed_description>
