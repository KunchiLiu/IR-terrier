	<criteria>Patients aged &gt;= 18 years Patients with HER2negative MBC. Mandatory to have the HER2/estrogen receptor(ER)/progesterone receptor (PR) status Patient who met criteria for firstline treatment with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab (standard doses) by local, regional or national guidelines or authorities Patients with measurable disease (RECIST criteria v1.1) or patients with no measurable but assessable disease Molecular phenotype as triple negative metastatic breast cancer and ER[+] tumors need to fulfill at least one of the two clinical criteria (metastatic relapse on adjuvant endocrine therapy or progression to at least one prior line of endocrine therapy for advanced disease or aggressive disease criteria [at least two criteria: taxane based regimen in the {neo}adjuvant setting, metastatic relapse within 2 years from the end of chemotherapy for early breast cancer, liver metastasis, three or more organs with metastatic involvement, symptomatic visceral disease]) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 02 Signed informed consent form Patient has received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease Patient requiring major/minor surgery within 3 weeks prior to administration of the first dose of study treatment Patient has received an investigational therapy within 4 weeks prior to study entry Patient has known symptomatic brain metastases Patient with nonmeasurable or assessable disease, exclusive blastic bone disease, pleural, pericardial or abdominal effusion as only evidence of disease Patient in chronic daily treatment with corticosteroids (doses&gt; 10 mg / day of methylprednisolone or equivalent), except inhaled steroids Pregnant or breastfeeding patient. A serum pregnancy test will be taken up to 7 days prior to study treatment, or up to 14 days prior to study treatment (in the latter case another urine test will be taken within 7 days prior to study treatment to confirm the result) Women of childbearing potential (defined as those who have had their last menstrual period &lt;2 years and are not surgically sterilized) who are not using hormonal contraceptives or highly effective birth control (e.g. intrauterine device) during the study Patient has an active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection(s) requiring systemic therapy Patient with significant renal, hematological or liver function alteration according to investigator's criteria Patient has serious medical risk factors involving any of the major organ systems</criteria>
