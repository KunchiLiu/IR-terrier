	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to evaluate the sensibility of the probe Forimtech to detect β+ emission in vivo in humans and its usefulness during elective surgical procedure Hypothesis:The probe Forimtech is able to allow per-surgery detection of tumoral lesions sensible to 18F-FDG and to help in the realization of guided biopsies, minimally invasive surgery or complement of resection of tumors. The β+ emission detected by the probe Forimtech is correlated to the emission γ detected by the 18F-FDG.PET/CT</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients with a malignant neoplasic lesion known or suspected for which a surgery is planned will be presented with the protocol. If inclusion/exclusion criteria are fulfilled all the procedures will be planned. A 18F-FDG PET/CT will be done. Surgery will be conducted within 3 hours after the I.V. injection of 18F-FDG according to the standard procedure applied in the visceral surgery department. During the surgery, emission of β+ from the lesion (s) seen during the PET/CT will be detected with the probe. Resected pieces will be analysed histologically.</detailed_description>
