	<brief_summary>This is a randomised, double blind, cross over clinical study in healthy human volunteers (including pharmacokinetic [PK] sampling and laser Doppler assessment of local blood flow in a subset of up to 6 subjects per cohort of 20) to assess the efficacy and safety of three different topical analgesics (DCF100, TIB200 and SPR300) versus placebo and active control(s) in a model of UV-induced inflammatory pain.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a randomised, double blind, cross over clinical study in healthy human volunteers, including pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling and laser Doppler assessment of local blood flow in a subset of up to 6 subjects per cohort, to assess the efficacy and safety of three different topical analgesics (DCF100, TIB200 and SPR300) versus placebo and active control(s) in a model of UV-induced inflammatory pain. The study will consist of 3 cohorts of subjects (n=20 subjects per cohort). Subjects of each cohort will receive test and reference products (no reference product for Cohort 3) of one investigational medicinal product (IMP) and a placebo. Test Products: Cohort 1: Ibuprofen, TIB200 gel (10%, w/w) Cohort 2: Diclofenac, DCF100 gel (2% or 4%, w/w) Cohort 3: Methyl-salicylate and Menthol, SPR300 gel (15%:7%, w/w; ratio of Methylsalicylate to Menthol) Reference Products: Cohort 1: Ibuprofen, Nurofen Max Strength gel (10%, w/w), Ibuprofen, Nurofen, oral tablet (400 mg) Cohort 2: Voltaren Emulgel (2%), Voltarol oral tablet (50 mg) Placebo: All Cohorts:Test product matching vehicle gel. Pharmacodynamic tests and PK blood draws will be performed at: pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours post dose for all treatment cohorts and treatment days (PK blood sampling in up to 6 subjects per cohort only). Safety will be evaluated by the incidence of local and systemic treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported after each treatment. Safety assessments will also include vital signs, 12-Lead Electrocardiograms (ECGs), laboratory tests and a physical examination at Screening and the Follow-up visit.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Were able to provide written informed consent. 2. Male between 18 and 65 years old, inclusive, at the time of screening. 3. Good general health as ascertained by detailed medical history and physical examination. 4. Body mass index (BMI) ≥18 and ≤29 kg/m2 (BMI = weight/height2), at the time of screening. 5. No clinically relevant abnormalities in 12lead ECG as per PI's judgement, e.g., absence of cardiac rhythm disorder, in particular bradycardia (&lt;40 beats per minute), conduction abnormalities such as atrioventricular block, absence of active ischemia (such as unstable angina pectoris) or recent myocardial infarction, no QTcF interval &gt;450 milliseconds, no QRS complex ≥120 milliseconds, at Screening. 6. No clinically relevant abnormalities in results of laboratory tests as per PI's judgement; in particular, no significant liver impairment defined as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN); no significant kidney impairment defined as serum creatinine 2x ULN; abnormal thyroid function as defined by thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH) and total thyroxin (T4) (TSH within range 0.27 to 4.2 mIU/L, total T4 within range 59 to 154 nmol/L). 7. Had a skin type II or III (Fitz Patrick classification). 8. Nonsmokers or exsmokers for at least 6 months prior to the Screening Visit, as confirmed by a urine cotinine test. 9. Subjects were able to communicate well with the PI/designee. 1. History of hypersensitivity to the IMP or any of the excipients or to medicinal products with similar chemical structures. 2. Presence of any clinically relevant acute or chronic disease which could interfere with the subject safety during the study, expose the subject to undue risk, limit the biological sampling (e.g., blood collection), interfere with the absorption of the IMP (e.g., active dermatological conditions at the application sites, or ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome) or interfere with the study objectives. 3. Skin type I, IV, V or VI (Fitzpatrick Classification). 4. History of chronic pain symptoms (&gt;6 months) or ongoing pain. 5. Any condition that required regular concomitant medication including herbal products, or predicted need of any concomitant medication from Screening Visit until the end of the study. 6. Intake of any medication including over the counter (OTC) medication (in particular any pain killers), herbal and dietary supplements such as St John's Wort, vitamins and minerals that could affect the outcome of the study, within 48 hours before the first administration of the investigational product and for the duration of the study. 7. Use of photosensitising medication, such as phenothiazines, tetracyclines, quinolones, sulphonamides, nalidixic acid, nonsteroidal antiinflammatories, furosemides, hydrochlorothiazides, fibrate, phytotherapeutic drugs (herbal supplements), phenothiazines, quinidines, psoralens and amiodarone within 4 weeks before the first UVB irradiation and for the duration of the study. 8. Any skin disease, acute or chronic (e.g., psoriasis vulgaris, neurodermatitis) or auto immune diseases associated with increased light sensitisation. 9. Any active dermatological conditions, local pigmentary disorders, body art (e.g., tattoos), or excessive hair growth at the lower back that might interfere with the study assessments or absorption of the IMP. 10. History of skin cancer (i.e., melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma). 11. History of conditions that increase risk for melanoma (e.g., dysplastic nevus [&gt;5 nevi], xeroderma pigmentosum, Fanconi anaemia, Bloom's syndrome, Werner syndrome, Cockayne syndrome, trichothiodystrophy, or familial mole melanoma syndrome). 12. History of bleeding disorders, peptic ulceration or gastro intestinal bleeding, heart burn, cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction or stroke. 13. Inability to give reproducible HPPT ratings on naïve skin at screening, (defined as HPTT test retest difference ≥1.0 °C) 14. Heat pain perception threshold &lt;40°C or &gt;51°C on naïve skin at Screening. 15. Supine systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt;90 mmHg or &gt;140 mmHg, or supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &lt;50 mmHg or &gt;90 mmHg after 5 minutes supine, at the Screening Visit. 16. Positive test results for HBsAg, HCVAb or HIV1 and/or 2 antibodies at Screening. 17. Excessive use of caffeinecontaining beverages exceeding 500 mg caffeine/day (5 cups of coffee) and the inability to refrain from the use of caffeinecontaining beverages during confinement in the Clinical Unit. 18. Excessive alcohol consumption (regular alcohol intake ≥21 units per week). Use of alcohol 48 hours before any study visit, as confirmed by urine alcohol testing at Screening, Day 2, and with any additional tests at the discretion of the PI. 19. History in the last year or presence of drug addiction (positive urine drug screen) at Screening and Day 2. 20. Presence or history of alcohol abuse in the last year, as confirmed by subject's general practitioner (GP). 21. Blood donation within 8 weeks before the first IMP administration. 22. Participation in another study with an experimental drug within 3 months before the first dosing day. 23. Any psychological, emotional problems, any disorder or resultant therapy that was likely to invalidate informed consent, or limited the ability of the subject to comply with the protocol requirements. 24. Unlikely to comply with the protocol requirements, instructions and studyrelated restrictions; e.g., uncooperative attitude, inability to return for Followup visits and improbability of completing the clinical study. 25. Planned surgery, dental procedure, or hospitalisation from the Screening Visit until the end of the study. 26. Inability to give written informed consent or to comply fully with the protocol. 27.
