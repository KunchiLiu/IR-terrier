	<brief_summary>This study is a prospective, randomised, controlled multi-centre study to examine outcomes following wide local excision (WLE) for breast cancer with (treatment arm) or without (control arm) intra-operative use of the LightPath™ Imaging System. The intraoperative 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) LightPath™ Images will be used to inform the surgeons about detectable residual cancer, in an attempt to achieve better guided cancer surgery and complete tumour excision with clear WLE resection margins. Study sites will use the local criteria considered standard of care to guide decisions to act on positive margins. In the LightPathTM arm the resection margin status of the WLE specimen, cavity shavings (if any) and the metastatic status of axillary (sentinel) lymph nodes as measured with the LightPath™ Imaging System will be compared with histopathology results.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomised Trial of LightPath Imaging in Breast Cancer Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Female subjects with a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) scheduled to have wide local excision (WLE) +/- sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) will be screened, and if eligible randomised (1:1) to either: the 18F-FDG plus LightPath™ Image arm or the arm without 18F-FDG and LightPath™. Subjects in both arms will have standard of care WLE. Extra cavity shaving due to positive 18F-FDG LightPath™ Images is at the discretion of the surgeon. Subjects randomised to the 18F-FDG arm will receive an intravenous injection of 5 MBq/kg, up to a maximum 300 MegaBecquerel (MBq) of 18F-FDG prior to surgery. Subjects randomised to the other arm will receive standard of care surgery. Randomisation will be conducted after inclusion, at the screening visit. WLE will be performed as per standard of care in both arms of the study. Following resection, the WLE specimen will be examined using the LightPath™ Imaging System (LightPath™ arm only). If the surgeons detect a positive signal they may perform cavity shavings of the resection cavity area corresponding to the positive signal area (up to a maximum thickness of 10mm). Axillary SLNB will be performed according to local practice. At sites where 99mTc is used: In the 18F-FDG + LightPath™ arm a higher dose of up to 150 MBq technetium-99m (99mTc) nanocolloid is necessary to avoid 18F-FDG masking the signal from 99mTc. In the control arm the standard dose of 99mTc will be used. Blue dye will be used according to local practice at sites where it is considered standard of care. Sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) will be examined using the LightPath™ Imaging System (LightPath™ arm only). Where clinically indicated, ALND will be performed as per standard of care. At the time this protocol was finalised LightPath™ data from involved lymph nodes sufficient to support recommendations were not available. For this reason, LightPath™ Image results will not be used to direct ALND. All LightPath™ Images will be performed between 60 and 180 minutes post injection of 18F-FDG. The WLE specimen, cavity shavings (where performed) and SLNs (where performed) will then undergo standard of care histopathological analysis. Lymph nodes will also be examined according to standard of care histopathological analysis. The results of the histopathological analysis will then be correlated with the LightPath™ Images. For cases in the 18F-FDG arm, all staff in the operating room and the recovery area caring for the subjects will wear badge dosimeters. Staff handling surgical specimens in theatre will also wear ring dosimeters. In the 18F-FDG arm histopathology analyses should be delayed to allow for radioactive decay of tissue samples to suitably low levels. At study sites where long-term follow-up is standard of care participants will return for study follow-up visits 1-6 weeks and 3, 6 and 12 months after completion of the initially planned surgery. After this the participants will be followed up annually to 60 months after the initial surgery.</detailed_description>

Wide local excision (WLE) for breast cancer is defined as a surgical procedure to remove the tumour and a margin of normal tissue. Females of childbearing age must have a negative pregnancy test (by Beta human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) qualitative analysis), or must have had a history of a surgical sterilisation, or must give history of no menses in the past twelve months Subjects who have had surgery in the operated breast in the past 12 months Subjects who have had radiotherapy in the operated breast Subjects who have had neoadjuvant systemic therapy Subjects who have had systemic chemotherapy in the past two years Subjects who have known hypersensitivity to 18FFDG Subjects who are pregnant or lactating Subjects who have an existing medical condition that would compromise their participation in the study Subjects who have participated in a clinical study in the last 2 months Subjects with a current or active history of other known cancer</criteria>
