	<brief_summary>RECIST criteria for evaluating tumor response are often inadequate for the evaluation of anti-angiogenic drugs. An evaluation model of tumor perfusion with contrast-enhanced ultrasonography was developed at Gustave Roussy. It assesses the tumor vascular response through the analysis of 7 different parameters. Several studies (four at IGR, involving 117 patients, and a multicenter study involving 400 patients) showed that CEUS allows early evaluation of the effect of anti-angiogenic drugs. Two of these parameters are particularly interesting for the early identification of patients responding (or not) to treatment. Those are area under curve , and area under the wash-out. To further validate the use of these parameters, it is essential to measure and describe the level of their intra-patient variability.</brief_summary>
