	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine whether these new image acquisition strategies and techniques using of up to 7T can produce meaningful structural and physiological information that can serve to improve our understanding of various disease processes in the clinical setting. 200 Control volunteers will be scanned for approximately one hour, without contrast, on up to 7T MRI scanner. 200 Study Participants will be scanned using newly developed imaging software or hardware that conforms to applicable FDA standards and recommendations. The data (images) for the Control and Experimental Group will be de-identified by the scan technologist and downloaded to a workstation within the Radiology Department for offline processing. These images will be reviewed by a trained Radiologist after the subject has departed.</brief_summary>
