	<brief_title>To Compare the Incidence of POST Between a TaperGuard ETT and Cylindrical-shaped ETT Under High Cuff Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND:Postoperative Sore Throat (POST) is supposed to be the most frequently occurred respiratory complication related to endotracheal intubation .Endotracheal tube size ,airway manipulation ,patients position et al. have been recognized as the factors affecting Postoperative Sore Throat .Controversy in respect of the relationship between the cuff design and POST is still existed. Whether the new type of ETT (TaperGuard ETT) to decrease or to increase the complications of general anesthesia compared with Cylindrical-shaped ETT is still unknown .In this study ,we will compare the different incidence of complications following general anesthesia between TaperGuard ETT and Cylindrical-shaped ETT under high endotracheal tube cuff pressure. METHODS:Patients undergoing elective non-throat and non-neck surgery were randomly allocated to receive either a TaperGuard ETT(group T) or Cylindrical-shaped ETT ( Group C).Patients received general anesthesia with different endotracheal tubes .Recoil of inflation syringe plunger was used to inflate the cuff. In the study , the cuff pressures of the endotracheal tube were recorded by a calibrated cuff manometer at two time: when the intubation was complited and before endotracheal tube was removed. The incidence and severity of Postoperative Sore Throat(POST),hoarseness, cough were collected by a single investigator blinded to the experiment at 0, 1,6, 12, and 24 hours post-operation.</detailed_description>
