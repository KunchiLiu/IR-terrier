	<brief_summary>Non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) patients used to be less responsive to proton pump inhibitor (PPI)s as compared with patients with erosive esophagitis. The aim of this study is to objectively evaluate the effect of a new PPI, ilaprazole in NERD for adjusting the focus of symptom score, histopathologic findings and inflammatory biomarker. A prospective study performed at single hospital enrolled 20 patients who were diagnosed clinically as NERD. Patients underwent EGD, a 24hr-combined multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH esophageal monitoring (MII-pH) and were treated with ilaprazole 20mg once daily for 4 weeks. Biopsies were obtained from 3cm above the EG junction before and after treatment. GERD Q questionnaire, histologic findings (basal cell hyperplasia, papillary elongation, dilated intercellular spaces, intraepithelial eosinophils and intraepithelial T lymphocyte) and inflammatory biomarkers (TNF-α, IL-8, IL-1β, TRPV1 and MCP-1) will be accessed.</brief_summary>
