	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation is a condition in which the upper chambers of the heart (the atria) begin to quiver (shake rapidly with small movements) instead of beating in a normal rhythm. This condition can cause blood to remain in the atria instead of moving to the lower heart chambers. AF can cause a number of other health problems and can decrease your quality of life. Treatments for AF can include surgery, implantable devices, ablation and medication, to name a few. An ablation is a procedure that creates scar tissue in the heart to interrupt irregular heart rhythms and prevent them from coming back. The ablation procedure uses tools called catheters to treat the AF. Ablation catheters are thin, flexible plastic tubes that use electrical energy to create scars in the heart. The amount of force applied to the heart tissue where the catheter touches (called the contact force) might help determine the success of the ablation procedure. This study would help to determine whether or not the contact force makes a difference in an effective ablation. You will be tested on both sides, at the end of the procedure to see if any problem persists. Participants will be in this study for about 3 months. All visits in this study will correspond to standard of care visits.</detailed_description>
