	<brief_summary>A prospective study in the ICU in a university hospital in Amsterdam. The relationship between the oxygen saturation measured by pulse-oximetry and the arterial PaO2 is investigated in the general ICU population in order to investigate which transcutaneous saturation values are safe.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safe Limits in Saturation in the ICU (SLIM-study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Supplemental oxygen is one of the most commonly prescribed therapies in the intensive care unit (ICU) in order to avoid tissue hypoxia. Oxygen is often administered superfluously. An increasing number of studies suggests harmful effects of supra-physiological PaO2 or 'hyperoxia'. Therefore, it is important to aim for PaO2-values within the physiological range. In the ICU the arterial oxygen concentration (measured as the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) in arterial blood gas analysis) and oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (SpO2) are used as targets of oxygenation. The partial pressure of oxygen is the gold standard in determining the oxygenation status of the patient, but SpO2-values are continuously available. In order to determine the SpO2-targets that are safe in avoiding both hyperoxia and hypoxia (as determined by PaO2) the correlation between PaO2 and SpO2 in critically ill patients will be investigated. Factors effecting this relationship are defined, such as peripheral blood flow and skin temperature. PaO2 measurements are routinely conducted multiple times a day as part of the regular care in the ICU. SpO2 is measured continuously as part of the regular care. When a routinely scheduled PaO2 value is measured the SpO2 will be written down.</detailed_description>
