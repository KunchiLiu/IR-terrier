	<brief_summary>This is a non-therapeutic, long-term follow-up (LTFU) study of subjects who have received retroviral-based gene therapy products in cancer studies. All subjects in this LTFU protocol have received lentiviral modified T cells engineered to express an anti-EGFRvIII scFv Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-term Follow-up of Subjects Exposed to Lentiviral-based CART-EGFRvIII Gene-modified Cellular Therapy Products in Cancer Studies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to monitor adult subjects, who as participants of a clinical trial, received T cells modified by a lentiviral vector encoding a chimeric antigen receptor specific for EGFRvIII, for adverse events that may be associated with lentiviral vector gene transfer such as insertional oncogenesis.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subjects will be enrolled into this destination protocol because they have received CARTEGFRvIII cells that were genetically modified with a lentiviral vector. All subjects who have participated in a lentiviral vector study under IND 15968 and have received CARTEGFRvIII cells will be asked to participate in this protocol. Subjects 18 years of age and older Subjects who have provided informed consent prior to their study participation.</criteria>
