	<brief_summary>The current trial is evaluating the integration of a pretherapeutical FDG-PET/MRI in the adjuvant radiochemotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer. As a secondary hypothesis the intention is to develop of a multi-parametric decision support system for personalised medicine by integrating functional imaging, Î³H2AX-analysis and genetic information.</brief_summary>
