	<criteria>HI Participants Only: Has a diagnosis of chronic (&gt;6 months), stable (no acute episodes of illness within the previous 2 months due to deterioration in hepatic function) HI features of cirrhosis; Part 1 only: Participant's score on the ChildPugh scale ranges from 7 to 9 (moderate HI) at study start. Part 2 only: Participant's score on the ChildPugh scale ranges from 10 to 15 (severe HI) at study start. All Participants: Body mass index (BMI) ≥19 and ≤ 40 kg/m^2; Continuous nonsmokers or moderate smokers (of fewer than 20 cigarettes/day or the equivalent). Participants must agree to consume no more than 10 cigarettes or equivalent/day from the time of screening and throughout the period of sample collection; Health is judged to be stable based on medical history (except for the hepatic impairment condition), physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECGs), and laboratory safety tests; For female participants of childbearing potential: either sexually inactive for 14 days prior to study start and throughout study or be using an acceptable birth control method; Female participants who are sexually inactive, but become sexually active during the course of the study must agree to use a double physical barrier method (e.g., condom and diaphragm) and a chemical barrier (e.g., spermicide) from the time of the start of sexual activity through completion of the study; Vasectomized or nonvasectomized male participants must agree to use a condom with spermicide or abstain from sexual intercourse from dosing until 90 days after dosing; Male participants must agree not to donate sperm from dosing until 90 days after dosing; Able to swallow multiple tablets and capsules. HI Participants Only: Presence of moderate or severe renal insufficiency (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≤50 mL/min/1.73 m^2 calculated according to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] study equation); Presence of drug abuse within the past 6 months prior to dosing. Healthy Participants Only: Presence of moderate or severe renal insufficiency (eGFR ≤60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 calculated according to the MDRD study equation); History or presence of alcoholism or drug abuse within the past 2 years prior to dosing; All Participants: Is mentally or legally incapacitated or has significant emotional problems at the time of study start or expected during the study; History or presence of clinically significant medical or psychiatric condition or disease; History or presence of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to the study drugs or related compounds; Female participants who are pregnant or lactating; Positive results at study start for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C virus (HCV); Unable to refrain from or anticipates the use of any medication or substance (including prescription or overthecounter, vitamin supplements, natural or herbal supplements) for the prohibited time period; Has taken amiodarone at any time in their life; Donation of blood &gt;500 mL or had significant blood loss within 56 days prior to the dose of study drugs; Plasma donation within 7 days prior to the dose of study drugs; Dosed in another clinical trial within 28 days prior to dosing of study drugs;</criteria>
