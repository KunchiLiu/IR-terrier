	<brief_title>A Single Dose-Escalation Study to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Orally Administered DAA-I in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be a single-blind, step-wise dose escalation, placebo controlled study in healthy subjects consisting of up to 3 dose steps of DAA-I. In the sequential step wise design, a single dose of DAA-I or placebo will be administered to 6 subjects for one treatment group. For each dose step, 4 subjects will receive DAA-I and 2 subjects will receive placebo. Subjects will be randomly allocated to one dose step. Step One would have to be completed before Step Two. Escalation up to Step Two and subsequent steps would depend on the safety results from the preceding step(s). There will be an interval of 6 hours between the dosing of the first and second DAA-I-treated volunteers of each cohort to allow for early cardiovascular monitoring. Only if there are no safety signals identify from these subjects as assessed by the Safety Review Committee can simultaneous dosing of the remaining volunteers be carried out.</detailed_description>
