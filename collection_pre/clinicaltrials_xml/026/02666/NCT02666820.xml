	<brief_summary>Endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) combined with large balloon dilation (LBD) has been increasingly accepted as alternative method for removal of large bile duct stones. However, there were limited studies comparing the efficacy of EST in combined with LBD to EST with mechanical lithotripsy (ML). The purpose of this study to compare the efficacy and safety of combined EST- LBD versus EST-ML in the removal of very large bile duct stones.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endoscopic Papillary Large Balloon Dilatation Versus Mechanical Lithotripsy for Large Stones</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The large common bile duct stones (CBDS) remains a therapeutic challenge in ERCPs. Large CBDS are generally refractory to be removed by EST and stone extraction balloons and or baskets. Traditional rescue therapy was the technique of stone fragmentation using ML. The previous reports have shown that EST with ML was successful in the fragmentation of large stones yielding stone clearance rate from 68 t0 79 %. EST-LBD has been shown favorable outcome in the treatment of large bile duct stone. A meta-analysis comparing the effectiveness and complications between EST-LBD and EST in the management of CBDS showed that EST-LBD was as effective as EST for the removal of large or difficult of CBDS in terms of stone clearance in the first ERCP session of 87.87 % vs. 84.15 % and overall clearance of 97.35 % vs. 96.35 % but EST-LBD was associated with fewer complications as well as reduced need for ML compared to EST. The efficacy of EST-ML versus EST-LBD as a therapy for relatively large CBDS, a mean stone size &gt; 20 mm in currently not well defined. The investigators, herein, compared the efficacy and complications between EST followed by LBD or ML for the removal of CBDS &gt; 15 mm with a mean stone size &gt; 20 mm.</detailed_description>
