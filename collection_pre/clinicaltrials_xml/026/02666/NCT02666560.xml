	<brief_title>Does Increasing Auditory Cueing Affect Gait Parameters in Children With Cerebral Palsy During a Functional Task?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction: Cerebral Palsy is a non progressive disorder occurring in early brain development, resulting in inefficient ambulatory pattern. The use of sensory cues to facilitate loco-motor activity has been suggested as providing the necessary trigger to synchronise movement with greater beneficial outcomes observed at higher frequency intensities within the adult population. Thus auditory cueing could have the potential to alter gait parameters during a functional task. Aim: To explore if increasing auditory cueing frequency (AC20) affects gait during a functional task compared to auditory cueing at self-paced cadence (ACSC). Method: Nineteen children with CP levels 1 and 2 on the Gross Motor Function Classification Scale participated using paired analysis. Outcomes were compared to the mean values for temporal spatial gait data within the conditions using a cross over design. TS data was obtained by using the GAITRite® walkway system whilst walking holding a cup.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Children with Cerebral Palsy aged 5 to 11 years old who were scored as levels 1 to 2 on the Gross Motor Function Classification Scale. Cognitive status average or above on the Weschler Intelligence Scale for children. Able to hear without the use of a hearing aid. Hearing impairment that results in the use of a hearing aid. Walking with assistance of a mobility aid. Cardiovascular problems or other associated health problems which limits the child waking multiple times over the GAITRite®.</criteria>
