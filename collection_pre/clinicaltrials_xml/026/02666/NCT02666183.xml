	<brief_summary>This study seeks to test the effectiveness of two arms of an intervention that use videoconference technology for distance caregivers of patients with advanced cancer. The study is significant because the intervention will promote involvement of caregivers of patients with cancer and makes a compelling case for significance based on changing demographics and lifestyles.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary goal of this randomized clinical trial is to compare outcomes (anxiety, distress, depression, health status) for distant care givers (DCGs) of patients with advanced cancer who are randomly assigned to either the full intervention arm (Closer), the video-only intervention arm (Video-C Only) or the control group (Web-Only). the goal is to determine which is most efficacious in improving outcomes over time for these caregivers. In addition, this study will examine the indirect effects of each arm of the intervention on DCG outcomes over time as well as explore the nature of relationships between patient and DCG distress, anxiety and depression over time. The specific research questions include: 1. Is there a difference in DCG outcomes (anxiety, distress, depression, health status) over time between caregivers in the Closer, Video-C Only, and Web-Only groups, controlling for DCG demographic variables? 2. Are there significant indirect effects of Closer, Video-C Only, and Web-Only on DCG outcomes (anxiety, distress, depression, health status) over time, controlling for DCG demographic variables? 3. Are there significant relationships between DCG distress, anxiety, depression and health status and patient distress, anxiety and depression over time?</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patient A new diagnosis (within 3 months) of advanced cancer (solid tumors) or a new recurrence of the primary cancer in an advanced stage receives ongoing care from a medical oncologist at the Seidman Cancer Center Has English as the primary language Has a life expectancy of &gt;6 months Provides consent for his/her own treatment and procedures Identifies a distant care giver (DCG) involved in his/her care, support or planning Patient The patient sample is limited to patients with advanced cancer because the full intervention is tailored to meet the needs of distant care givers (DCGs) of patients with advanced cancer Caregiver Inclusion Criteria Is an adult family member (at least 18 years old) of a patient with an advancedstage cancer Identifies himself/herself as a DCG for the patient Lives &gt;1 hour travel time away from the patient Has English as his/her primary language Is capable of providing informed consent Will be able to access the internet (phone, computer, etc.) Caregiver Exclusion Criteria Cognitive Impairment</criteria>
