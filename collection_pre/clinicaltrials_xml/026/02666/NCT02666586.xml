	<brief_title>Effects of Faba Bean Fractions as Ingredients in Novel Food Products on Glycemia, Appetite and Metabolic Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall objective is to describe the effect and mechanisms of action of faba bean powder and fractions (protein, starch and fiber) on glucose and insulin homeostasis, food intake, satiety and metabolic regulation in young adults (18 to 30 years). The specific objectives are to test the acute effects of different faba bean ingredient smoothie on: 1) post-prandial blood glucose, appetite, satiety hormone and insulin for 200 minutes, and 2) food intake 120 minutes following consumption of the faba bean smoothie. Two short-term acute studies will be conducted to meet these objectives. Both acute studies will follow a randomized, double blinded, balanced, repeated measures design and the same protocol; except one will have an ad libitum pizza meal (study 1), while the other will have a fixed pizza meal (study 2) at 120 minutes. Half the participants will have blood drawn by IV and the other half will be finger prick.</detailed_description>
