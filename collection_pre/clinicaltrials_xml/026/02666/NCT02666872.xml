	<brief_summary>Vaccination greatly reduced mortality and morbidity from many preventable diseases. However, to avoid the resurgence of these diseases and the human drama associated, high vaccine coverage should be maintained in the population. Yet in Quebec, vaccine coverage (VC) in young children remains suboptimal, especially caused by a proportion of parents who are ambivalent about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. In this context, the Provincial Immunization Committee developed in 2010 a Quebec's immunization promotion plan. Therefore, our research team tested and validated across the Eastern Townships, a vaccination promotion concept by means of an educational intervention within maternities, based on motivational interviewing techniques. This intervention has not only significantly increased the intention of vaccination (+15%) within parents who had received the intervention but also increased their child vaccination coverage (+7.5% at 7 months). This is the purpose of the PROMOVAQ study (PROmotion of VAccination in Quebec) This research project evaluated the impact of an educational strategy based on motivational interviewing techniques within maternity ward on infants' VC. This strategy has been tested through a provincial study (Montreal, Quebec, Sherbrooke) including more than 2500 families. At term, this research program will offer the Quebec's Health Ministry an optimal strategy for immunization awareness so that Quebec's children may grow healthy and thrive.</brief_summary>
