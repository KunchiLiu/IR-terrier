	<brief_summary>The pharmacokinetics of fluconazole are expected to be different in ICU patients compared to non-ICU patients. The investigators will determine fluconazole and free fluconazole concentrations in 20 ICU patients, who will get intravenous fluconazole as standard care. Switching to oral/enteral fluconazol is allowed after day 3. A full pharmacokinetic curve will be taken on day 3 of iv therapy and limited pharmacokinetic curves on day 7 of iv therapy and/or on day 3 of oral therapy; trough levels will be taken daily after intravenous therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics of Fluconazole IV as Prophylaxis or Therapy to ICU Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pharmacokinetics of fluconazole are expected to be different in ICU patients compared to non-ICU patients and healthy volunteers due to underlying disease(s). Therefore, extrapolation of data from healthy volunteers and non-ICU patients is not possible. To be able to include 20 patients within the study duration, a multi-centre approach is necessary. Patients will receive standard care, as stated in the product characteristics or according to local protocols. Blood sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis will be retrieved through a central venous catheter. A maximum of 62 milliliter blood in total will be drawn for this study. Patients will be monitored daily during the treatment period for adverse events of the study drug. Full pharmacokinetic curves will be taken on day 3 of iv therapy. Limited pharmacokinetic curves will be taken on day 7 of iv therapy. These two moments of pharmacokinetic analysis will enable the determination steady state and enable the determination of intra-individual variability. As probably not all patients included will be treated with iv fluconazole for 7 days, switching to oral/enteral therapy is allowed after day 3. To assess bioavailability limited pharmacokinetic curves will be taken on day 3 of oral/enteral therapy.</detailed_description>
