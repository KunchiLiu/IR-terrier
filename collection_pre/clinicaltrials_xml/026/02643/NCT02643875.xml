	<brief_summary>Orthokeratology (ortho-k) is a clinical technique that uses reverse geometry rigid gas permeable contact lens exerting positive pressure on the central cornea to temporary reduce refractive error. The investigators have shown that this treatment is effective for myopic control in low to high myopes, with and without astigmatism. Most designs of ortho-k lenses in the market are fitted based on the Jessen formula. The compression factor was introduced to compensate for regression of the ortho-k effect during the no lens-wear period, so that the wearer can obtain clear distance vision throughout the day and most lens designs use a compression factor of 0.50-0.75D. However, in a retrospective study (mixed brands of ortho-k lenses), showed that most patients did not achieve an over-correction of 0.75D. In order to achieve an over-correction of 0.75D, an extra flattening power of about 1.50D instead of 0.75D should be be targeted. The increased compression factor is expected to increase the target reduction and it may play a role in myopic control and providing a higher successful rate in fitting ortho-k lenses.</brief_summary>
