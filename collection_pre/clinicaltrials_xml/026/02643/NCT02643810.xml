	<brief_title>Exercise Training in Adults With Corrected Tetralogy of Fallot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients after surgical correction of tetralogy of Fallot (cTF) have impaired exercise tolerance as compared to healthy age-matched individuals. In this controlled trial, patients with cTF will be randomized to either interval training, continuous training, or usual care. The aim of the study is to compare the effect of interval vs. continuous exercise training on: i) exercise capacity ii) vascular function iii) arrhythmogenic potential iv) parameters of inflammation, hemostasis and heart failure severity v) health-related quality of life adults with cTF</detailed_description>
