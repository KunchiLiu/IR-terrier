	<brief_title>Human Umbilical Cord-Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells exhibit the potential to differentiate into chondrocyte and osteocyte, which have been confirmed in in vivo and in vitro experiments. There have been few clinical reports describing umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells for treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis. To investigate the effects of hUC-MSC treatment for Rheumatoid Arthritis, 20 patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis will be enrolled and receive 4 times of hUC-MSC transplantation.</detailed_description>
