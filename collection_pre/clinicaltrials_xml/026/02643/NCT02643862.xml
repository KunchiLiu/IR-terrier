	<brief_summary>This is a pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study which will be conducted at a single center. All participants will receive oral immunotherapy for their specific food allergies (limited to 5 of those food allergens in IND 14831). In a 3:1 ratio, 36 participants will receive Xolair for 16 weeks while 12 will receive corresponding placebo instead of Xolair. 12 controls will be enrolled who will receive no OIT and no Xolair.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Using Xolair in Rush Multi Oral Immunotherapy in Multi Food Allergic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will enroll multi food allergic participants (4-55 years of age) with proven "multi food allergies". We anticipate enrolling 60 participants with allergies to, at least two foods. Participants must have food specific IgE&gt;4kU/L for each allergen or a skin test reactivity to each food allergen â‰¥ 6 mm wheal diameter. We have chosen criteria associated with a very low likelihood of natural loss of food allergy for the duration of this protocol. These values of specific IgE and SPT were chosen based on the opinions of 4 experts. Participants also must have a total IgE &lt;1500kU/L, a clinical reaction during a double blind placebo controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) with food proteins/powders to establish sensitivity to given food proteins/powders (milk, egg, peanut, almond, wheat, cashew, sesame seed, soy, walnut, hazelnut) and no clinical reaction during placebo (oat) as per CMC section of IND. Participants will undergo a rush desensitization day at week 8 to a maximum dose of 1,250 mg total protein. Participants will be ingesting either 2 to 5 food allergens, depending on their allergy screening. They will consume home doses for two weeks based on the these results and document reactions. Upon returning to the CFRU (Clinical Food Research Unit) two weeks later, a dose escalation will be attempted. This cycle will continue until the participant reaches a maximum dose of 2,000 mg protein daily of each food allergen (two to five food allergens to be ingested by the participant). No more than 5 allergens will be given.</detailed_description>

Current use of oral, intramuscular, or intravenous corticosteroids, tricyclic antidepressants, or betablockers (oral or topical) Routine use of medication that could induce adverse gastrointestinal reactions during the study Refusing to sign the Epinephrine autoinjector Training Form Pregnant or breast feeding women A history of oat allergy (since oat is the placebo agent in the DBPCFC), or an objective reaction to the screening DBPCFC to oat Unwilling to avoid all food allergencontaining items except those given as part of the OIT as well as any other food allergens you are allergic to that are not included in the 10 foods listed in the study Concurrent/prior use of immunomodulatory therapy (within 1 month) ie, omalizumab, nontraditional forms of allergen immunotherapy (e.g., oral or sublingual) Severe asthma (2007 NHLBI Criteria Steps 5 or 6) at time of enrollment Mild or moderate asthma (2007 NHLBI Criteria Steps 14) at time of enrollment with any of the following criteria met: FEV1 &lt; 80% of predicted, or FEV1/FVC &lt; 75%, with or without controller medications (only for age 6 or greater and able to do spirometry) or ICS dosing of &gt; 220 mcg daily fluticasone (or equivalent inhaled corticosteroids based on NHLBI dosing chart) or 1 hospitalization in the past year for asthma or ER visit for asthma within the past six months Use of steroid medications (IV, IM or oral) in the following manners history of daily oral steroid dosing for &gt;1 month during the past year or steroid burst course ( 5 or more days) of 1 mg/kg prednisone) course in the past 3 months or &gt;2 steroid burst courses in the past year Use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatment modalities (e.g., herbal remedies) for atopic and/or nonatopic disease within 90 days preceding rush desensitization at week 8or at any time .
