	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate in a 3 +3 design, the safety of escalating doses of IPH2201 given IV in combination with cetuximab in patients who have received prior systemic regimen(s) for recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). A cohort expansion will evaluate antitumor activity of the combination.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Age ≥ 18 years 2. Histologically or cytologicallyconfirmed, HPV (+) or HPV () squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx (WHO Type 1), oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx (supraglottis, glottis, subglottis) or oral cavity, 3. Recurrent or metastatic disease, documented by imaging (CT scan, MRI, Xray) and/or physical examination. In phase II, measurable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1 is mandated. In phase Ib, patients with or without measurable disease are eligible. 4. Progression after platinumbased chemotherapy 5. For phase Ib only: Pretreated patients, and not amenable to further therapy with curative intent. This part is open to pretreated patients regardless of the number of previous treatment lines. For phase II only: Patients who received a maximum of two prior systemic regimens for recurrent and/or metastatic disease and not amenable to further therapy with curative intent. 6. No prior treatment by cetuximab except if given for primary treatment (locally advanced disease) with no progressive disease for at least 4 months following the end of prior cetuximab treatment. 7. Recovery from prior surgery and recovery from adverse events to grade 1 or less (except alopecia) due to prior radiation therapy and any systemic therapy. 8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 01 9. Life expectancy of ≥ 3 months 10. Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if they are &gt; 4 weeks from therapy completion (including radiation and/or surgery), are clinically stable at the time of study entry and are not receiving corticosteroid therapy at the time of study entry 11. Adequate hematologic, immunologic, liver and renal function, defined as hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL, absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3, platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3, total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper normal limit (UNL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 X institutional UNL, serum creatinine ≤1.5 X institutional UNL or estimated (CockcroftGault formula) or measured creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min 12. Negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours before starting study treatment for women of childbearing potential. Women of childbearing potential and all men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of monalizumab administration and for up to 5 months after the last dose of monalizumab. 13. Ability to understand a written informed consent document 14. Signed informed consent prior to any protocolspecific procedures 1. For phase II only: Patients who received more than 2 prior systemic regimens for recurrent and/or metastatic disease (no restriction in the phase Ib part of the trial). 2. For phase II only: Patients who received cetuximab or another inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor are excluded from the phase II of the trial, except if cetuximab was given as part of a primary treatment approach, with no progressive disease for at least 4 months following the end of prior cetuximab treatment. 3. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to cetuximab. 4. Patients with known untreated and uncontrolled brain metastases are excluded. However, brainimaging studies are not required for eligibility if the patient has no neurological signs or symptoms. 5. Serious concurrent uncontrolled medical disorder. 6. Autoimmune disease, which: 1. currently or previously required systemic immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy (including corticosteroids administered by systemic route) and/or 2. has a substantial probability to cause an irreversible injury to any tissue and/or 3. has been diagnosed less than 3 months before study entry and/or 4. is clinically unstable and/or 5. has a substantial risk to progress and cause severe complications. 7. Abnormal cardiac status with any of the following: 1. Unstable angina 2. Arrhythmia requiring treatment which is not stabilized by the treatment 3. QTc &gt; 450 ms (M) or 470 ms (F) (Bazett formula QT Interval / √ (RR interval) where RR Interval = 60/HR). 8. History of cardiac dysfunction including any of the following: 1. Myocardial infarction within the last 6 months 2. History of documented congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional classification IIIIV). 9. Known interstitial lung disease. 10. Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding must be discontinued. 11. Other active invasive malignancy (except for treated basal or squamous cell skin carcinoma, or in situ cervix carcinoma). 12. Treatment with other investigational agents less than 14 days prior to study entry. 13. Systemic treatment with steroids or other immunosuppressive agents within 30 days prior to entry. Physiological replacement with hydrocortisone or equivalent is acceptable. 14. Current active infectious disease. 15. Positive serology for HIV. 16. Positive HBs Ag or positive HBV viremia, Positive HCV viremia. 17. Psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not permit medical followup and compliance with study protocol.</criteria>
