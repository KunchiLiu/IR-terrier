	<brief_summary>Background: Peri-procedural management of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) is challenging. The optimal duration of pre-procedural discontinuation that guarantees a minimal DOAC concentration ([DOAC]) at surgery is unknown. The usual 48-hour discontinuation might not be sufficient for all patients. Objectives: To investigate the factors associated with per-procedural [DOAC]. To test the hypothesis that a 48-hour DOAC discontinuation is not sufficient to ensure a minimal perprocedural [DOAC], defined as [DOAC] &lt; 30 ng/mL. Methods: Patients treated with DOAC, and requiring any invasive procedure will be included in this multicentre, prospective, observational study. [DOAC], will be measured during invasive procedure.</brief_summary>
