	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multicenter Phase 1/2 study of the CTLA-4 antibody, tremelimumab, and the PD-L1 antibody, durvalumab (MEDI4736), in combination with the tumor microenvironment (TME) modulator polyICLC, a TLR3 agonist, in subjects with advanced, measurable, biopsy-accessible cancers.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Subjects must have histologic confirmation of advanced, biopsyaccessible, measurable cancers of the following histologies: Nonviralassociated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) or HPVassociated HNSCC after failure of prior therapy Locally recurrent breast cancer Sarcoma Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) Cutaneous T cell Lymphoma (CTCL) Melanoma after failure of available therapies GU cancers with accessible metastases (e.g., bladder, renal) Any solid tumors with masses that are accessible without imaging 2. Subjects with measurable disease. 3. Any number of prior systemic therapies. 4. Performance status 01. 5. Laboratory parameters: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1000/mm3; Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3; Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 9 g/dL; HgbA1C ≤ 7.5%; Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN); Bilirubin ≤ 2.5 × ULN (≤ 4 × ULN for subjects with Gilbert's disease); Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 × ULN; Creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN. 6. Age ≥ 18 years. 7. Able and willing to give valid written informed consent. 1. Prior treatment with combination CTLA4 and PD1/PDL1 blockade. 2. Participants may not have been treated intratumorally with polyICLC. 3. Unresolved irAEs following prior biological therapy, except that stable and managed irAEs may be acceptable (e.g., hypothyroidism or hypopituitarism on appropriate replacement). 4. Subjects with history or evidence upon physical examination of central nervous system (CNS) disease, including primary brain tumor, seizures not controlled with standard medical therapy, any brain metastases, or, within 6 months of the first date of treatment on this study, history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA, stroke), transient ischemic attack (TIA) or subarachnoid hemorrhage. 5. Subjects with clinically significant cardiovascular disease, including: 1. Uncontrolled hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure (BP) &gt; 150 mmHg or diastolic BP &gt; 90 mmHg. 2. Myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months of the first date of treatment on this study. 3. History of serious ventricular arrhythmia (i.e., ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) or cardiac arrhythmias requiring antiarrhythmic medications, except for atrial fibrillation that is well controlled with anti arrhythmic medication. 4. Baseline ejection fraction ≤ 50% as assessed by echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan. 5. New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II or higher congestive heart failure. 6. Grade 2 or higher peripheral ischemia [brief (&lt; 24 hours) episode of ischemia managed nonsurgically and without permanent deficit]. 6. History of pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease. 7. Active, suspected or prior documented autoimmune disease (including inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, Wegner's granulomatosis and Hashimoto's thyroiditis). Participants with vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll. 8. Other malignancy within 2 years prior to entry into the study, except for those treated with surgical therapy only (e.g., localized lowgrade cervical or prostate cancers). 9. Subjects with clinical symptoms or signs of gastrointestinal obstruction and/or who require drainage gastrostomy tube and/or parenteral hydration or nutrition. 10. Known immunodeficiency or HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C positivity. Antibody to Hepatitis B or C without evidence of active infection may be allowed. 11. History of severe allergic reactions to any unknown allergens or any components of the study drugs. 12. Other serious illnesses (e.g., serious infections requiring antibiotics, bleeding disorders). 13. Participation in any other clinical trial involving another investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to Day 1 of the study. 14. Mental impairment that may compromise the ability to give informed consent and comply with the requirements of the study. 15. Lack of availability for immunological and clinical followup assessment. 16. Women of child bearing potential who are pregnant as evidenced by positive serum pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) or nursing. 17. Females of childbearing potential not using a medically acceptable means of contraception. 18. Any condition that, in the clinical judgment of the treating physician, is likely to prevent the subject from complying with any aspect of the protocol or that may put the subject at unacceptable risk.</criteria>
