	<brief_summary>Patients who are having problems breathing sometimes require placement of a breathing tube in their mouth and windpipe. The purpose of this breathing tube is to save the patient's life. It is common to give the patient a medication to sedate him or her before the breathing tube is placed. For patients who are gravely ill two medications are commonly used: etomidate or ketamine. Both medications have risks and benefits. Researchers at UT-Southwestern Medical Center and Parkland Memorial Hospital would like to do a study to figure out which one is better for our patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Etomidate Versus Ketamine for Emergency Endotracheal Intubation: a Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Critically ill individuals who require emergency endotracheal intubation (placement of a breathing tube in the patient's mouth) usually require sedation or anesthesia to make this process tolerable. There are several medication choices for anesthesia, including medications like etomidate, ketamine and propofol. Of these, etomidate and ketamine are frequently used for critically ill patients because they have minimal effects on the patient's vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate). Both etomidate and ketamine are standard-of-care medications, locally and nationally, and both are frequently used to sedate a patient for this procedure. Both etomidate and ketamine have potential side effects. One of the potential side effects of etomidate is suppression of adrenal gland function. It is not known if this affects patients' outcomes in significant ways. One of the potential side effects of ketamine is a slight increase in patients' heart rates. It is not known if this affects patients' outcomes in significant ways. The EvK Trial will be conducted at Parkland Memorial Hospital by investigators in the Departments of Anesthesiology, Emergency Medicine, Medicine / Critical Care Medicine, Surgery, and Pharmacy. The study will randomize critically ill patients who require emergency endotracheal intubation to one of two groups: Etomidate or Ketamine. We will observe the patients' outcomes. The only study intervention involves randomizing individual patients to one medication or the other. All study follow-up beyond that point is done by review of medical records. Because of the nature of this study - an emergency procedure on a critically ill patient - the study will require institutional review board permission not to obtain written informed consent from the patient prior to randomization of study drug for administration for endotracheal tube placement. Prior to enrollment of patients the study team will carry out a comprehensive Community Consultation Plan, which is designed to inform the community about the research study. This is in accordance with rules set forth by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA 21 CFR 50.24).</detailed_description>
