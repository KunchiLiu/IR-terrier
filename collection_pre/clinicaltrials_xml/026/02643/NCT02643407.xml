	<criteria>1. Patients were required to be between 18 to 75 years, with histologically or cytologically proven squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, stage ⅢB (unfit for definitive radiotherapy), stage Ⅳ or relapsing; 2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of zero or one; 3. life expectancy &gt; 3 months; 4. No previous history of malignancy (except adequately treated carcinomainsitu of the cervix or basal cell carcinoma of the skin or superficial bladder cancer [Ta, Tis &amp; T1]); previously untreated with chemotherapy (eg. gemcitabine, platinum, paclitaxel); no previously systemic therapy on locally advanced and metastatic disease; patients were eligible for participation in the study if they had recurrence or metastasis and became locally advanced or metastatic lung cancer after 12 months treatment with gemcitabine, platinum or paclitaxel regimen in adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy; 5. Adequate organ function was required, as evidenced by absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109 /L, platelet count ≥ 100 x109/L, hemoglobin ≥ 90 g/L (9 g/dL); 6. hepatic enzyme levels ≤ 2.5 x the upper limit of the normal range (ULN), alkaline phosphatase levels ≤ 5.0 x the ULN, total bilirubin levels ≤ 1.5 x the ULN, and serum creatinine levels ≤1.5 mg/dL (or creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min); 7. Previous radiotherapy was allowed if it involved &lt;25% of bone marrow and was completed 4 weeks before study entry; Patients must be recovered from acute toxicity before the clinical trials; 8. Pregnancy test: negative (female only); Women with fertility need pregnancy test (serum or urine) in 7 days before entering the group and the results were negative. Male or female patients with reproduction potential had to use an approved contraceptive method during and for 8 weeks after the end of study treatment. 9. Patients are judged by researcher to be the compliance of research requirements and followup. 10. All the patients provided their written informed consent before enrollment. 11. The standard firstline platinumbased regimens according to the clinical practice, and the efficacy was evaluated every two cycles. 1. EGFR positive or ALK positive (patients, the status of EGFR and ALK were unknown due to the detection, were included); 2. Participation in any clinical research in 4 weeks before the first dosage, except non interventional epidemiological investigation; 3. Patients with the complications in high risk; 4. Primary brain tumors or central nervous system (CNS) metastatic carcinoma. The patients who are suspected the CNS metastatic carcinoma should be scanned in 28 days before entering the group. Other malignant disease five years ago (except conebiopsied carcinomainsitu of the cervix or adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin) 5. Thirdspace fluid collection that has the clinical significance, such as ascites or pleural effusion, cannot control through the drainage or other method; 6. Serious mental retardation or cognitive impairment, psychotic illness, poor compliance, cannot meet and narrate therapy responders; 7. No eliminated acute or chronic infection, or other serious concomitant diseases; 8. Serious or uncontrolled concomitant disorders (active infection, ischemic heart diseases, arrhythmia, liver dysfunction, or peripheral nerve disorder); 9. Patients with bleeding tendency or organ transplant; 10. Alcohol or drug dependent patients; patients with the chronic administration of adrenal cortical hormone or immunosuppressive; patients with AIDS or other infectious diseases; 11. Active hepatitis, liver metastasis is over 3/4 of the whole liver; 12. A history of drug allergy; 13. The female patients in the reproductive years are unwilling contraception; 14. Accept other antitumor therapy at the same time; 15. The researchers believe that the patients are not able to complete the entire clinical trial.</criteria>
