	<brief_summary>The objective of our observational prospective study will be to compare, for women treated for infertility and included in a ICSI program, the implantation rate and delivery rate obtained after the transfer of a single blastocyst , chosen in a group of patients on the basis of the embryo morphology and in the other group on the basis of both embryo morphology and follicular fluid cytokines content. 100 IVF infertile patients , aged 32-39 years, with normal ovarian reserve, previously stimulated for their first cycle with standard short protocol (GnRH-Ant) and r-FSH alone, who have had a low ovarian response, Fort &lt; 50% ( FORT Criteria, 2012; FORT= PFCX100/AFC), will be treated for the second cycle with standard short protocol (GnRH-Ant) and r-FSH plus r-LH , according to the standard established by our clinical practice. Patients will be part of one of the following groups: Group 1: single embryo transfer on day 5, according to standard embryo morphological criteria Group 2: single embryo transfer on day 5, chosen on the basis of both embryo morphological criteria and levels of cytokines measured in the individual FF.</brief_summary>
