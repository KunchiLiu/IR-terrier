	<brief_title>A RCT of CenteringPregnancy on Birth Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized controlled trial to compare biomedical, behavioral and psychosocial outcomes by race among pregnant women who participate in CenteringPregnancy group prenatal care, to women in the traditional individual prenatal care and to investigate whether improving women's stress, activation and engagement will explain the potential benefits of CenteringPregnancy on outcomes and health disparities. The trial will be conducted in a large prenatal care center in South Carolina. Eligible White and Black women will be recruited before 20 weeks of gestational age with low risk pregnancy.</detailed_description>
