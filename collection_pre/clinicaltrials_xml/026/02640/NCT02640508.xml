Patients may have had a prior diagnosis of cancer if it has been &gt; 5 years since their last treatment and are considered free of disease. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below: Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/uL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/uL Platelets ≥ 100,000/uL Child Pugh score ≤ 10 Patients must be able to swallow and retain oral medication. All patients must have given signed, informed consent prior to registration on study. Women who are pregnant or lactating are not eligible for study treatment. Patients who are undergoing concomitant radiotherapy are NOT eligible for participation.

Previous systemic treatment and/or radiation therapy is allowed with a 14 day washout period prior to registration. Lesions that have been radiated previously cannot be considered target lesions Prior treatment related side effects must have resolved to &lt; Grade 2 severity per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.03), except alopecia and infertility. Patients who are taking any herbal (alternative) medicines are NOT eligible for participation. Patients must be off any such medications by the time of registration. Patients with known brain metastases are NOT eligible for participation unless the brain metastases are treated (either with surgical excision, stereotactic radiosurgery or radiotherapy) and have been stable for at least 4 wks per MR performed, the patient is asymptomatic and has discontinued corticosteroids if taken for that purpose. Patients with any of the following conditions or complications are NOT eligible for participation: 1. GI tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication 2. Malabsorption syndrome 3. Require IV alimentation 4. History of prior surgical procedures affecting absorption 5. Uncontrolled inflammatory GI disease (e.g., Crohn's, ulcerative colitis). 6.
