	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate if MRI scans performed after neoadjuvant radiotherapy can predict the therapeutic response of rectal cancer following preoperative chemo-radiotherapy. This will help doctors to better tailor treatments for rectal cancer in the future.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predicting Neoadjuvant Therapy Response of Rectal Cancer With MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We proposed to constructed multi-parameter predictive model for predicting therapeutic response and pathological complete response(pCR) of patients with rectal cancer who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation. MR radiomics, morphological parameters and quantitative functional parameters derived from diffusion-weighted MR images will be integrated for model construction.</detailed_description>
