	<brief_title>Effects of Levosimendan and Milrinone on Left and Right Ventricular Function in Septic Cardiomyopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective randomized study where 30 patients with septic shock and myocardial dysfunction in echocardiogram, during the care in ICU, will be included. Patients with a history of previous heart disease will be excluded from the study. Each patient will be randomized and blinded to receive either milrinone or levosimendan. Before giving one of these inotropic agents, hemodynamic variables as blood pressure, cardiac output, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) will be continuously monitored with ECG, arterial line and pulmonary artery catheter (PAC). Two doses of respective inotropic drug will be administered according to drug recommendations. A) milrinone bolus injection 50 mcg/kg followed by infusion 0,4 mcg/kg/min and 0,8 mcg/kg/min. B) levosimendan bolus injection 12 mg/kg followed by infusion 0,1 mcg/kg/min and 0,2 mcg/kg/min. After 30 minutes of treatment with respective drug and dosage, the cardiac function will be assessed with echocardiography and systemic hemodynamics. Echocardiograms will be analysed for the determination of LV an RV strain. Potential differences between the two agents on hemodynamic and respiratory variables, as well as echo and strain measurements will be analysed.</detailed_description>
