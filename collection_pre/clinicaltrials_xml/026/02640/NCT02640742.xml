	<detailed_description>Rationale for this Non-Interventional Study According to the Japanese Asthma Prevention and Management Guideline 2015 (Japan guideline (JGL) 2015), the goal in the management and treatment of asthma is "to be able to lead a life like a healthy individual." In order to achieve this therapeutic goal, the achievement of "well-controlled" state based on the asthma control status is considered to be a clinical goal. However, there are few studies in which the asthma control status is accurately surveyed in a real life setting in adult asthma patients receiving continued treatment from physician in Japan and the actual situation is unknown. By understanding the status of asthma control in asthma patients in a real life setting, the clinical issues could be clarified. Therefore, such information would contribute to appropriate treatment of asthma. Thus, we planned this study to evaluate the asthma control status, asthma symptoms (severity, frequency, and limitations on activities, etc.), Quality of line (QOL), and use of drugs for asthma attack in the study population in a real life setting by recruiting patients through medical institutions providing continued care for asthma patients. Objectives of this Non-Interventional Study 1. Primary objective To assess the proportion of adult asthma patients receiving continued treatment from physician in Japan in each asthma control status defined by JGL 2015 ("poorly-controlled," "insufficiently-controlled," and "well-controlled"). 2. Secondary objectives To evaluate asthma symptoms (intensity, frequency, and limitations on activities, etc.), QOL, use of drugs for asthma attack, and emotional feelings in the study population; and to investigate the effects of demographic characteristics and pathologic properties of each patient on the status of asthma control, asthma symptoms, QOL, use of drugs for asthma attack, and emotional feelings.</detailed_description>
