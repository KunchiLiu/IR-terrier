	<brief_summary>The investigators have devised a simple method to continuously measure the CP using an invasive pressure monitoring setup (IPMS), which is used routinely in the operating room to monitor arterial or central venous pressures. The investigators have previously confirmed both in vitro and in vivo (previous IRB approved protocol), a clinically applicable agreement of the IPMS readings with the values obtained from a standard manometer (gold standard). In the current study, we will prospectively evaluate the relationship between the patient's head position and CP in patients undergoing otolaryngological surgery and also measure the oxygen concentration in the oropharynx to determine the potential risk of an airway fire.</brief_summary>
