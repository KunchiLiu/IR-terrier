	<brief_summary>The main objective of this trial is to provide long-term safety, PK, and immunogenicity data on BI 695501 administered via prefilled syringe in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis who have completed Trial 1297.2. The primary endpoint thereby is the number (proportion) of patients with drug-related AEs during the treatment phase. The secondary objective in this trial is the assessment of Long-term efficacy of BI 695501 by evaluation of: - the change from Baseline in DAS28 (ESR) at Week 48 - the proportion of patients meeting ACR20 response criteria at Week 48 - the proportion of patients who meet the ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) definition of remission at Week 48 - the proportion of patients with EULAR response (good response, moderate response, or no response) at Week 48.</brief_summary>
