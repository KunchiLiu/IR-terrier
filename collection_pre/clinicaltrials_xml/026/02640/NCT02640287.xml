	<brief_summary>Waldenström's macroglobulinemia is a rare disease whose pathophysiology remains at present poorly understood, although a recurrent mutation (L265P MYD88) has recently been described. Unlike other lymphoproliferative disorders, there is a defect in isotype switching, mechanism involving AID and NHEJ complex. Using a two-dimensional electrophoresis technology, our group showed that MW had a specific proteomic profile, and one of the differentially expressed proteins is Ku70 (encoded by XRCC6 belonging to NHEJ complex) . The investigators purpose to explore the mechanisms of underexpression of Ku70/XRCC6 (genetic or epigenetic modification) in comparison with other lymphoid malignancies and normal B cells.</brief_summary>
