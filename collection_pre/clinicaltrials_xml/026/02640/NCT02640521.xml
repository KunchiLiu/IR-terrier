	<brief_summary>The overall goal of this study is to adapt and preliminarily validate an intervention based on evidence based approaches to assist smoking parents and other family members of inner-city children ages 4 to 12 with asthma to stop smoking.This study aims (1) to adapt existing guideline-based materials used in adult medicine to create a system- and provider-level intervention for pediatrics and (2) to evaluate feasibility and acceptability of (a) procedures to recruit inner-city, ethnic minority parents and (b) intervention procedures, and to estimate intervention effects.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigators will adapt guideline-based interventions used in adult medicine. The intervention consists of two system-level interventions (chart reminders to prompt providers to ask about in-home smoking and a State Quit-line referral system), and a provider-level intervention (training in the PHS Guidelines, in motivational interviewing, and on how to use the system-level intervention). Investigators will implement the study in the Bellevue Pediatric Asthma Clinic and the pediatric clinic at Lincoln Hospital using a two group (pre intervention control group / post-intervention treatment group) pilot study to test the feasibility and preliminary effects of a multi-level (i.e., system and provider) intervention. The primary outcome is provider adherence to tobacco use treatment guidelines, which will be assessed by conducting parent exit interviews with 200 smoking parents (100 pre-intervention [control group] and 100 post-intervention [treatment group]). Preliminary intervention outcomes will be collected through the parent exit interviews (i.e., baseline) and 2-month post-baseline interviews with the control and treatment parents. Providers will also be interviewed regarding their satisfaction with the intervention.</detailed_description>
