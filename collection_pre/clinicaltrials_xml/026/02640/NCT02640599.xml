	<brief_summary>Investigators will use a stationary bike protocol to investigate whether patients with post concussion syndrome benefit from adding exertion training to a vestibular rehabilitation program. Investigators examine the effect of aerobic exercise testing and training on individuals with concussion who are currently experiencing symptoms and examine the effect of aerobic exercise in combination with traditional vestibular rehabilitation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a randomized controlled single blind pilot study testing the hypothesis that the combination of aerobic exercise plus vestibular rehabilitation will result in greater reduction of symptoms of dizziness and imbalance compared to vestibular rehabilitation alone.</detailed_description>
