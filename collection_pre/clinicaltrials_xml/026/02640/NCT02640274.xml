	<brief_summary>The European guidelines of cardiovascular disease prevention recommend treatment modalities, such as lifestyle changes in order to minimize the risk of further cardiac event after a myocardial infarction (MI). However, a considerable gap exists between guidelines and their implementation in clinical practise. Further, less is known about the impact of different interventions on patient's knowledge, skills and confidence necessary for self-management after MI. Aim: To evaluate and compare the short- and long-term effects of an individual nurse-led counselling programme together with usual care for patients early discharged after MI on self-management behaviour.</brief_summary>
