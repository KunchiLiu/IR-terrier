	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind, randomized study in parallel groups of subjects presenting with low back pain. Randomized subjects will receive treatment for 60 days with either a combination of nucleotides and vitamin B12 or vitamin B1+B6+B12. The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the therapeutic effect of the combination of nucleotides + vitamin B12 with that of the combination of vitamins B1, B6 and B12 in low back pain. Safety and efficacy will be monitored throughout the treatment period. Subjects will be randomized in a double-blind fashion to either treatment group.</detailed_description>
