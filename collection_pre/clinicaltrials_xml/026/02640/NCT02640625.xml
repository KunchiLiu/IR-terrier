	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of probiotics in cART-treated immunologic non-responder (INR) patients with chronic HIV infection. The secondary objectives are to i) explore the biological effects of probiotics in combined antiretroviral therapy(cART)-treated INR patient with chronic HIV infection, and ii) investigate differences between cART-treated HIV-infected INR and non-INR patients with regards to gut microbial composition and mucosal barrier function.</brief_summary>
