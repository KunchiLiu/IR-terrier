	<brief_summary>An extended replication of Jaen &amp; Dalton (2014), the investigators aim to investigate the role of odors and associated trigger beliefs on symptom perception and airway inflammation in individuals with asthma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Odors on Asthma Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants with asthma are randomly assigned to a 15-min (phenylethyl alcohol) odor inhalation, accompanied by either an asthmogenic suggestion (nocebo), or a therapeutic suggestion (placebo). Airway inflammation, lung function, and asthma symptoms are measured in response to the odor/suggestion, up to 24 hours after odor inhalation. The investigators are also measuring worry and heart rate variability as potential mediators of the response.</detailed_description>
