	<brief_title>2nd Line Treatment With Pemetrexed and Sorafenib for Recurrent or Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a single-arm, open-label, phase 2 study of a regimen of dose-dense pemetrexed and sorafenib to determine the objective response rate in patients with recurrent or metastatic TNBC. Eligible patients will be those who have had disease progression during or after treatment for recurrent or metastatic disease with a minimum of 1 previous chemotherapy regimen. (There is no maximum number of previous treatment regimens.) Correlative studies will be conducted using blood samples and archived tumor samples. Simon's two-stage design will be utilized in this study. In the first stage, if there are ≤ 3 patients of the first 18 efficacy-evaluable patients who have a partial or complete response, then the trial will end for futility. If ≥ 4 patients have a partial or complete response, patient accrual will continue in the second stage to add 10 more efficacy-evaluable patients. The total sample size for the Simon's two-stage design is 35 patients. Based on enrollment of 2-3 patients per month, the expected enrollment period will be about 12-18 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Unresectable adenocarcinoma of the breast involving chest wall, regional nodes, or distant site Breast cancer determined to be estrogen receptor (ER)negative and progesterone receptor (PgR)negative defined for this study as &lt; 10% tumor staining by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Note: Eligibility should be based on the ER and PgR status reported at the time of the most recent biopsy or resection). Breast cancer determined to be HER2negative per current American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) HER2 Guidelines (Note: Eligibility should be based on the HER2 status reported at the time of the most recent biopsy or resection). One, and only one, previous cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen for treatment of recurrent or metastatic disease (Note: Previous cytotoxic chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic disease is not required if the patient had disease progression or recurrence during or within the first 6 months following completion of adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.) Measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 Age ≥ 18 years Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 Ability to swallow oral medications Adequate bone marrow function as defined below: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,200/mm3 Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL Adequate renal function as defined below: Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 45 mL/min Adequate hepatic function as defined below: Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for the laboratory Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3 x ULN for the laboratory, except in the presence of known hepatic metastasis, wherein the AST may be ≤ 5 x ULN Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 3 x ULN for the laboratory, except in the presence of known hepatic metastasis, wherein the ALT may be ≤ 5 x ULN International normalized ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 Serum B12 and folate levels ≥ lower limit of normal (LLN) for the laboratory (Note: Patients may begin B12 and folic acid supplementation and be reconsidered for participation in the study when levels are ≥ LLN for the laboratory). Ability to take folic acid, vitamin B12, and dexamethasone according to the protocol instructions Ability to interrupt chronic nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) beginning 2 days before (5 days before for longacting NSAIDs) and continuing for 2 days following administration of each pemetrexed dose Toxicities from previous cancer therapies resolved to ≤ grade 1 unless specified otherwise in the inclusion or exclusion criteria (Exception: Neuropathy related to previous chemotherapy must be resolved to ≤ grade 2.) Women who are not postmenopausal or have not undergone hysterectomy must have a documented negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to initiating study treatment. Note: Postmenopausal is defined as one or more of the following: Age ≥ 60 years Age &lt; 60 years and amenorrheic for at least 1 year with folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) and plasma estradiol levels in the postmenopausal range Bilateral oophorectomy A woman of childbearing potential (WCBP) and a male patient with partner who is a WCBP must agree to use a medically accepted method for preventing pregnancy for the duration of study treatment and for 2 months following completion of study treatment. Ability to understand and willingness to sign the consent form written in English Exclusion Criteria Any investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to initiating study treatment Anticancer therapy within 2 weeks prior to initiating study treatment Plans for concurrent anticancer therapy except as permitted in Section 6.7.11 Known or presumed intolerance of pemetrexed or sorafenib Known or suspected malabsorption condition or obstruction Symptomatic or untreated brain metastases (Note: Patients with known brain metastases who are asymptomatic and have had posttreatment imaging within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment that indicates stable disease in the brain are eligible. (Imaging of the brain is required within 8 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment in all other patients.) Leptomeningeal metastasis Any documented history of clinically identifiable thrombotic, embolic, venous, or arterial events such as cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism within 6 months prior to initiating study treatment (Note: Patients with an asymptomatic catheterrelated thrombus or a tumorassociated thrombus of locallyinvolved vessels or with incidental asymptomatic filling defects identified on imaging are not excluded.)
