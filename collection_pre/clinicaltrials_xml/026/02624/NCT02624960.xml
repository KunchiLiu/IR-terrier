	<brief_summary>This is a single-arm, multi-center, open-label controlled study that will assess the safety and performance of the Accucinch System to induce left ventricular reverse remodeling and reduce the severity of functional mitral regurgitation in symptomatic adult patients with mitral regurgitation and left ventricular remodeling due to dilated cardiomyopathy (ischemic or non-ischemic etiology), who are of high operative risk.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Study patient is an adult of legal consent age Severity of FMR: ≥ Moderate Ejection Fraction: ≥20 to ≤60% Symptom Status: NYHA IIIVa Treatment and compliance with optimal guideline directed medical therapy for heart failure for at least 1 month Surgical risk: Subject is eligible for cardiac surgery Patients with significant organic mitral valve pathology (e.g. myxomatous degeneration, mitral valve prolapse or flail leaflets) Myocardial infarction or any percutaneous cardiovascular intervention, cardiovascular surgery, or carotid surgery within 30 days Prior surgical, transcatheter, or percutaneous mitral valve intervention Untreated clinically significant coronary artery disease requiring revascularization Hemodynamic instability: Hypotension or requirement for inotropic support or mechanical hemodynamic support Any planned cardiac surgery or interventions within the next 6 months NYHA class IVb (i.e., nonambulatory) or ACC/AHA Stage D heart failure Fixed pulmonary artery systolic pressure &gt;70 mmHg Severe tricuspid regurgitation Modified Rankin Scale ≥ 4 disability Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, constrictive pericarditis, or any other structural heart disease causing heart failure other than dilated cardiomyopathy of either ischemic or nonischemic etiology Mitral valve area less than 4.0 cm2 Anatomical pathology/constraints preventing appropriate access/implant of the GDS Accucinch System Renal insufficiency Mitral annular calcification Moderate or severe aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation or aortic valve prosthesis Fluoroscopic or echocardiographic evidence of severe aortic arch calcification, mobile aortic atheroma, intracardiac mass, thrombus or vegetation Active bacterial endocarditis History of stroke within the prior 3 months Subjects in whom anticoagulation is contraindicated Anemia Thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis Bleeding disorders or hypercoaguable state Active peptic ulcer or active gastrointestinal bleeding Known allergy to nitinol, polyester, or polyethylene Any prior true anaphylactic reaction to contrast agents; defined as known anaphylactoid or other nonanaphylactic allergic reactions to contrast agents that cannot be adequately premedicated prior to the index procedure. Life expectancy &lt; 1 year due to noncardiac conditions Currently participating in another interventional investigational study Implant or revision of any rhythm management device or implantable cardioverter defibrillator within the prior month Absence of CRT with class I indication criteria for biventricular pacing Subjects on high dose steroids or immunosuppressant therapy Female subjects who are pregnant, of child bearing potential or lactating</criteria>
