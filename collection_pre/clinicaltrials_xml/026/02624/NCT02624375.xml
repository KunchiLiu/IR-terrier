Additional exclusions for optional skin biopsy: 1. Has an acute or chronic medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would render biopsies unsafe 2. History of coagulopathy or taking medication that may cause bleeding (long term aspirin, heparin, coumadin) 3. History of keloid formation or excessive scarring 4.
