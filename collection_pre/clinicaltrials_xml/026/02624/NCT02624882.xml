	<brief_title>Impact of Antibiotic Treatment of Group A Streptococcal Blistering Distal Dactylitis in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Blistering distal dactylitis are very common in children. About 60% are caused by Staphylococcus aureus and some are caused by Group A Streptococcus (GAS) or Streptococcus pyogenes. While these forms have been known for fifty years, few publications are interested in it. Some studies have confirmed that a single antibiotic treatment against the SGA allows the healing of these dactylitis but few surgical teams have adopted this strategy. As all streptococcal infections, they face the risk of acute complications (septicemia, streptococcal toxic shock, etc.) or late (post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, acute rheumatic fever, etc.). The involvement of the SGA in these dactylitis is easy to demonstrate through the use of rapid GAS test already widely used in other GAS infections (tonsillitis, scarlet fever, streptococcal perianal infections). This study aims to assess the clinical course of positive GAS test blistering distal dactylitis in children after antibiotic treatment.</detailed_description>
