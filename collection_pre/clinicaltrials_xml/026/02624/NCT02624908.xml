	<brief_summary>24-week, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate safety and efficacy of canagliflozin as compared with placebo in reducing the need for mealtime insulin in subjects with type 2 diabetes currently using a basal-bolus insulin regimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Canagliflozin-Mealtime Insulin Rescue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Canagliflozin Mealtime Insulin Rescue study will enroll up to 40 subjects at the Atlanta VA Medical Center. Subjects will be screened and enter a 2-week run-in period during which they will switch to or continue on a diabetes treatment regimen of basal insulin before supper and aspart insulin before meals. Run-in will be useful in evaluating compliance to treatment and self-monitoring. After run-in, subjects will collect one week of baseline glycemic data with regular pre-meal and fasting glycemic levels using both finger stick testing and continuous glucose monitoring. Subjects will be randomized at Visit 3 to 100 mg of canagliflozin or placebo. If well tolerated, this dose will be increased to 300 mg of canagliflozin or placebo at Visit 4. Diabetes management will be assured through regular contact with the study team (weekly calls and clinic visits at Weeks 4, 8, 16 and 24). Management will be facilitated by diabetes management software. Self-monitoring and continuous glucose monitoring will be repeated at the end of study participation.</detailed_description>
