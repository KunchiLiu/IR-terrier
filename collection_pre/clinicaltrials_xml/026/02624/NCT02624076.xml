	<brief_summary>Infertility affects one in six couples. In a quarter of them, routine tests of semen quality, ovulation or tubal patency fail to reveal any abnormalities and the cause of infertility is unexplained. Acupuncture is being increasingly used by couples with all types of infertility and initial trials have suggested that it could be potentially beneficial in some cases. A number of systematic reviews of acupuncture in IVF have shown conflicting results, but there is no evidence to inform best practice in unexplained infertility. In addition, as an intervention, acupuncture is not cost neutral as it involves multiple visits for treatment sessions delivered by a skilled practitioner. Thus, while acupuncture could have the potential to increase live birth rates in women with unexplained infertility, the clinical and cost effectiveness of acupuncture needs to be confirmed in the context of a large randomized controlled trial.</brief_summary>
