	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and duration of pain relief after total knee arthroplasty provided by a single injection of liposomal bupivacaine (EXPARELÂ®) versus standard bupivacaine with an adjuvant, dexamethasone when administered as a quadriceps sparing femoral nerve block and periarticular injection. It is hypothesized that liposomal bupivacaine is superior to standard bupivacaine with dexamethasone and will decrease time to discharge readiness.</brief_summary>
