	<brief_summary>The study aimed to explore therapeutic effects of natural environments. To do so, the investigators evaluated the immediate and sustained changes in several indicators of well-being while people (n=26) with poor mental health were engaged in unconstrained exposures to natural (green, blue) and urban environments. The indicators included: affection, cognition, physiological responses. Each participant was exposed to all environments for a period of 210 minutes between October 2013 and January 2014. During the exposure period, participants were instructed to do what they would usually do in that environment. Before, during (at 30 and 210 minutes) and after each exposure, several psycho-physiological measures were taken: (i) heart rate variability and heart rate using a Holter monitor, (ii) blood pressure using a digital blood pressure monitor, (iii) physical activity using the CalFIT application installed in a Smartphone, (iv) lung function using a portable computerized spirometer, (v) stress level using salivary cortisol samples collected using Salivettes, (vi) affect, perceived restoration and social interactions using questionnaires, (vii) cognitive functioning using the backwards digit-span task test.</brief_summary>
