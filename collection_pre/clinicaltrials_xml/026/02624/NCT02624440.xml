	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the effect of prophylactic antibiotics in multiple myeloma. One third of patients will received treatment with clarithromycin, one third of patients will receive treatment with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and one third will be observed without prophylactic antibiotics. All patients receive concurrent anti-myeloma treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clarithromycin, Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim or Observation in Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a need for improvement of the prognosis in elderly myeloma patients. The patients are fragile due to age and severe comorbidity. Infections are frequent during the course of initial myeloma treatment and contribute to the high morbidity and mortality in elderly patients. Furthermore infections often lead to delay in myeloma treatment and to dose reduction. The use of primary antibiotic prophylaxis might influence the frequency of these complications. In the study myeloma patients who are ineligible for high-dose melphalan with stem cell support are randomised to either p.o. clarithromycin 250 mg twice daily for 180 days, p.o. sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim 400/80 mg twice daily for 180 days or observation without prophylactic antibiotics. All patients receive concurrent myeloma treatment at the discretion of the treating physician. The choice of anti-myeloma treatment has to be settled before randomization. The study evaluates the frequency of infections in patients treated with clarithromycin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim or observation</detailed_description>
