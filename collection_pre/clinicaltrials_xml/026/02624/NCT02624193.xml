	<brief_summary>Preliminary data from the investigators' NCCAM-funded R21 on mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) in HIV-infected youth suggest an association between mindfulness and improved self-regulation and medication adherence. This randomized, controlled trial will help the investigators to better understand the specific impact of MBSR on HIV medication and treatment adherence in HIV-infected youth, and the efficacy of MBSR in the amelioration of stress and improved self-regulation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite remarkable advances in HIV medication effectiveness, adherence to HIV treatment recommendations is alarmingly poor, resulting in preventable morbidity and mortality. It is estimated that 26-72% of HIV-infected adolescents are non-adherent to their HIV medications and 22-33% are non-adherent with scheduled health care visits. HIV treatment non-adherence puts individuals at markedly increased risk for illness related to HIV itself and a variety of opportunistic infections, as well as at increased risk of spreading HIV. Preliminary data from the investigators' NCCAM-funded R21 on mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) in HIV-infected youth suggest an association between mindfulness and improved medication adherence, as well as enhanced self-regulatory processes (coping, psychological function, and cognitive function). This three-armed randomized, controlled trial will help the investigators to better understand the specific impact of MBSR on HIV medication and treatment adherence in HIV-infected youth, and the efficacy of MBSR in the amelioration of stress and improved self-regulation.</detailed_description>
