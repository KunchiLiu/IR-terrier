	<brief_summary>Ramadan fasting (RF) has been shown to be associated with vascular and metabolic disorders including glycemic control and lipid profile. It may also alter pharmacologic properties of some medications. Many patients with CAD and under Clopidogrel insist to observe the fasting and taking the risk of altering the pharmacologic proprieties of this drug. The aim of this study is to assess the effects of RF on clopidogrel resistance in patients at high cardiovascular risk with particular interest to patients with DM.</brief_summary>
