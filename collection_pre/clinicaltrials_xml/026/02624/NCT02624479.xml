	<brief_summary>Chronic treatment and prophylaxis of vessel and soft tissue calcification as well as of renal calculi could be a future indication for sodium thiosulfate (STS). Using an oral formulation might increase the compliance and treatment success compared to parenteral administration. Three gastro-resistant formulations of STS for oral administration were developed with different release characteristics: fast-release, medium-release and slow-release tablets. Aim of the enteric coating was to increase the oral bioavailability of STS. The bioavailability and tolerability of these formulations for oral administration in healthy volunteers will be compared in this clinical trial.</brief_summary>
