	<criteria>Other then hepatic impairment, subjects should be in good health as determined by past medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (except for additional inclusion criteria for hepatic impaired subjects). Subjects must weigh at least 50 kg and no more than 120 kg and have a body mass index in the range 18.036.0 kg/m2. Additional criteria for hepatic impaired subjects: Subjects must have a score clinically determined and calculated as per the ChildPugh classification and consistent with the degree of hepatic impairment in which study is currently enrolling. Stable ChildPugh status within 28 days prior to dosing. All subjects: Subject has received a liver transplant at any time in the past and is on immunosuppressant therapy. Smokers not willing to limit the use of tobacco to 5 cigarettes per day. Surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, or which may jeopardize the subject's safety in case of participation in the study. Use of any herbal medications/supplements. History of acute pancreatitis within 1 year of study entry. Additional criteria for subjects with normal liver function: Use of any prescription or nonprescription medication. Positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or Hepatitis C test result. Additional criteria for hepatic impaired subjects: Use of any prescription or nonprescription medication, that has the potential to interact with alpelisb. Concomitant medications without potential to interact with alpelisib must be stable in dose. Encephalopathy grade 3 or worse. Total bilirubin &gt; 6 mg/dl. Screening or baseline ECG: QTcF&gt;480msec for both genders Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
