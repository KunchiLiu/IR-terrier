	<brief_summary>Despite the declining incidence, gastric cancer (GC) remains the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In France, it is the second digestive cancer with 7,000 new cases per year. It is now well demonstrated that patients with H. pylori infection, atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia, have a high risk of developing GC. It is therefore important to detect these pre-neoplastic lesions at an early stage to improve patients prognosis. Thus, the aim of this project is to investigate the possible screening of gastric precancerous lesions by a blood test (GastroPanelÂ®) in France, in patients with oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) prescription.</brief_summary>
