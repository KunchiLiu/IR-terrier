Subjects must agree not to have any other procedures affecting skin quality (microdermabrasion, peels, acne treatments, etc.) for the duration of the study. Subjects must understand the study and be able to follow study instructions as well as attend the required study visits. Subjects who agree to be photographed for research purposes and their identity may not be concealed in these photographs. Subjects whom are pregnant, planning to become pregnant or breastfeeding.

Subjects who cannot understand or are not willing to comply with the requirements of the study.

The use of estrogens or oral contraceptives for less than 3 months prior to baseline. The use within 1 month prior to baseline of: topical retinoids to the face; systemic antibiotics known to have an impact on the severity of facial acne (e.g., containing tetracycline and its derivatives, erythromycin and its derivatives, sulfamethoxazole, or trimethoprim); systemic corticosteroids (Note: intranasal and inhalational corticosteroids do not require a washout and maybe used throughout the trial if the subject is on a stable dose). Use within 2 weeks prior to baseline of: topical corticosteroids; topical antibiotics; topical medications for acne (e.g., metronidazole).

Subjects who engage in activities that involve excessive or prolonged exposure to sunlight or weather extremes, such as wind or cold. A subject who has any clinically significant condition or situation, other than the condition being studied that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with the study evaluations or optimal participation in the study. A subject who has used any topical azelaic acid therapy within 30 days of baseline visit. Subjects who have participated in an investigational drug study (i.e., subjects have been treated with an Investigational Drug) within 30 days prior to baseline will be excluded from study participation. Subjects who are participating in nontreatment studies such as observational studies or registry studies can be considered for inclusion. Subjects who have been previously enrolled in this study. Subjects who have had laser therapy (for telangiectasia or other conditions), electrodessication and phototherapy to the facial area within 180 days prior to study entry. Subjects who have had cosmetic procedures (e.g., facials) which may affect the efficacy and safety profile of the Investigational Product within 14 days prior to study entry. Subjects who have had any kind of facial dermabrasion, chemical peel, laser, IPL or any other treatment that could influence the skin quality in the past 6 months or for the duration of the study Subjects who do not agree to avoid using tanning beds or intensive exposure to the sun two weeks prior to each office visit.
