	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to find out if taking Acetaminophen with Ibuprofen (e.g. Tylenol + Advil), a non-opioid regimen, provides the same type of pain relief after hand surgery compared to Acetaminophen and codeine (e.g. Tylenol 3), an opioid regimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acetaminophen/Codeine vs Acetaminophen/Ibuprofen for Pain Control and Patient Satisfaction After Hand Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: To establish, through a randomized control trial, whether post-operative Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen (non-opioid regimen) would provide equivalent post-operative analgesia to ambulatory hand surgery patients compared to Acetaminophen and Codeine (opioid regimen). Secondary Objective: To establish whether the opioid versus non-opioid post-operative pain regimen influences patient satisfaction. Sixty-three patients enrolled for each group (non-opioid and opioid). Approximately 145 patients will be required to achieve complete data for 63 patients in each group (assuming 15% lost to follow-up &amp; failure to comply with study protocol).</detailed_description>
