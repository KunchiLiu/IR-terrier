	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate Properties of Radiprodil Given in Oral Solution to Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>UP0027 is a Phase 1, single-center, open-label study to investigate the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of radiprodil in healthy adult male and female subjects after a single fasting oral dose of radiprodil 30 mg suspension formulation. A total of 10 subjects will be enrolled in the study. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the PK profile of oral radiprodil in suspension form in healthy adult subjects. The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral radiprodil in suspension form in healthy adult subjects. The exploratory objectives of the study are to evaluate the comparative PK profile of radiprodil from samples collected using 2 alternative microsampling techniques (MITRA™ and Drummond capillary tubes) with that of conventional venous blood samples, and to test the perception of the taste and texture of the oral radiprodil suspension.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subject is male or female, ≥ 18 years to ≤ 45 years of age Subject smokes &lt; 10 cigarettes per day and has a score of &lt; 4 on the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (Heatherthon et al., 1991).

Exceptions: Paracetamol for the treatment of mild symptoms (eg, headache or other pain), given at most every 6 h to 8 h, not exceeding 2 g/day, and with a total of no more than 5 g over 7 days Inhaled corticosteroids for seasonal rhinitis Vitamins within recommended daily dose Limits Subject has consumed any grapefruit, grapefruit juice, grapefruitcontaining products, or star fruit within 14 days prior to administration of Radiprodil Subject has a history of unexplained syncope or a family history of sudden death due to long QT syndrome</criteria>
