	<brief_summary>Many patients complain to clinicians that they have difficulty sleeping appears to be due to environmental noise. There is a common perception that acute noises are more troublesome than continuous noises in the effect on individual sleep quality. Therefore the goal is to use a Marpac white noise maker with a continuous noise to see its effect on individuals that have difficulty sleeping in a high noise environment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of White Noise In High Noise Environment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insomnia patients will be recruited based on their perception of high noise in their apartment. The investigators will screen patients during the first meeting using The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 6.0 (MINI 6.0). At baseline, an Insomnia Severity Index will be administered. The study will consist of a one week baseline period in which noise levels will be monitored using spectral analysis and decibel levels and sleep duration will be recorded using a subjective sleep log and wrist actigraphy for objective measurement. At the end of the first week an Insomnia Severity Index will be administered. During the second week, a treatment period with a white noise machine using a fixed decibel level will be installed in the bedrooms of the subjects. The room noise will continue to be monitored via spectral analysis as well as decibel levels while the patients are wearing actigraphs and keeping a sleep log. At the end of the second week an Insomnia Severity Index will be administered. During the third week, the white noise machine will be removed and the rooms will still be monitored for sound via spectral analysis and decibel levels and the subject will wear an actigraph and keep a sleep log. At the end of the third week an Insomnia Severity Index will be administered. The total numbers of subjects will be 20. The investigators will use Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline vs. white noise to analyze differences. The investigators will use an Acute Noise Index, in which noise spikes of 2 standard deviations from the mean of the entire nights decibel levels count as a noise event. Noise levels in subjects bedroom will be collected throughout the study along with subjects sleep activity using an actigraph and sleep log.</detailed_description>
