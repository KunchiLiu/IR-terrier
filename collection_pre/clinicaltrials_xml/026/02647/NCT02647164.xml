	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the value of circulating tumor cells (CTC)for non-small cell lung cancer in the postoperative recurrence monitoring by comparing the CTCs, CT and tumor markers at different time points.The time of CTC and carcinoembryonic antigen(CEA) detection is baseline, 2~7 days, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months after the surgery. And the time of CT detection is 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months after the surgery.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age 1880 years old Patients with histologically documented (stage Ⅰ/Ⅱ/ⅢA ) nonsmall cell lung cancer. Patients will undergo surgery. Patients with preoperative CTCs ≥8.5 Units / 3 ml Informed consent must be obtained from all patients prior to beginning therapy. Patients should have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Patients with histologically documented not (stage Ⅰ/Ⅱ/ⅢA ) nonsmall cell lung cancer. After the operation review, patients' result of CTC, CT and tumor markers is incomplete at the same point. The blood sample isn't collected in predetermined time. The blood samples appear hemolysis. The blood sample isn't enough.</criteria>
