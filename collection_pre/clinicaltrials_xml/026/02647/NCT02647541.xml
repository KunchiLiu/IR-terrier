	<brief_summary>The hypothesis of this study is a nutrition preoperatively in infants and children undergoing elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass leads to improvement in nutritional status, intervention, and that this results in good postoperative results.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If this hypothesis is confirmed, there will be subsidies for systematic implementation of nutritional interventions in patients seen in service.</detailed_description>
