	<criteria>1. Adult subjects, age ≥18 years 2. Clinically confirmed diagnosis of diabetes mellitus for ≥1 year 3. Subject has signed an informed consent form and is willing to comply with protocol requirements 1. History of severe hypoglycemia in the previous 6 months. Severe hypoglycemia is defined as hypoglycemia resulting in loss of consciousness or seizure 2. History of diabetic ketoacidosis requiring emergency room visit or hospitalization in the previous 6 months 3.

Symptomatic coronary artery disease; unstable angina; myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack or stroke in the past 6 months; uncontrolled hypertension (systolic&gt;160 mm Hg or diastolic &gt;100 mm Hg at time of screening); current congestive heart failure; history of cardiac arrhythmia (benign PACs and PVCs allowed). Subjects with asymptomatic coronary artery disease (e,g, CABG, stent placement or angioplasty) may participate if negative stress test within 1 year prior to screening and written clearance from Cardiologist documented. 6. Hematocrit &lt;30% or &gt;55% 7. History of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV 8. Any condition that in the investigator's opinion would make the subject unable to complete the study or would make it not in the subject's best interest to participate in the study.</criteria>
