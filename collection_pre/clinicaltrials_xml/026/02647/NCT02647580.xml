	<brief_summary>Failure to thrive (FTT) is an expression for inadequate growth in the early childhood and thus, a sign of undernutrition. This study will include children with FTT, and compare with existing data from children with normal and excessive growth. The overall aim of this study is to explore whether 1) children who develop FTT with no organic explanation differ from healthy normal weight and overweight children in their basal level of appetite-regulating hormones and 2) if inadequate, normal and excessive growth in children can be partly predicted by variation in their gut microbiome and metabolome.</brief_summary>
