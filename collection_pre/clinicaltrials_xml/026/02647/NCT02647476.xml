	<brief_summary>Immunomodulating enteral nutrition in the perioperative period may reduce postoperative complications in cancer patients. Little is known if this effect translates to the better survival. The aim of study was to assess the impact of postoperative immunomodulating enteral nutrition on postoperative complications and survival of gastric cancer patients. The group of 98 gastric cancer patients were randomly assigned for postoperative immunomodulating enteral nutrition n=44 (Reconvan ,Fresenius Kabi), or standard enteral nutrition n=54 (Peptisorb, Nutricia). Postoperative complications, mortality, 6-month, 1-year and 5-year survival were analyzed.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment of gastric cancer often requires major surgery and carries the risk of postoperative complications and fatal outcomes. Mortality rates after gastrectomy due to gastric cancer have been reported as 2-5%, while the incidence of postoperative complications was 10 to over 40%. Immunomodulating enteral nutrition in the perioperative period may reduce postoperative complications in cancer patients. Little is known if this effect translates to the better survival. The aim of study was to assess the impact of postoperative immunomodulating enteral nutrition on postoperative complications and survival of gastric cancer patients. The group of 98 gastric cancer patients were randomly assigned for postoperative immunomodulating enteral nutrition n=44 or standard enteral nutrition n=54. Following the initial randomization, the patients received either standard nutrition (oligopeptide, low-fat, isocaloric, non-residue diet - Peptisorb, Nutricia) or immunomodulating nutrition (protein rich, isocaloric, no-residue diet including arginine, glutamines and omega-3 fatty acids - Reconvan, Fresenius Kabi). Postoperative complications, mortality, 6-month, 1-year and 5-year survival were analyzed.</detailed_description>
