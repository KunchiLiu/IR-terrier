	<brief_summary>Laboratory change induced by common bile duct (CBD) stone is in general observed as the higher elevation of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptideas (É¤-GT), in comparison to those of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). However, some patients with CBD stone show the marked increased level of aminotransferase, which sometimes leads to misdiagnose those as liver disease caused by viral hepatitis, ischemia, and drug toxicity. The aim of this study is to investigate the clinicopathologic features of patients with CBD stones with the high level of aminotransferase in serum.</brief_summary>
