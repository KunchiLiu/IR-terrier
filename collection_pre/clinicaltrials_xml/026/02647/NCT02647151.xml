	<brief_summary>Photodynamic therapy technique (PDT) is a conventional technique which is performed applying the product under occlusion lesions, let it incubate for 3 hours and then exposed skin to a light source, usually red. The conclusions of efficacy, tolerance and satisfaction that today are known about PDT with MAL, but not with ALA, which is a new photosensitizer indicated for Actinic Keratoses.

	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Treatment of Actinic Keratoses With Photodynamic Therapy Between MAL Cream and ALA Gel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intraindividual comparative study, to evaluate efficacy and safety of the treatment of actinic keratosis with photodynamic therapy between methyl aminolevulinate cream (MAL) and aminolevulinic acid nanosoma gel (ALA). MAL cream: is an antineoplastic agent used as a photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy (PDT). The mode of action of methyl aminolevulinate in PDT was shown in the pharmacodynamic (PD) studies. In the target cells,methyl aminolevulinate was converted to photoactive porphyrins, including protoporphyrinIX (PpIX), which are the active photosensitizers. Upon light activation, the photosensitizers give rise to the production of cytotoxic singlet oxygen species which destroy the target cells. ALA gel: Following topical application of 5-aminolaevulinic acid, the substance is metabolized to protoporphyrin IX, a photoactive compound which accumulates intracellularly in the treated actinic keratosis lesions. Protoporphyrin IX is activated by illumination with red light of a suitable wavelength and energy. In the presence of oxygen, reactive oxygen species are formed. The latter causes damage of cellular components and eventually destroys the target cells. Photodynamic therapy technique (PDT) is a conventional technique which is performed applying the product under occlusion lesions, let it incubate for 3 hours and then exposed skin to a light source, usually red. The conclusions of efficacy, tolerance and satisfaction that today are known about PDT with MAL, but not with ALA, which is a new photosensitizer indicated for QA. The pharmaceutical form of ALA is a gel, which gives a hypothetical better penetration and consequently it is more effectively.</detailed_description>
