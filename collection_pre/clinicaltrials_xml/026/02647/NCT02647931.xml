	<brief_summary>Muscle tension dysphagia is a novel diagnostic taxonomy describing a subset of patient population with reported dysphagia who exhibit normal oropharyngeal and esophageal swallowing function as evidenced by videofluoroscopic swallow study. These patients also demonstrate abnormal supraglottic muscle tension during laryngoscopy as well as signs of laryngeal hypersensitivity and laryngopharyngeal reflux. Treatment of these patients with Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) therapy is a common practice however voice therapy invention targeting the unloading of the supraglottic muscle tension has been shown to be highly effective in symptom resolution per the investigators' clinical experience. The study is designed to answer efficacy of treatment being offered to patients with muscle tension dysphagia.</brief_summary>
