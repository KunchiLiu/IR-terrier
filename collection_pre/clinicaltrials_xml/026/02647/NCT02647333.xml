	<brief_summary>In order to reduce cardiovascular risk, current European guidelines recommend a diet low on saturated fatty acid through replacement with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Polyunsaturated fatty acids can be classified into omega-3 and omega-6. However the results from recent meta-analyses investigating coronary risk outcomes did not clearly support a low intake of saturated fatty acids and a high intake of omega-3 or omega-6. The aim of this study is to investigate the short term effects of a high intake of PUFAs on microvascular function, lipids, inflammation and other cardiovascular risk factors in inactive patients with increased waistline.</brief_summary>
