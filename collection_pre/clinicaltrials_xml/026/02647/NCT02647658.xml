	<brief_summary>Low back pain (LBP) is a common problem among US adults. Initial episodes tend to be self-limited ("acute"), but some people can progress to a state of persistent pain. Often termed "chronic" LBP (cLBP), this condition can cause prolonged difficulty with most daily activities, including job performance. Most patients see chiropractors or primary care physicians (PCPs) for initial episodes of LBP. This study will compare two approaches for preventing patients with acute LBP (aLBP) from developing cLBP. Both treatments can be delivered in an outpatient PCP setting. The first approach is to provide PCPs with information regarding a patient's risk of transitioning from aLBP to cLBP and to encourage PCPs to treat patients according to accepted clinical guidelines. The second approach is to provide the same risk information and have PCPs team up with physical therapists to deliver psychologically-informed physical therapy (PIPT) for those patients determined to be at high risk for transitioning to cLBP. PIPT is designed to help patients identify and overcome physical and psychological barriers to recovery. The 3,000 patients expected to be recruited from five regional sites (Pittsburgh, PA; Boston, MA; Baltimore, MD; Charleston, SC; and Salt Lake City, UT) will start the study when their LBP is in an acute phase. The study's primary aims are to compare the proportions of cLBP and measures of functional ability between the two groups at 6 months. Secondary aims are to compare these outcomes between the two groups at 12 months and measure the number of low back-related x-rays, MRIs, surgeries, and other medical procedures during the follow-up period. The same outcomes will be assessed for an observational cohort of 9,000 patients with aLBP at low to medium risk for transitioning to cLBP across the 5 sites. This study was designed with input from a variety of national and local stakeholders, including patients with LBP, providers, payers, professional organizations, purchasers, and policy representatives.</brief_summary>
