	<brief_summary>The main aim of this study is to test in the Icelandic population the hypothesis that a nationwide treatment program which offers effective treatment to all known cases of Hepatitis C with the aim of halting HCV (Hepatitis C virus) transmission will lead to a reduction in incidence and disease burden associated with chronic HCV infection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment as Prevention for Hepatitis C in Iceland</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Iceland, a nationwide effort is planned where all patients with HCV infection will be offered treatment using direct acting antiviral agents. The aim of the initiative, besides offering cure to patients, is to substantially reduce domestic transmission of HCV and thereby lower the incidence. Ultimately, with these intense efforts the long-term complications of chronic HCV infection could potentially be nearly eliminated. In Iceland, there is mandatory reporting of all new cases of hepatitis C to the State Epidemiologist. In the study, short term and long term outcomes of this initiative will be investigated. In an initial treatment phase which will last for up to three years, all patients diagnosed with hepatitis C in Iceland will be offered treatment with direct acting antiviral agents. Virological response rate and compliance will be monitored. Long term, the incidence of HCV infection acquired in Iceland will be monitored for up to 15 years, and the incidence rates of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma due to HCV will be monitored for up to 15 years.</detailed_description>
