	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of administration of multiple ascending doses of KHK4083 and to select the highest dose tolerated by subjects with moderately active Ulcerative Colitis (UC) followed by a Long-term Extension Therapy (LTE) phase for eligible subjects with a clinical response.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of a Monoclonal Antibody KHK4083 in Moderate Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Phase 2, double-blind clinical study of multiple ascending doses of KHK4083 (or placebo) with an Long-term Extension Therapy (LTE) phase will be conducted in approximately 60 randomized adult subjects with moderately active UC who have a documented unsuccessful previous treatment. The Treatment Period includes double-blind Induction Therapy (12 weeks) and Open-label Therapy (OLE) phase phase (40 weeks) for eligible subjects at Week 12. Subjects already enrolled in the double-blind, long-term extension (LTE) under preceding versions of the protocol who worsen may be eligible to transition to the OLE up to Week 28. The Follow Up Period after the last administration will be for up to 16 weeks.</detailed_description>

Male and female subjects ≥ 18 years of age at the time of enrollment; 4. Subject has UC that was diagnosed at least 6 months prior to the Screening visit; 5. Subject has moderately active UC with a total Mayo score of 49 and an endoscopic subscore of at least 2, with disease that extends at least 15 cm from the anal verge; 6. Subject has had previous treatment (within 5 years prior to Screening) with one or more of the following: corticosteroids, immunosuppressive medications or TNF antagonist therapy that was unsuccessful because of a lack of efficacy response. 7. Female subjects (WOCBP) must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and Baseline. WOCBP must agree to use effective contraception; 8.

Two or more biologic treatments with different mechanisms of action (e.g., infliximab, vedolizumab and golimumab) or Three or more antiTNF biologics e.g. infliximab, adalimumab 4. Subject requires prescription treatment for UC, except for the stable, oral treatment of UC for 4 weeks prior to screening. 5. Subject has received any of the following prior treatments or treatments within the specified time prior to the Baseline visit: Natalizumab, efalizumab, rituximab or other lymphocytedepleting treatments, including but not limited, to alkylating agents (such as cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil) and total lymphoid irradiation at any time; TNF antagonists within 8 weeks, or 5 halflives (up to 12 weeks); Vedolizumab within 16 weeks; Methotrexate, cyclosporine, mycophenolate, tacrolimus, thalidomide, or other immune altering drugs within 4 weeks (ophthalmologic preparations are permitted); 5ASA enema, steroid enema or suppository use within 2 weeks ; and/or Investigational agents within 8 weeks or 5 halflives (whichever is longer). 6.
