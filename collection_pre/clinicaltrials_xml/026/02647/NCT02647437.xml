	<brief_summary>Levetiracetam (LEV: (S)-Î±-ethyl-2-oxo-pyrrolidine acetamide) is an anticonvulsant/antiepileptic drug. The specific aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of low-dose LEV in reducing hippocampal activity in schizophrenia. The investigators also hypothesize that LEV will improve neurocognition in patients with schizophrenia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Low-dose Levetiracetam on Clinical Symptoms, Cognition and Hippocampal Hyperactivity in Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>LEV is typically administered in twice-daily doses of 500-1500 mg for the treatment of epilepsy; these doses are generally well tolerated (Patsalos, 2000). Most relevant to the proposed study, LEV (125 mg twice-daily, two week administration) reduces hippocampal hyperactivity and improves cognition in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (Bakker et al., 2012). The proposed study will administer 125 mg of immediate release LEV twice-daily for two weeks. This dose was chosen to potentially maximize efficacy while minimizing side effects. The proposed dose is substantially lower than the most common dose used clinically for epilepsy treatment of 3000 mg/day.</detailed_description>
