	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to develop pilot data on the potential efficacy of computer-based cognitive training or the combination of computer-based cognitive training with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in improving cognitive function in persons with HIV-related mild neurocognitive disorder (MND). tDCS is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique in which a small direct current (1-2 mA) is applied to the scalp during a cognitive or motor activity, inducing a very small current that affects specific neural circuits related to the site at which electrodes are placed. tDCS has been judged safe and has shown significant treatment effects in studies with other populations, but has not been extensively studied in individuals with HIV infection. tDCS has been shown to facilitate learning in a number of studies, suggesting that it may improve or enhance learning in those with cognitive problems. As HIV infection is associated with decrements in a number of cognitive skills, including working memory, executive functions, and psychomotor speed that are related to individuals' functional status and medication adherence, the demonstration of a technique to enhance the effects of cognitive training in this population would have substantial clinical benefits as well as scientific value.</brief_summary>
