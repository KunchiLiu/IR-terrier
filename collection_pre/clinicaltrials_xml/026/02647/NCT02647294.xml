	<detailed_description>Patients with metabolic syndrome and Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) will be randomly allocated for the treatment with n-3 PUFA (3.6 g/day) or placebo for 12 months. At the beginning and at the end of the study basic clinical and anthropometric data will be recorded and the following parameters will be tested: panel of biochemistry and liver function tests: triglycerides, cholesterol, HDLcholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, glucose, insulin, serum bilirubin, liver tests, thyroid hormones, bile acids and their metabolites, albumin, total protein. Bioactive metabolites, Inflammatory markers Non-invasive serum markers of liver fibrosis and steatohepatitis. Hyaluronic acid, NAFLD fibrosis score, cytokeratine-18 fragments. Ultrasonography with non-invasive measurement of fibrosis and steatosis, magnetic resonance spectroscopy for visceral and liver fat determination.</detailed_description>
