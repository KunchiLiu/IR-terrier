	<brief_summary>In patients with type 2 diabetes, the incretin hormone glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) has lost its insulinotropic activity, but more so after continuous versus bolus administration. The design was a two-way crossover design comparing repeated bolus injection and continuous infusion of GIP under hyperglycaemic clamp conditions. Patients were age- gender- and weight-matched with type 2 diabetes, first degree relatives of such patients, and healthy subjects. Investigators performed a: 1. Oral glucose challenge; 2. hyperglycemic clamp (8.5 mmol/l) with two repeated GIP bolus administrations (50 pmol/kg body weight at 30 and 120 min); and 3. hyperglycemic clamp with continuous administration of GIP (2 pmol.kg-1.min-1 from 30-180 min). To answer the question, whether rapid tachyphylaxis occurs with regard to the insulinotropic action of GIP, investigators studied type 2-diabetic patients, their first-degree relatives, and healthy controls under hyperglycaemic clamp conditions with two GIP bolus injections 90 min apart, and compared this to a continued intravenous infusion of GIP.</brief_summary>
