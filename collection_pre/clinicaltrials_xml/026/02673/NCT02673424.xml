	<detailed_description>1. Study overview Prospective, open-label, randomized, multicenter trial to test the safety and efficacy of physiology- or imaging-guided PCI in patients with intermediate coronary stenosis. 2. Primary hypothesis Primary hypothesis is that the FFR-guided strategy will show significantly lower rates of patients-oriented composite outcomes at 24 months after index procedure, compared with IVUS-guided strategy in patients with intermediate coronary stenosis. 3. Study population 1300 patients derived from a population of Korean and China patients with stable angina and intermediate coronary stenosis in coronary angiography receiving percutaneous coronary intervention will be enrolled in the present trial. 4. Enrollment criteria 1. Inclusion Criteria - Subject must be ≥ 18 years - Subject is able to verbally confirm understandings of risks, benefits and treatment alternatives of receiving invasive physiologic or imaging evaluation and PCI and he/she or his/her legally authorized representative provides written informed consent prior to any study related procedure. - Patients suspected with stable angina, regardless of the results of non-invasive tests ④ Patients with intermediate stenosis in non-culprit vessel of acute coronary syndrome - De novo coronary lesion in a major coronary artery ⑥ Intermediate degree of stenosis (40-70% stenosis by visual estimation) eligible for stent implantation ⑦ Proximal to mid segment lesion in a major coronary artery ⑧ Target vessel size &gt; 2.5mm in visual estimation 2. Exclusion Criteria - The patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to any of the following medications: Heparin, Aspirin, Clopidogrel, Prasugrel, Ticagrelor, Biolimus, Everolimus, Zotarolimus, Contrast media (Patients with documented sensitivity to contrast media which can be effectively premedicated with steroids and diphenhydramine [e.g. rash] may be enrolled. Those with true anaphylaxis to prior contrast media, however, should not be enrolled.) - Culprit vessel of acute coronary syndrome will be excluded. ③ Patients with active pathologic bleeding - Gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding within the prior 3 months, or major surgery within 2 months. - Systemic (intravenous) Biolimus, everolimus, or zotarolimus use within 12 months. ⑥ Female of childbearing potential, unless a recent pregnancy test is negative, who possibly plan to become pregnant any time after enrollment into this study. - History of bleeding diathesis, known coagulopathy (including heparin-induced thrombocytopenia), or will refuse blood transfusions ⑧ Non-cardiac co-morbid conditions are present with life expectancy &lt;1 year or that may result in protocol non-compliance (per site investigator's medical judgment). ⑨ Target lesion located in coronary arterial bypass graft [5] Sample size calculation Sample Size Calculation Hypothesis: The FFR-guided strategy will show significantly lower rates of patients-oriented composite outcomes at 24 months after index procedure, compared with IVUS-guided strategy in patients with intermediate coronary stenosis. Based on the event rates of a previous trials evaluated FFR-guided PCI strategy (FAME I 2 year results)2 or meta-analysis compared IVUS-guided PCI versus angiography-guided PCI strategy6, we predicted the rates of patient-oriented composite outcomes (POCO) at 24 months after PCI to be 15% and 20%, respectively. • Primary endpoint: patient-oriented composite outcome (a composite of all-cause death, MI, any repeat revascularization) at 24 months after PCI • Design: Equality (two-sided test) • Sampling ratio: FFR-guided strategy : IVUS-guided strategy = 1:1 • Type I error (α): two-sided 2.5% • Accrual time : 2 years • Total time : 4 years (accrual 2 year + follow-up 2 years) • Assumption: POCO 15.0% vs. 20.0% in FFR or IVUS-guided strategy, respectively • Statistical power (1- β): 80% - Primary statistical method : Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with log-rank test - Potential withdrawal rates : total 2% Based on the above assumption, expected number of events are 222. We would need total 1,300 patients (650 patients in each group) with consideration of withdrawal rates.</detailed_description>
