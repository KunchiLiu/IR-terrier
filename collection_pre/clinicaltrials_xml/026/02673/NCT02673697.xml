	<brief_summary>Prospective, randomized, stratified non blinded multi-center, international, post market trial assessed in a non-inferiority study. A minimum of 1234 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 60 worldwide investigational sites where the device is commercially available. The primary objective of this trial is to test the safety and efficacy of Perceval versus standard sutured stented bioprosthetic aortic valves among the intended trial population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perceval Sutureless Implant Versus Standard-Aortic Valve Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PERSIST-AVR is designed to collect data on sutureless valve (Perceval sutureless aortic heart valve), a new type of biological aortic valve, comparing data with standard biological aortic valve, considered the gold standard for aortic valve replacement. This prospective, randomized international multicenter study is planned to demonstrate, as primary endpoint, the non inferiority of Major Adverse Cardiac and Cerebrovascular (MACCE) events at one year while showing superiority in resource consumptions at hospital discharge in patients treated with Perceval valve when compared to standard aortic valve replacement. The study is planned to cover the lack of prospective, randomized comparison data between sutureless valve and standard aortic biological sutured valve. To achieve the primary endpoint, 1234 patients will be recruited in 60 worldwide investigational sites. The be part of the trial, investigational sites should have demonstrated experience with the implantation of the Perceval and able to implement the requirements of the study protocol.. All subjects with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis or steno-insufficiency who are candidates for surgical replacement of their native aortic valve according to established guidelines in current medical practice and as specified in the Perceval valve Instruction for Use (IFU) are the intended population for inclusion in this randomized trial. The patients will be followed for 5 years after the implant, the total duration of study including the enrollment time will be 7 years</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. The subject has an indication for treatment by valve replacement with a bioprosthesis according to the IFU, through either full sternotomy or ministernotomy. 2. The subject has aortic valve disease that can be treated with a commercially available Perceval valve size, based on preoperative CTscan. 3. The subject has: 1. critical aortic valve area defined as an initial aortic valve area of â‰¤1.0 cm2 or aortic valve area index &lt; 0.6 cm2/m2 AND 2. Mean gradient &gt; 40 mmHg or Vmax &gt; 4 m/sec by resting echocardiogram or simultaneous pressure recordings at cardiac catheterization [or with dobutamine stress, if subject has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;55%] or velocity ratio &lt; 0.25; 4. The subject is symptomatic due to aortic stenosis with functional class of New York Heart Association (NYHA) II or higher. 5. The subject has signed the informed consent. 6. The subject is of legal minimum age. 7. The subject will be available for postoperative followup beyond one year. 1. The subject has a contraindication for treatment by the Perceval valve or by a bioprosthetic aortic valve as stated in the IFU. 2. The subject has aneurismal dilation or dissection of the ascending aortic wall. 3. The subject is scheduled for concomitant procedures other than Coronary Aortic Bypass Graft (CABG), myectomy with or without aortic annulus enlargement 4. The subject has congenital bicuspid (i.e. Sievers type 0) or unicuspid aortic valve. 5. Anatomical structures not suitable for Perceval valve such as: aortic root enlargement, where the ratio between the diameter of the sinotubular junction and the annulus diameter is &gt; 1.3. 6. The subject has a prosthetic heart valve in any position, including mitral valve repair. 7. The subject has a stroke or myocardial infarction (STEMI and NSTEMI) within 30 days prior to the planned valve implant surgery. 8. The subject has active endocarditis, myocarditis, or sepsis. 9. The subject is in cardiogenic shock manifested by low cardiac output and needing hemodynamic support. 10. The subject is allergic to nickel alloys. 11. The subject is already included in another clinical trial that could confound the results of this clinical investigation.</criteria>
