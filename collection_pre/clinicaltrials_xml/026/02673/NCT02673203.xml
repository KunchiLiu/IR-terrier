	<brief_title>Investigation Into the Effects of Blood Glucose Levels Upon Eating Behavior in Lean and Obese Non-diabetic and Diabetic Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate the effect of blood glucose levels on eating behavior in a population of patients with diabetes in a free-living environment; the investigators plan to study 15 lean healthy control subjects (BMI &lt;25 kg/m2), 15 obese non-diabetic subjects (BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2), 15 T2DM subjects who will be age and BMI-matched to obese, non-diabetic subjects, and 15 T1DM subjects who will be age and BMI matched to control, non-diabetic subjects. The participants who qualify will be invited to use the CGMS (DEXCOM G4 Platinum) for up to 7 days. On the visit for placement of the CGMS: 1) the participants will be explained by one of the study physicians how to use a glucometer (FreeStyle or Accu-Check), 2) they will have the CGMS inserted under the skin, and 3) they will be instructed how to fill up the food log (informational brochures are available at the end of the protocol. On the second visit (up to 7 days after the initial visit) the CGMS will be removed from the skin and the glucose meter and food log will be returned to the investigators.</detailed_description>
