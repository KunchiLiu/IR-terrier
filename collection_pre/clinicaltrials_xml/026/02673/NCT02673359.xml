	<brief_title>Vaginal Progesterone Versus Cervical Cerclage for Pregnant Women With Short Cervix and History of PTL and/or MTM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women with singleton pregnancy and history of preterm labor and/or midtrimester miscarriage in a previous pregnancy will be selected for serial assessment of the cervical length by transvaginal sonography (TVS) starting from 16 weeks till 24 weeks of gestation. Eligible participants in our study will be those who have cervical length of 15-25 mm at 16-24 weeks of gestation. At 16-24 weeks gestational age, all women participating in the study will be randomly allocated into two groups; progesterone group and cerclage group. For women in the progesterone group, vaginal progesterone suppositories will be given in a dose of 400 mg/day. For women in the cerclage group, McDonald cervical cerclage will be performed.</detailed_description>
