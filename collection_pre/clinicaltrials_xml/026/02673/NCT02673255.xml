	<brief_summary>Many plasma donation centers have Tetanus immunization programs that are implemented in order to collect plasma with high levels of tetanus antibodies. The immunization program requires participants to receive multiple tetanus vaccinations over a period of time with the goal of hyper-immunizing them to tetanus. Their antibody-rich plasma is then used to manufacture a tetanus immunoglobulin product which helps with the prophylaxis and treatment of tetanus disease. The Tetanus vaccine previously used for these programs is no longer being manufactured. Therefore, we must evaluate the safety and efficacy of a different vaccine when used for this purpose. The only other FDA approved Tetanus vaccines currently available for adults in the US are combination vaccines that also immunize against Diphtheria and/or Pertussis. In this study, the investigators will evaluate two vaccines that are combinations of Tetanus and Diphtheria (Td). Investigators will not evaluate any vaccines containing Pertussis antigen. The vaccines to be evaluated are manufactured by MassBiologics and Sanofi Pasteur (Tenivac). The package insert for these vaccines indicates they should be administered to previously vaccinated people once every 10 years. However, this study will evaluate whether they are safe and effective for dosing every 90 days. The investigators hypothesize that at least 25% of study subjects will have a positive response to at least one of the five planned doses. Each vaccine will be evaluated separately.</brief_summary>
