	<brief_title>Progressive Muscle Relaxation Effect on Sleep Quality, Depression and Stress in People With Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction: Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, autoimmune disease, characterized by demyelination and neurodegeneration of the central nervous system. The progressive course of this disease may cause individuals to develop extreme dependency and create serious difficulties both to the individuals themselves and family members and caregivers, since the disease brings a number of physical, emotional, psychological and social symptoms. Therefore, it is essential to offer healthcare practices that go beyond the usually fragmenting, dehumanized care services that focus on the disease bodily processes. Objective: Evaluate the effects of Progressive Muscle Relaxation on sleep quality and on stress and depression levels of individuals with multiple sclerosis. Methodology: This is randomized clinical test. The sample was made up of 40 individuals with multiple sclerosis (20 in control group and 20 in the experimental group) in outpatient follow-up. The progressive muscle relaxation technique was employed. In order to collect the data, we adopted the interview with form filling technique, using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Perceived Stress Scale and Beck Depression Inventory. Blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate of experimental group were measured before and after the progressive muscle relaxation intervention. In order to treat statistical data, we used Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 19.0.</detailed_description>
