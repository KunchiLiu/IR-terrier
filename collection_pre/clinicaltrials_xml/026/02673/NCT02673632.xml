	<brief_title>The Influence of AMH on Ovarian Responsiveness to Ovulation Induction With GnRH in Women With PCOS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a correlation between high levels of AMH and the severity of PCOS. Excessive AMH may have a negative effect on the sensitivity of the resting follicles to gonadotropins. This is an observational prospective study to investigate the impact of circulating AMH on gonadotrophin induction in women with PCOS.</detailed_description>
