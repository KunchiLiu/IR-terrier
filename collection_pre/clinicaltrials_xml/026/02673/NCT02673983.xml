	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of the FTRD System for Obtaining Full-thickness Intestinal Biopsies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Functional intestinal disorders are a common problem and diagnosis is a challenge to clinicians. Several motility disorders are caused by pathological changes in the neuromuscular network in the intestinal wall. To obtain a diagnosis a full-thickness biopsy is required. At present, this kind of biopsy is usually obtained by a laparoscopic surgical procedure, requiring full anesthesia, operating room and several days of postoperative care in the hospital. Today, there is lacking a more minimal invasive approach for obtaining full-thickness biopsies from the gastrointestinal tract. A new device has been developed called full-thickness resection device (FTRD), which has proved useful and safe from removing polyps in the gastrointestinal tract (Schmidt A Endoscopy 47;8, 719-725). The specific aims of this study is to determine if FTRD safe for obtaining full-thickness biopsies form the gastrointestinal tract and whether these FTRD biopsies be used for clinical diagnosis of patients with suspected intestinal motility disorders. If these aims can be achieved FTRD would be of potential great value for patients and health care in the management of patients with gastrointestinal disorders. 40 patients will be included, i.e. 10 patients will undergo FTRD biopsy in the sigmoid colon, distal ileum, jejunum and duodenum. Patients will undergo the biopsy procedure under conscious sedation at the Endoscopy Unit in Malm√∂, Region Skane and stay one night at the hospital to detect any complications. A venous blood sample will be taken before and 24 hours after the biopsy for examination of systemic inflammatory changes. All biopsies will examined by an expert in neuromuscular pathology.</detailed_description>
