	<brief_summary>Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT) is an effective therapy for acute leukemia, but relapse remains an important problem. Therapy options for relapse include stopping immune suppression, re-induction of chemotherapy, donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), and another transplantation used alone or in combination. However, the efﬁcacy of these interventions is limited. One approach to the relapse problem is to intervene before hematologic or pathologic relapse occurs based on minimal residual disease (MRD). In this study, the efficacy of MRD-directed DLI on transplantation outcomes will be evaluated in patients with acute leukemia receiving allo-HSCT.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT) is an effective therapy for acute leukemia, but relapse remains an important problem. Therapy options for relapse include stopping immune suppression, re-induction of chemotherapy, donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), and another transplantation used alone or in combination. However, the efﬁcacy of these interventions is limited. One approach to the relapse problem is to intervene before hematologic or pathologic relapse occurs based on minimal residual disease (MRD) using immune or molecular techniques.DLI is an effective post-transplantation therapy for prophylaxis of leukemia relapse, but is associated with a substantial risk of GVHD. Whether MRD-directed DLI could improve outcomes remains unclear. In this study, the efficacy of MRD-directed DLI on transplantation outcomes will be evaluated in patients with acute leukemia receiving allo-HSCT.</detailed_description>
