	<brief_summary>This study evaluates MBC-11 (a conjugate of a bone-targeting vehicle (etidronate) and a cytostatic agent [ara-C] in patients with malignant tumors with CIBD. This is a first use in human.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial of MBC-11 in Patients With CIBD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A standard "3+3" dose escalation design to determine Maximum Tolerated Dose with consecutive different dose level cohort recruitment. The following dose levels to be investigated: 0.5 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg, 5.0 mg/kg, 10 mg/kgm 20 mg/kg. The study for each patient consists of 14-days screening period, single dose administration of MBC-11 followed by 7-day safety monitoring and then 2 cycles of multiple use of MBC-11 (28 days each cycle, study drug is administered at Days1-5). In case of partial metabolic reaction/stable metabolic reaction therapy maybe prolonged up to 4 cycles (at investigator and sponsor consideration)</detailed_description>
