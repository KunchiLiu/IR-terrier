	<brief_summary>Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) pathways include multiple evidence-based interventions delivered throughout the peri-operative period that aim to attenuate the surgical stress response and support rapid physiologic and functional recovery.A key element of the ERAS pathway is the administration of a clear carbohydrate-rich beverage 2-3 h before surgery in order to keep the patient in a fed state rather than a fasted state when they go to the operating room. The aim of the current study is to investigate the impact of a drink containing simple carbohydrate on attenuating surgical stress induced insulin resistance in patients undergoing major laparoscopic abdominal surgery, compared to drinks containing maltodextrin.</brief_summary>
