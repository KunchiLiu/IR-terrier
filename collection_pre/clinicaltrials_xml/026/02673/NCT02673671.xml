	<brief_summary>A feasibility study for assessing and recording myoelectric activity in patients for early detection of a post-operative ileus (POI) in patients who undergo gastrointestinal surgery and differentiating the myoelectric signals from those who have normal post-operative return of GI function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>G-Tech Feasibility Study for Early Detection of a Post-op Ileus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Group 1: Up to 100 subjects may be consented prior to surgery who are planned to undergo gastrointestinal surgery or a planned surgery that does not involve the abdominal cavity. The post-operative course will be assessed for both clinical symptoms and for myoelectric activity for return to normal GI function or the development of a POI in both populations. Group 2: Up to 50 subjects who have undergone gastrointestinal surgery or surgery not involving the abdominal cavity may be consented post-operatively during their hospital stay for this study.</detailed_description>
