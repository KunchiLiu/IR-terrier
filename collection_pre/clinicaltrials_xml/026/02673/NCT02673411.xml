	<brief_title>Ultrasonography SWE for Hepatic Fibrosis Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatic fibrosis causes liver dysfunction and HCC. Since hepatic fibrosis is reversible dynamic condition, its monitoring is important to predict long term outcome and to determine treatment plan. The reference of standard to diagnose hepatic fibrosis is biopsy, but recently non-invasive method such as stiffness imaging has been drawing a lot of attention. In this study, ultrasound shear wave elastography will be performed and its diagnostic performance to detect advanced hepatic fibrosis (= &gt; F2) will be measured using histologic grade as a reference.</detailed_description>
