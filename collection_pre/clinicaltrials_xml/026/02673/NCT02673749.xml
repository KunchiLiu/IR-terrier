	<brief_title>Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability Study of RP-G28 in Subjects With Lactose Intolerance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lactose intolerance is a common gastrointestinal (GI) disorder that develops in lactose maldigesters when consuming lactose or when lactose is added to a previously low-lactose diet. Lactose intolerance is characterized by one or more of the cardinal symptoms that follow the ingestion of lactose-containing foods. These symptoms include; abdominal pain, cramping, bloating, flatulence [gas] and diarrhea. As such, most lactose intolerant individuals avoid the ingestion of milk and dairy products, while others substitute non-lactose containing products in their diet. Currently, there are no approved treatments for this condition. Based on the health implications from insufficient calcium intake over a lifetime, including increased risk of osteoporosis and hypertension, there is need in the medical community for a tolerable and convenient treatment that allows for all levels of milk and dairy product consumption in people suffering from mild to severe lactose intolerance. Study Objective: To access efficacy of two RP-G28 dosing regimes on symptoms related to lactose intolerance relative to placebo after 30 days of treatment. The 30 day post-treatment phase will further evaluate the treatment's potential to prolong relief from symptoms. Study Design: The participants will take about 60 days to complete the study. The study consists of 3 distinct phases: Screening, a 30-day Treatment Phase, and a 30-day Post-Treatment Phase (off study treatment observation period). A participant will need to visit the clinical only 6 times throughout the study.</detailed_description>
