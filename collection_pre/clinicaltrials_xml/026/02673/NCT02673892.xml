	<brief_summary>Improving the patient experience has become a major focus of quality improvement efforts in Ontario and in health systems worldwide. However, our existing knowledge base is relatively under-developed, particularly in how patients experience care as they transition from one care setting to another and the relationship between patient experience and clinical outcomes. The Patient Oriented Discharge Summary (PODS) is a discharge instruction tool created by patients, caregivers, health-care providers and design experts. It provides a written template for providers to engage patients and caregivers when reviewing important instructions on medications, activity and diet restrictions, follow-up appointments and worrisome symptoms warranting emergency care following admission to hospital. The PODS also uses plain and simple wording, large fonts, pictograms, and includes white space for patients to take notes and provides the option for translation of major headings into the most common spoken languages. The PODS impact study will study the impact of using the PODS versus usual discharge instructions on patient experience and health outcomes in a provincial-wide randomized study across acute care and rehabilitation hospitals.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patient Oriented Discharge Summary Impact Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Full Title: The impact of a patient-centered discharge summary (PODS) on patient experience and health outcomes following discharge: A multicenter randomized controlled trial. Short Title: PODS Impact Study Primary Objective: To evaluate the impact of a patient-centered discharge instruction tool on patient experience following hospital discharge. Primary Outcome Measures: Patient experience within 72 hours following discharge from hospital. This will be a binary composite of the proportion of patients who scored Yes or "Completely/Quite a Bit" to 4 out of 6 of the Canadian Institute of Health Information (CIHI) Patient Experience In-Patient Survey on transitions of care. Secondary Objectives: 1) Evaluate the impact of a patient-centered discharge instruction tool on health outcomes following hospital discharge. 2) Identify the level of patient and system engagement needed when providing discharge instructions and patient-specific characteristics that might impact the use and effectiveness of discharge instructions. Secondary Outcome Measures: Self-reported adherence to medications, diet and activity restrictions, and scheduled visits with primary care physician and/or specialist at 30 days following discharge, and a composite of unscheduled visits to primary care physician, emergency room, readmission to hospital or death at 30 days and 3 months following discharge. Study Design: The study will use a mixed methods approach with a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and qualitative study. Inclusion Criteria: All patients (&gt;=18 years) admitted to inpatient units at University Health Network (UHN) (and other participating hospitals in Ontario) with a primary diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, stroke, congestive heart failure, post hip and knee replacement will be recruited for randomization to receive the PODS versus standard of discharge care. These diseases were chosen to align with the Ministry of Health and Long Term Care (MOHLTC) quality based procedures. Exclusion Criteria: Patients who are being discharged to another facility rather than home, who have a prognosis of less than 3 months, who do not have a telephone for post-discharge follow-up or with cognitive impairment or significant language barrier for whom a family member or professional interpreter is not available will be excluded from the study. Intervention: The patient-oriented discharge summary (PODS) is a discharge instruction tool co-created with patients which provides a written template for providers to engage patients and caregivers when reviewing discharge instructions on medications, activity and diet restrictions, follow-up appointments or outstanding investigations and worrisome symptoms warranting emergency care (Appendix A). The PODS also uses plain and simple wording, large fonts, pictograms, and includes white space for patients to take notes and provides the option for translation of major headings into the most common spoken languages. As this will be a pragmatic design, we may make modifications to the process involved in completing the PODS, such as using pre-filled disease-specific information, if system processes and providers involved deem it more usable and feasible. Sample Size: We estimate that we will require at minimum 199 and at maximum 388 patients in each study arm if we want to detect a 10% minimum improvement in patient experience scores. Currently, we have study centers that would like to participate in Toronto, Ottawa and Thunder Bay. Accrual Period: Enrollment for this study will begin once ethics approval is obtained and continue until 776 patients have been enrolled (in total across all participating sites). Study Duration: The study is expected to run between December 1, 2015 and March 31, 2018 (approximately 3 years) following research ethics board (REB) approval. This will allow for a year of study enrollment across participating sites until sample size is achieved as well as 3 months of follow-up for primary and secondary endpoints and a year for data analysis and manuscript preparation.</detailed_description>
