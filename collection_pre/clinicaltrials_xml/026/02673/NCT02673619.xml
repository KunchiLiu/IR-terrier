	<brief_summary>Umeclidinium (UMEC) is a potent pan-active long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA). It is anticipated that topical administration of UMEC will block stimulation of muscarinic receptors, thereby reducing the overproduction of sweat in subjects who suffer from hyperhidrosis. This study will assess the clinical effect, pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of topically applied UMEC following once daily topical administration, for 28 days, to the palms, in subjects with primary palmar hyperhidrosis. The study will also investigate if topically applied UMEC, at the highest possible concentration, will decrease palmar hyperhidrosis with a systemic anticholinergic adverse event profile similar to or below that observed with inhaled administration. This is a double blind (Sponsor unblind), repeat dose, randomized, parallel group, placebo controlled study. Study will enrol up to 55 subjects.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female subjects between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent may be considered for enrolment. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative urine human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) test), not lactating, and at least one of the following conditions applies: Nonreproductive potential defined as, Premenopausal females with one of the following: Documented tubal ligation or Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with followup confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion or Hysterectomy or Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy OR Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels consistent with menopause]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrolment. Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the options listed in the Modified List of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of Reproductive Potential (FRP) from 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication and for 30 days after the last dose of study medication and completion of the followup visit. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception. The subject has a HDSS score of 3 or 4. The subject has a diagnosis of primary, palmar hyperhidrosis, defined as excessive, palmar sweating of at least 6 months duration without apparent cause and with at least one of the following characteristics: Positive family history of hyperhidrosis or Hyperhidrosis is bilateral and relatively symmetrical or First episode of hyperhidrosis before 25 years of age or Cessation of focal sweating during sleep. The subject has a Baseline/Day 1 gravimetric assessment of at least 150 mg sweat produced at rest, during a period of 5 minutes separately for each palm. (Measurements can be repeated up to two times on two different days, screening and/or Baseline/Day 1 visits, but subjects need to qualify on at least one occasion for each palm.) The subject agrees to avoid to use nicotinecontaining products (including nicotine patches) during the treatment period The subject is capable of giving signed informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and in protocol The subject has an unstable or life threatening cardiac disease such as: Myocardial infarction or unstable angina in the last 6 months or Unstable or life threatening cardiac arrhythmia requiring intervention in the last 3 months or New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV heart failure The subject has a diagnosis of Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, or is receiving treatment for control of blood glucose levels. The subject has a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, as confirmed by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), or is receiving treatment for hyperthyroidism. The subject has a diagnosis of narrowangle glaucoma, urinary retention, prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction that in the opinion of the study Investigator or Medical Monitor would prevent use of an anticholinergic. The subject has irritation or active infection of palm area, including sweat glands. The subject has a current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones that the Investigator deems clinically insignificant) The subject has an ALT&gt;2xUpper limit of normal (ULN) and bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%) at screening. The subject has QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) &gt; 450 milli second (msec) or QTc &gt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block. The QTc according to Bazett's formula (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF), and/or another method, machineread or manually overread The specific formula that will be used to determine eligibility and discontinuation for an individual subject should be determined prior to initiation of the study. In other words, several different formulae cannot be used to calculate the QTc for an individual subject and then the lowest QTc value used to include or discontinue the subject from the trial. For purposes of data analysis, QTcB, QTcF, another QT correction formula, or a composite of available values of QTc will be used as specified in the Reporting and Analysis Plan (RAP). The subject has a history of allergy or hypersensitivity to anticholinergic/muscarinic receptor antagonist or any ingredient of the preparation. The subject has had a prior surgical procedure for palmar hyperhidrosis. The subject has had treatment with radiofrequency and/or microwave devices for palmar hyperhidrosis The subject has had botulinum toxin injections for palmar hyperhidrosis in the last year prior to Baseline/Day 1 The subject has had treatment with iontophoresis for palmar hyperhidrosis within 4 weeks prior to Baseline/Day 1 The subject used antiperspirant on the palms within 2 weeks of the Baseline/Day 1 The subject is a menopausal female who has had symptoms of menopause such as sweating or flushing within 3 years of Baseline/Day 1 The subject has used any prohibited medication within the indicated washout period The subject tested positive for any of the following at screening or within 3 months of the first scheduled dose of study medication: Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and Hepatitis C antibody. The subject has a positive prestudy drug and/or alcohol test at screening The subject has a positive test for Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody at screening. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time periods prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer). This does not apply to UMEC when a subject who participated in the 1.85% cohort participates in the 1.15% cohort The subject has had exposure to more than four investigational medicinal products within 12 months prior to the first dosing day. The subject has any other condition which, in the judgment of the Investigator, would put the subject at unacceptable risk from participation in the study (e.g., subjects with renal failure). The subject has clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory values which, according to the Investigator, would put the subject at undue risk due to study participation. The subject has abnormal findings on screening ECG deemed clinically significant by the Investigator. The subject is pregnant or lactating or is planning on becoming pregnant during the study.</criteria>
