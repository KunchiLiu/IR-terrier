	<brief_title>Autologous Tumor Tissue Antigen-sensitized DC-CIK Cells Combined With Chemotherapy for Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>60 patients of esophageal cancer with TNM stage of tumor stage II-III,who had received surgery and kept their tumor tissue, will be randomly divided into group A (receive cancer tissue antigen sensitized D-CIK immune cells in combination with chemotherapy treatment) or group B (just receive chemotherapy), and the randomize ratio will be 1:1. Patients in group A will receive 3 cycles of autologous antigen-sensitized DC-CIK cells treatment (every 4 weeks) and chemotherapy. Patients in group B will receive only 3 cycles chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
