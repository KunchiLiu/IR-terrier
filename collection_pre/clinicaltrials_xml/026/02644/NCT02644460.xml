	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I clinical trial evaluating abemaciclib (LY2835219), an inhibitor of cyclin dependent-kinases 4 and 6 (Cdk 4/6) in children and young adults with newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) (Stratum A) and in relapsed/refractory/progressive malignant brain (Grade III/IV, including DIPG; MBT) and solid tumor (ST) patients (Stratum B).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Abemaciclib in Children With DIPG or Recurrent/Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stratum A- Appropriate dose RT will be administered in 30-33 fractions over approximately 6 weeks for Stratum A patients. Treatment with abemaciclib (LY2835219) will start on the same day as RT and continue twice daily during and after RT for a maximum treatment duration of 2 years. Investigators plan to treat a maximum of 4 cohorts of research participants (dosage levels 1, 2, 3, and 4) with escalating doses of abemaciclib (LY2835219) starting with dose level 1 (80% of adult dose). A cycle is defined as 28 days and the first 6 weeks of therapy will constitute the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)-evaluation period. Participants must take abemaciclib by mouth as intact capsules. Stratum B - Abemaciclib (LY2835219) will be administered orally on a twice daily basis continuously for 28 days, which defines one cycle. The maximum treatment duration will be 2 years. Investigators plan to treat a maximum of 4 cohorts of research participants (dosage levels 1, 2, 3, and 4) with escalating doses of abemaciclib starting with dose level 1 (80% of adult dose). Dose escalation will be independent of Stratum A escalation. A cycle is defined as 28 days and the first 4 weeks of therapy will constitute the DLT-evaluation period. Participants must take abemaciclib by mouth as intact capsules.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria All Participants: 1. Age must be ≥ 2 and &lt; 21 years 2. BSA ≥ 0.5 m2 3. Must have measurable or evaluable disease 4. Diagnosis of DIPG (Stratum A), or recurrent/refractory/progressive MBT (WHO Grade III/IV) or ST, including neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, malignant rhabdoid tumor and osteosarcoma (Stratum B). 5. Lansky (for participants ≤ 16 years) or Karnofsky (for participants &gt; 16 years) performance score ≥ 40 at the time of study enrollment 6. Adequate organ function at the time of study enrollment as follows: 7. Bone marrow: ANC ≥ 1,000/μL, platelet count ≥ 75,000/μL (transfusion independent meaning not having had platelet transfusion for 7 days prior to enrollment), hemoglobin concentration ≥ 8g/dL (may be transfused). Participants with bone marrow involvement are eligible but not evaluable for hematologic toxicity. 8. Renal: Normal serum creatinine concentration 9. Hepatic: Total bilirubin concentration &lt; 1.5x the institutional upper limit of normal for age; SGPT &lt; 3x the institutional upper limit of normal 10. Female research participants of childbearing potential (age 10 or greater) must not be pregnant as confirmed by a serum or urine pregnancy test and confirmed within 1 week of start of treatment. Participants must not be breastfeeding. 11. Males or females of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use two effective contraceptive methods. Abstinence in a nonsexually active child will be sufficient birth control. Inclusion Criteria Stratum A Newly Diagnosed DIPG 1. Diagnosis of DIPG or highgrade glioma originating from the brainstem 2. Participants have had no previous treatment except corticosteroid use. 3. Participants are able to take abemaciclib as intact capsules by mouth. Inclusion Criteria Stratum B Recurrent/refractory/progressive MBT (including DIPG) or ST 1. Participants must have radiologic evidence of recurrent, refractory or progressive malignant brain tumor or solid tumor 2. Participants must be able to swallow capsules. 3. Participants with neurological deficits should have deficits that are stable for a minimum of 1 week prior to registration. 4. Participants who are on dexamethasone must be on a stable or decreasing dose for at least one week prior to registration. 5. Participants must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to entering this study. 6. Myelosuppressive chemotherapy: Participants must have received their last dose of known myelosuppressive anticancer chemotherapy at least 21 days prior to study registration or at least six weeks if nitrosourea. At least two weeks must have lapsed if participants received lower dose oral etoposide (50 mg/m2) without experiencing evidence of myelosuppression (i.e. neutropenia or requiring transfusion with blood products) 7. Biologic agent: Participants must have recovered from any toxicity potentially related to the agent and received their last dose of the biologic agent ≥ 7 days prior to study registration. 8. Monoclonal antibody treatment: At least three halflives must have elapsed prior to registration. 9. Radiation: Participant has received radiation therapy prior to study registration. Participants must have had their last fraction of local irradiation to the primary tumor ≥ 3 months prior to registration, their last fraction of craniospinal irradiation (&gt;24Gy) or total body irradiation &gt; 3 months prior to registration. Participant has not received focal irradiation for symptomatic metastatic sites within 14 days prior to registration. 10. Bone Marrow Transplant: Participant must be ≥ 3 months since high dose chemotherapy and peripheral blood stem cell rescue prior to registration. 11. Growth factors: Participants must be off all colony forming growth factors(s) for at least 1 week prior to registration (filgrastim, sargramostim, erythropoietin) and at least 2 weeks for longacting formulations (e.g. neupogen). 1. Uncontrolled infection 2. Prior history of QTc prolongation or QTcF &gt; 450 ms on screening ECG. 3. Any concomitant significant medical illness that cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy, or that would impair the evaluation of side effects related to this treatment, alter drug metabolism or the tolerance to this treatment 4. Receiving any other anticancer or investigational drug therapy 5. Prior therapy with abemaciclib</criteria>
