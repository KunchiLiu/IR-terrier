	<brief_summary>Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a prominent cause of delayed graft function(DGF) after kidney transplantation. Reactive oxygen species play a crucial role in I/R injury. Edaravone is a synthetic radical scavenger that has been used in acute stroke. Some animal experiments have revealed its beneficial effects against I/R injury, our goal is therefore to investigate the effectiveness of a recipient pretreatment with Edaravone at reducing the occurrence of DGF after kidney transplantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Edaravone on the Ischemia-Reperfusion(I/R) Injury in Kidney Transplantation Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive Edaravone or control (0.9 %Sodium Chloride Solution,0.9%NaCl). The randomization sequence will be computer-generated, and randomization will be performed in blocks and will be stratified according to participating center.Edaravone and 0.9 %NaCl solution will be treated at 10 minutes before kidney reperfusion, ending in 30 minutes. The number of dialysis and the serum creatinine level within the first week after the transplantation will be recorded. The participation of each patient is scheduled for 1 month.</detailed_description>
