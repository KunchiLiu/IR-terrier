	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of VX-984 administered alone and in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and preliminary evidence of efficacy of VX-984 in combination with PLD in subjects with advanced solid tumors</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects (male and female for Part A and female for Part B) will be at least 18 year of age. Part A Subjects with histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant advanced solid tumors, who have progressed on at least 1 prior chemotherapy, and for whom either 1. No standard care available 2. PLD at the dose and schedule being used might be considered standard of care Part B 1. Subjects with histologically confirmed advanced primary endometrial cancer (locally advanced and incurable endometrial cancer that has been treated with surgery and/or radiation or is ineligible for such treatment), or recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer, and 2. Completed 1 line of chemotherapy treatment with a platinumcontaining regimen in the advanced setting Measurable disease according to RECIST criteria (Version 1.1) Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks Hematological and biochemical indices within acceptable ranges shown at screening. Normal left ventricular ejection fraction on screening assessed by transthoracic echocardiogram or multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) scan Previous radiotherapy (unless brachytherapy), endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, or exposure to investigational medicinal products during the 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas and MitomycinC) or 4 drug halflives before the planned administration of the first dose of study drug, whichever is greater. Previous immunotherapy during the 4 weeks before the planned administration of the first dose of study drug. For Part B only: 1. Subjects with uterine carcinosarcoma 2. Prior anthracycline therapy 3. More than 1 prior chemotherapy regimen (a subject who received first line carboplatin and taxane and then receives the same taxane second line will be considered to have had 1 prior chemotherapy regimen) Unresolved toxicity of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 2 or greater from previous anticancer therapy or radiotherapy History of spinal cord compression or brain metastases, unless asymptomatic, treated, stable, and not requiring treatment with steroids for at least 4 weeks before the planned administration of the first dose of study drug. Any history of leptomeningeal metastases. Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating at Screening, or plan to become pregnant while on study or within 6 months after the last dose of study drug Female subjects of childbearing potential must adhere to contraception guidelines as outlined in the protocol. Female subjects will be considered to be of nonchildbearing potential if they have undergone surgical hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or have been amenorrheic for more than 2 years with a screening serum folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) level within the laboratory's reference range for postmenopausal females Male subjects with pregnant or lactating partners or partners who plan to become pregnant while on study or within 6 months after the planned administration of the last dose of study drug Major surgery â‰¤4 weeks before first dose of study drug, or incomplete recovery from a prior major surgical procedure Cardiac conditions Prior bone marrow transplant Extensive radiotherapy (to greater than 15% of bone marrow) Any other condition that in the investigator's opinion would not make the subject a good candidate for the clinical study, Part B: Current active malignancies of other types, with the exception of adequately treated conebiopsied in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri and basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Prior cancer in remission for 2 years or more would not be excluded.</criteria>
