	<brief_summary>For patients requiring the heart valve replacement surgery, heart function is injured in different degree.Thus, minimizing the impact of the anesthesia drug on the cardiovascular system has important clinical meanings. Etomidate has slight effect on the cardiovascular system, often used in the induction of anesthesia, however target controlled infusion etomidate in maintenance of anesthesia is less used. So, the trial is designed to observe the application value of TCI etomidate in thoracoscopic mitral valve replacement surgery.</brief_summary>
