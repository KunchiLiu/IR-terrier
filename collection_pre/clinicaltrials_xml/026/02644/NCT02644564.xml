	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine whether the introduction of early ultrasonography screening will change the diagnostic spectrum of soft tissue shoulder injuries in patients aged forty years or more. We also want to study whether certain physical tests will be able to predict or rule out full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff (shoulder tendons) in the acute phase. Another purpose is to explore the course of soft tissue shoulder injuries over a year, as well as to compare the results to studies on the prevalence of rotator cuff full-thickness tears.</brief_summary>
