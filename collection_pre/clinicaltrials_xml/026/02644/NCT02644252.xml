	<brief_summary>There is a need for improving the effect of first-line chemotherapy for lung cancer patients, preferably by using an approach with none or very few side effects. In this trial the investigators incorporate δ-tocotrienol/placebo as a nutritional supplement on top of standard chemotherapy for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
