	<brief_summary>This study evaluates whether PegIFN alfa-2a add on can improve CHB patients HBsAg clearance at the end of 48 weeks treatment. The CHB patients who received nucleot(s)ides anti-virus treatment and reached HBV DNA&lt;1000 copies/ml and HBsAg&lt;3000 IU/ml, were randomly assigned into two groups: One group continue the nucleot(s)ides treatment for 72 weeks, the other add on PegIFN alfa-2a on the basis of the original treatment for 48 weeks, and follow up for 24 weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Addition of PegIFN Alfa-2a to CHB Patients Treated With Nucleot(s)Ides</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>nucleot(s)ides is a potent inhibitor of hepatitis B viral(HBV) replication, but long-term therapy may be required, and it is difficult for CHB patients to achieve HBsAg clearance by using nucleot(s)ides. Therefore, it is need take long-term therapy if chronic hepatitis B (CHB) choose to use nucleot(s)ides, and in another way, nucleot(s)ides resistance is an important clinical risk. More and more young patients want to stop treating, and discontinuation of nucleot(s)ides is a feasible strategy to reduce resistance. However, it is really easy to relapse if patients did not arrive HBsAg clearance. PegIFN alfa-2a can clear HBV by direct anti-viral and immune regulation mechanisms including enhancing natural killer cell response, increased cluster of differentiation 8(CD8 +) T lymphocytes and other mechanisms to restore and enhance the immune response in patients with CHB; and what's more, patients are safety after discontinuing.</detailed_description>
