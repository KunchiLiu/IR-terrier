	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that DMF can improve mitochondrial function in the brain of people with MS. The investigators will assess mitochondrial function in the cerebral grey matter by measuring PCr and ATP by 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and NAA in NAWM by 1H MRS.</brief_summary>
