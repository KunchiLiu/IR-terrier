	<brief_summary>The current commonly used for distal gastri cancer in gastrointestinal anastomosis is Roux-en-Y. However, the complications after Roux-en-Y reach an incidence of over 30% which involve nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension. The underlying mechanism might be the result of interruption of intestine peristalsis. In 2013, Kim reported total laparoscopic uncut Roux-en-Y anastomosis could reduce Roux stasis syndrome incidence by keeping the continuity of jejunum. In September 2014, we carried out this operation in 30 cases in our centre. Our previous results showed that this operation had a low postoperative complication and short hospitalization time, indicating uncut Roux-en-Y anastomosis might be a safe procedure. However, some limitations are noticed. The report from South Korea is a retrospective study and the evaluation of QOL is certain subjective. Here, we aimed to perform the first randomized controlled clinical study on uncut Roux-en-Y anastomosis to improve QOL of patients after laparoscopic distal gastrectomy.</brief_summary>

The primary aim is to determine whether uncut Roux-en-Y anastomosis improve the quality of life of patients after laparoscopic distal gastrectomy.</detailed_description>
