	<brief_title>Effect of Different Body Position on Intraabdominal Pressure in Mechanically Ventilated Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each set of measurements of intraabdominal pressure included intra bladder and intragastric pressure in the supine position followed by the semi-recumbent position at head of bed 30. All four measurements were taken over a period of 5 to 10 min or less to reduce the possibility of changes in intraabdominal pressure over time. Three sets of readings were taken at least 4 h apart over a 24-h period.</detailed_description>
