	<brief_title>Motivational Interviewing for Smoking Cessation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: • To compare the effectiveness of motivational interviewing versus brief advice by conducting a randomized controlled trial in General Practice Setting in China. OUTLINE: This is a randomized controlled study. Patients are randomized to either the intervention arm or the control arm. • Arm I (intervention): Patients will be given a 20 minutes personal talk in the family physician's office during the visit. The family physicians will determine the stage of change in smoking cessation (precontemplative, contemplative, action, maintenance and relapse) and use the motivational interviewing skills during the talk. The motivational interviewing skills include expressing empathy, developing discrepancy, rolling with resistance, supporting self efficacy. Up to six phone calls will be given to the patients during the follow-up, using the motivational interviewing skill. • Arm II (control): Patients will receive brief advice for smoking cessation, lasting approximately 5 minutes. The risks of smoking and the advantages of quitting will be explained. The information provided during the talk will be standardized. No phone call will be given during the follow-up.</detailed_description>
