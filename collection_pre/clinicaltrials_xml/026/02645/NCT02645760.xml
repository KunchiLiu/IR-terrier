	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Core Stabilization Exercise in Patients With Subacute Non-Specific Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is to compare the effectiveness of Core stabilization exercise and physical therapy on pain intensity at rest, functional disability, lumbar movement and ability to perform repositioning tasks (joint position sense) in patients with subacute non-specific low back pain. There are 2 groups receiving 2 different kinds of intervention: treatment group receiving core stabilization exercise (CSE) and control group receiving physical therapy including therapeutic ultrasound and hydrocollator pack. Each intervention will perform for 7 weeks. The patients will assess for all outcome measures at baseline, 7 weeks of intervention, and 1- month follow-up</detailed_description>
