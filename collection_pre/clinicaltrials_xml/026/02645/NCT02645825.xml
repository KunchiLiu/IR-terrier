	<brief_summary>Investigators need to establish a formal diagnostic of superficial adenopathy through complementary investigations to find etiologic diagnostic ( Echography, adenogram). Echography examination should be a guide to take in charge the adenopathy and to predict presence of malignant (primitive) or benin (reactional) character of adenopathy. The aim of this study is to codify the management of adenopathic patient with a diagnostic in 48 hours after examination. This fast diagnostic helps to prevent unnecessary biopsy, to avoid wasting time in case of a serious pathology.</brief_summary>
