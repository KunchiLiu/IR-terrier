	<brief_summary>The objective was to compare the effects of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) combined with sensory cueing (SC), rTMS alone, and conventional rehabilitation on reducing unilateral neglect (UN) and improving hemiplegic arm functions and performance of activities of daily living (ADL). Sixty subacute patients with left UN after right-hemispheric stroke were randomly assigned to three groups; rTMS combined with SC, rTMS alone, and conventional rehabilitation. rTMS at 1 Hz was applied over P5 of the contralesional hemisphere while vibration cueing was emitted using a wristwatch device on the hemiplegic arm, five days per week for two weeks. The first two groups received the same dosage of conventional rehabilitation on top of their experimental interventions. Blinded assessments were administered at baseline, 2 weeks postintervention, and four-week follow-up upon completion of training.</brief_summary>
