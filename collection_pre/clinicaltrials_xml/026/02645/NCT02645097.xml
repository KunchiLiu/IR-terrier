	<brief_summary>This research is being done to compare two different saphenous nerve block locations and will help to determine which site best maintains knee strength and pain control.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ideal Anatomic Location for Saphenous Nerve Blocks: A Prospective Clinical Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized, observer blinded clinical trial comparing motor strength in knee extension between two sets of patients, one receiving a proximal thigh block of the saphenous nerve and one receiving a distal thigh block of the saphenous nerve. The secondary objectives are to compare the pain relief and quality of life of participants in these two groups.</detailed_description>
