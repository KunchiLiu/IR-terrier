	<brief_summary>Background: Direct anterior approach to the hip (DAA) is being considered as one of the most promising minimally-invasive approaches in total hip arthroplasty (THA). Purpose of this study is to analyse influence of learning curve on clinical and radiographic outcome in direct anterior approach (DAA) for total hip replacement. Methods: The first 30 patients operated with DAA (group B) were compared to 39 patients operated by Hardinge approach (group A). Peri-and postoperative complications, Harris Hip Score (HHS), implant positioning, experienced pain and patient satisfaction were evaluated at a mean follow-up of 32 months.</brief_summary>
