	<brief_summary>Cervical spine manipulation has been found to be effective in patients with mechanical neck pain. Discrepancies exist on the side of manipulation and the placebo effect of this manual intervention. In addition, some authors have proposed that spinal manipulation can alter proprioception of the cervical spine. The aim of this study will be to investigate the effects of cervical spine manipulation on pain, disability, widespread pressure pain sensitivity, and cervicokinethesia in patients with mechanical neck pain.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cervical spine manipulation has been found to be effective in patients with mechanical neck pain. Discrepancies exist on the side of manipulation and the placebo effect of this manual intervention. In addition, some authors have proposed that spinal manipulation can alter proprioception of the cervical spine. The aim of this study will be to investigate the effects of cervical spine manipulation on pain, disability and cervicokinethesia in patients with mechanical neck pain. Patients will receive cervical spine manipulation in either right or left side of the neck and will be assessed on pain intensity, neck-related disability, widespread pressure pain sensitivity, and cervicokinethesia by an assessor blinded to the allocation group.</detailed_description>
