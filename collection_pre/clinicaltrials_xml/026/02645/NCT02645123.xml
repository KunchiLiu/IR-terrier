	<brief_summary>Introduction: patients with chronic back pain as a result of degenerated disc disease, besides pain also present with impaired gait. The purpose of this study is to evaluate both the clinical data using clinical rating scales, such as Oswestry Disability Index Greek version (ODI), Numerical Pain Rating Scale for low back pain and leg pain (NPRS) and the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire Greek Version, and kinetic and kinematic characteristics during gait analysis in patients with chronic low back pain as a result of the degenerated disc disease (Disc Degenerative Disease), before and after application of manual therapy techniques. Methodology: for the purposes of the study, 75 patients suffering from chronic low back pain were randomly divided into 3 groups of 25 each. Each group received five sessions with the first group receiving manual therapy treatment (spinal mobilisation), the second a sham treatment and the third, classic physiotherapy (stretching exercises, TENS and massage). To evaluate the effectiveness of each treatment, the visual analog pain scale, two questionnaires (Oswestry and Roland Morris) and also an optoelectronic system for recording and analysis of gait (kinetic and kinematic data) were utilized.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This was a randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of spinal mobilization with other physiotherapy interventions (stretching, TENS application and Swedish type massage) and sham treatment in a group of chronic low back pain patients. The outcome measures included three dimensional gait analysis (kinetic and kinematic data) as well as clinical indicators (numerical pain rating scale, Oswestry disability index, Roland-Moris Disability questionnaire).</detailed_description>
