	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to determine the effects of an innovative child-friendly remind-to-move treatment (RTM) treatment by comparing it with constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) on upper extremity outcomes in children with hemiplegic Cerebral Palsy. In an evaluator-blinded randomized controlled trial, 73 children, among of whom 20 in Manual Ability Classification System level I, 38 level II, and 15 level III, were recruited from 3 special schools and randomized to receive 75-hour RTM (n=25) and CIMT (n=24) programme over 15-weekdays, and conventional treatment (n=24). The primary outcomes were Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test (JTHFT) and Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOTMP-II) Subtest 3 for assessing the motor efficiency at baseline, posttest, and 1- and 3-month follow-up.</brief_summary>
