	<brief_title>Comparison of Circulating Tumor DNA and Tumor Tissue DNA by Targeted Sequencing in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies have shown the feasibility of detecting mutation status by circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, no clinical standard method has been established, and most previous studies were lack of prospective clinical data and aimed at advanced NSCLC. We plan to perform a prospective study including consecutive cases of NSCLC patients who underwent surgical treatments. Primary tumor and plasma samples were collected in each patients and gene mutation analysis were performed immediately after surgery. We utilized the targeted DNA sequencing with a next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform to detect driver somatic mutations in matched tumor DNA (tDNA) and plasma ctDNA samples with matched white blood cell (WBC) DNA as a control. A panel of genes were identified.</detailed_description>
