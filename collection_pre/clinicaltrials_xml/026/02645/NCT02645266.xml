	<brief_summary>Diabetic Macular Edema is a serious ocular consequence of poorly controlled diabetes. Even though significant research has been done to clarify the pathogenesis of DME, a clear causal pathway of the complication is of yet undetermined. However, there is some consensus among researchers that a cascade of inflammatory markers plays an important role in the disease process. Here we hope to better delineate the role these inflammatory markers play by investigating whether basal levels predict response or lack thereof to Aflibercept.</brief_summary>
