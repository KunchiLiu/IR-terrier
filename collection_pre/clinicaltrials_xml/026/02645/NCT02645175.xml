	<brief_title>Evaluate the Safety Profile and Ability of TW1025 Oral Solution to Decrease Fatigue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study population designed to be enrolled is patients with histologically and/or cytologically confirmed breast cancer with clinical evidence of recurrent or progressive HER2-negative metastatic disease and planning to begin a chemotherapy regimen of physician's choice for HER2-negative MBC who have evidence of fatigue. An add-on study design to assess the superiority of TW1025 over placebo will be utilized in this study to evaluate whether TW1025 can decrease fatigue in patients with fatigue. The study will be conducted as a double-blind, randomized trial.</detailed_description>
