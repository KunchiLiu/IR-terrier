	<brief_summary>Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is the chief component of the spice turmeric and is derived from the rhizome of the East Indian plant Curcuma longa. Curcuma longais a member of the Zingiberacae (ginger) family of botanicals and is a perennial plant that is native to Southeast Asia. Turmeric contains a class of compounds known as the curcuminoids, comprised of curcumin, demethoxy curcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Anti-inflammatory mechanisms implicated in the anticarcinogenic potential of curcumin include: (1) inhibition of NF-ÎºB and COX-2 (increased levels of COX-2 are associated with many cancer types); (2)inhibition of arachidonic acid metabolism via lipoxygenase and scavenging of free radicals generated in this pathway; (3) decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a, resulting in growth inhibition of cancer cell lines; and (4) down-regulation of enzymes, such as protein kinase C, that mediate inflammation and tumor-cell proliferation. Curcumin's potent anti-oxidant and free-radical quenching properties play an important role in the inhibitory effects of the compound on the initial stages of carcinogenesis. Antioxidants are implicated in the pathogenesis of OSMF and hence this preparation may be helpful in resolution of this lesion.</detailed_description>
