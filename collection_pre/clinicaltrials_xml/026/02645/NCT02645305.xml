	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the name for a collection of lung diseases including chronic bronchitis, emphysema and chronic obstructive airways disease. People with COPD have difficulties breathing, primarily due to the narrowing of their airways, this is called airflow obstruction. Some preclinical evaluations showed that COPD is closely related to chronic inflammation; therefore, this study aimed to use adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) in the form of non-expanded culture - that usually names as a stromal vascular fraction (SVF) in combination with activated platelet rich plasma (PRP) to treat this disease. Both SVF and PRP are autologous sources that obtained from adipose tissue and peripheral blood, respectively. This mixture is intravenously transfused into the patients.</brief_summary>
