	<brief_summary>Ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of death and disability in developed countries and is responsible for a third of deaths in persons over 35 years . The most severe form of ischemic heart disease is sudden death and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). There is evidence that early and optimal treatment of ACS decreases mortality. Within the optimal treatment, these patients must receive a reperfusion therapy as mechanical or pharmacologic treatment. In addition to reperfusion treatment, antiplatelet therapy is a central part of the management. Aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor have been shown to decrease mortality. In our country, clopidogrel is the more accessible and used P2Y12 inhibitor; however, it has been shown to have a wide variability in response and this variability could be influenced by different pharmacological, genetic and environmental factors. Platelet reactivity measured by aggregometry predicts major cardiovascular events in ACS patients treated with clopidogrel. Due to their frequent prescription, generic clopidogrel efficacy must be evaluated. The purpose of this study is to compare the platelet reactivity in patients with ACS receiving clopidogrel generic versus patent.</brief_summary>
