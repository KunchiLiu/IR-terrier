	<brief_summary>Delirium is one of the most common complications among elderly hospitalized patients, postoperative patients and patients on intensive care units. The reported prevalence is between 11 and 80 %. Delirium is associated with a high morbidity and threefold higher 6-month mortality. The Nursing-Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC) is a screening tool with a high sensitivity and specificity. The purpose of this study is to translate the Nu-DESC to danish and evaluate afterwards its feasibility and understanding by different medical staff. Material and methods: The Nu-DESC will be translated after International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) guidelines to Danish by permission of the original author. The evaluation will be performed, by filling out evaluation forms, where the feasibility and understanding will be rated on a 6 step Likert scale.</brief_summary>
