	<brief_summary>Selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) is a well-recognized way to lower eye pressure in treatment of glaucoma. This treatment is performed for 180 degrees or 360 degrees, and studies at academic centers have shown mixed results when comparing the success rates of 180 degrees or 360 degrees. Both protocols are now typically done by comprehensive ophthalmologists. However, there is no data that compares success rates of 180 degrees and 360 degrees in the community setting.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>180 Degree vs. 360 Degree Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty as Initial Therapy for Glaucoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed as a prospective evaluation of the two treatment algorithms for SLT by measuring intraocular pressure (IOP) after treatment. The hypothesis is that 360 degrees of SLT will produce a greater reduction in IOP than 180 degrees of SLT at 3 months follow up.</detailed_description>
