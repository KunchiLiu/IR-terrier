	<brief_summary>Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) at the macula originates from hyperfluorescence from retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and blockage of hyperfluorescence by macular pigment. Investigators evaluate whether presence of FAF may correlate to the postoperative visual outcome for epiretinal membrane.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fundus Autofluorescence After Vitrectomy for Epiretinal Membrane</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>92 eyes with epiretinal membrane were performed vitreous surgery, epiretinal membrane removal and internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling. Presence of hyperfluorescence in FAF at the macular area and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was evaluated preoperatively and at postoperative 1, 3, and 6 months with ultra-wide angle imaging.</detailed_description>
