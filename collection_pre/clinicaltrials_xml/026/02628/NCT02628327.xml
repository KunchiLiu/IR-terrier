	<brief_title>Factors Influencing Patient Satisfaction in a Glaucoma Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective study aims to recruit up to 250 patients being seen by glaucoma specialists at Wills Eye Hospital. Informed consent will be obtained prior to the office visit. Patients will complete a satisfaction survey with a few additional questions about themselves and their vision. Electronic health records (EHR) will be used to collect race, gender, age, glaucoma diagnosis, current and prior treatments, timing of appointment and care, visual acuity and field data, and distance to patient's home. Additional information captured will include weather, time of day, day of week. In addition to completing the questionnaire subjects will be asked to provide their name and date of birth. Trained research staff members will use this information to find patients on the EHR system. A research assistant will later abstract information from the patient's EHR. This information will be tagged to the survey by a unique identifier, but all patient identity related information will be removed, including name and date of birth. Patients will be made aware that research staff will be retrieving their protected health information (PHI) for the purpose of this study through the consent form.</detailed_description>
