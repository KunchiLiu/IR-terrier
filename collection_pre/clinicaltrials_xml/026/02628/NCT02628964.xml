	<brief_title>Electronic Cigarettes (E-cigarettes) as a Harm Reduction Strategy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study will be a two-arm, randomized controlled trial. The investigator will randomize 40 participants into each intervention arm. Participants will be randomized to one of the two arms: e-cigarettes with nicotine cartridges or e-cigarettes with placebo cartridges (0mg). Participants and research assistants will be blind to the allocation of nicotine or placebo e-cigarettes as there are no difference in appearance or odor of the mist emitted from the e-cigarettes with and without nicotine containing cartridges. Participants will be asked to track their nicotine use via text message. All participants will receive a 20-30 minute behavioral counseling consultation with a trained tobacco counselor. Counselors will review each participant's smoking pattern and offer tailored behavioral and environmental change strategies including specific smoking reduction strategy options. Participants will be given a supply of e-cigarettes and followed for 3 weeks</detailed_description>
