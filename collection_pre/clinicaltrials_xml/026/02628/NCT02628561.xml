	<brief_title>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Associate to Constraint Induced Movement Therapy Over Premotor Cortex in Severe Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke survivors experience one or more movement-related impairments and activity limitations. In this sense, the premotor cortex (PMC) can be considered as an alternative locus for post-stroke rehabilitation. In relation to physical rehabilitation protocols, associate to neuromodulation, the investigators have chosen a standardized physical therapy protocol for this study, the Constraint Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT), which presents evidence of good therapeutic results. The investigators hypothesized that applying tDCS and CIMT over the PMC promotes motor restoration in stroke patients.</detailed_description>
