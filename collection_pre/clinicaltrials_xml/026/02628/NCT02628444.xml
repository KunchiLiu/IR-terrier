	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to assess the safety of the primary series vaccine schedules and the booster vaccination Primary Objectives: - To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the immune response elicited against each dengue serotype by tetravalent CYD vaccine given as a 2 dose schedule (Placebo 1/CYD Dengue vaccine group) compared to the immune response elicited by CYD vaccine given as a 3 dose schedule (CYD Dengue vaccine group) 28 days post-final vaccination. - To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the immune response elicited against each dengue serotype by tetravalent CYD vaccine given as a 1 dose schedule (Placebo 2/CYD Dengue vaccine group) compared to the immune response elicited by CYD vaccine given as a 3 dose schedule (CYD Dengue vaccine group) 28 days post final vaccination. - To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the immune response elicited against each dengue serotype 28 days after administration of a single booster dose of tetravalent CYD vaccine Secondary Objectives: - To demonstrate the superiority of the immune response elicited by tetravalent CYD vaccine given as a 2 dose schedule (Placebo 1/CYD Dengue vaccine group) compared to the immune response elicited by CYD vaccine given as a 3 dose schedule (CYD Dengue vaccine group) 28 days post-final vaccination. - To demonstrate the superiority of the immune response elicited by tetravalent CYD vaccine given as a 1 dose schedule (Placebo 2/CYD Dengue vaccine group) compared to the immune response elicited by CYD vaccine given as a 3 dose schedule (CYD Dengue vaccine group) 28 days post-final vaccination. - To describe the neutralizing antibody levels of each dengue serotype at 28 days post Dose 3 to the Ab levels immediately before receiving booster injection in all 3 CYD vaccination groups. - To describe the neutralizing antibody levels of each dengue serotype at 28 days post-dose 2 and 28 days post-dose 3 from CYD Dengue vaccine group in a primary series schedule. - To demonstrate the superiority of the immune response elicited against each dengue serotype 28 days after administration of a single booster dose of tetravalent CYD vaccine. - To evaluate the safety profile of CYD vaccine after each and any injection</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunogenicity and Safety of 3-Dose and Booster Dose of Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine in Healthy Subjects 9 to 50 Years of Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy subjects between age 9 and 50 year will receive in various schedules of CYD vaccine and placebo administration over a 12-month period. They will be further randomized to receive a single booster vaccination of CYD vaccine at either 12 months or 24 months following the last primary series injection.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Aged 9 to 50 years on the day of enrollment Subject in good health, based on medical history and physical examination Assent form or informed consent form (ICF) has been signed and dated by the subject (based on local regulations), and ICF has been signed and dated by the parent(s) or another legally acceptable representative (and by an independent witness if required by local regulations) Subject and parent(s)/legally acceptable representative(s) able to attend all scheduled visits and to comply with all trial procedures. Subject is pregnant, or lactating, or of childbearing potential (to be considered of nonchildbearing potential, a female must be premenarche, surgically sterile, or using an effective method of contraception or abstinence from at least 4 weeks prior to the first vaccination until at least 4 weeks after the last vaccination) Participation at the time of study enrollment (or in the 4 weeks preceding the first trial vaccination) or planned participation during the present trial period in another clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device or medical procedure Selfreported or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy such as anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the preceding 6 months; or longterm systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months) Selfreported systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a lifethreatening reaction to the vaccine used in the trial or to a vaccine containing any of the same substances Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, is at a stage where it might interfere with trial conduct or completion Receipt of blood or bloodderived products in the past 3 months, which might interfere with assessment of the immune response Planned receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks following any trial vaccination Previous vaccination against dengue disease with either the trial vaccine or another vaccine Deprived of freedom by an administrative or court order, or in an emergency setting, or hospitalized involuntarily Current alcohol abuse or drug addiction that, based on investigator's judgment, may interfere with the subject´s ability to comply with trial procedures. Identified as a site employee of the Investigator, with direct involvement in the proposed study or other studies under the direction of that Investigator or study center, as well as family members (i.e. ,immediate, husband, wife, and their children, adopted or natural) of the employees or the Investigator A prospective subject must not be included in the study until the following conditions and/or symptoms are resolved: Febrile illness (temperature ≥ 38.0°C) or moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to Investigator's judgment) on the day of vaccination. Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding the first trial vaccination.</criteria>
