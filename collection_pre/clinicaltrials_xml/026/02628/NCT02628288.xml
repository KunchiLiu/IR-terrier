	<brief_summary>Comparison of healing responses after treatment of complex bifurcation lesions with a dedicated bifurcation device (Axxess™ Biolimus Eluting Coronary Bifurcation Stent System + Absorb BVS in the distal branches) versus the Modified T stenting technique using Absorb BVS: an optical coherence tomography (OCT) analysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>COmplex Bifurcation PCI: AXXESS Device + Absorb BVS, vs Modified T Stenting With Absorb BVS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective single center randomized clinical trial with baseline OCT and clinical, angiographic and OCT follow-up at thirty months. Patients with true and complex coronary bifurcation lesions are randomly assigned to treatment with the dedicated Axxess biolimus-eluting bifurcation stent in the proximal main vessel (MV) and additional Absorb everolimus-eluting BVS in the branches versus a modified T technique using Absorb BVS only. The primary endpoint is changes in minimal luminal area assessed with OCT from baseline to 30 months in pre-specified bifurcation segments. The main aims are to assess acute performance and to compare long-term vessel healing with optical coherence tomography, and clinical and angiographic outcome after treatment of complex bifurcation lesions with a dedicated stent with additional Absorb Bioabsorbable scaffolds (BVS) versus a modified T stenting technique with Absorb BVS.</detailed_description>

Pregnant and/or breastfeeding females or females who intend to become pregnant (pregnancy test required) 6. Patients with a life expectancy of less than three years 7. Patient currently enrolled in other investigational device or drug trial of which the primary endpoint timing has not been reached and potentially interferes with the outcome of either of both trials 8. Patient not able or willing to adhere to followup visits 9. Patients who intend to have a major surgical intervention within 12 months of enrolment in the study. 10. Patients who previously participated in this study. 11. Subject has experienced an acute myocardial infarction 72 hours prior to the index procedure, as defined either by the presence of a new Qwave in 2 or more contiguous leads, or by a CK greater than two times site upper reference limit (URL) with presence of creatine KinaseMB ( CKMB) greater than the site URL. 12. Creatinine Kinase (CK) greater than two times URL with presence of CKMB greater than the site URL at the time of procedure. 13. The subject has suffered a stroke or transient ischemic neurological attack or cerebrovascular accident within the past six months, or has any known intracranial mass, arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm or other intracranial pathology 14. The subject has experienced a significant gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleed within the past six months, or has had any active bleeding within two months. 15. The subject is taking warfarin or NOAC, will need to take warfarin or novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC) post procedure, or has an international normalised ratio (INR) &gt; 1.4. 16. Planned revascularization within 1 year after index procedure. 17. The target vessel contains intraluminal thrombus. 18. The target lesion is located in the left main coronary artery 19. Lesion of the left main trunk &gt; 50%, unprotected 20. The subject has another lesion within the target vessel parent or side branch requiring treatment besides the bifurcation lesion 21. The subject has had prior PCI to the target lesion, including a 5mm zone proximal and distal to the lesion 22. The target lesion shows angiographic evidence of severe calcification or tortuosity.</criteria>
