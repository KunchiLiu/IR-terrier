	<brief_title>Impact of Cashew Nuts in the Human Diet: Measured Energy Value and Effects on Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The cardioprotective effects of nuts have been well documented in the scientific literature; however, most of the research has been done with almonds, walnuts, and pistachios, while studies with cashew nuts are lacking. In addition to the cardiovascular literature, our recent studies measuring the metabolizable energy of nuts have demonstrated that the measured energy value of almonds, pistachios, and walnuts is lower than that predicted using the Atwater factors. However, the measured energy value of cashew nuts is unknown. There are two distinct aims of this study - determining the effects of cashew nut consumption on risk factors of CVD, and determining the energy value of cashew nuts in the human diet. The cardiovascular effects of cashew nuts will be determined by measuring both traditional and emerging risk factors. The metabolizable energy value of cashew nuts will be calculated based on the chemical composition and energy content of the consumed diet and excreta. This will provide a better estimate of the energy value than simply calculating energy value based on Atwater factors.</detailed_description>
