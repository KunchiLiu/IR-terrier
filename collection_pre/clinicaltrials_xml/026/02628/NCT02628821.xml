	<brief_summary>Prospective observational study of SNIPPV use in preterm infants of less than 32weeks of gestation from January 2012 to December 2015. Previous respiratory status is analyzed as well as respiratory outcomes and possible secondary side effects. SNIPPV is used to prevent Intubation in Infants in which nCPAP has already failed (Infants that met intubation criteria) and also is used electively for extubation when nCPAP extubation has previously failed or infants with Prolonged mechanical ventilation (more than 15 days) with high respiratory parameters (PMAP &gt; 10 cmH2O and FiO2&gt;35%).</brief_summary>
