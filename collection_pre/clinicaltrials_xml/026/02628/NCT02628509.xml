	<brief_title>Von Willebrand Factor As a Biological Sensor of Blood Flow in Percutaneous Cardiac Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was designed to understand the Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) abnormalities observed in association with implantation of different devices in cardiovascular diseases (percutaneous valve replacement and circulatory support devices). The main objective of the study was to describe the time-course of VWF abnormalities onset/offset during implantation of devices in cardiovascular diseases. Adult patients &gt; 18 years who need a CF-LVAD or trans-aortic valve implantation are included in this cohort; Blood samples are obtained just before procedures</detailed_description>
