	<brief_summary>The therapy of photofrin PDT was effective in improving life quality of patients with advanced esophageal and/or gastric cardiac cancer and the time optimizing for employing laser irradiation was of great importance.The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and adverse effects of Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) on esophageal and/or gastric cardiac cancer during different time after inject photofrin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study of Time Optimizing of Endoscopic Photodynamic Therapy on Esophageal and/or Gastric Cardiac Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators plan to recruit the patients who were pathologically confirmed with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma or gastric cardia adenocarcinoma from the Oct.2015. The patients will be divided into two groups. Group 1: Following intravenous administration of photofrin at dose of 2 mg/kg.b.w. as the photosensitizer, 630 nm laser irradiation (DIOMED) with 400 mW/cm was applied on each part of tumor for 750 seconds through cylinder diffusing quartz fibers localizing in the biopsy channel of a flexible endoscope at 24th. Group 2: Following intravenous administration of photofrin at dose of 2 mg/kg.b.w. as the photosensitizer, 630 nm laser irradiation (DIOMED) with 400 mW/cm was applied on each part of tumor for 750 seconds through cylinder diffusing quartz fibers localizing in the biopsy channel of a flexible endoscope at 48th.</detailed_description>
