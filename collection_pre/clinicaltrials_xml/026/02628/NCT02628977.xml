	<brief_title>Sleep Health Education and Social Support Among Blacks With OSA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which disproportionately affects blacks (31% vs. 10%, whites), is a critical, preventable and/or treatable disease potentially causing increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes (e.g., obesity, diabetes, hypertension, stroke, arrhythmia, and chronic heart failure). Improving sleep may have direct effects in reducing CVD risk,2 enhancing brain functions, and increasing workplace productivity. Unfortunately, our focus groups suggest that most at-risk blacks are unaware of OSA symptoms or its related morbidity. Thus, it is imperative to address poor adherence among blacks with OSA, if we are to reduce health disparities associated with CVD outcomes between blacks and whites. This is a randomized study with a total of 6 sites recruiting; 3 will serve as controls and 3 that will be intervention. Group A participants (Intervention group) will receive health education from a trained Peer Health Educator and Group B participants (Control group) will meet with a salon worker, barbershop worker, or church Health Ministry group leader. Participants will be asked to use a sleep diary and wear a home sleep test device to measure sleep for 7 days. They will be followed for 12 months.</detailed_description>
