	<brief_title>Blood Glucose Variability and Insulin Action During Menstrual Cycle in Females With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is a chronic disease that leads to disability and premature death if not well treated. While females and males are equally affected by T1D, diabetes places additional burdens of care on females. Characteristically, females with T1D have worse glycemic control, a higher incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis, and a greater risk of cardiovascular complications as compared to their male peers. It has been hypothesized that variations in responsiveness to pre-meal bolus doses of insulin during menstrual cycling is an important underlying cause for increased management problems in females with T1D, but the hypothesis has not been adequately tested. Consequently, insulin treatment of females during the different cycles of menstruation remains a guessing game that often results in major swings in blood glucose from high to low levels. The unfavorable impact of this gap in knowledge extends to the efficiency and accuracy of artificial pancreas closed-loop (CL) system insulin delivery algorithms designed based on insulin action parameters. The proposed study addresses this unmet need in diabetes management for females both in open-loop (OL) and CL therapies.</detailed_description>

Subjects ages 2135y on combination oral contraceptive pills (OCP) could be included. 1. irregular periods, 2. pregnant, breastfeeding, 3. subjects&gt;20y on progesterone only pills or injections, 4. Likelihood of requiring treatment during the study period with drugs not permitted by the study protocol, 5. mental condition rendering the subject unable to understand the nature, scope and possible consequences of the study, including blood glucose monitoring requirements including the documentation of blood glucose data and insulin dosing,and/or inability to return for followup visits, and unlikely to complete the study. 6. Subjects on OCP will be excluded in the 1220y group to capture the physiologic variability in insulin action during pubertal progress.</criteria>
