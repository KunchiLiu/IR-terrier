	<brief_summary>The aim of this Phase I/II study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dendritic cells(DC) combined with cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells in patients with advanced esophagus cancer. Experimental recombinant adenovirus coded mRNA including MUC1 and Survivin that transfected DC, which are used for DC-based immunotherapy. Based on the results of our previously performed preclinical study with DC vaccine combined with CIK cells, the researcher plan to perform the clinical trial.</brief_summary>
