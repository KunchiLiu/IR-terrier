	<brief_summary>Currently the management of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is mainly based on symptomatic treatments. The arrival of children in day hospital, every 2 to 3 months, is for many of them and those around them, stressful, rarely expressed, but noticeable by the care team. In line with the recommendations of the High Authority of Health, the multidisciplinary team of Resources and Skills Centre for Cystic Fibrosis (CRCM) Pediatric of Nantes University Hospital offers a therapeutic education program tailored to the needs of children with cystic fibrosis and their families . The aim is to support children and parents in the acquisition of self-care skills (knowledge and skills) and coping skills, such as managing stress and emotions . Our goal is to demonstrate that art therapy, mobilizing coping skills of the child, facilitates its expressive capabilities and reduces anxiety.</brief_summary>
