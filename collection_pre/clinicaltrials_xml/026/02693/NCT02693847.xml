	<brief_summary>Prospective multicenter cohort recruiting consecutive patients from 7 hospitals in Andalusia, southern Spain, according to following criteria: 1) HIV infection, 2) Chronic active HCV infection, 3) Older than 18 years, 4) New diagnosis of liver cirrhosis on the basis of a liver stiffness above 14 kiloPascals, 5) No previous or concomitant decompensation of liver disease. Patients are prospectively followed-up according to a uniform protocol of care. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory variables are periodically recorded. The primary outcomes are the emergence of a liver decompensation (including hepatocellular carcinoma), liver transplant or death. The predictors of these outcomes are analyzed.</brief_summary>
