	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine the magnitude and duration of the reduction in pH (acidification) following a single dose of Acidform vaginal gel containing 3, 4, or 5 g compared with hydroxyethylcellulose placebo gel (4 g) or no treatment. Vaginal pH will be measured 1 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, then once daily for 7 days. In addition, the participants will be assessed for an exploratory endpoint to the determine effect of one dose of Acidform gel (3, 4 or 5 g) or placebo gel (4 g) or no treatment, on asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis (BV).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Duration of Effect of Acidform Gel on Vaginal pH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One hundred healthy volunteer women, 20 per each treatment arm, will be treated with either IVAG Acidform gel, 5 g dose (GROUP A), Acidform gel, 4 g dose (GROUP B), Acidform gel, 3 g dose (GROUP C), Universal Placebo Gel (UPG), 4 g (GROUP D) or no treatment (GROUP E). For GROUPS A, B, C and D, treatment is defined as speculum exam plus instillation of Investigational Product (IP) or placebo gel. For GROUP E (control), no treatment is defined as speculum exam and no gel instillation. At least 15 women in each group will be of either African American or Hispanic ethnicity. Routine screening tests will be performed on admission; and subjects will be assessed for BV via vaginal swabs obtained for grading by Amsel criteria. A direct vaginal pH reading will be research staff-obtained before the speculum exam, as well as one hour, and six hours post-treatment (Day 0). At the one hour and six hour post treatment time points, the direct vaginal pH readings will be taken on specimens collected from two different positions in the vagina, in case of incomplete distribution of the IP soon after administration. Both readings will be included as data points. At the six hour timepoint, subjects will be trained on self-collecting vaginal swabs and performing the vaginal pH test. At 12 hours post-treatment, subjects will perform the vaginal pH test themselves using self-obtained swabs, and record their results for clinician review. Subjects will stay overnight in the domiciliary unit, and vaginal pH and Amsel criteria will be measured again by research staff at 24 (+/- 2) hours post-treatment before discharge on Day 1. The subjects will be discharged with the appropriate pH testing supplies and diary. All women must agree to abstain from sexual intercourse, douching and use of any intravaginally applied products or devices until after their final study visit on Day 7. Subjects will measure their vaginal pH at 24 (+/-2) hour intervals for 5 days (Days 2-6) as outpatients and record the pH test results, and any change in vaginal comfort, in a provided diary. Subjects will also record any activities engaged in from the abstinence criteria in the study exclusion list, if applicable, each day. On Day 7, subjects will return to the clinic with their diaries, have their vaginal pH and Amsel criteria determined by the clinic staff, and queried as to any vaginal discomfort (vaginal comfort assessment) over the course of the study, as self-recorded in their diaries.</detailed_description>
