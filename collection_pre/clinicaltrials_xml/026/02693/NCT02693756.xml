	<brief_summary>Gait stability is reduced as early as from age 40 to 50. Gait stability can be improved in patients with neurological diseases or in healthy elderly persons with exercises. There is evidence that mental practice, also called motor imagery, the imagination of performing a movement, can also improve an activity or balance. The effective performance and the imagination of a task activates some overlapping central areas and neural networks, which might explain the improvements after motor imagery. The investigators set out to test the feasibility of such a study using an open label randomized cross-over trial including 32 persons aged 40 years or more. The primary aim is to evaluate whether the instructions are clear, the intervention and the study procedures are acceptable and to assess the proportion of participants withdraw from the study (drop outs). Secondary aims are the assessment of between group differences in the changes of the gait stability.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gait stability is reduced as early as from age 40 to 50. Gait stability can be improved in patients with neurological diseases or in healthy elderly persons with exercises. There is evidence that mental practice, also called motor imagery, the imagination of performing a movement, can also improve an activity or balance. The effective performance and the imagination of a task activates some overlapping central areas and neural networks, which might explain the improvements after motor imagery. These "non-physical kind of training" modalities could be used in patients who are immobilized temporarily (bedridden because of non-chronic disease, infection etc.), or in those who are not allowed to charge their leg normally (e.g. postoperative phase of joint replacement or fractures), or it can be used in combination with physical exercises, or in the preparation of the physical exercise training (either skilling up phase or as a preparation to increase safety of physical exercises). In persons above 40 years of age, motor imagery could provide a sound exercise modality for tasks that are not easy to perform with real performance. For example, walking on slippery underground such as ice, walking on a small trail in some altitude, avoiding running dogs or cats on a sidewalk, or catching up after stumbling can be either difficult to exercise in reality or might be too dangerous in reality. Imaging one's performance in such difficult environments or situations might lead to better gait stability, improved reactions in these situations and thus probably to reduced falls frequency. Gait stability can be estimated with the local dynamic stability, which is based on chaos theory, i.e. the maximal Lyapunov exponent, is strongly influenced by the sensorimotor balance system and is widely used for measuring gait stability. In the future, the investigators plan a large scale randomized open label cross-over study to test whether nine sessions of motor imagery improve walking stability, measured with the Lyapunov Exponent. To prepare this future study, the investigators set out to test the feasibility of such a study with a feasibility study using an open label randomized cross-over trial including 32 persons aged 40 years or more. The primary aim is to evaluate whether the instructions are clear, the intervention and the study procedures are acceptable and to assess the proportion of participants withdraw from the study (drop outs). Secondary aims are the assessment of between group differences in the changes of the gait stability.</detailed_description>
