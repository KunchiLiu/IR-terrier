	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this multicenter, single-arm, observational study is to evaluate the feasibility of a systematic direct stenting strategy with the Svelte SLENDER IDS Sirolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent-on-a-Wire Integrated Delivery System (SLENDER IDS) in an all-comers, real-world population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Direct III Post Market Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this post-market study, the population will include real-world subjects who are intended to be treated, with SLENDER IDS as standard therapy. Follow-up contacts post procedure will be made for clinical assessments at hospital discharge, 1, 6 and 12 months. This study is designed as a prospective, multi-center, single-arm, observational all-comers clinical study to collect ongoing safety and efficacy of SLENDER IDS and to determine the feasibility of a direct stenting strategy in an all-comers population. A minimum of two hundred fifty (250) subjects will be treated at up to 20 sites in Europe. Review of safety data and risks to subjects will be monitored by an independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC) at pre-specified enrollment milestones.</detailed_description>
