	<brief_summary>This research study will examine the relationship interconnecting medical body health, mental health, and microbes of the digestive tract in persons living with serious mental illnesses,as compared to persons without such disorders. Existing research suggests that interactions between digestive tract microbes and the body may influence brain function circuits, mood, anxiety state, cognition, behavior, and medical physiology.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Microbiome and the Gut-Brain Axis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People living with serious mental illnesses have far shorter life expectancy due to various attending medical disorders. Vast knowledge gaps exist regarding microbial taxa responsible for governing various the human states of health or morbidity or interactions with medications. Serious mental illnesses collectively comprise the single largest medical category of life-long disability worldwide. Mounting evidence in humans and in animal models of schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related mental illnesses point to gut microbiome-host interactions that may influence brain function circuits, mood, anxiety state, cognition, behavior, as well as generate medical comorbidities. This research study will collect stool samples and blood for in vitro analysis of microbiome and metabolomics.</detailed_description>
