	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Therapeutic Hepatitis B Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Objectives: To explore the appropriate dose of a therapeutic hepatitis B vaccine through the evaluation of safety, tolerability, and efficacy - Subjects: Chronic hepatitis B carrier with normal ALT range - Study hypothesis: The immune tolerance break and strong immune responses in the chronic hepatitis B carrier could be achieved with therapeutic hepatitis B vaccine containing novel adjuvant</detailed_description>
