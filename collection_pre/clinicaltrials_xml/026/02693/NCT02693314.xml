	<detailed_description>Participants will be screened using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (questions regarding physical activity, including intensity, duration and frequency) and inclusion/exclusion criteria. Participants will be scheduled to begin a 7-day baseline period, during which participants will complete daily questionnaires of bowel movement frequency, gastrointestinal symptoms and wellness. On or about day 8, height and weight will be determined. Participants will then be randomized to one of the following groups: Group 1: Jarro-Dophilus EPS速 (5 billion CFU/capsule), Group 2: Jarro-Dophilus EPS速 Higher Potency (25 billion CFU/capsule), Group 3: Placebo capsule Study participants will continue to complete the daily online questionnaire throughout the 28 days of treatment and for 7 days post treatment. Participants will also be asked to complete a weekly questionnaire on gastrointestinal symptoms (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale) throughout the entire study. In addition, participants in each group will be asked to collect one stool sample at baseline, one stool sample during week 4 of treatment and an additional sample during the washout period. Stool samples will be analyzed and quantified for the probiotic bacteria and changes in the microbiota. Participants will be asked to return any unconsumed supplements at the end of the treatment period. Additionally, the participants will be weighed after the treatment period and the washout period.</detailed_description>
