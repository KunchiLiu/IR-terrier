	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD) in clinically stable cardiologic outpatients of a German university clinic by means of polygraphy. Furthermore, the practicability of the underlying diagnostic process in clinical application is assessed as well as the sensitivity and specificity of polygraphy as compared to the reference standard of polysomnography. Another aim is to determine the individual cardiovascular risk profile by pulse wave analysis and risk classification according to European Society of Hypertension (ESH) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC), "ESH/ESC risk".</brief_summary>
