	<brief_summary>Human immune function and intestinal microbiota are suggested to be altered within long-duration stay in space. Accumulated evidences on earth support that Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS) is a promising probiotic strain on improvement of immune function and intestinal microbiota. This study aims to investigate the impact of long-duration spaceflight as well as intake of LcS on the international space station (ISS), on immune system and intestinal microbiota in astronauts.</brief_summary>
