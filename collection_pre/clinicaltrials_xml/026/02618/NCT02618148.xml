	<detailed_description>Recent studies have proved : -Garlic oil as garlic may reduce platelet aggregation, patients taking anticoagulant medication are cautioned about consuming garlic. A 2013 meta-analysis concluded that garlic preparations may effectively lower total cholesterol by 11-23 mg/dL and LDL cholesterol by 3-15 mg/dL in adults with high cholesterol if taken for longer than two months. The same analysis found that garlic had a marginally positive effect on HDL cholesterol, no significant effect on blood triglyceride levels, and that garlic preparations were generally well tolerated with very few side effects. - Nattokinase Nattō is made from fermented soybeans and has been eaten in Japan for about a thousand years. Nattō is produced by fermentation by adding the bacterium Bacillus natto to boiled soybeans. Nattokinase is produced by the bacterium acting on the soybeans . While other soy foods contain enzymes, it is only the nattō preparation that contains the specific nattokinase enzyme. - Estradiol valerate is one of the most widely used esters of estradiol. - Progesterone: Hormone replacement therapy. Progesterone is combined with 17-beta estradiol in the estrogen patch.</detailed_description>
