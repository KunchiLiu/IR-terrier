	<brief_summary>Mycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the most common causes of community-acquired pneumonia in children. The clinical course is typically self-limited and benign; however, rare cases of severe pneumonia can develop despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. The investigators aim to study the effects of prednisolone on severe M. pneumoniae pneumonia with lobar consolidation or pleural effusion in children.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the most common causes of community-acquired pneumonia in children. The clinical course is typically self-limited and benign; however, rare cases of severe pneumonia can develop despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. The investigators aim to study the effects of prednisolone on severe M. pneumoniae pneumonia with lobar consolidation or pleural effusion in children. Participants will be randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive either prednisone 1 mg/kg/d daily for 5 days or none. The primary endpoint was fever duration and analysed by intention to treat.</detailed_description>
