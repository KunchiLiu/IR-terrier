	<brief_title>The Use of i/t Curve in Assessment of Phototherapy Effects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Electrodiagnostic Studies (i/t curve), chronaxies, rheobase (i/t curve), Electrodiagnostic Studies will be conducted before a series of 10 phototherapy treatments and after their completion. Pain threshold assessment with algometer will be conducted before a series of 10 phototherapy treatments and after their completion. Assessment of sensitivity to compression (pound/cm2). Creation of 3 test groups: 1 - Piler light + red filter, 2 - Piler light + blue filter, 3 - Piler light without a filter. Creation of a numerical coefficient for i/t curve. monitoring of changes in numerical coefficient after phototherapy.</detailed_description>
