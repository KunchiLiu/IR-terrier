	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (LRYGB) is considered the weight loss procedure of choice for patients suffering of gastro-esophageal reflux (GER). However, long term instrumental evaluations of GER after LRYGB are not available. The aim of this study is to evaluate the long-term effects of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (LRYGB) on gastro-esophageal function.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Consecutive morbidly obese patients selected for LRYGB were included in a prospective study. The investigators performed clinical evaluation with GERD-HRQoL and GIS questionnaire, upper endoscopy, esophageal manometry and 24h-impedance pH monitoring (24h-MII-pH) preoperatively and at 12 and 60 months after surgery. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the presence of GER at preoperative 24h-MII-pH.</detailed_description>
