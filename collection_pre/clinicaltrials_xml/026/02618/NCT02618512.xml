	<brief_summary>This study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of intravenous (IV) administration of SBC-103 in previously studied, SBC-103 treatment naïve patients with mucopolysaccharidosis III, type B (MPS IIIB, Sanfilippo B) who participated in the NGLU-CL01 study. The NGLU-CL01 study was a non-interventional study that evaluated structural brain abnormalities and blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebrospinal fluid/serum albumin index.</brief_summary>
