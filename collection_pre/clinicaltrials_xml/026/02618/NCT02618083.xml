	<brief_summary>Retinal detachments correspond to a separation of the neuroepithelium from the pigment epithelium. They can be exudative (sometimes in conjunction with a tumor), tractional, traumatic (postoperative) or rhegmatogenous (in relation to a tear). Ultrasound, requested when the fundus is difficult to achieve and shows a hyperechoic mobile membrane. It can also measure the hemodynamic parameters of retinal arteries. A preliminary study showed a correlation between systolic velocity in the central retinal artery and postoperative visual acuity. The aim of this study is to confirm those preliminary data.</brief_summary>
