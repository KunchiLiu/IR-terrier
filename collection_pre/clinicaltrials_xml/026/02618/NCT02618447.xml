	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that 4Dimensional Phase Contrast Magnetic Resonance Angiography (4D PC MRA) evaluation of portal venous flow predicts underlying liver function and hypertrophic potential in patients with liver cancer presenting for portal vein embolization (PVE). 4D PC MRA may provide a non-invasive measure of liver function that could help determine which patients could safely and successfully undergo PVE and subsequent resection of tumor. By comparing 4D PC MRA results with invasive catheter measurements the investigators will validate the flow findings. Further regression/correlation analysis with functional measures of the liver (HIDA scans), volumetrics, Doppler flow analysis, histology, and outcomes will help the investigators to determine the ability of 4D PC MRA to predict functional status and hypertrophic potential of the liver prior to PVE and hepatectomy allowing for better patient selection and reduced morbidity/mortality.</brief_summary>
