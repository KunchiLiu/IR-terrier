	<brief_summary>A first-in-human clinical trial to treat patients with multiple sclerosis by vaccination with tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDC), generated using Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) will be conducted. In doing so, the feasibility and safety of administering myelin-derived peptide-pulsed tolDC in patients with MS will be assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A "Negative"Dendritic Cell-based Vaccine for the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis: a First-in-human Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A phase I dose-escalating clinical trial will be conducted in a coordinated and comprehensive manner to determine safety and tolerability, and to enable selection of a suitable dose regimen for phase II trials. The primary objective of the phase I study will be to determine whether tolDC-based therapy is safe and well tolerated and to establish the dose-response, with clinical relapse rates, neurological disability (assessed using various scales) and MRI endpoints, measured over 12 months. Patients will serve as their own controls pre- and post-vaccination. Completion of screening assessments and confirmation of eligibility criteria should take no longer than 6 weeks. First-line treatments will be stopped 6 weeks before baseline at the latest.</detailed_description>
