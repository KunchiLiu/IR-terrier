	<brief_title>Delayed Cord Clamping and Use of Oxytocin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized controlled trial with 2 arms to test the influence of oxytocin in placental transfusion. Placental transfusion: the amount of blood that passes to the baby from the time of birth until the cord is clamped. The difference in weight between a measurement at birth and a second one after clamping the cord at 3 minutes will be considered as proxy for placental transfusion. In one arm the oxytocin will be used immediately after birth and the cord clamped at 3 minutes In the other arm the oxytocin will be administered at 3 minutes of birth after the cord is clamped.</detailed_description>
