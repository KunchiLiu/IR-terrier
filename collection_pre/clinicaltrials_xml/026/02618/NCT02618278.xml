	<brief_summary>This study aims to evaluate the whether receiving physiotherapy early after onset of the problem is better than waiting a few weeks to see if it gets better before starting physiotherapy. 80 people with sciatica will take part in the study, half of which will receive physiotherapy 2 weeks after seeing their G.P. The other half will receive physiotherapy at the usual time, around 6 weeks after seeing their G.P.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Physiotherapy for Sciatica; Is Earlier Better?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sciatica is a relatively common problem which is often caused by nerve compression or irritation due to a lower back (Lumbar) disc prolapse. The problem is likely to improve in time as the body heals itself. However, this can take many months or sometime years. Sciatica can be a very painful condition, it may cause pins and needles, numbness or weakness in the legs affected. This, can cause great difficulty for people carrying out normal day to day activities. Physiotherapy is often used to help people with sciatica but in many places in the United Kingdom it can take many weeks or months to begin therapy. This study aims to see if having physiotherapy at 2 weeks after the patient has seen their G.P helps them get back to normal day to day function. This will be compared with another group of patients who will have physiotherapy at the 'usual' time of around 6 weeks after they have seen their G.P.The investigators will also be interviewing participants for their views of sciatica and physiotherapy. Each patient will receive a goal orientated physiotherapy management programme with achievement of those goals acting as secondary outcomes. Primary outcomes are feasibility objectives including patient recruitment rates, acceptability of outcome measures and intervention and rates of adverse events. This is a pilot study which means that the investigators won't be directly comparing the 2 groups, but seeing if doing a full-scale study in the future is going to be feasible.The investigators will do this by measuring several different things, such as whether patients want to take part in the study or not, whether the tests the investigators will perform are the right tests and to see if the patients and physiotherapists find the treatment useful.</detailed_description>
