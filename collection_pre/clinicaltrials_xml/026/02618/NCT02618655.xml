	<brief_title>Clinical Research for the Diagnosis of Tick-borne Diseases in Patients With Unexplained Acute Fever</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tickborne Diseases(TBDs) spread throughout many countries and regions. In recent years, the incidence has a tendency to rise continuously. The clinical symptoms and laboratory features of tick-borne diseases are always of no specific, and the diagnostic methods available, such as observing the pathogen after cultivation or by the method of Gimenez、serological tests for antibody always can't make a timely diagnosis, especially in the early period of the disease. The development of polymerase chain reaction(PCR) has been applied for pathogen detection, and showed high sensitivity and specificity,and may contribute to early diagnose，but no standardized method of PCR has been as yet proposed. This study mean to explore several laboratory diagnoses to find out which will be more helpful for making an accurate diagnosis in the early period of TBDs.</detailed_description>
