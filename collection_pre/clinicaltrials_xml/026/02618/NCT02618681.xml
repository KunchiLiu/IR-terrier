	<brief_title>Earlobe Creases Predict Prognosis in Chinese Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : 1 year primary composite end point (including the whole death, recurrent myocardial infarction, stroke, target vessel revascularization, stent thrombosis) in AMI patients with different types of earlobe crease. Secondary objective: 1. The incidence of complications during hospitalization 2. The rate of rehospitalization due to cardiovascular disease 3. The incidence of revascularization at 1 year after AMI</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Initial acute myocardial infarction(AMI) 2. Detection of a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarker values (preferably cardiac troponin (cTn) with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL)) and with at least one of the following: Symptoms of ischemia Development of pathologic Q waves in the electrocardiogram (ECG) New or presumed new significant STsegmentT wave (STT) changes or new left bundle branch block (LBBB). Identification of an intracoronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or a new regional wall motion abnormality. 3. Type 1 (spontaneous myocardial infarction(MI)) in the third universal definition of MI: MI consequent to a pathologic process in the wall of the coronary artery (eg, plaque erosion/rupture, fissuring, or dissection), resulting in intraluminal thrombus. 4. Infarct related artery (IRA) showed that acute thrombus formation, IRA occlusion or stenosis ≥95%、≥90%～95%、≤90%，thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI)03 flow. 5. PCI(percutaneous coronary intervention)intervention（PCI for STEMI within 12 hours after symptom onset）. 6. Signed informed consent. 1. Combined valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, blood diseases, skin diseases, rheumatic diseases, ischemic cerebrovascular disease, tumor, etc. 2. Previous myocardial infarction. 3. Previous PCI and coronary artery bypass graft(CABG). 4. Chronic total occlusion(CTO)lesions. 5. Ear malformation. 6. Ocular diseases. 7. Participating in a clinical study.</criteria>
