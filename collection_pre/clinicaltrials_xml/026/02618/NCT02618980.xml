	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to compare efficacy of "early endoscopy" and "non-endoscopic treatment" for management of acute upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding in patients with recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS). This study will also compare rates of surgery, repeated intervention (endoscopy or TAE), rebleeding and complications between two groups.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Antiplatelet therapy is the cornerstone in the management of patients with ACS. Aspirin interferes platelet aggregation activity by decreasing thromboxane synthesis through inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzymes. Low-dose (75-325mg/day) aspirin has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of cardio-and cerebro-vascular events by as much as 30%, and 18% of all-cause mortality in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. However, aspirin is notorious for GI adverse effects because of inhibition of COX-mediated prostaglandin synthesis. Up to 60% of aspirin users develop GI mucosal lesions under endoscopic examination, especially stomach and duodenum. The risk of serious ulcer complications, including life-threatening bleeding and perforation, is two- to fourfold higher in patients taking low-dose aspirin than placebo. Clopidogrel, another antiplatelet agent, inhibits platelet function by blocking the adenosine diphosphate receptor on platelets rather than suppressing COX activity. The CAPRIE trial has shown that long-term clopidogrel monotherapy was more effective and better tolerated than aspirin in reducing combined risk of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), or vascular death. Clopidogrel seems to be associated with fewer GI adverse effects compared with aspirin. Nonetheless, an animal study revealed that clopidogrel impair the healing of gastric ulcers by suppressing the release of platelet-derived growth factors which are crucial for repair of mucosal defects. Clinical studies have also disclosed that 8-12% of clopidogrel users with a history of peptic ulcer bleeding develop recurrent GI bleeding within 12 months. A nationwide population-based study demonstrated that the use of clopidogrel increased the risk of UGI bleeding with hazard ratio (HR) of 3.66 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.96-4.51], especially in elderly, chronic kidney disease (CKD), past history of peptic ulcer disease, and concomitant use of aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The combined use of aspirin and clopidogrel has become the mainstay therapy for patients who undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The dual antiplatelet therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of death, MI and stroke as much as 27% in patients after PCI. Inevitably, GI bleeding is still a major complication of dual antiplatelet therapy in MI patients and is associated with longer hospital stay and higher mortality rates (18.5~44% vs. 2.4~13%). An investigation of 1,368 MI patients who underwent PCI has shown an incidence rate of in-hospital UGI bleeding about 8.9%. In the CURE study, the overall incidence of bleeding complication was 8.5%, commonly occurring in GI tract (major GI tract bleeding incidence 1.3%). In patients under dual antiplatelet therapy, ACS carried a higher risk for UGI bleeding at early stage (≦2 weeks) with HR 2.67 (95%CI 1.33-5.34). GIB was strongly associated with 30-day all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 4.87, p&lt;0.0001), cardiac mortality (HR: 5.35, p&lt;0.0001), and composite ischemia (HR: 1.94, p=0.014), as well as with 1-year all-cause mortality (HR: 3.97, p&lt;0.0001), cardiac mortality (HR: 3.77, p&lt;0.0001), MI (HR: 1.74, p=0.047), and composite ischemia (HR: 1.9, p=0.0001). Patients who experienced GIB had significantly higher rates of stent thrombosis compared with patients without GIB (5.8% vs. 2.4%, p=0.009). Therefore, how to deal with acute UGI bleeding in the setting of recent ACS is still challenging to gastroenterologists and cardiologists. Acute UGI bleeding remains a therapeutic challenge with significant morbidity and mortality. Pharmacological therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and therapeutic endoscopy using various modalities have been clearly shown to significantly reduce re-bleeding, need for surgery and mortality of patients with acute UGI bleeding. Early endoscopy (within 24 hours) has been recommended for all medium to high risk patients with acute UGI bleeding. Early endoscopic intervention allows early diagnosis and early discharge of patients with low risk findings, provides endoscopic hemostasis, enables complete risk stratification of non-variceal bleeding, has resulted in less transfusion requirements and length of hospitalization. However, despite of many benefits from early endoscopy, no study has been able to demonstrate that this strategy leads to a reduction in mortality of acute UGI bleeding; this is probably due to that mortality from acute UGI bleeding is mainly determined by co-morbidity rather than control of hemorrhage. Moreover, endoscopy carries certain potential risk for complications, including cardiopulmonary events, infectious and thromboembolic events, bleeding, instrumental (perforation, penetration and impaction), and drug reaction. Whether early endoscopic intervention for hemostasis of UGI bleeding improves outcomes in patients with recent ACS is still debated. In patients with recent ACS, the safety and timing of endoscopy is not well known. Dynamic changes in infarct size may occur since the loss of viable myocardium is progressive after coronary artery occlusion during several hours. In addition, the infarcted region which itself is a critical determinant of remodeling, incidence of arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death and thus prognosis of ACS, may further expand or contract; moreover, normal collagen structure disappears during the first week even after the loss of viable myocardium has terminated. Therefore, endoscopy within the first week after MI seems to be associated with higher risk for cardiovascular events. Nonetheless, in several observational cohort and retrospective studies, endoscopy for post-ACS patients has been described as relatively acceptable with complication rates ranging from 1% to 48.4%, depending on the definition of complications, timing of endoscopy, and clinical condition of enrolled patients.A systemic review of literature has shown that overall complication rate of esophagogastroduodenoscopy after MI was about 1% to 8%, with a large predominance of minor complications. Women seem to experience more periprocedural myocardial ischemia than men (31% vs. 11%, p=.058),35 and ACS patients who are very ill (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE] II score ≧ 16) are more likely to develop endoscopic complications than those with relatively stable condition (APACHE II &lt; 16) (21% vs. 2%). Another recent retrospective study has also revealed that patients with APACHE II scores &gt;16 experienced more minor complications (chest pain, abnormal vital signs, or minor arrhythmias) than those with scores ≦15 (54.5% vs. 24.2%, p=.02). However, design of these studies is mostly retrospective or observational. Given the lack of guidelines and randomized control trials, gastroenterologists are always reluctant to perform early endoscopy for UGI bleeding in ACS patients in fear of potential risk of complications. In this study, investigators will evaluate the safety and efficacy of "early endoscopy" and "non-endoscopic treatment" for acute UGI bleeding in recent ACS patients.</detailed_description>
