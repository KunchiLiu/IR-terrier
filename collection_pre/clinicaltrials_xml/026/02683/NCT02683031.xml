	<brief_summary>We aimed to investigate the efficiency of chemical oocyte activation using readymade Ca2+ ionophore on cases with previously cancelled cases due to fertilization arrest at pronuclear stage i.e: cleavage failure to find out if there is any improvement in embryonic developmental stages.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Ca2+ Ionophore on Embryonic Development and Clinical Outcome in Cases With Previous Fertilization Arrest</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many studies reported that Ca2+ ionophore has a positive effect on embryo development in cases with complete or partial fertilization failure. However, only one preliminary report suggested a beneficial effect of Ca2+ ionophore activation in four cases with fertilization arrest.</detailed_description>
