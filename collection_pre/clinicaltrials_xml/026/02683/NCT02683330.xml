	<brief_summary>Psychological difficulties, especially depression and anxiety are the most prevalent non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease (PD). Pharmacological treatments are not as effective in PD. Mindfulness courses have received increased popularity and recognition as an effective way to manage emotional states, and there is ever growing findings of the effectiveness of mindfulness courses for people with long-term medical conditions. Two small pilot studies have indicated that mindfulness courses can be helpful for people with PD in improving symptoms of depression, language functioning and motor symptoms. The investigators propose to deliver these courses remotely, through Skype video conferences, to make it more accessible for people with mobility limitations and people who live in rural areas.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Distant Delivery of a Mindfulness-based Intervention for People Affected by Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will employ a mixed-methods design, with an experimental randomised control trial followed by a qualitative design. Sixty participants will be randomly assigned to the 8-week mindfulness course (n=30) or a wait-list control group (n=30). Block randomisation will be used and the randomisation scheme will be generated using the randomisation.com website. One-hour sessions will be delivered to groups of 5 people using Skype video-conferencing. As this is a pilot study analyses will largely be descriptive. Further, inferential analyses using mixed modelling will be conducted by intention-to-treat. At the end of the intervention, the investigators will interview the participants of the mindfulness group about their experiences of the course.</detailed_description>
