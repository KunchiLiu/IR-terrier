	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) is a disease affecting 5-15% of population and 50-80% of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obese subjects. OSA causally contributes to the development of glucose intolerance and T2DM. The project is targeting the gap in providing effective treatment of metabolic impairments associated with OSA, particularly T2DM. In contrast to proved benefits of OSA treatment with CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) on cardiovascular morbidity/mortality, studies on the impact of CPAP on diabetes control are disappointing. In fact, OSA-induced metabolic impairments might not be reversible with CPAP treatment, as investigators suggested recently. Clearly, the search for additional treatments, probably pharmacological, is warranted. Investigators hypothesize that elevated levels of free fatty acids (FFA), as detected in OSA patients, are linking OSA with the T2DM development. The aim of the study is to target adipose tissue and muscle dysfunction leading to elevated FFA and develop thus novel pharmacological treatments based on lipolysis inhibition and stimulation of FFA oxidation.</brief_summary>
