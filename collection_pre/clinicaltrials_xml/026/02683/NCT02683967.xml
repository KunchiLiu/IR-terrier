	<brief_title>The Impact of Acupuncture on the Success Rates of IVF (In Vitro Fertilisation) Treatments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Failing to conceive naturally poses significant stress to the infertile couple. It creates a feeling of failure and frustration. It has been found that the use of complementary therapies makes women feel empowered, with a sense of regaining control of the body. The popularity of acupuncture is increasing. A significant proportion of couples having fertility treatment, especially IVF (In-Vitro Fertilisation) ask their clinician about using acupuncture and some patients undergo acupuncture privately without reporting to their clinicians. The effectiveness of acupuncture on IVF has been extensively researched; however the results are varied and not conclusive. This is due to previous studies varying significantly in their study design, acupuncture timing and the final outcome measure. As a result of the difference in the studies it is not clear whether acupuncture is beneficial regarding IVF success rates and whether it should be offered to women undergoing IVF.</detailed_description>
