	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies the use of integrin alpha-v-beta [18F]-R01-MG-F2 positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in measuring response in patients with pancreatic cancer and healthy volunteers. Integrins, such as integrin alpha-v-beta [18F]-R01-MG-F2, are a family of membrane receptors that are overexpressed and attaches to various proteins which sense and respond to contact events that occur at the cell surface and may improve early detection of pancreatic cancer and improve patient selection for anti-integrin alpha-v-beta 6 therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Integrin Alpha-v-Beta and [18F]-R01-MG-F2 PET/CT in Measuring Response in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer and Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the biodistribution and safety of [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 in healthy volunteers. II. Evaluate the feasibility of [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 PET/CT scanning in patients with pancreatic cancer. OUTLINE: Patients receive [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 intravenously (IV) and undergo PET/CT scan immediately after and at 60 and 120 minutes. After completion of study, patients are followed up at 12 months.</detailed_description>
