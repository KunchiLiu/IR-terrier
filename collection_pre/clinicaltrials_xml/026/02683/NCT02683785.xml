	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, Phase IIa, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study with the primary objective to assess the efficacy potential of GSK3196165 on pain, in subjects with active inflammatory hand osteoarthritis (HOA). Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled into the study, following a screening period of up to 4 weeks. The total treatment period will be 12 weeks, with the follow up period completing at Week 22. At least 40 subjects will be randomized across the two treatment arms, to either placebo or GSK3196165 in a 1:1 ratio.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Osteoarthritis</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Age &gt;=18 years at the time of signing informed consent. Meets American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification of osteoarthritis (OA) and have not responded to analgesics (level 1 and 2) or to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for at least 10 days in the past 3 months. Active disease at screening and randomization with at least two swollen and tender proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and/or distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints in the affected hand. Signs of inflammation such as synovitis in the MRI scan of the affected hand. Must have a subject's self assessment of 24hour average hand pain intensity at baseline of at least '5' on an 11point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS, 010). Weight &gt;=45 kilogram (kg). Male or female subjects are eligible to participate so long as they meet and agree to abide by the contraceptive criteria. Diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) &gt;=70% predicted; forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) &gt;=80% predicted. No evidence of active or latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB). Pregnant or lactating women. History of any clinically significant inflammatory disease other than inflammatory HOA, especially, but not limited to, rheumatoid arthritis or spondylarthropathies. Diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, gout, calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD), pseudogout, hemochromatosis or other inflammatory rheumatological or autoimmune disorders. Clinical suspicion of, or previous investigation for CPPD or pseudogout, or history of chondrocalcinosis. Any injury, medical or surgical procedure to the affected joint(s) that may interfere with evaluation of the target HOA joint(s). History of infected joint prosthesis at any time, with the prosthesis still in situ. History of leg ulcers, catheters, chronic sinusitis or recurrent chest or urinary tract infections. Any surgical procedure, including bone or joint surgery/synovectomy within 12 weeks prior to Day 1 or any planned surgery within the duration of the study or followup period. History of any respiratory disease which (in the opinion of the investigator) would compromise subject safety or the ability of the subject to complete the study (e.g. significant interstitial lung disease, such as pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), moderatesevere asthma, bronchiectasis, previous pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [PAP]). Clinicallysignificant or unstable (in the opinion of the investigator) persistent cough or dyspnea that is unexplained. Significant unstable or uncontrolled acute or chronic disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, could confound the results of the study or put the subject at undue risk. A history of malignancy. Hereditary or acquired immunodeficiency disorder, including immunoglobulin deficiency. Current/previous Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1 or 2 infection.</criteria>
