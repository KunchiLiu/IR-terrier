	<brief_summary>Inflammatory Bowel Disease, including ulcerative colitis, is thought to result from an imbalance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors. As such, the majority of treatment options are directed at attempting to control the chronic inflammation and prolonging remission of clinical symptoms. Several studies have proven that curcumin has well-established anti-inflammatory properties. However, curcumin has poor bioavailability and prior studies have needed to use high concentrations in order to study the efficacy of the product. The investigators propose that a bio-enhanced preparation of curcumin will require a lower dosage to reach and affect its target tissue and will subsequently produce less adverse side effects.</brief_summary>
