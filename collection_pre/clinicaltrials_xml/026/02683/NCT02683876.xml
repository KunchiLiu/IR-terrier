	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to identify metabolic signatures associated with malodor conditions. The investigators will perform state-of-the art metabolomics tests and bioinformatic data mining to explore if conditions leading to malodor can be screened by metabolomic profiling of urine samples.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploratory Study of Relationships Between Malodor and Urine Metabolomics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, metabolite profiling analysis will be carried out on urine samples of individuals with malodor conditions related to metabolism inefficiencies. Metabolic profiles will be identified using the metabolomics equipment located in the NMR, HPLC and MS facilities of the Metabolomics Innovation Centre (TMIC). Multivariate statistical analyses will be used, as well as other approaches to mine complex data from heterogeneous sources.</detailed_description>
