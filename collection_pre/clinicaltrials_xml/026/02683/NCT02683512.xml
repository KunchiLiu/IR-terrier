	<brief_summary>Database for information on individuals affected with glycogen brancher deficiency, also known as glycogen storage disease type IV</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glycogen Storage Disease Type IV Database</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The long term goal of the proposed project is to develop a repository of information with the long term goal of expanding the understanding of the disease manifestation and natural history of GSD IV. Specific Aims: To establish a repository of clinical, laboratory, and biochemical information on individuals diagnosed with glycogen brancher enzyme deficiency. In the long term, this information will permit a better understanding of the long term complications and clinical course in GBE deficiency. The medical records will be reviewed and participant information will be collected using REDCapâ„¢ software, hosted through the Duke Translational Medicine Institute (DTMI). The database will serve as the repository for retrospective and prospective clinical information and results on all participants. Data to be collected: Name, DOB, Sex, Age, Method of diagnosis, Liver, skin, or muscle biopsy histology, Initial symptoms and/or reason for referral, Past medical history, Past surgical history, Family history, Pregnancy history, Developmental history, Developmental assessments, and Results of liver function testing. All patients with GSD-IV regardless of age, gender or ethnicity, are eligible for the database. This research project will enroll individuals from outside institutions. The goal is increase the robustness of data collection and analysis with a large number of participants.</detailed_description>
