	<brief_summary>Large spikes in blood glucose experienced after meals in people with type 2 diabetes are known to damage blood vessels. Low carbohydrate high fat diets and exercise can improve blood glucose control in people with type 2 diabetes but it is unclear how these two strategies interact to affect blood vessel function and inflammation. We will examine how following a short-term low carbohydrate high fat diet (4 days) with or without post-meal walking impacts markers of blood vessel function and inflammation. We will also examine how a single low carbohydrate high fat meal, with or without post-meal walking, impacts blood glucose control and blood vessel function. Findings will help determine the best lifestyle approach for improving cardiovascular health in type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
