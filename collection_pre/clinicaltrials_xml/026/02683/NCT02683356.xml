	<brief_summary>Fully Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffolds (BVS) have been introduced with the objective to preserve native vessel geometry, allow for adaptive vessel remodeling with late lumen gain, restore physiological vasomotion, and avoid late adverse events including restenosis and scaffold thrombosis. Although randomized clinical trials in low risk patients to date suggest non-inferiority in terms of safety and efficacy compared with metallic DES, several reports have raised concerns regarding the scaffold thrombosis highlighting the importance of technical considerations regarding lesion preparation and scaffold expansion. OCT offers the opportunity to plan the procedure and optimize the implantation of BVS. The hypothesis of the present study is that a strategy of OCT-guided PCI using BVS is superior to angiography-guided PCI (e.g. by selecting scaffold dimension on the basis of a pre-procedural OCT and applying corrective measures in case of suboptimal treatment result as indicated by OCT).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Age ≥18 years. 2. Patient provides signed written informed consent before any studyspecific procedure. 3. De novo native coronary artery disease with lesions that have a distal and proximal reference vessel diameter in the range between 2.25mm and 3.8mm. 4. Single or multi vessel disease. For multi vessel disease up to two vessels and three lesions treated at baseline with no more than two lesions per vessel. Vessel is defined as, left anterior descending, left circumflex, and right coronary arteries. Any branch within the vessel is considered part of the vessel. 5. Full revascularization of all lesions should be achievable (staged PCI not recommended) 6. Elective or ad hoc PCI, stable angina and acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS and STEMI). 7. Angiographically significant (&gt;50% visual estimation) stenosis present in at least one native coronary artery and evidence of ischemia. 1. Subjects with left main lesion. 2. Aortoostial lesion location within 3 mm of the aorta junction (both right and left). 3. Subjects with restenosis or stent thrombosis in the target vessel. 4. Severely calcified lesions requiring rotablation. 5. Bifurcation with sidebranch &gt;2.5mm or any sidebranch that possibly requires treatment with angulation &gt;70° 6. Severe angulation (&gt;90°) or excessive tortuosity (&gt;two 45° angles) 7. Known renal insufficiency (serum creatinine clearance &lt;45ml/min or receiving dialysis). 8. Vessel(s) and lesion(s) not amenable for PCI, for example diffuse disease. 9. Female of childbearing potential (age &lt;50 years and last menstruation within the last 12 months), who did not undergo tubal ligation, ovariectomy or hysterectomy 10. Life expectancy less than 1 year. 11. Indication for oral anticoagulation 12. Known allergy against protocolrequired medications including ASA, prasugrel, ticagrelor, clopidogrel, heparin, iodinated contrast (the latter in case it cannot be adequately premedicated) 13. History of bleeding diathesis or known coagulopathy. 14. Planned surgery within the next 6 months</criteria>
