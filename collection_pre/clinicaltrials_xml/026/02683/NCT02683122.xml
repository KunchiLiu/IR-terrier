	<brief_title>The DIPOD Study (Diagnosis Improvement of Pneumonia by Organ Dysfunction)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>New onset of pulmonary infiltrates, fever, and an increase in white blood cell (WBC) count accompanied by purulent tracheal secretions are clinically indicative of hospital-associated pneumonia (HAP). The low specificity and sensibility of diagnostic tests for HAP, however, tends to result in an extremely high incidence of missed diagnoses and may lay to high mortality. The place of analysis of organ dysfunction in relation to the diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia in intensive care is not yet defined, because early organ dysfunction may be the first symptoms noted by clinicians.</detailed_description>
