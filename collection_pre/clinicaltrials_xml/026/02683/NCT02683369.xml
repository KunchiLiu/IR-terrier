	<brief_summary>Healthy premenopausal women that are iron-deficient without anemia will receive a low-dose iron dietary supplement. The investigators seek to determine if the low-dose iron dietary supplement will restore iron levels to normal range with fewer side effects than typically experienced at higher doses of iron supplementation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-dose Iron Supplementation and Markers of Iron Status Among Non-anemic, Iron-deficient Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the impact of a low-dose iron dietary supplement on markers of iron status among a sample of premenopausal women that are iron-deficient without anemia. This study will also assess the incidence of mild adverse events (constipation, nausea, etc.) that are relatively common with other over the counter iron dietary supplements and that the investigators hypothesize will be reduced with this lower-dose formulation.</detailed_description>
