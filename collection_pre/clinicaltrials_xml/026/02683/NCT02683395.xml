	<criteria>Confirmed diagnosis of an advanced malignancy in one of two treatment groups: Treatment Group A: any advanced solid tumor (including lymphomas); Treatment Group B: relapsed or refractory AML or highrisk MDS, defined as IPSS INT2 or greater disease (Maes 1999). Progressed following at least 1 line of prior anticancer therapy for the advanced disease and there is no further standard therapeutic option available (including subjects who are intolerant to the approved/available therapies) Age ≥ 18 years Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance Status (PS) 02 Life expectancy ≥ 3 months Adequate organ function as demonstrated by the following laboratory values (collected within 10 days of treatment initiation) and as appropriate for the disease under study. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening and must agree to use an effective form of contraception from the time of the negative pregnancy test up to 6 months after the last dose of study drug. Women of nonchildbearing potential may be included if they are either surgically sterile or have been postmenopausal for ≥ 1 year. Fertile men must agree to use an effective method of birth control during the study and for up to 6 months after the last dose of study drug All associated toxicity, except grade 2 alopecia, from previous cancer therapy must be resolved (to ≤ Grade 1 or Baseline) prior to study treatment administration (Grade 2 alopecia is allowed). Willingness and ability to provide written informed consent prior to any studyrelated procedures and to comply with all study requirements. Prior exposure to a bromodomain inhibitor Active graft versus host disease Known uncontrolled fungal, bacterial, and/or viral infection ≥ Grade 2 Uncontrolled autoimmune hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia Presence of symptomatic or uncontrolled central nervous system or leptomeningeal metastases (Note: Subjects with stable, treated brain metastases are eligible for this trial. However, subjects must not have required steroid treatment for their brain metastases within 30 days of Screening.) A diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) or chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in blast crisis Known or suspected allergy to the investigational agent or any agent given in association with this trial Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias including bradyarrhythmias and/or subjects who require antiarrhythmic therapy (excluding beta blockers or digoxin). Subjects with controlled atrial fibrillation are not excluded. Congenital long QT syndrome or subjects taking concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval except treatment required for infections with a low risk of QTc prolongation. Subjects on active anticoagulation therapy including warfarin, factor Xa inhibitors, thrombin inhibitors or heparin QTcF ≥ 450 msec (for males) or ≥ 470 msec (for females) at Screening History of clinically significant cardiac disease or congestive heart failure &gt;New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 2. Subjects must not have unstable angina (anginal symptoms at rest) or newonset angina within the last 3 months or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months. Hypertension as defined by systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg despite optimal medical management Arterial or venous thrombotic or embolic events such as cerebrovascular accident (including transient ischemic attacks), deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism within the 6 months before start of study medication (except for adequately treated catheterrelated venous thrombosis occurring more than 1 month before the start of study medication) Inability to take oral medication or significant nausea and vomiting, malabsorption, or significant small bowel resection that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude adequate absorption Nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture Known HIVpositive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy Subjects with known active hepatitis B or C, or chronic hepatitis B or C requiring treatment with antiviral therapy Presence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol Strong CYP3A4 and 2C8 inhibitors or inducers or CYP3A4 substrate drugs with a narrow therapeutic range within 14 days or 5 drug halflives, whichever is longer, before start of study drug Subjects with &gt; Grade 1 serum potassium, magnesium, or calcium levels Active secondary malignancy (either concurrent or within the last 3 years) that requires nonsurgical therapy (e.g., chemotherapy or radiation therapy), with the exception of surgically treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, melanoma insitu, or carcinoma insitu of the cervix Major surgery or significant traumatic injury within 14 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 Receipt of anticancer medications or investigational drugs within the following interval before the first administration of study drug: &lt; 14 days or 5 drug halflives, whichever is shorter, for chemotherapy and investigational agents &lt; 5 halflives for all other anticancer medications, or Sponsor approval leukopheresis and/or hydroxyurea for leukocytosis is allowed any time prior to and during the study to reduce WBC Radiation therapy within 14 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 Any medical condition(s) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with the study endpoints or the subject's ability to participate in the study</criteria>
