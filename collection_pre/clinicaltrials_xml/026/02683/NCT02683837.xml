	<brief_summary>The aim of this prospective randomized study is to evaluate the impact of peroperative pupillometry monitoring on per and post-operative opioid consumption in pediatric anesthesia. All patients are anesthetized with sevoflurane and remifentanil. In the intervention group, peroperative remifentanil infusion rate is guided by pupillometry. In the other group, remifentanil infusion rate is guided according to hemodynamic data.</brief_summary>
