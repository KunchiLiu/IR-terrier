	<criteria>Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 34 kg/mÂ², inclusive, at screening. BMI 35 may be accepted in case of 3point scored ascites. Minimum body weight of 50 kg. Vital signs (after 5 minutes resting in a supine position) that are within study specified ranges Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate doublebarrier method of contraception during the study and for 30 days after discharge. Subjects with impaired hepatic function: Clinical diagnosis of chronic hepatic disease (stable for more than 3 months) with a documented history of underlying hepatic insufficiency and no acute episodes of illness within 30 days prior to Day 1, and no significant change in disease status (ie, up to 1 point in the ChildPugh classification) from screening to Day 1. Control subjects with normal hepatic function: Clinical laboratory test results must be strictly within the normal laboratory reference ranges for liver function, and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) or, for other parameters, deemed as not clinically significant by the investigator. Presence of clinically significant physical, laboratory, or Electrocardiogram (ECG) findings (with the exception of those parameters that are resulting from the underlying hepatic disease) that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with any aspect of study conduct or interpretation of results. Clinically significant illness or disease as determined by medical history, including cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic (other than reason for their hepatic impairment), biliary, Gastrointestinal (GI), endocrinologic, or renal disorders, or cancer within the last 5 years (except localised or in situ nonmelanoma skin cancer), physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, and 12lead ECGs. Receipt of any investigational agent or study drug within 30 days or 10 halflives, whichever is longer, prior to dosing. Smoking more than 20 cigarettes (eg, 1 pack) per day or equivalent (eg, evapour cigarette, pipe, cigar, chewing tobacco, nicotine patch, nicotine gum); unable or unwilling to refrain from smoking and tobacco use for 2 hours prior to dosing and 4 hours after dose administration. History of any serious adverse reaction or hypersensitivity to any inactive component of telotristat etiprate (ie, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium (disintegrant), talc, silicon dioxide, and magnesium stearate (nonbovine)). Existence of any surgical or medical condition that, in the judgment of the investigator and the sponsor's, medical monitor, might interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of telotristat etiprate. History of any major surgery within 6 months or anticipated surgery prior to Day 1. History of renal disease or significantly abnormal kidney function test. History of any active infection within 30 days prior to Day 1, if deemed clinically significant by the investigator.</criteria>
