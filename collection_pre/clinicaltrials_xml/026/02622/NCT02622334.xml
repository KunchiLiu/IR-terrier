	<criteria>Diagnosis of ocular hypertension (OHT) or primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) in at least one eye (qualifying eye) as determined by the Investigator at screening or based on a reliable and documented assessment done within the last 6 months prior to screening provided that no progression of visual field damage is expected At baseline visit, intraocular pressure (IOP) &gt;= 24 mmHg in the morning and &gt;= 21 mmHg in the afternoon measurement in at least one eye (qualifying eye = study eye) and =&lt; 34 mmHg at all time points in both eyes Best corrected logMAR visual acuity score of 0.7 (20/100 Snellen) or better in each eye as measured by ETDRS visual acuity test at screening Central corneal pachymetry measurement 420 to 620 micrometer in qualifying eye at screening Cuptodisk ratio =&lt; 0.8 (both eyes) at screening Anterior chamber angle is open and nonoccludable as confirmed by the Investigator by gonioscopy examination at screening History of any clinically significant gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, bronchopulmonary, neurological, psychiatric, cardiovascular, endocrinological, hematological or allergic disease (multiple allergies, seasonal allergy is acceptable), metabolic disorder, cancer or cirrhosis Uncontrolled hypertension (SBP &gt;= 160 mmHg and/or DBP &gt;= 100 mmHg) despite treatment at the time of screening confirmed by the average of &gt;= 3 blood pressure measurements, properly measured with wellmaintained equipment Clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory test results at screening Hypersensitivity to RO5093151 or any of the components of its formulation, or hypersensitivity to latanoprost or any of the components of its formulation (Part B only) Donation of blood over 500 mL within three months prior to screening Positive result on hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), or HIV 1 and 2 Presence of narrow angle (=&lt; grade 2 Shaffer gonioscopic classification) or complete or partial closure, as measured by gonioscopy or at risk for angle closure as assessed by the Investigator Other forms of glaucoma than POAG or OHT in the study eye Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry Any clinically significant corneal scarring, haze or opacity Patient uncooperativeness that restricts adequate examination of IOP, ocular fundus or anterior chamber Evidence of clinically significant blepharitis, concurrent infectious/noninfectious conjunctivitis, keratitis or uveitis History or signs of penetrating ocular trauma. Uneventful (uncomplicated) cataract surgery performed 3 months prior to screening is allowed According to the Investigator's best judgment, risk of visual field or visual acuity worsening in either eye as a consequence of glaucoma progression or consequence of participation in the trial (i.e., during washout of ocular hypotensive medications or treatment with placebo) or any other ocular disease Unable to safely stop ocular hypotension medications prior to randomization according to the required minimum washout periods History of any ocular filtering surgical intervention, previous glaucoma intraocular surgery, or laser trabeculoplasty History of refractive surgery (laser assisted insitu keratomileusis, laser epithelial keratomileusis, photorefractive keratectomy, phototherapeutic keratectomy) Any other intraocular surgery within 6 months of screening Advanced agerelated macular degeneration (wet or dry), vitreous hemorrhage, diabetic retinopathy or any progressive retinal or optic nerve disease from any cause other than glaucoma</criteria>
