	<brief_summary>Diabetes is considered an oxidative stress and a chronic inflammatory disease. Coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone) is recognized as a lipid soluble antioxidant. Ubiquinol is a reduced form of coenzyme Q10 in our body after food or supplements intakes. Studies have indicated that the water-soluble ubiquinol had better antioxidant activity and absorption than lipid-soluble. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a water-soluble ubiquinol supplement (100 mg/d) on antioxidation and anti-inflammation in diabetes patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Water-soluble Ubiquinol Supplementation on Blood Glucose, Lipids, Oxidative Stress, and Inflammation in Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patients with type 2 diabetes will recruit as subjects (n = 50) and randomly assign to the placebo (n = 25) or coenzyme Q10 groups (n = 25). The intervention will administer for 12 weeks. The concentrations of coenzyme Q10, oxidative stress marker (malondialdehyde), antioxidant enzymes activities (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase), inflammatory markers [C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin-6 (IL-6)], and biochemical parameters (fasting glucose, A1C, insulin, C-peptide, and lipid profiles), and blood pressure will measure. Hopefully, the results of this study could provide the information of water-soluble ubiquinol supplement for clinical doctors and dietitians recommend that diabetes patients deserve to know whether the use of coenzyme Q10 supplement.</detailed_description>
