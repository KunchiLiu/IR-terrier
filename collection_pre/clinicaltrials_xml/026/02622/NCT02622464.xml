	<brief_summary>Post-operative scarring on vocal cords is responsible for disorders of the vibration of the lining to the original dysphonia can be troublesome for the patient both in his private and professional life. There is no currently codified treatment for this type of situation and no therapeutic antifibrotic has been effective. Cell therapy is a promising new approach.After a liposuction and removing of mature adipocytes (40 to 60%), the remaining cells called stromal vascular fraction (SVF) could be isolated. SVF consists of a heterogeneous cell population including multipotent stem cells similar to mesenchymal stem cells present in bone marrow. The investigators hypothesis is that the trophic and antifibrotic properties of SVF could benefit patients with vocal cords scarring responsible for dysphonia.</brief_summary>
