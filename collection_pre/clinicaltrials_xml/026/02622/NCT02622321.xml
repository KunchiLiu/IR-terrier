	<brief_summary>This multicenter, open-label study will evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of prophylactic emicizumab treatment in patients previously treated with episodic or prophylactic bypassing agents. Episodic bypassing agent patients will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to receive emicizumab prophylaxis (Arm A) versus no prophylaxis (Arm B) and will be stratified across Arms A and B according to the number of bleeds they experienced over the last 24 weeks prior to study entry (less than [&lt;] 9 or greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 9 bleeds); Arm B patients will have the opportunity to switch to emicizumab prophylaxis after 24 weeks on-study. Prophylactic bypassing agent patients will switch to emicizumab prophylaxis (Arm C) from the start of the trial; enrollment will be extended for 24 weeks after the last patient has enrolled in Arms A or B or until approximately 50 patients have enrolled in Arm C, whichever occurs first. Episodic bypassing agent patients who previously participated in a Non-Interventional Study BH29768 but were unable to enroll in Arms A or B prior to their closure will have the opportunity to enroll in Arm D until 24 weeks after the last patient has enrolled in Arms A or B or until approximately 35 patients have enrolled in Arm D, whichever occurs first. Like patients in Arms A and C, Arm D patients will receive emicizumab prophylaxis from the start of the trial. All patients will continue to receive standard of care/background treatment with their usual episodic bypassing agent therapy to treat breakthrough bleeds, as needed.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients aged 12 years or older at the time of informed consent Body weight &gt;=40 kg at the time of screening Diagnosis of congenital hemophilia A of any severity and documented history of hightiter inhibitor (i.e., &gt;=5 Bethesda Units [BU]) Documentation of treatment with episodic or prophylactic bypassing agents for at least the last 24 weeks &gt;=6 bleeds in the last 24 weeks prior to screening (if on an episodic bypassing agent regimen) or &gt;=2 bleeds in the last 24 weeks prior to screening (if on a prophylactic bypassing agent regimen) Adequate hematologic function Adequate hepatic function Adequate renal function For women who are not postmenopausal or surgically sterile: agreement to remain abstinent or use single or combined highly effective contraceptive methods Inherited or acquired bleeding disorder other than hemophilia A Ongoing (or plan to receive during the study) immune tolerance induction therapy or prophylaxis with Factor VIII (FVIII), with the exception of patients who have received a treatment regimen of FVIII prophylaxis with concurrent bypassing agent prophylaxis Previous (in the past 12 months) or current treatment for thromboembolic disease (with the exception of previous catheterassociated thrombosis for which antithrombotic treatment is not currently ongoing) or current signs of thromboembolic disease Other conditions (e.g., certain autoimmune diseases) that may increase the risk of bleeding or thrombosis History of clinically significant hypersensitivity associated with monoclonal antibody therapies or components of the emicizumab injection Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with CD4 count &lt;200 cells/microliter within 24 weeks prior to screening Use of systemic immunomodulators (e.g., interferon or rituximab) at enrollment or planned use during the study, with the exception of antiretroviral therapy Concurrent disease, treatment, or abnormality in clinical laboratory tests that could interfere with the conduct of the study or that would, in the opinion of the investigator or Sponsor, preclude the patient's safe participation in and completion of the study or interpretation of the study results Planned surgery (excluding minor procedures such as tooth extraction or incision and drainage) during the study Receipt of Emicizumab in a prior investigational study An investigational drug to treat or reduce the risk of hemophilic bleeds within 5 halflives of last drug administration A nonhemophiliarelated investigational drug within last 30 days or 5 halflives, whichever is shorter An investigational drug concurrently Unwillingness to use highly effective contraception methods for the specified duration in the protocol (females only, unless required otherwise by the local health authority) Clinically significant abnormality on screening evaluations or laboratory tests that, in the opinion of the investigator, may pose an additional risk in administering study drug to the patient Pregnancy or lactation, or intent to become pregnant during the study</criteria>
