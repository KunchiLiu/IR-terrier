	<brief_summary>Maternal hypotension is the most frequent complication of a spinal Anesthesia. The prevention of spinal hypotension appears more likely to decrease the frequency and severity of associated adverse maternal symptoms than the treatment of established hypotension. Intravenous fluid administration prior to spinal anesthesia for caesarean section is accepted standard practice. The choice of fluid depends on individual and institutional habit, material cost (crystalloid is considerably cheaper) and the perceived relative benefits and risks. Uncommon but potentially serious adverse effect of colloids is impaired coagulation. Although pregnancy is associated with hypercoagulability, little is known about the effects of colloid preloading on coagulation in pregnant patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The patients were divided into two equal group of thirty patients in each group; Control group (normotensive pregnant women) and Mild preeclampsia group. In both groups patients preloaded with 500 mL hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 6% (130/0.4) (Voluven). Spinal anesthesia will be performed with intrathecal 10-12 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine in addition to 200 meg morphine. The patient was placed supine with left lateral tilt to alleviate aortocaval compression. 10 ml/kg of isotonic 0.9 sodium chloride (NaCl) solutions will be used co loading during the duration of the operation. Blood pressure was measured and recorded every three minutes. If severe hypotension (fall of &gt; 20% of mean arterial pressure from baseline) occurred, vasopressors, 6 mg ephedrine (per dose) will be used. The blood pressure will rechecked 1 minute after each doses of ephedrine. If hypotension persisted after 30 mg of ephedrine, an additional 2 ml/kg of isotonic 0.9 NaCl solutions will be infused rapidly. Maternal hypotension is defined as at least a single administration of ephedrine within the period from induction of spinal anesthesia until transfer to postoperative recovery unit. Reactive hypertension is characterized as a blood pressure 20% greater than baseline mean levels after the use of the vasopressor. Bradycardia is defined as a fall of &gt;30% of heart rate from baseline or &lt;50 beats /minute. Bradycardia, and when associated with hypotension it will be treated with 0.5 mg of atropine intravenous. Upon completion of the cesarean section, the subject will be transported to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU).</detailed_description>
