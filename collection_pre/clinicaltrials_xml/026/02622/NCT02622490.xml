	<detailed_description>Thirty participants come to the metabolic ward at about 8 oÂ´clock in the fasting state and stay until lunch on four occasions each. The participants are randomized to the order of the test meals. The meals have a total caloric content of 750 kcal and have either 50% of energy from carbohydrates (low fat) or 20% of energy from carbohydrates (low carb.). The meals are consumed on one occasion in the morning or divided in 5 portions (150 kcal each) for every 30 minutes, i.e. total combinations of meal composition and of meal distribution is 4. Effects of the food on p-glucose, s-insulin, blood-lipids, hormones and on metabolic rate is measured by blood tests or by indirect calorimetry (for metabolic rate). Sense of satiety is measured by visual analogue scales.</detailed_description>
