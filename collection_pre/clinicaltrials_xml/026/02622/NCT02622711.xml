	<detailed_description>The InForma project is designed as a mono-institutional randomized controlled 4-arm parallel-group trial. Potential study participants will be recruited among all overweight or obese breast cancer patients previously treated at the European Institute of Oncology (IEO). Potential study participants will be recruited after breast cancer treatments (surgery, chemotherapy and and/or radiation) will be completed. Study participants will be randomized to one of the 4 arms: DI - Dietary Intervention; PAI - Physical Activity Intervention; PADI - Physical Activity and Dietary Intervention; LII - Less Intensive Intervention. Enrolled patients will receive a 6-month intervention and will be followed until the end of the study period with two additional follow-up visits at 12- and 24-month. The main aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of the intervention programme on body weight change in overweight or obese breast cancer patients.</detailed_description>
