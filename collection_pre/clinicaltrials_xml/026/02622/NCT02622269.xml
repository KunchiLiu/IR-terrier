	<brief_title>Patient-driven Compression in Urography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are subjected to radiation from radiographical studies. The nurse can reduce the radiation dose for the individual by using dose-reducing measures. One of these is compression. It is known that compression in urography reduces the radiation dose because the radiation has less tissue to transverse when it is compressed. By reducing patient radiation doses, the risk of harmful radiation effects is reduced. This study aims to study if a patient-regulated compression device can reduce the radiation dose as effectively as the conventional compression, regulated by the nurse. Two compression devices are investigated in each patient, in randomized order. Aims of the study: 1. Evaluate if the radiation doses are comparable with a patient-regulated compression device and conventional compression. 2. Evaluate image quality with the two devices. 3. Describe patients' experiences from using the two devices.</detailed_description>
