	<brief_title>ACute Uncomplicated Type b Aortic Dissection: Endovascular Repair vs. Best Medical Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design: This is a prospective, two-arm, parallel-group, single-center, pragmatic, randomized clinical trial. Population: The target population comprises all adult patients aged 18 years and older who present with uncomplicated acute type B aortic dissection. The study sample will include 436 subjects of both genders and any race or ethnicity. Procedures: Eligible and consented patients will be enrolled into the study if all eligibility criteria are met and will be randomly allocated to one of the two study arms: BMT vs BMT+TEVAR Study Duration: The study will accrue patients over the course of 4 years and total follow up per patient for 5 years. Overall duration of the study is anticipated to be 9 years Endpoints: - Primary Outcome: To determine all-cause mortality among both study arms. - Secondary Outcomes: To assess any major morbidity events (rupture, aortic intervention or reintervention, progression to complicated dissection, aneurysm formation, malperfusion resulting in organ failure, and aorta-specific mortality), as will quality of life measures, temporal discounting assessment and outcomes comparison in an observational cohort of patients who decline to be randomized due to a strong treatment preference. Risks and Benefits: Since this study involves only usual care and FDA-approved treatments, the investigators do not expect any additional physical risks to patients beyond those associated with usual care. One discernible risk involved in study participants is an unintentional disclosure of sensitive patient health information. The participants of this study do not stand to benefit directly from taking part. However, the investigators hope that the results obtained from this study would provide useful information that would help delineate a standard and economical management protocol for acute Type B aortic dissection in future.</detailed_description>
