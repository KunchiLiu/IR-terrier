	<brief_summary>Breathlessness is a common and distressing symptom in patients with advanced diseases like cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic heart failure (CHF) or lung fibrosis, which broadly impacts on patients' quality of life and may result in high burden for carers. This single-blinded randomized controlled fast track trial evaluates the effectiveness of a multi-professional breathlessness service in patients with advanced and chronic diseases. The intervention group will get immediate access to the breathlessness service whereas the control group will receive standard care and get access to the service after a waiting time of eight weeks. Primary endpoints are mastery of breathlessness and quality of life, measured with the CRQ (Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire) as well as the reduction of symptom burden of patients and burden of carers. The evaluation of the cost effectiveness of the breathlessness service from the perspective of the German health system is a further study aim.</brief_summary>
