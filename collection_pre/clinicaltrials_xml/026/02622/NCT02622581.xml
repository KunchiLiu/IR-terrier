	<brief_title>Clinical Research Platform Into Molecular Testing, Treatment and Outcome of Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thorough knowledge of the treatment reality, e.g. characteristics, diagnostic, treatment and outcome of unselected patients in real-life practice, is crucial to evaluate and improve the quality of care for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The purpose of CRISP is to set up a national clinical research platform to document uniform data on the molecular testing, treatment, course of disease in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC not amenable to curative treatment. A particular focus is on molecular biomarker testing of patients before the start of first-line treatment. The data shall be used to assess the current state of care and to develop recommendations concerning topics that could be improved. PRO assessment will provide large-scale data on quality of life and anxiety/depression for real-life patients in routine practice. In addition, two questionnaires (concerning individual quality of life and patient-caregiver communication) will be validated in German patients with metastatic NSCLC. Furthermore CRISP will set up a decentralized clinically annotated tissue repository for future collaborative, investigational scientific biomarker testing.</detailed_description>
