	<brief_summary>The main goal of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the NOVA-DN VEP protocol and a new software and method (Corda) for the glaucoma detection using optical coherence tomography images. Another objective is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of these tests to differentiate between normal subjects and glaucoma suspects. The hypothesis is that the NOVA-DN VEP protocol and Corda analysis results in a high sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (ROC area) for the glaucoma detection. Another hypothesis is that the NOVA-DN VEP protocol and some Corda parameters can differentiate between normal subjects and glaucoma suspects.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of the NOVA-DN VEP protocol and Corda parameters to discriminate between healthy eyes and eyes with early to moderate glaucomatous visual field loss. For this purpose the sensitivity (specificity cutoffs of 85%, 90%, and 95%) and ROC of Corda parameters will be obtained. We will evaluate those measurements of the NOVA-DN VEP protocol, Corda software and the Cirrus SD-OCT software in order to compare and correlate those analyses.</detailed_description>
