	<brief_summary>Bone metastases are common in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and can have devastating consequences. Preventing or delaying bone metastases may improve outcomes. Bisphosphonates are inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. The current indications for bisphosphonates include the treatment of metabolic disorders of bone metabolism (e.g., osteoporosis and Paget's disease), the treatment of hypercalcaemia of malignancy (HCM), and the prevention of skeletal-related events(SREs）from malignant bone disease. Clinical trials also confirm that bisphosphonates, and zoledronic acid（ZOL) in particular, can prevent bone loss from cancer treatment.There is also emerging evidence that the benefits of bisphosphonate therapy in the oncology setting are more extensive. This study will evaluate whether the addition of ZOL 4 mg every 3 months for up to 1 years in patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC could reduce the rate of bone metastases ,improve progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival(OS), and delay time to bone metastases .</brief_summary>
