	<brief_title>Advanced Methods for Cancer Detection by Vaginal Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most high grade ovarian cancers originate in the fallopian tubes. Since the lining of the fallopian tube opens into the uterine cavity cancer cells from ovarian/fallopian tube cancers can travel through the uterus to the cervix and vagina. Likewise, endometrial cancer cells shed through the cervix into the vagina. It may be possible to develop a screening test for ovarian and endometrial cancers by collecting vaginal cells.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ovarian Cancer and Endometrial Cancer cases: 1. Women age 19 or older. 2. Histologically confirmed high grade serous cancer (had a preoperative core biopsy) of ovarian/fallopian tube/peritoneal origin or histocytologically confirmed endometrial cancer, not yet treated by surgery or chemotherapy. 3. Give consent to access primary tumour tissue following surgery or biopsy. Healthy participants: 1) Healthy women between the ages of 19 and 60. Ovarian Cancer and Endometrial Cancer cases: 1. Women with selfreported, known pregnancy. Healthy participants: 2. Women with a prior diagnosis of gynecologic malignancy (ovarian, endometrial, cervical, or vulvar cancer) will be excluded. 3. Women who report irregular bleeding (spotting between menstrual cycles, or postmenopausal bleeding), or who have selfreported gynecologic concerns (e.g. pelvic pain, pelvic masses, dyspareunia) or have had a recent evaluation for gynecologic concerns (consultation with a gynecologist, pelvic ultrasound, endometrial biopsy) are ineligible. 4. Women with known Lynch Syndrome and/or BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations will not be eligible to participate as healthy volunteers for this study. 5. Women with selfreported, known pregnancy.</criteria>
