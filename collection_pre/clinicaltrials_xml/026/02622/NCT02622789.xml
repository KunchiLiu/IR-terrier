	<brief_title>Efficacy and Influence of Pilates Based Physical Therapy Exercises for Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low back pain (LBP) is becoming a major public health problem associated with enormous economic burden on the modern society. Despite conservative interventions such as Pilates back exercises are routinely prescribed in clinical practice, most studies to date have only assessed its efficacy based on subjective patient reported outcomes with limited objective data available to clearly demonstrate the benefit of Pilates exercise on spinal alignment and mobility. Furthermore, patient adherence has been well identified to be an obstacle for effective home exercise program and the most cost-effective strategy to improve patient compliance remain unknown. Current study therefore aims to fulfil this gap in our knowledge by assessing the change of spinal alignment and kinematics utilizing dynamic radiographs performed pre- and post- a 6-week Pilates based physical therapy exercise program compare to a more generic hospital based back care exercise program. Furthermore, the effectiveness of conducing weekly phone reminders for 6 weeks on improving short (6-month) and long (12-month) term functional outcomes and patient compliance will also be assessed.</detailed_description>
