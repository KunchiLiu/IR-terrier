	<brief_summary>Introduction: Population aging is associated with increased prevalence of chronic diseases. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world population, affecting motor function and functional independence progressively. The physiological aging promotes the gradual reduction of body weight, lung function, peripheral muscle strength, cardiopulmonary endurance and physical capacity, which increase the debilitating effects. Aging, when associated with PD, can induce loss of functionality, postural changes, further affecting the nutritional status, worsening the quality of life and functional independence of the individual. Although physical therapy is commonly applied with a variety of methodologies to PD patients, evidence for the effectiveness of these interventions is lacking. Objective: The primary objective of the study is to compare the effects of Functional Training, Stationary Bike and Exergaming Exercises on proportion of fallers in elderly participants with PD. In addition, the secondary objectives are to compare the effects on cardiopulmonary endurance, posture, postural control, executive function, quality of life and functionality of individuals with PD. Methodology: This is an interventional, randomized, blinded, longitudinal and prospective study. This research will be conducted in the State Reference Center for Health Care of the Elderly (CREASI). The sample will consist of 63 individuals with PD per group. The Experimental Group 1 will be submitted to Functional Training, the Experimental Group 2 with undergo training with Stationary Bike and the Experimental Group 3 will be submitted to exergame training using Xbox360 with KinectTM sensor. All the interventions will be performed three times per week, with 50 minutes per session, during 8 weeks.</brief_summary>
