	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate topical treatment with Veregen™ 15% ointment as a single therapeutic agent and compare it to combination therapy with Veregen ™ 15% ointment and a single destructive treatment by cryotherapy for non-facial verruca vulgaris in the pediatric population. The investigators will compare the single and combination treatment modalities over identical time points in patients with non-facial verruca vulgaris. One of the current options for care for non-facial verruca includes cryotherapy, which is a painful and destructive method performed in the pediatric dermatology clinic. This study aims to establish the safety, non-invasivenature, efficiency, and efficacy of Veregen ™ 15% ointment as monotherapyfor non-facial verruca vulgaris in the pediatric population. The investigators hypothesize that Veregen ™ 15% ointment monotherapy will non-invasively treat non-facial verruca vulgaris with similar efficacy as combination therapy with a single cryotherapy treatment followed by topical application of Veregen ™ ointment. This novel treatment modality will be useful in the pediatric dermatology community offering a less invasive, painless option for treatment of non-facial verruca vulgaris.</brief_summary>
