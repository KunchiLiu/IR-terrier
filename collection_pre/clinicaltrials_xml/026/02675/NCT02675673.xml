	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the quality of life (QOL) in head and neck patients who are given the GJ tube (which is placed in the bowel) versus those who are given the G-Tube (which is placed in the stomach) for prophylactic feeding. The standard of care for patients at Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) is using GJ tubes. Patients who agree to be in the study will be randomized to either the GJ-Tube or the G-Tube arm. Patients randomized to the G-tube will receive prophylactic intravenous and oral antibiotics prior to insertion of the G-tube. Antibiotics will be given for a total of 1 week. A few hours following tube insertion (on return to PMH ward), patients will complete a single item, visual analogue pain scale (VAS). Patients will remain in hospital for a minimum of 24 hours and until the patient and/or family is able to care for the Enteric Feeding(EF) device at home. Patients randomized to the GJ-Tube may receive i.v medication during the procedure. All Patients will be asked to fill out several questionnaires at different time- points of the study. All Patients will have regular assessments to evaluate their overall quality of Life, toxicity, and how they respond to treatment during the study. Patients will also be assessed after they completed study treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feeding Tube in Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prophylactic enteral feeding tubes are used routinely for nutritional support during intensive radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer. Typically, tubes remain in place for up to 3-4 months. Whether small-bore jejunal (GJ) or larger bore gastric (G) tubes are used varies geographically, based on tradition, physician preference and availability of services. Feeding tube placement is arranged either prior to the start of RT, or more commonly within the first 2 weeks of RT, prior to the onset of severe mucositis. Patients are admitted to hospital for 1-3 days to monitor side effects of the procedure, and to allow our dietetic and nursing staff to provide intensive teaching on the use and care of the tube. Feeding tubes are kept in place through the treatment course and removed once patients are able to meet their calorie needs and maintain body weight through oral feeding. On average, feeding tubes are removed approximately 2-3 months after completion of RT; however, approximately 20% of patients may still require enteral feeding at 1 year post-treatment. This study will compare the QOL in patients who use the G tube versus the GJ tube.</detailed_description>
