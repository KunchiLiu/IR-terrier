	<brief_summary>Increasing ablative zone is an essential part to improve technical success and long term outcome in patient treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA). A combination of dual switching system and separable clustered electrode has been reported to create large ablative zone in preclinical study. Based on preclinical study, the investigators conducted a preliminary study in eligible 60 patients to measure whether this combination (dual switching system and separable clustered electrode) improves technical success rate and local tumor progression rate over a year, in comparison with historical control group.</brief_summary>
