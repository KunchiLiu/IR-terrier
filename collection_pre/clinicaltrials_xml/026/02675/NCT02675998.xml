	<brief_summary>This phase 3, 8-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multi-center study with a 4-week, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal period will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Tenapanor to treat hyperphosphatemia in end-stage renal disease patients on hemodialysis (ESRD-HD). Subjects who qualify are randomized into the study will either receive 3 mg BID, 10 mg BID, or a titration regimen of tenapanor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An 8-Week Study to Evaluate Tenapanor in the Treatment of Hyperphosphatemia in End-Stage Renal Disease Patients on Hemodialysis (ESRD-HD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consists of a screening visit, a wash out period of up to 3 weeks, when existing phosphate lowering medication is withheld, an 8-week treatment period, in which all groups receive tenapanor, and a 4-week placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal period, during which patients are re-randomized 1:1 to either remain on their current tenapanor treatment or placebo. Depending on the increase in serum phosphate levels, subjects can be randomized 1,2, or 3 weeks after being taken off their phosphate lowering medication.</detailed_description>
