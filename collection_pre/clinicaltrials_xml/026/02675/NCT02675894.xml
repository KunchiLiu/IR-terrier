	<brief_title>Radiofrequency Ablation Using Cooled-Wet Electrode</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine safety, ablative zone, technical success rate and early safety data (12 months local tumor progression rate) of recently introduced cooled-wet electrode in eligible patients who are indicative for radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for liver tumors in comparison with currently used separable clustered electrode in our institution. Owing to tissue cooling effect of internally cooled-wet electrode can be used in switching bipolar mode. Patients would be randomized into two groups (cool-wet electrode group and separable clustered electrode in switching monopolar mode). The results from this preliminary study would be used for main study to compare the efficacy and safety data between two electrodes in the future.</detailed_description>
