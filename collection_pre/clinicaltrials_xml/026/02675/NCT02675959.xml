	<brief_summary>This is a follow-up trial to NYMC 526 (NCT01461837) to assess the safety, efficacy and toxicity of administering Defibrotide prophylaxis for high-risk sickle cell patients undergoing a familial haploidentical allogeneic stem cell transplantation with CD34 enrichment and T-cell addback. This patient population historically has a risk of developing sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS) and Defibrotide has demonstrated efficacy in treatment of SOS.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must demonstrate one or more of the following Sickle Cell Disease Complications (or patients in Cohort 2 can meet the criteria in section 4.4 instead) Clinically significant neurologic event (stroke) or any neurologic deficit lasting &gt;24 hours that is accompanied by an infarct on cerebral MRI Minimum of two episodes of acute chest syndrome (defined as new pulmonary alveolar consolidation involving at least one complete lung segment associated with acute symptoms including fever &gt;38.5, chest pain, tachypnea, intercostal retractions, nasal flaring, use of accessory muscles of respiration, wheezing, rales, or cough not attributable to asthma or bronchiolitis) in the preceding two year period prior to enrollment that have failed, been noncompliant or declined hydroxyurea treatment, or prior to chronic RBC transfusion therapy, exchange transfusion or erythrocyte pheresis. The acute chest syndrome event occured despite adequate supportive care measures (i.e. despite the use of supportive care and interventions including asthma therapy and/or hydroxyurea; patients who decline hydroxyurea or noncompliant with this therapy are eligible if they meet the other pulmonary criteria defined above for inclusion). Recurrent painful events (at least 3 in the 2 years prior to enrollment or prior to chronic chronic RBC transfusion therapy, exchange transfusion or erythrocyte pheresis). Pain occurred in typical sites associated with vasoocclusive painful events and cannot be explained by causes other than sickle cell disease. Pain lasted at least 24 hours and required parenteral narcotic treatment, or an equianalgesic dose of oral narcotics or parenteral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. These painful events may have been treated in any setting; however, the events, including events that were managed at home, will be considered for eligibility only if there is documentation of the event in a clinical record that may be reviewed by the investigator. Abnormal TCD study requiring starting on chronic transfusion therapy and/or exchange transfusions. At least one silent infarct lesion on a MRI scan of the head. An infarctlike lesion is defined as an MRI signal abnormality that is at least 3 mm in one dimension and that is visible in two planes on fluidattenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) T2weighted images, as determined by a neuroradiologist.207 = OR for Cohort #2 ONLY 98: Patient must be between 21 and 34.99 years of age, patients must demonstrate at least two of the following: WBC &gt; 13,500 cells/microliter at baseline when not acutely ill (on two separate occasions) &gt; 2 weeks from a VOC event or hospitalization. Tricuspid Regurgitant Jet Velocity (TRV) &gt; 3.0 m/s Requiring Chronic Monthly Transfusions ( &gt; 12 transfusions in the 12 months) History of sepsis Nterminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) &gt; 160 ng/L at clinical baseline when not acutely ill or hospitalized. Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding are not eligible SCD Patients with documented uncontrolled infection at the time of study entry are not eligible. SCD patients who have an unaffected HLA matched family donor willing to proceed to donation will not be eligible for this study. Karnofsky or Lansky (age appropriate) Performance Score &lt;50% (hemiplegia alone secondary to a previous stroke is not an exclusion) Demonstrated lack of compliance with medical care. Patients with clinically significant fibrosis or cirrhosis of the liver will not be eligible. Patients who have previously received a HSCT will not be eligible. Patients with contraindications to the use of defibrotide</criteria>
