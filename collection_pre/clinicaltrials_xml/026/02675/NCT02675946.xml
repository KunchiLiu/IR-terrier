	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1 study consisting of a Dose Escalation Phase and a Dose Expansion Phase to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, and clinical activity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of CGX1321 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the Dose Escalation Phase is to examine the safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose of CGX1321 when administered to subjects with advanced solid tumors including GI tumors that have relapsed or are refractory to or not considered medically suitable to receive standard of care treatment who meet the entry criteria. Once the dose is identified in the Dose Escalation Phase, the Dose Expansion Phase will start. The purpose of the Dose Expansion Phase is to continue to examine the safety and confirm the final Phase 2 dose of CGX1321 when administered to subjects with advanced GI tumors who meet the entry criteria.</detailed_description>
