	<brief_summary>This study is an international, multi-center, study of Pompe disease patients that are currently receiving enzyme-replacement therapy (ERT). The purpose of this study is to find out if the co-administration of investigational new drugs ATB200 and AT2221 is safe in adults with Pompe disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>First-In-Human Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, and PK of Intravenous ATB200 Alone and When Co-Administered With Oral AT2221</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, fixed-sequence, ascending-dose, first-in-human study to evaluate the effect of a highly targeted rhGAA (ATB200) co-administered with a chaperone (AT2221). The study aims to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity of ATB200 co-administered with AT2221. The study will be conducted in 3 stages. In Stage 1, safety, tolerability, and PK will be evaluated following sequential single ascending doses of intravenously infused ATB200. In Stage 2, safety, tolerability, and PK will be evaluated following single- and multiple-ascending dose combinations of ATB200 and AT2221. In Stage 3, long term safety and efficacy will be assessed following 24 month treatment of ATB200 co-administered with AT2221 (Miglustat) No Muscle biopsies will be performed in this study.</detailed_description>
