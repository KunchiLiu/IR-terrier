	<brief_summary>This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) is multi-center, parallel-arm, and open label. It will test the feasibility and safety of randomizing elderly patients with end-stage kidney failure starting hemodialysis with a tunneled/non-tunneled catheter to one of the following vascular access strategies: (a) attempt at fistula creation (intervention), or (b) continued use of a catheter (comparator). A total number of 100 participants will be enrolled in this pilot RCT. The rationale for this trial includes: (1) the importance of the intervention question related to the choice of vascular access for patients treated with hemodialysis; (2) lack of evidence from clinical trials for decision-making in this area (only observational studies are available); (3) existing studies which suggest that fistula use is associated with better patient outcomes are very prone to selection bias; (4) need for a clinical trial comparing the impact of the two most frequently chosen strategies for vascular access (catheter and fistula) in the hemodialysis population; and (5) a feasible and safe trial design. The results obtained from this pilot RCT will determine the feasibility and safety of conducting a large RCT, which will be powered for the primary outcome of all-cause mortality.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ACCESS HD: Comparing Catheters to Fistulas in Elderly Patients Starting Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose: This pilot RCT will help to address challenges related to patient recruitment, protocol adherence, safety, and data collection in the hemodialysis population. The primary outcome for this pilot RCT is feasibility, which will be measured by patient recruitment and protocol adherence. The secondary outcomes include feasibility-related outcomes, safety (which will include expected procedure-related outcomes and causes for hospital admissions), and other protocol violations. Hypothesis: Results obtained from the pilot RCT will provide feasibility and safety data for conducting a large RCT, which will establish a better understanding of the clinical outcomes associated with the use of fistula versus catheter for vascular access in the hemodialysis population. Research Method: This is a multicenter, open-label, RCT, and is expected to be conducted over 36 months. All screened people who meet the eligibility criteria will have the following data collected in a minimal dataset: eligibility, age, sex, program/center, height, weight, comorbid conditions, and details of any prior treatment for acute or chronic kidney failure (e.g., previous peritoneal dialysis, kidney transplant, or hemodialysis). Every consented participant will have the following additional data collected at baseline: baseline laboratory values, baseline hemodialysis initiation, history of access procedures, patient-reported outcome measures (includes data on quality of life and a vascular access questionnaire), and grip strength. The pilot RCT will consist of 6 months of site preparation, approximately 24 months of participant accrual, and 6 months of additional follow-up time for the last randomized participant. An additional 6 months will be used to assess the preliminary data, prepare the report of this pilot RCT, and to prepare and submit funding applications for the large RCT. Participants in the pilot RCT will be rolled into the large RCT, and will therefore be followed for a total of 36 months (3 years) after randomization to assess adherence to the trial protocol, assess safety outcomes, and collect qualitative data. Statistical Analysis Plan: The primary analysis of the pilot RCT will be descriptive. The proportion of people meeting each of the feasibility endpoints with accompanying 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. Investigators will describe participant characteristics and evaluate reasons for protocol violation, as well as calculate rates of drop-ins and other events. Interim or subgroup analyses will not be conducted in this pilot RCT. Expected Procedure-Related Outcomes (Safety Data): As both catheter and fistula treatment strategies are standard of care, the procedure-related outcomes are well known. Investigators will collect only expected procedure-related outcomes (i.e., events that have a potentially causal relationship to the strategy) that occur within 7 days of the execution of any access related intervention. These will include hospital admissions and prolongation of hospitalization, status changes, bacterial infections, catheter or exit site infections, cannulation injury events. In addition, sites will report all incidents of participant death that occur during the trial period. Cause of death will be determined by trial site investigators, based on a trial-specific list of classifications, and will be adjudicated for accuracy by appropriate members of the trial steering committee, who will be blinded to treatment arm.</detailed_description>
