	<brief_summary>The discovery of antenatal bilateral renal anomaly poses an essential question: can we predict postnatal renal function in short, medium and long term? Ultrasound appears sufficient in severe or mild forms. In the "Intermediaries" form (normal size dysplastic kidneys with persistence of amniotic fluid), ultrasound and current markers do not predict postnatal renal function evolution. The objective of this study is to estimate the specificity and sensitivity of amniotic biomarkers profile in the diagnosis of renal functionality in fetuses with bilateral nephropathy development.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: All fetuses with a bilateral abnormal renal development (structure modification of the parenchyma with or without urinary tract abnormalities associated) The following sonographic criteria are used: Fetal kidney size &lt;2.5ep or &lt;2 standard deviation (SD) defining renal hypoplasia or renal size&gt; 97.5ep or&gt; 2 SD defining nephromegaly And / or hyperechogenicity (more echogenic than the liver kidney) And / or cysts And / or abnormal corticomedullary differentiation (decrease or lack thereof) And / or bilateral cortical thinning And / or the possibility of an initial unilateral renal disease in the case of a pathology on which kidney damage is usually to become bilateral during evolution EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Foetuses with severe malformations that can change the amniotic or urine proteome: complex heart disease, digestive stenosis, fetal immobility. Fetus whose mother has chronic infectious diseases (HIV, hepatitis B and C) or acute infectious diseases such chorioamnionitis. Parental Refusal.</criteria>
