	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare sensitivity for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of bi-annual ultrasonography and low dose computed tomography (LDCT) in patients at high risk of HCC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of HCC High Risk Group Using Two Surveillance Tools</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients at high risk of HCC are recommended to undergo biannual surveillance using ultrasound. In this study, LDCT is performed in addition to biannual ultrasound surveillance in eligible patients to compare their sensitivity for HCC. Standard of reference would be follow-up imaging and/or gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI.</detailed_description>
