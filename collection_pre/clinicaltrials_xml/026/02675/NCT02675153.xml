	<brief_title>To Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Sirolimus for Crohn's Disease With Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Management of Crohn's disease （CD） with stenosis is challenging and often requires endoscopic dilatation or surgical resection of the strictured bowel. Sirolimus (rapamycin), a macrocyclic antibiotic with immunosuppressive and antineoplastic properties, has been reported as promising rescue therapy for refractory CD. This study aims to evaluate the use of sirolimus for stricturing Crohn's Disease. Patients in this study will receive a continuous dosing schedule of oral sirolimus 2mg daily for six months and follow-up for at least one year. The Harvey-Bradshaw Index （HBI） score, Blood tests , MRI and endoscopy will be used to assess participants at study start and at follow-up points.</detailed_description>
