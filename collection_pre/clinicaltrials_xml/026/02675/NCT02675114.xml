	<brief_title>The PARTNER 3 - Trial - The Safety and Effectiveness of the SAPIEN 3 Transcatheter Heart Valve in Low Risk Patients With Aortic Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center trial. Patients having an operative mortality &lt; 2% (low operative risk) for surgical aortic valve replacement will be randomized 1:1 to receive either transcatheter heart valve replacement (TAVR) with the Edwards SAPIEN 3 or aortic valve replacement with a commercially available surgical bioprosthetic valve. Patients will be seen for follow-up visits at discharge, 30 days, 6 months, and annually through 10 years.</detailed_description>
