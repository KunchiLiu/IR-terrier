	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to demonstrate in vivo the concordance of the imagery system EOS and the spiral CT in women having had an obstructed delivery. If this concordance is demonstrated, it would allow the use of this new technique of imagery, to realize a pelvimetry during the pregnancy less irradiating for the mother, and the fetus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EOSÂ® Versus Spiral CT Technique for Achieving a Pelvimetry in Suites of Obstructed Labor.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to demonstrate in vivo the concordance of the imagery system EOS and the spiral CT in women having had an obstructed delivery. If this concordance is demonstrated, it would allow the use of this new technique of imagery, to realize a pelvimetry during the pregnancy less irradiating for the mother, and the fetus. To answer this objective, the study will be a prospective, monocentric, open clinical trial, comparing the radio-pelvimetry realized with EOS technique, to the spiral CT. Measures are performed in the 3 months following the obstructed delivery.</detailed_description>
