	<brief_summary>Part of interventional neuroradiology procedures for the treatment of selected cerebral aneurysms are now based on stenting. To reduce thromboembolic events, dual antiplatelet therapy (APT) combining aspirin and clopidogrel is proposed with close monitoring, since 1/3 of the patients are low responders due to variation of the biological response to clopidogrel . Ticagrelor is used by few teams but has never been evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. It could be an option for APT due to more reproducible response with less interindividual variability and reduced monitoring. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the interest of ticagrelor for the dual APT for platelet inhibition, in patients undergoing neurovascular stenting for cerebral aneurysm.</brief_summary>
