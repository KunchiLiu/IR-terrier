	<brief_summary>Since the 2000s, the experiences of children and especially their fear during a consultation, a treatment or examination is food for thought in our establishment. There is no tool validated self-assessment of fear to 6 faces. It therefore appeared necessary to us to create this tool. The scale self-assessment of the fear that we have developed consists of six faces representing a gradual level of fear: the child can easily describe their level of fear, which allows for appropriate care.</brief_summary>
