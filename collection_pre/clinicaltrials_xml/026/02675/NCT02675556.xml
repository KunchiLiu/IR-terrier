	<brief_title>Allogeneic Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hMSCs) Infusion in Patients With Treatment Resistant Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase I study, with eighty (80) patients fulfilling all inclusion/exclusion criteria's will be randomly assigned to receive allogeneic Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell (hMSCs) or placebo in a 1:1 blinded fashion. 40 patients will receive a single administration of allogeneic hMSCs and another 40 patients will receive a single administration of Placebo in a 1:1 blinded fashion. Following infusion, patients will be followed at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 week's post-infusion to complete all safety and efficacy assessments. Patients will additionally be followed for up to 12 months post-infusion.</detailed_description>

Diagnosis of Treatment resistant depression (Failed at least two adequate trials of antidepressant monotherapy or antidepressant augmentation with an antipsychotic or lithium during the current episode) Patients who are receiving a third or more treatment will only be entered if they have not responded to the current treatment. Experiencing a current Major Depressive Episode (fulfilling Structured clinical interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM V) criteria per Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID) for categorical diagnosis, and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD)) Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 21item score greater than 18 Adequacy of previous failed antidepressant trials will be defined using standard criteria by Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) of patients with a score greater than 2.5 Increased inflammation ([Serum CRP] greater than 3.0 mg/L) In order to participate in this study, a patient Must Not: Be a female who is pregnant, nursing, or of childbearing potential, while not practicing effective contraceptive methods. (Female patients must undergo a blood or urine pregnancy test at screening and within 36 hours prior to infusion.) Female subjects must have an Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) less than 25.8 IU/L Inability to perform any of the assessments required. Clinically important abnormal screening laboratory values, including but not limited to: hemoglobin &lt;8 g/dl, white blood cell count &lt;3000/mm3, platelets&lt;80,000/mm3, International Normalized Ratio (INR) &gt; 1.5 not due to a reversible cause (i.e. Coumadin), aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, or alkaline phosphatase &gt; 3 times upper limit of normal, total bilirubin &gt; 1.8 mg/dl (unless due to a benign cause). Active medical condition that could cause or exacerbate depressive symptoms (e.g., hypothyroidism, anemia) Serious comorbid illness or any other condition (Such as bipolar, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder) that, in the opinion of the investigator, may compromise the safety or compliance of the patient or preclude successful completion of the study. Have acute suicidality Prior history of a suicide attempt Active psychotic disorder, eating disorder, or substance use disorder within 6 months of enrollment Treatment with any psychotropic (including hypnotic), steroidal, or anti inflammatory medication (including Non steroid AntiInflammatory Drug) within 2 weeks of treatment randomization or 6 weeks for fluoxetine. First major depressive episode after 50 years of age. Have known allergies to penicillin or streptomycin. Hypersensitivity to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Have a clinical history of malignancy within 5 years (i.e., patients with prior malignancy must be disease free for 5 years), except curatively treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma in situ or cervical carcinoma. Have a nonpulmonary condition that limits lifespan to less than 1 year. Have a history of drug or alcohol abuse within the past 24 months. Be serum positive for HIV, Hepatitis B surface antigen or Viremic hepatitis C.
