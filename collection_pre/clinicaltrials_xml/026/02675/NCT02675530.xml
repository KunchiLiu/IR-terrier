	<criteria>Subjects for the Ketamine experiment(Healthy control experiment): 1. Male or female 2. 2145 years old 3. Deemed healthy by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSMNP (SCIDNP) and collateral information. Subjects will need to provide the name of a person, preferably a family member, whom the research team can contact to corroborate information. 1. Lifetime diagnosis of DSMIV substance dependence (except caffeine and nicotine). 2. Substance abuse, as per clinical judgment, in the past 1 year. 3. Current or past DSMIV AxisI diagnosis. 4. A history of significant medical/neurological disease such as cardiac, thyroid, renal, hepatic or neurological. Unstable medical condition based on EKG, vital signs, physical examination and laboratory workup. 5. A hearing deficit greater than 30 dB in both ears detected using a WelchAllyn audioscope (500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz threshold will be evaluated) at screening. 6. Major current or recent (&lt;6 weeks) stressors. 7. History of counseling, except if counseling was for a life circumstance disorder (e.g., bereavement, divorce) or in the opinion of the investigator, is not clinically significant. 8. Lifetime history of treatment with any psychotropic medications for &gt; 1 month duration suggestive of psychiatric illness. 9. Current or past Axis I diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder in firstdegree relatives. 10. Any medication that could interfere with either the safety of the study and/or the outcome measures. 11. Use of any illicit substances in the 4 weeks prior to beginning study participation. 12. Any history indicating learning disability, mental retardation, or attention deficit disorder. 13. History of head injury with loss of consciousness greater than fifteen minutes. 14. Any other condition or medication, which in the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation in the study. 15. NonEnglish speaking. 16. Known sensitivity to ketamine. Subjects for the Schizophrenia experiment: Inclusion Criteria for control subjects: 1. Male or female 2. 2145 years old 3. No past or present Axis I diagnosis, as determined by the SCIDNP Exclusion Criteria for control subjects: 1. Lifetime diagnosis of DSMIV substance dependence (except caffeine and nicotine). 2. Substance abuse, as per clinical judgment, in the past 1 year 3. A history of significant medical/neurological disease such as cardiac, thyroid, renal, hepatic or neurological. 4. A hearing deficit greater than 30dB in both ears detected using a WelchAllyn audioscope (500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz threshold will be evaluated) at screening. 5. Axis I diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder in firstdegree relatives. 6. History of head injury with loss of consciousness greater than fifteen minutes 7. Any other condition or medication, which in the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation in the study. 8. NonEnglish speaking. Inclusion Criteria for patients: 1. Male or female 2. 2145 years old 3. Diagnosed with DSMIV schizophrenia based on a SCIDIP interview for patients. 4. Stable dose of antipsychotic medications for at least 2 weeks prior to beginning study participation. 5. Score either in the 13 (high functioning) range or in the 57 (low functioning) range of the Global Functioning Scale from the MSIF based on a screening interview. 1. Lifetime diagnosis of DSMIV substance dependence (except caffeine and nicotine). 2. Substance abuse, as per clinical judgment, in the past 1 year 3. A history of significant medical/neurological disease such as cardiac, thyroid, renal, hepatic or neurological. 4. A hearing deficit greater than 30dB in both ears detected using a WelchAllyn audioscope (500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz threshold will be evaluated) at screening. 5. History of head injury with loss of consciousness greater than fifteen minutes. 6.
