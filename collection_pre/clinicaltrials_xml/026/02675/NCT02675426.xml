Subjects have been receiving conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD) therapy for greater than or equal to 3 months and on a stable dose for greater than or equal to 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. The following csDMARDs are allowed: Methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and leflunomide. Meets the following minimum disease activity criteria: greater than or equal to 6 swollen joints (based on 66 joint counts) and greater than or equal to 6 tender joints (based on 68 joint counts) at Screening and Baseline Visits. Subjects with prior exposure to at most one biologic DMARD (bDMARD) may be enrolled (up to 20% of study population) if they have documented evidence of intolerance to bDMARDs or limited exposure (less than 3 months) and have satisfied required washout periods. Prior exposure to any Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor (including but not limited to tofacitinib, baricitinib, and filgotinib). History of inflammatory joint disease other than RA. History of secondary Sjogren's Syndrome is permitted. Subjects who are considered inadequate responders to bDMARD therapy as determined by the Investigator.</criteria>
