	<brief_summary>A 48-week, open label, non comparative prospective trial in stable chronic human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients having achieved complete virological suppression for more than 24 weeks (human immunodeficiency virus-1 RNA &lt;50 c/ml) switching from an antiretroviral regimen containing tenofovir and lamivudine or emtricitabine and boosted protease inhibitor to boosted atazanavir and lamivudine Study visits will take place at screening, baseline, weeks 4, 12, 24, and 48.</brief_summary>
