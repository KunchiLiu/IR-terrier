	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of non invasive brain stimulation - NIBS - techniques (Electroconvulsivotherapy - ECT, transcranial Direct Current Stimulation - tDCS, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation - rTMS) on serum Brain Derived Neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in patients with depression and schizophrenia. Four blood samples will be collected in each participants, one before the NIBS sessions, and 3 after the completion of NIBS protocols: one immediately after the end of the NIBS sessions, a second one week after and a last one month after. Two blood samples separated by one month will also be collected in a a group of healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The hypothesis is that NIBS will modulate BDNF levels and that the modification in serum BDNF levels will be correlated with clinical improvements in the sample of patients.</detailed_description>
