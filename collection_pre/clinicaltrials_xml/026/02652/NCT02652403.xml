	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a simplified technique of conventional dentures fabrication, comparing it to a traditional technique, by evaluating the impact of oral health on quality of life, satisfaction of individuals and chewing efficiency as well assessing the quality of prosthetics and TMD. Furthermore, the cost involved in the manufacture of dentures through technique simplified will be compared to the cost involved in the traditional technique.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Simplified Versus Conventional Technique for Complete Denture Fabrication.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The traditional technique will be conducted through a protocol used by most dental schools in Brazil and described in some clinical trials as a conventional technique for dentures fabrication. On simplified technical functional molding step is deleted, and thus the orientation planes are made directly on the resulting models of the initial molding alginate, and the mounting of the models is performed in semiadjustable articulators random with the aid of an auxiliary table 15 degrees with semiadjustable articulators fixed to the slope. To evaluate the impact on oral health quality of life of individuals will be used the Brazilian version of Oral Health Impact Profile for edentulous patients (OHIP-Edent) for evaluation of patient satisfaction will use a specific questionnaire assessing the quality of the prostheses will be carried out through a specific exam, to assess the presence of TMD, all subjects will be evaluated through the RDC / TMD, for assessing the efficiency masticatory chewing capsules are used, the costs involved in the manufacture of prostheses will be calculated according to the material consumption used during the making of the prosthesis. All subjects will be assessed before making the prostheses and 90 days after installation of new dentures during this period will be held regular control visits. The data will be evaluated in order descriptive by numbers and proportions, moreover, it will be statistically evaluated by means of suitable tests.</detailed_description>
