	<brief_title>Serial, Non-invasive Analysis of Exhaled Breath Condensate in Ventilated Trauma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This proposal investigates the utility of exhaled breath condensate fluid (EBCF) collected from heat moisture exchange (HME) filters connected to patient's endotracheal tubes for early, non-invasive detection of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in critically ill or injured ICU patients. The development of pneumonia during mechanical ventilation is the most common healthcare-associated infection in severely injured patients, accounting for substantial morbidity, excess ICU and hospital stay, additional cost and increased mortality.</detailed_description>
