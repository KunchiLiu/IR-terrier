	<brief_summary>To determine engraftment of neutrophils and platelets at 28 days following alpha/beta T-cell and CD19 cell depletion using HLA haploidentical donors for peripheral blood stem cell transplant in relapsed lymphoma. Assess incidence of acute GVHD (Graft versus Host Disease), chronic GVHD, graft failure rate, treatment related mortality rate, progression free survival and overall survival of patients. The stem cell product will be processed using an investigational Miltenyi cell selection device/system that removes the alpha/beta T-cells and CD19+ cells, immune system cells that are more likely to cause GVHD.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must meet one of the following disease criteria: Relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma after autologous stem cell transplantation Relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma, deemed ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation due to refractory disease Relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma after autologous stem cell transplantation (history of transformed lymphoma is acceptable) Relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma, deemed ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation due to refractory disease (history of transformed lymphoma is acceptable) Relapsed/refractory T cell lymphoma relapsed after at least 1 prior line of therapy Relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma relapsed after at least 1 prior line of therapy Relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma relapsed after at least 1 prior line of therapy Relapsed/refractory small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia relapsed after at least 1 prior line of therapy Karnofsky score of 60% or better ("Requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for most of his/her needs"). Pulmonary: DLCO (corrected for hemoglobin) &gt; 40%; and FEV1 &gt; 50% Cardiac: EF ≥ 50% and no uncontrolled angina, symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias, or ECG evidence of active ischemia Renal: estimated GFR by MDRD formula &gt; 40 mL/min/1.73m2 Women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 14 days prior to study registration and agree to use adequate birth control during study treatment. A female of childbearing potential (FCBP) is a sexually mature female who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months). Voluntary written consent Active CNS lymphoma within two weeks of registration. Patients with a history of CNS involvement must have adequate treatment as defined by at least two negative spinal fluid assessments separated by at least one week. (Otherwise LP is not required if no clinical suspicion or evidence of CNS involvement.) Patients who have received cranial radiation therapy must still be eligible to receive total lymphoid irradiation to 7 Gy. New or active infection as determined by fever, unexplained pulmonary infiltrate or sinusitis on radiographic assessment. Infections diagnosed within 4 weeks of registration must be determined to be controlled or resolving prior to treatment. Presence of HIV, or active hepatitis A, B, or C infection Allergy or hypersensitivity to agents used within the treatment protocol. For an indolent lymphoma histology (follicular lymphoma, SLL/CLL) or mantle cell lymphoma, the patient should not have an HLAmatched sibling, who would be an eligible donor, available. Vulnerable population groups, i.e., prisoners, those lacking consent capacity, nonEnglish speaking, illiterate, pregnant females.</criteria>
