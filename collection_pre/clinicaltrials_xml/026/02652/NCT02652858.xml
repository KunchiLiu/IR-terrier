	<brief_summary>Central and peripheral arterial pressure decoupling occurs in some clinical conditions like sepsis or cardiopulmonary bypass. This decoupling may leed to unsuitable decisions such as the use of catecholamines. The aim of this study is to evaluate the pulse wave's speed as a marker of central and peripheral arterial pressure decoupling in a scheduled condition which is the cardiopulmonary bypass during cardiac surgery.</brief_summary>
