	<brief_summary>The experimental design is an open-label two-week trial of tolcapone to evaluate which clinical domains are affected by tolcapone treatment and to identify "responders" to tolcapone treatment in the two subject groups (BI and NCD)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluate the Effects of Tolcapone on Cognitive and Behavioral Dysfunction in Patients With BI and NCD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each patient will receive a two-week specified dosing amount of tolcapone (100mg TID on Day 1; 200mg TID on Days 2-14). The patient will be instructed to take the study drug three times daily. Tolcapone will be tapered after Day 14 to avoid potential withdrawal reactions. Clinical Instruments for patients: - Question banks from large patient-reported outcome measure initiatives will be used and administered and used by computerized-adaptive tests (CATs). These include the TBI-QoL for patients with TBI and question banks from the patient-reported outcome measure information systems (PROMIS) and neurology quality of life measurement initiative (Neuro-QoL). Patients will answer questions related to their mobility, fatigue, pain interference, positive affect and well-being, depression, anxiety, anger and irritability, and emotional and behavioral dyscontrol. - Clinical Global Impressions Scale - Geriatric Depression Scale-15 - State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - Hopkins Adult Reading Test - Frontal Systems Behavior Scale - Montreal Cognitive Assessment - Trails A&amp;B - Modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test - NIH Toolbox - Perceptual Comparison Test - Brief Test of Attention - Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Brief Visuospatial Memory Test - Calibrated Ideational Fluency Assessment - Profile of Mood States - Digit Span Clinical Instruments for Informants: - Neuropsychiatry Inventory - Apathy evaluation scale - Overt aggression scale - Frontal Systems Behavior Scale Laboratory Measures: - Blood sample for genotyping - Blood sample for assessing COMT activity. - Blood sample for a laboratory profile including CBC, CMP, TSH, Hepatitis Panel (B and C), and RPR - A urine analysis, urine drug screen, and a urine pregnancy test - In addition for NCD patients: a blood sample for tests including Serum Calcium, B12, ESR, and C-reactive protein</detailed_description>
