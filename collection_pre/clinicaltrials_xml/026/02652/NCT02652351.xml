	<brief_title>Human Umbilical Cord-Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Hepatic Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells exhibit the potential to differentiate into mature cells typical of several tissues, which have been confirmed in in vivo and in vitro experiments. There have been few clinical reports describing umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells for treatment of Hepatic Cirrhosis. To investigate the effects of hUC-MSC treatment for Hepatic Cirrhosis, 20 patients with Hepatic Cirrhosis will be enrolled and receive 4 times of hUC-MSC transplantation.</detailed_description>
