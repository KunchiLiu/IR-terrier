	<brief_summary>Enchanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols aim to provide safer and quicker recovery postoperatively. One of the elements in ERAS protocols is that bowel is not prepared before colorectal surgery. However, several recent retrospective register studies have suggested that mechanical bowel preparation combined to oral antibiotics before colectomy reduces complications compared to no preparation at all. This trial compares these two strategies to find out whether complications can indeed be reduced by mechanically preparing the bowel with oral antibiotics.</brief_summary>
