	<brief_summary>This clinical trial will examine differences in the effectiveness between three (3) commonly used methods and/or medications used to perform a transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block for post-operative pain control. The transversus abdominis muscle is either side between the lowest rib and the hip bone. Group A subjects will undergo post-operative pain relief treatment with a single injection of Bupivacaine injected into the TAP. Group B subjects will undergo post-operative pain relief treatment with a single injection of Exparel®, a liposomal form of bupivacaine into the TAP. Group C subjects will be treated with a continuous infusion of the local anesthetic ropivacaine with the ON-Q® pump. There will be no placebo group in this study.</brief_summary>
