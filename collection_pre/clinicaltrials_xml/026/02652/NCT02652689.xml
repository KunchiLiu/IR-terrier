	<brief_summary>The LDS may contain information of significant diagnostic and physiological value regarding the pulmonary parenchyma and vasculature, as well as the cardio- vascular system in general. In pilot clinical studies of patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) as well as patients with Pulmonary Hypertension, LDS signals patterns unique to these conditions were identified. We believe that these newly discovered ultrasound signals might provide a non-invasive radiation-free means to diagnose and monitor patients with Pulmonary Embolism. The purpose of this study is to assess the utility of noninvasive assessment of lung Doppler signals performed via transthoracic parametric Doppler. The objective of the study is to evaluate the lung Doppler signals (LDS) in patients diagnosed with acute PE, in order to determine the potential assessment value of this non-invasive method in this potentially life threatening condition.</brief_summary>
