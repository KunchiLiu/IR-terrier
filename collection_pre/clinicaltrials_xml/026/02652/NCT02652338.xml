	<brief_summary>The main aim of this study, which was carried out in two parallel groups, is testing the efficacy of a specific micronutrients combination in adults with heart rhythm disturbances and accompanying symptoms. It is therefore the investigators hypothesis that daily oral administration of the specific micronutrients combination will lead to a decrease of symptoms awareness and to a reduction of heart rhythm disturbances in adults with or without structural heart disease. The principal endpoints will be a decrease in the total score of symptoms awareness.</brief_summary>
