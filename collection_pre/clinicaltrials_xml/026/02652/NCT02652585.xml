	<brief_title>Validation of a Test System for Development of Medications for Alcoholism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective of this study is to show that a laboratory alcohol self-administration method can predict the therapeutic potential of new compounds to reduce relapse in alcohol-dependent patients. The 'TEMA" translates several animal behavioral paradigms of alcohol self-administration into corresponding human experiments. We will investigate the opiate antagonist Naltrexone, whose anti-relapse effect is well documented, as a reference drug for validation. Main objective: With TEMA (test system for development of medications for alcoholism ) it can be shown, that naltrexone administration reduces the willingness to perform work for alcohol infusion in a laboratory experiment. Secondary objectives: - administration of naltrexone in comparison to placebo leads to a reduction of alcohol craving and real-life drinking - administration of naltrexone in comparison to placebo leads to reduction of the CDT-Level - administration of naltrexone in comparison to placebo leads to a change in perception of subjective alcohol effects - the effectiveness of naltrexone can be predicted by the A118G polymorphism of the OPRM1 - administration of naltrexone changes the baseline and alcohol-induced ability of motor inhibition - administration of naltrexone changes the baseline and alcohol-induced regional cerebral perfusion - administration of naltrexone changes the baseline and alcohol-induced cerebral resting state activity - changes of alcohol effects to the brain activity induced by naltrexone in comparison to placebo correlate with effects of naltrexone on the willingness to work for alcohol self-administration</detailed_description>
