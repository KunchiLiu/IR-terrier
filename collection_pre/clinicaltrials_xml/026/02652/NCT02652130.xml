	<brief_title>Safety Follow-up of Treatment With Remestemcel-L in Pediatric Patients Who Have Failed to Respond to Steroid Treatment for Acute GVHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a safety follow-up study through 180 days of remestemcel-L treatment in subjects who participated in MSB-GVHD001. This study will also explore duration of response over time. Subjects who participated in MSB-GVHD001 and received at least one dose of remestemcel-L as outlined in that protocol will be evaluated at baseline (Day 100) and at Days 120, 140, 160 and 180 for safety endpoints. Subjects who participated in Protocol MSB-GVHD001 and received the first 8 doses of remestemcel-L as outlined in that protocol will be evaluated at baseline (Day 100) and at Days 120, 140, 160 and 180.</detailed_description>
