	<brief_summary>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been widely used for problem-solving tool in the evaluation of hepatic lesions, and it has been shown to have better sensitivity than CT for detection of colorectal liver metastases, especially for lesions which are smaller than 1 cm. After introduction of a liver-specific hepatobiliary MR contrast agent, gadoxetic acid, gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI (Gd-EOB-MRI) has been increasingly used for evaluation of liver lesion including CRLM. However, compared to conventional MRI with extracellular contrast agent (ECA-MRI), Gd-EOB-MRI has different pharmacodynamic characteristics, and is more expensive due to higher cost of gadoxetic acid and needs longer scan time to obtain hepatobiliary phase which is generally acquired 15 to 20 minutes after contrast injection. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical outcome and diagnostic performance of Gd-EOB-MRI and ECA-MRI for evaluation of focal hepatic lesion in newly diagnosed colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
