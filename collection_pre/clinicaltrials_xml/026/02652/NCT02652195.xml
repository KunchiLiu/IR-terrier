	<brief_title>Deciphering the Role of Oxytocin in Motivation: an fMRI Study. Part II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oxytocin is a well-known social and reproductive hormone demonstrated to have a variety of prosocial effects in humans including enhancing trust and generosity, improving positive communication, increasing eye gaze, and reducing anxiety. Oxytocin is hypothesized to facilitate social behaviors via its modulation of motivational networks. With this study, the investigators will characterize oxytocin's effects on the neural processing of salient stimuli. The investigators will utilize a noninvasive brain imaging technique, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to assess brain activity while participants perform tests designed to engage neural circuits associated with the processing of social and non-social stimuli. Ongoing clinical trials are examining the use of intranasal oxytocin for the treatment of multiple psychiatric disorders including substance dependence, depression, and schizophrenia; disorders which reward system dysfunction appears to play a significant role. As such, it is important that we obtain a better understanding of the neurobiological effects this drug may have on reward circuitry functioning. To this end, in this study, we will examine healthy control participants and participants diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD).</detailed_description>
