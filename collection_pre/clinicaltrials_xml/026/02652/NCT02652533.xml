	<brief_summary>The investigators plan to investigate the use of US shear wave elastography (SWE), a newly available imaging technology, in children with suspected/known BA.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound Shear Wave Elastography Evaluation of Suspected and Known Biliary Atresia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators plan a prospective, multi-center study to determine if liver ultrasound shear wave speed measurements acquired at clinical presentation can discriminate biliary atresia (BA) from other causes of liver disease in the setting of neonatal cholestasis. The investigators also plan to determine if liver ultrasound shear wave speed measurements acquired at clinical presentation or longitudinally during the first one-year period after Kasai can predict important long-term outcomes in BA patients.</detailed_description>
