	<brief_summary>Superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) are related entities. Only in the last years a series of observational studies mainly conducted in France could show that ´isolated SVT´ (without concomitant deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism) is in fact not a benign and spontaneously healing disease but bears a potential for severe thromboembolic complications once not treated adequately. INSIGHTS-SVT study aims at collecting representative data on the current management and outcomes of SVT in Germany under real-life conditions. It will document the implementation of the recently issued national SVT guidelines issued by the Society for Angiology (DGA) and the Society for Phlebology (DGP).</brief_summary>
