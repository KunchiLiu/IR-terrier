	<brief_title>Does Training on a Virtual Reality Bronchoscopy Simulator Improve Performance of Bronchoscopic Intubation in Patients?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traditionally, fiber optic bronchoscopy (FOB) intubation has been taught in a see one, do one basis. Modern training method in skill acquisition involves the use of simulators. Recently a portable, computer based, bronchoscopic simulator (ORSIM) was developed. The investigators hypothesized that operators trained with the ORSIM simulator will be more proficient in performing asleep FOB intubation than those trained with didactic teaching alone. This randomized trial involves 34 consented residents or anesthesia assistants (AAs). In preparation, each consented person will view a teaching video of FOB intubation and tips. They will then perform an asleep FOBI in the OR under a staff anesthesiologist's supervision who's familiar with the study. Those who are randomized to the ORSIM group with undergo simulator training of 30-60 min. Those in the Didactic group will not undergo further training. Within about a week, the resident/AA will perform another asleep FOB intubation. The study results will impact on how FOB intubation will be taught effectively in the future.</detailed_description>
