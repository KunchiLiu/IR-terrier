	<criteria>Subjects' parent(s)/Legally Acceptable Representative(s) (LAR[s]) who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. A male or female 6 months of age (from the day the child becomes 6 months of age until the day before the child achieves 7 months of age) at the time of the first vaccination. Signed or thumbprinted informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject. Where parent(s)/LAR(s) are illiterate, the consent form will be countersigned by an independent witness. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Previously received three documented doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and wholecell pertussis, hepatitis B vaccine (DTPwHepB), and a 3dose course of oral polio vaccine and, if locally recommended, pneumococcal and rotavirus vaccines. Child in care Use of a drug or vaccine that is not approved for that indication other than the study vaccines within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Any medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator would make intramuscular injection unsafe. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose. For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed. Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol in the period starting seven days before the first dose of SB257049 measles, rubella and YF vaccines and ending 42 days after the last dose of vaccines given at 9 months of age (Visit 4), with the exception of oral polio vaccine which could be given for unforseen public health threat. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational vaccine/product. Previous vaccination against measles, YF or rubella. Previous administration of Vitamin A. Moderate or severe malnutrition at screening defined as weight for age Zscore &lt; 2. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination. Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine(s). See also Section 1.3. Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness. History of any neurological disorders or seizures. Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment. Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C /99.5°F for oral, axillary or tympanic route, or ≥ 38.0°C /100.4°F on rectal route. The preferred route for recording temperature in this study will be axillary. Subjects with a minor illness without fever may, be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period. Same sex twin. Maternal death. Previous participation in any other malaria study.</criteria>
