	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia with a lifetime risk for development of over 20%. Pulmonary vein isolation is now established as therapy of choice for patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation. It is well known that this interventional therapy inevitably modulates the intracardiac autonomic nervous system. While this ablation might alter atrial electrophysiology beneficially, the impact on ventricular electrophysiology remains unclear. The investigators study aimed to observe the occurrence of new premature ventricular complexes and other ventricular arrhythmias after pulmonary vein isolation.</brief_summary>
