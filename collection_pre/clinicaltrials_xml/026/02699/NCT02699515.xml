	<criteria>Able and willing to give written informed consent and has signed the appropriate written informed consent form (ICF), prior to performance of any trial activities Eligible male and female subjects aged greater than or equal to (&gt;=)20 years Histologically or cytologically proven metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors, for which no effective standard therapy exists or standard therapy has failed Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1 at trial entry Life expectancy &gt;=12 weeks as judged by the Investigator. Adequate hematological function defined by white blood cell (WBC) count &gt;=3*10^9/Liter with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;=1.5*10^9/Liter, lymphocyte count &gt;=0.5* 10^9/Liter, platelet count &gt;=75*10^9/Liter, and Hemoglobin (Hgb) &gt;= 9 grams per deciliter (g/dL) (in absence of blood transfusion). Adequate hepatic function defined by a total bilirubin level &lt;=1.5 × Upper limit of normal (ULN), an AST level &lt;= 2.5 × ULN, and an ALT level &lt;= 2.5 × ULN. Adequate renal function defined by an estimated creatinine clearance &gt;50 milliliter per minute (mL/min) according to the CockcroftGault formula or by measure of creatinine clearance from 24 hour urine collection. Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria could apply. Concurrent treatment with nonpermitted drugs and other interventions Anticancer treatment within 28 days before the start of trial treatment, for example cyto reductive therapy, radiotherapy (with the exception of palliative bone directed radiotherapy), immune therapy, or cytokine therapy Major surgery within 28 days before the start of trial treatment (excluding prior diagnostic biopsy) Systemic therapy with immunosuppressive agents within 7 days before the start of trial treatment; or use of any investigational drug within 28 days before the start of trial treatment Previous malignant disease other than the target malignancy to be investigated in this trial with the exception of cervical carcinoma in situ and superficial or non invasive bladder cancer (treated with curative intent) within the last 5 years or basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma in situ within the last 3 years Rapidly progressive disease which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may predispose to inability to tolerate treatment or trial procedures Active or history of central nervous system metastases, except as in the melanomaspecific Central nervous system (CNS) criteria listed above Receipt of any organ transplantation, including allogeneic stemcell transplantation, but with the exception of transplants that do not require immunosuppression (eg, corneal transplant, hair transplant)</criteria>
