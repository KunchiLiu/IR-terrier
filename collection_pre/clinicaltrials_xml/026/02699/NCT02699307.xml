	<brief_summary>Physical activity is the cornerstone of good diabetes management, and yet effective physical activity intervention is not available. The investigators developed a lifestyle intervention based on individual's home activity patterns. The goal of the study is to test the efficacy of this intervention among older adults with diabetes. In addition to physical activity, the investigators will also assess if the intervention will improve social participation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lifestyle Intervention for Adults With Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To tailor to the needs of older adults, the investigators developed an innovative lifestyle modification intervention that incorporates rehabilitation approaches to improve the participation of physical activities (PA) among sedentary older adults with type 2 diabetes. The intervention is developed based on well-established health behavior theory (i.e., self-regulation) and the conceptual framework from the World Health Organization, with several innovations not previously investigated in this population. The intervention: 1. is tailored based on individual's unique patterns of daily PA performed within his/her environment as opposed to the total amount of PA performed in a day or a recall of activities over some time period; 2. uses an accelerometer-assisted, field-based method to address the individual's unique physical and social environment; 3. is delivered by a trained occupational therapist in brief counseling sessions, which can be easily translated into real clinical settings; and 4. addresses participation, a patient-centered outcome that is associated with quality of life but has received limited attention outside of rehabilitation research.</detailed_description>
