	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate TAK-931 in Participants With Advanced Nonhematologic Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being under investigation in this study is called TAK-931. The effect of TAK-931 is being evaluated in up to 100 participants who have nonhematologic (solid) neoplasms. This study will look at the safety, tolerability, and PK to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TAK-931. This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall study duration is approximately 42 months for total of dose escalation cohorts and the safety expansion cohort. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic with final visit approximately 30-40 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>
