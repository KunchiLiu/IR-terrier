	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate objective response rate (ORR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 of erdafitinib in a molecularly-defined subset of Asian participants with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), urothelial cancer, esophageal cancer and cholangiocarcinoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Clinical Efficacy of JNJ-42756493 (Erdafitinib), A Pan-Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor, In Asian Participants With Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer, Urothelial Cancer, Esophageal Cancer Or Cholangiocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multicenter, phase 2 study to evaluate the clinical efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of erdafitinib in Asian participants with advanced NSCLC, urothelial cancer, esophageal cancer and cholangiocarcinoma.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pathologically or cytologically confirmed, advanced or refractory tumors (there are no restriction on the total number of lines of prior therapies, but participant should have received at least 1 line of anticancer therapy [as per local standard of care]): Squamous and nonsquamous nonsmallcell lung cancer (NSCLC), esophageal cancer, urothelial cancer and cholangiocarcinoma Participants must meet the following molecular eligibility criteria (diagnosed at a central or local laboratory using either a tumor tissue based assay, which must indicate: at least one of following): a) fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) gene translocations b) FGFR gene mutations c) Participants with evidence of FGFR pathway activation or other potential target/pathway inhibited by erdafitinib may also be considered and allowed for enrollment if supported by emerging biomarker data. The presence of measurable disease according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST, Version 1.1) Criteria, and documented disease progression as defined by RECIST (Version 1.1) at baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score 0 or 1 Female participants (of child bearing potential and sexually active) and male participants (with a partner of child bearing potential) must use medically acceptable methods of birth control. Male participants must use highly effective birth control measurements when sexually active and must not donate sperm Adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function within the 14 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1 up until predose of Cycle 1 Chemotherapy, targeted therapies, immunotherapy, or treatment with an investigational anticancer agent within 2 weeks or at least 5 halflives of the drug whichever is longer up to a maximum of 4 weeks before the first administration of study drug. Localized palliative radiation therapy (but should not include radiation to target lesions) and ongoing luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone (LHRH) agonists, bisphosphonates and denosumab, are permitted Participants with persistent phosphate greater than (&gt;) upper limit of normal (ULN) during Screening (within 14 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1 up until predose of Cycle 1) and despite medical management of phosphate levels Participants taking medications known to have a significant risk of causing QTc prolongation and Torsades de Pointes. Participants who have discontinued any of these medications must have a washout period of at least 5 days or at least 5 halflives of the drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study drug Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than (&lt;) 50% as assessed by echocardiography (or multigated acquisition [MUGA]) performed at Screening Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, poorly controlled hypertension or diabetes, ongoing active infection requiring antibiotics, psychiatric illness, or at risk of gastrointestinal perforation as per investigators' assessment Received prior selective FGFR inhibitor treatment or RET inhibitor treatment, respectively according to the biomarker prescreening result, or if the participant has known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to Erdafitinib or its excipients Any corneal or retinal abnormality likely to increase risk of eye toxicity</criteria>
