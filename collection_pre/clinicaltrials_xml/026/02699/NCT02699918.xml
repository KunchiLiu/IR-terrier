	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: to address if diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea before or during the extending check-up is a risk factor toward metastasis for melanoma stage ≥ tIIaN0M0 Study design: Adult patients with a Breslow's Thickness ≥ 1mm coming to the surgery consultation will have a nocturnal oximetry for screening of obstructive sleep apnea. Patients having an abnormal nocturnal oximetry will be explored by polysomnography in order to detect sleep apnea syndrome. Patients with sleep apnea will be treated. Standard dermatologic follow-up over a 3 years period with thoraco-abdominal-pelvic and cerebral CT-scan and a lymph-node ultrasound every 6 months will be performed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Obstructive SAS on Metastatic Potential of Cutaneous Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Melanoma is a cutaneous cancer due to a proliferation of melanocytes. For metastatic cases the prognostic is poor (18% survival at 5 years). Few factors predict metastasis. Sleep Apnea Syndrome is involved in mechanism of carcinogenesis and aggressiveness markers of malignant cutaneous melanoma. Hypothesis: to address if diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea before or during the extending check-up is a risk factor toward metastasis for melanoma stage ≥ tIIaN0M0 Study design: Adult patients with a Breslow's Thickness ≥ 1mm coming to the surgery consultation will have a nocturnal oximetry for screening of obstructive sleep apnea. Patients having an abnormal nocturnal oximetry will be explored by polysomnography in order to detect sleep apnea syndrome. Patients with sleep apnea will be treated. Standard dermatologic follow-up over a 3 years period with thoraco-abdominal-pelvic and cerebral CT-scan and a lymph-node ultrasound every 6 months will be performed. Sample size: based on previous data from the investigators showing that 25% of patients with a Breslow's Thickness ≥ 1mm will have node or visceral metastasis. For an alpha threshold of 5% and a study power of 80%, with 5% of dropouts, with the hypothesis that 40% of apnea syndrome patients will metastasis versus 20% in the control group the study should include 83 patients in each group. Statistical analysis: an intermediate analysis after 80 included patients will be performed. Peto method will be followed, results will be considered significant with a p≤0.001 and the study will be stopped. Normality of data will be checked by Kurtosis and Skewness tests, variance equality will be tested with the Leven test. The significance level will be set at 5%.</detailed_description>
