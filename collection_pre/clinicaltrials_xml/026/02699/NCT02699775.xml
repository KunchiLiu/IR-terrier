	<brief_summary>Chronic stroke patients exhibit gait pattern alterations which are mainly due to spasticity and treated with repetitive multifocal botulinum toxin injection(BTI). Several studies demonstrated that single BTI-session in a single muscle of paretic lower limb(LL) improved kinematic gait parameters(GP) but surprisingly none of them assessed the effects of repetitive multifocal BTI on patient's gait pattern and their duration. The aim was to evaluate the impact of repetitive multifocal BTI-sessions on GP of chronic stroke patients. To that end, gait of patients will be compared using 3D-gait analysis after 3 consecutives BTI sessions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Repeated Botulinum Toxin Injection on Gait Pattern in Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All the patients will be treated with BTI . These injections will be performed under electrical stimulation control (~5mA). The dose, the number of site of injection per muscle is at the discretion of the physician according to patients' needs and physicians' routine clinical practice. The dilution the most commonly used will be 100 U for 2.5ml (XEOMINÂ®)</detailed_description>
