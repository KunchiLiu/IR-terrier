	<brief_title>Remission of Lumbar Disc Herniation by Physiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both groups received combination of electrotherapy, deep friction massage and stabilization exercise for fifteen session. Combine group received non surgical spinal decompression therapy (NSDT) different from conventional physiotherapy group. Numeric Analog Scale, Straight leg raise (SLR) test, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were applied at baseline and after treatment. Disc height and herniation thickness were measured on Magnetic Resonance Imagination (MRI) which performed at baseline and three months after therapy.</detailed_description>
