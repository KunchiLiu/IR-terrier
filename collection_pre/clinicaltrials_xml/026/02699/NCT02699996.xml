	<brief_summary>This partially randomized pilot trial studies peer mentoring to see how well it works in promoting follow-up care self-management in younger childhood cancer survivors. Childhood cancer survivors require lifelong follow-up care to identify, monitor, and treat medical and psychosocial late effects stemming from their cancer, its treatment, and lifestyle factors. A peer mentoring program may improve disease knowledge, health motivation, problem-solving skills, stress management, and communication with caregivers and providers in adolescent and young adult cancer survivors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peer Mentoring in Promoting Follow-up Care Self-Management in Younger Childhood Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Adapt problem-solving skills training (PSST) with peer mentoring to improve adolescent and young adult (AYA) self-management of long-term follow-up care. II. Evaluate the feasibility of the self-management + peer mentoring program in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). III. Assess preliminary efficacy of the peer mentoring program vs. widely available print brochure. OUTLINE: PHASE 1: Participants (providers, survivors, and caregivers) complete a 60 minute interview to help adapt PSST to focus on AYA self-management of care. PHASE 2: Patients are randomized to 1of 2 arms. ARM I: Patients complete the adapted PSST peer mentoring intervention comprising a videoconference or phone call with the peer mentor followed by secure text messaging weekly for 4 weeks and then monthly for 2 months. ARM II: Patients receive tailored survivorship educational materials from the Children's Oncology Group patient education "Health Links" as well as a brochure with self-management strategies entitled: "Moving Into Adult Health Care: A Guide for Young Adults With and Without Disabilities" via email or postal mail. Patients also receive general health tips (e.g., exercise and nutrition recommendations) via text message weekly for 4 weeks and then monthly for 2 months.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>PHASE 1: PATIENT ELIGIBILITY: At least 1.5 years from treatment (which is a typical time for preparation to transfer to longterm followup care) PHASE 1: PARENT ELIGIBILITY: Caregiver of a pediatric cancer survivor age 1825 who was primary caregiver at diagnosis PHASE 1: PARENT ELIGIBILITY: Patient is at least 1.5 years from treatment PHASE 1: PROVIDER ELIGIBILITY: Health professional who works with childhood cancer survivors ages 18 to 25 PHASE 2: PEER MENTOR ELIGIBILITY: Age 2129 PHASE 2: PEER MENTOR ELIGIBILITY: At least 1.5 years from treatment PHASE 2: PEER MENTOR ELIGIBILITY: Selfreported primary responsibility for care and "complete readiness" using the Readiness for Transition Questionnaire PHASE 2: PATIENT ELIGIBILITY: Age 1825 PHASE 2: PATIENT ELIGIBILITY: At least 1.5 years from treatment PHASE 2: PATIENT ELIGIBILITY: Currently does not independently selfmanage followup care according to selfreport (i.e., reports low readiness [score of 1 or 2 out of 4] to assume total responsibility for care using an item from the Readiness for Transition Questionnaire) PHASE 1: PATIENT EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Physician or selfreported cognitive delay or impairment that would prevent selfmanagement of healthcare PHASE 1: PARENT EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Patient has physician or caregiverreported cognitive delay or impairment that would prevent selfmanagement of healthcare No provider exclusion criteria PHASE 2: PATIENT EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Physician or selfreported cognitive delay or impairment that would prevent selfmanagement of healthcare</criteria>
