	<brief_summary>An investigator initiated and conducted, multicentre, international, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial to determine the effects of a fixed low-dose combination blood pressure lowering pill ("Triple Pill") on top of standard of care on blood pressure control and on time to first occurrence of recurrent stroke in patients with a history of acute intracerebral haemorrhage (TRIDENT).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Triple Therapy Prevention of Recurrent Intracerebral Disease EveNts Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is the most serious and least treatable form of stroke, accounting for at least 10% of the 20 million new strokes that occur globally each year. Survivors of ICH are at high risk of recurrent ICH and other serious cardiovascular events. While there is strong evidence that this risk can be reduced by lowering the blood pressure (BP) of patients after ICH, many patients with ICH do not receive blood pressure lowering long-term unless the blood pressure levels are particularly high, and many do not receive BP combination therapy. The aim of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of a combination of fixed low-dose generic BP lowering agents as a "Triple Pill" strategy on top of standard of care for the prevention of recurrent stroke in patients with a history of ICH and high normal or low grade hypertension in a large-scale, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised controlled trial.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults (â‰¥18 years) with a history up to 6 months of symptom onset of acute stroke caused by primary ICH as confirmed by imaging Clinically stable, as judged by investigator Two resting SBP levels measured 5 minutes apart in the range 130160mmHg recorded in a seated position. (Patients with higher SBP can be included if considered by attending clinician that management is consistent with local standards of clinical practice) Geographical proximity to the recruiting hospital and/or followup medical clinic site to allow ready access for inperson clinic visits during followup Provision of written informed consent Taking of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor that cannot be switched to any of the following alternatives: telmisartan 20 or 40mg, amlodipine 2.5 or 5mg, indapamide 1.25 or 2.5mg, or an equivalent class (Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB), Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB) or thiazidelike diuretic), or a betablocker Contraindication to any of the study medications, in the context of currently prescribed BP lowering medication Unable to complete the study procedures and/or followup Females of child bearing age and capability, who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or those not using adequate birth control Emergent side effects that prevent longterm treatment during the 14 week active runin phase on open treatment Any condition that in the opinion of the responsible physician or investigator that renders the patient unsuitable for the study (e.g. severe disability [ie modified Rankin Score of 45] or significant memory or behavioural disorder)</criteria>
