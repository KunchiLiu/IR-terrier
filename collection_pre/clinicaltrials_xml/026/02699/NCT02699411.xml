	<brief_summary>We will conduct a randomized clinical trial observing forty patients divided into two groups: one group composed of twenty individuals undergoing surgery for ruptured ACL, which perform dry needling of myofascial trigger (PGM) point of the vastus muscle and then perform techniques proprioception (group a); and twenty patients not be treated with dry needling after ACL surgery, using only proprioceptive exercises to the joint (group B).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dry Needling Effectiveness of Patients on Break Anterior Cruciate Ligament.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It carries out a last fifteen days ECA surgical reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. Twenty individuals in a group to be subjected to a technique of physiotherapy, dry needling were included. (Group A). Another group of twenty patients treated with conservative treatment performed a stability exercises and proprioception (Group B). Forty-six patients will be examined s. None had been previously operated by joint instability and all subjects were previously subjected to a diagnostic study by nuclear magnetic resonance before surgery and the diagnosis was confirmed by additional diagnostic testing. All patients will be evaluated by a physical therapist and Myofascial Trigger Point (PGM) of the vastus muscle will be evaluated. patients using the following variables are evaluated: - Pain: Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used. - Stiffness and physical function using the WOMAC scale (The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index.). - Range of motion of the knee joint: Scale ROM. - Muscular strength, balance and propiocepci√≥n: Star Excursion by Balance Scale Test.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>over eighteen and anatomically mature surgically break LCA and valued above using MRI and functional tests to confirm the rupture of the ligament. Patients who did not reach 18 years of age and those over 55, postoperative complications cause myofascial or neuropathic pain in the lower limb, as lumbasacral radiculopathy, neuropraxia, neurotmesis, axonotmesis or meralgia paresthetica; fibromyalgia. hypothyroidism iron deficiencies and patients who had a fear of needles (fear of needles).
