	<brief_summary>Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) appears to be an efficient tool to cure standard-risk acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in first CR (CR1) but the choice between BU-based or TBI-based conditioning regimens still remains controversial. In this study, the safety and efficacy of BUCY and TBICY myeloablative conditioning regimens in patients undergoing allo-HSCT for ALL in CR1 are evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BuCY vs TBICY Conditioning Regimen for Standard-risk ALL Undergoing Allo-HSCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allo-HSCT appears to be an efficient tool to cure standard-risk ALL in CR1. The conditioning regimen with BUCY or TBICY is considered as the standard myeloablative regimen for ALL in CR1, but the choice between BU-based or TBI-based conditioning regimen still remains controversial.In order to analyze the impact of conditioning regimen on long-term survival and relapse, in this study, the safety and efficacy of BUCY and TBICY myeloablative conditioning regimens in patients undergoing allo-HSCT for ALL in CR1 are evaluated.</detailed_description>
