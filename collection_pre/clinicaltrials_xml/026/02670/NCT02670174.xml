	<brief_summary>A randomized controlled trial will be conducted to examine the effectiveness of a traditional home exercise program versus an kinetic chain home exercise program on treatment outcome of overhead athletes with shoulder impingement syndrome. Primary outcome measures are reduction of pain and disability, and improvement in functionality and sports performance. Secondary outcome measures are strength, mobility, flexibility and functional performance.</brief_summary>
