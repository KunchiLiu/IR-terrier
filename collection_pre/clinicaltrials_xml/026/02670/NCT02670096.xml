	<brief_summary>This is a single center pilot study evaluating the immediate effects of low-dose acetazolamide on respiratory control in subjects with treatment emergent sleep disordered breathing. The purpose of this study is to assess the immediate effect one-time low-dose acetazolamide on sleep breathing in (Treatment Emergent Sleep Disordered Breathing) TE-CSA subjects compared to subjects' baseline evaluation without acetazolamide. Investigators will also try to determine the immediate effect of one-time low-dose acetazolamide on subjects' resting ventilation and ventilatory response slope compared to subjects' baseline evaluation without acetazolamide.</brief_summary>
