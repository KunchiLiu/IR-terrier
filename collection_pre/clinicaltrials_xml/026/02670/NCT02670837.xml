	<brief_summary>Few but persistent wounds often remain even after successful hematopoietic cell transplantation for systemic genodermatosis epidermolysis bullosa (EB). The investigators propose local wound therapy using epidermal skin grafting from the same donor that provided the hematopoietic graft, or from the same EB individual with a mosaic (naturally gene corrected) skin. In both cases permissive immune system and skin chimerism is expected to enable long-term epidermal engraftment and wound healing. The investigators will use FDA approved vacuum device (CelluTome®, Regulation number 878.4820) that enables painless, bloodless and scar-free harvesting of epidermis and its transfer on a square of surgical tape (Tegaderm®) to the recipient as a wound dressing.</brief_summary>
