	<brief_summary>Study conducted to confirm phrenic nerve stimulation using the Lungpacer LIVE Catheter, confirm capture of the diaphragm and confirm that the diaphragm can be paced in synchrony with mechanical ventilator breaths.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Percutaneous Temporary Placement of a Phrenic Nerve Stimulator for Diaphragm Pacing, a First in Human Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is being conducted to determine if in an anaesthetized (sedated, intubated and mechanically ventilated) subject the LIVE Catheter can be inserted percutaneously and activated via the electrical stimulator to stimulate the left and right phrenic nerves causing the diaphragm to contract in synchrony with mechanical ventilator breaths via phrenic nerve stimulation from a transvenously delivered electrical current.</detailed_description>
