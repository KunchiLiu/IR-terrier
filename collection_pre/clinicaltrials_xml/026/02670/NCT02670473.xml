	<brief_title>Clinical Performance of Existing Wearers of Enfilcon A Following a Refit With Fanfilcon A Lenses for 4 Weeks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 30 subject, prospective, dispensing, bilateral wear, subject-masked study, reviewing the refit characteristics in a group of enfilcon A wearers switched to the fanfilcon A lens. Subject's habitual enfilcon A lenses will be evaluated at the first vist and then re-fitted with a pair of fanfilcon A lenses for 4 weeks of daily wear. After the dispensing visit, subjects will return for evaluations at 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
