	<brief_title>Open Label Extension Study to Evaluate the Long-term Safety of Zorblisa (SD-101-6.0) in Patients With Epidermolysis Bullosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) is a rare group of inherited disorders that typically manifest at birth as blistering and lesion formation on the skin and, in some cases, the epithelial lining of other organs, in response to little or no apparent trauma. In consequence, the skin is extremely fragile which can result in shearing of the skin, causing a high risk of infection. All forms of EB are both debilitating and life threatening. In some EB subtypes, high mortality occurs before the age of 1 (Junctional Herlitz), and others in adolescences to early adulthood, typically due to infection or failure to thrive. In addition, children surviving into their 20's and 30's are also at risk for development of a virulent form of squamous cell carcinoma, which is in many cases fatal. There are no standard of care products available to treat the dermal manifestations of EB, and there is no approved drug for EB in either Europe or the United States. There have been numerous studies published on potential treatments for skin manifestations associated with EB, including vitamin E therapy, systemic phenytoin, topical nonsteroidal agents, cyproheptadine, tetracycline, and dapsone. No controlled studies showed clinical benefit of any therapy. Newer exploratory treatments including skin grafts, bioengineered skin products, and gene therapy have been unsuccessful to date. This is an open label, multi-center extension study to assess the long-term safety of topically applied ZORBLISA in patients with Simplex, Recessive Dystrophic, and Junctional non-Herlitz Epidermolysis Bullosa. ZORBLISA will be applied topically, once a day, to the entire body for a period of 1440 days. Patients who successfully completed study SD-005 (on study drug at Visit 5) will have the option to roll over into the SD-006 study. The baseline visit (Visit 1) will occur at Visit 5 for SD-005. The Body Surface Area (BSA) assessments of lesional skin and wound burden performed at the Visit 5 for SD-005 will be utilized as the baseline assessment for SD-006. Patients will return for follow-up visits at months 1, 3, 6, 9 ,12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, and 48 after Visit 1. At each visit, assessments will include BSA of lesional skin and wound burden. For target wounds that are not closed by the end of Study SD-005, the ARANZ picture and calculation of target wound area at the final visit for Study SD-005 will used as the baseline area size of the target wound for SD-006. These unhealed target wounds from SD-005 will be assessed via ARANZ at each subsequent scheduled visit until the target wound is documented as closed. Closed wounds will be assessed for scarring.</detailed_description>
