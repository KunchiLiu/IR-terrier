	<brief_summary>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of crenezumab versus placebo in participants with prodromal to mild AD. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either intravenous (IV) infusion of crenezumab or placebo every 4 weeks (q4w) for 100 weeks. The final efficacy and safety assessment will be performed 52 weeks after the last crenezumab dose.</brief_summary>
