	<brief_title>Aromatherapy for Chemotherapy-induced Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study is an exploratory trial to evaluate the use of aromatherapy for symptom management in patients undergoing chemotherapy. The investigators will accrue 120 adult cancer subjects undergoing chemotherapy in a initial efficacy study to determine the effectiveness of three different aromatherapies (ginger, lavender, or orange) on chemotherapy-related symptoms (nausea, vomiting, pain, anxiety, sleep difficulties, fatigue, and lack of appetite) compared to placebo (i.e., jojoba). All subjects will be randomized to one of the four arms for symptom management during three different chemotherapy cycles. The investigators will examine the incidence and severity of the seven symptoms at each chemotherapy cycle. The preliminary data from this study will elucidate the relationships between certain aromatherapies and specific symptom relief, which can be further evaluated in a larger confirmatory study of subjects undergoing chemotherapy or other types of cancer treatment. This study will provide clinical evidence regarding the incorporation of aromatherapy into cancer patient care.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Nonpregnant adults between the ages of 21 to 89 years of age with diagnosis of cancer and be scheduled to receive at least three more cycles of chemotherapy. Subjects must have had at least one chemotherapy cycle in their current prescribed course and have at least three additional chemotherapy cycles planned. Day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle must be separated from Day 1 of the next chemotherapy cycles by at least 12 days. All chemotherapy regimens are eligible. Any number of chemotherapy administrations per week during a chemotherapy treatment cycle is allowed. Subjects must be aromatherapynaïve and not have used or be currently using aromatherapy inhalation for symptom management. NOTE: Patients that use or have used scented soaps, lotions, shampoos, body sprays, perfume/cologne, candles, or air fresheners are eligible. Subjects must be able to read and understand English, as well as provide informed consent in order to participate in this study. Subjects &lt; 21 years old or &gt; 89 years old are not eligible for participation in this study at the University of Rochester. Pregnant females are ineligible for the study because pregnancy is a contraindication for chemotherapy and exposure to essentials oils. Subjects who are chemotherapynaïve are ineligible. Subjects with more than four weeks between chemotherapy treatment cycles are not eligible. Concurrent radiation therapy or interferon treatment is not allowed. Subjects that have used or are currently using aromatherapy inhalation for symptom management are not eligible. Subjects with any known allergy to ginger, lavender, orange, citrus of any kind, jojoba, or essential oils.</criteria>
