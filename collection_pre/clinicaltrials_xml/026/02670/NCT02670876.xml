	<detailed_description>The present study included previous perpetrators of school bullying who were convicted for a minor offense, including physical or verbal assaults or theft, and who were referred by the police to participate in an anti-bullying intervention. The program consisted of 8 sessions over 4 weeks and was conducted by a board-certified psychiatrist and a therapist with previous training in psychosocial treatments. The intervention was based on CBT principles and addressed various factors that have been associated with perpetrators of school bullying, including impulse control, perspective taking (empathy), and the enhancement of communication skills. All participants completed the Korean Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophreniaâ€”Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL) administered by board-certified child and adolescent psychiatrists. The validity and reliability of the original and Korean versions of the K-SADS-PL have been established. Intelligence quotient (IQ) was measured using the Korean Educational Developmental Institute's Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. Prior to and after participation in the program, all participants underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (structural and functional) and completed neurocognitive tests that included the continuous performance test (CPT), the Stroop Word and Color Test, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). The parents of the participants completed questionnaires including the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).
