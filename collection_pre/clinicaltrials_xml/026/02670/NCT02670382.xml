	<brief_title>Role of Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) and Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) on Inflammation and Lipids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study of the effects of EPA and DHA on inflammation and lipid metabolism in 24 men and women with metabolic syndrome. The study will characterize the effects of EPA alone and DHA alone, relative to each other and to placebo, on plasma biomarkers of inflammation, inflammatory cell activation and gene expression, and plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels.</detailed_description>
