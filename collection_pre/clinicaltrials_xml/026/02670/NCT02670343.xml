	<brief_summary>An open-label, single oral TU dose study was conducted in eight (8) hypogonadal men at a single study site. Each study participant received a single oral TU dose immediately prior to a standardized breakfast meal comprised of 800 to 1000 calories and approximately 30 g of fat. Blood samples were collected 30 minutes prior dose administration and at 0 pre-dose and post dose at the following hours post-dose; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 hours.</brief_summary>
