	<brief_summary>This study is a randomized controlled trial designed to compare the effects of 4 weeks of chiropractic care to a waitlist control group on measures of strength, balance, and endurance in military personnel experiencing non-surgical low back pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of Chiropractic Treatment: Strength and Balance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will assess three functional outcomes (strength, balance and endurance) and patient-reported outcomes in participants with low back pain (LBP) treated with chiropractic care, providing evidence that may enhance our understanding of the relationship between functional outcomes and chiropractic care. The findings from this study may support the use of chiropractic care for military personnel as an effective, conservative treatment for low back pain that may also help preserve or improve functional outcomes and thus, allow active duty personnel to better perform the physical demands required of them.</detailed_description>
