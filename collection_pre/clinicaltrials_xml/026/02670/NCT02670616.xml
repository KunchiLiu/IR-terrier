	<brief_summary>EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma has EBV-mediated oncogenic signaling pathway activation, and these multiple intracellular pathway can be potential therapeutic target in this disorder. Thus, EBV-associated protein, LMP1 can induce the activation of various downstream pathway molecules such as PI3K/Akt and NF-kB activation. The activation of NF-kB is one of essential factors contributing to prolonged survival and aggressive phenotype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In a more aggressive subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, activated B-cell like type, chronic active B-cell receptor signaling and MYD88 mutation are known to stimulate NF-kB transcription and activation. As a result, a key molecule mediating B-cell receptor signaling pathway, Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) can have a critical role, and BTK has been emerging as a therapeutic target in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Considering the close association between B-cell receptor signaling pathway and PI3K/Akt pathway in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, targeting BTK might be helpful for improving treatment outcome of EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Ibrutinib, BTK inhibitor has an activity against B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma via targeting on B-cell receptor signaling pathway. As a result, the evidence of antitumor- effect of Ibrutinib has been accumulated in several types of B-cell lymphoma such as mantle cell lymphoma. Given EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is known as having poor response to treatment compared to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (NOS), the addition of ibrutinib to standard chemotherapy regimen, rituximab-CHOP may provide benefit these patients.</brief_summary>

Men must agree to not donate sperm during and after the study. For females, these restrictions apply for 1 month after the last dose of study drug. For males, these restrictions apply for 3 months after the last dose of study drug 5. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (betahuman chorionic gonadotropin)or urine pregnancy test at Screening.
