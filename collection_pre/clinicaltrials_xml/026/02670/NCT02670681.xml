	<brief_summary>The aim of this intervention study is to evaluate the acute and chronic effects of different intensity (mild, moderate and high intensity) of aerobic exercise on blood pressure levels of subjects classified as resistant hypertension. Resistant hypertensives subjects aged 40 to 70, men or women with body mass index lower that 40 kg/m² are recruited and subjected in acute phase in three sessions of aerobic exercise: mild, moderate, high intensity; and session control. After, the subjects will be randomly allocated into four intervention groups: mild intensity group, moderate intensity group, high intensity group and control group. In both phases, the subjects have blood pressure data recorded by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, for clinic and ambulatory analysis. In addition, continuously be registered biological signs of blood pressure (finometer), electrocardiogram (DII derivation) and blood flow (venous occlusion plethysmography) for analysis of cardiac autonomic modulation, vascular autonomic modulation, baroreflex sensitivity, vasodilator response and peripheral vascular resistance.</brief_summary>
