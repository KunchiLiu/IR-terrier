	<brief_summary>Compared to hemodialysis, patients on peritoneal dialysis live longer and healthier, have a higher quality of life and cost approximately $40,000 less to the healthcare system per patient per year. However, only 18% of dialysis patients in Canada currently use peritoneal dialysis because patients often feel isolated from the healthcare team and lack the confidence to manage treatments by themselves. This study will assess a telehome monitoring system (eQ Connect™), allowing for up-to-date data transmission and digital interaction between the patients at home and their healthcare team. From the patients' perspective, this technology is an easier way to communicate with their healthcare providers, track their treatment and supplies, and receive training and support. From the providers' perspective, eQ Connect™ delivers up-to-date patient data and provides an efficient way to keep track of the patients' progress. This intervention has the potential to improve the patients' clinical outcomes, quality of life, reduce the costs of dialysis to the healthcare system and ultimately empower patients to start and stay on peritoneal dialysis.</brief_summary>
