	<brief_summary>This is an observational, multicenter, single arm, prospective study to evaluate safety and tolerability of selective and ultraselective drug eluting beads transcatheter intraarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) with up to 3 ml of well calibrated 100 µ microspheres and up to 150 mg of doxorubicin, for the treatment of non resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The hypothesis is that 100 µ beads penetrate deeper into the tumor than those eluting beads with larger volumes without increasing the risk and complications of DEB-TACE.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Study to Evaluate Safety of Deb-TACE With 100µ Beads in Patients With Non Resectable HCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this observational, prospective study patients will undergo DEB-TACE and subsequent follow up procedures according to standard clinical practice. The primary aim of the study is to describe treatment safety and tolerability of 100 µ beads in DEB-TACE. As a secondary end-point a description of efficacy parameters will be obtained.</detailed_description>
