	<brief_summary>The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS CoV), a virus related to Severe Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV), was first recognized as a cause of severe pulmonary infection in 2012. Infection with MERS CoV has been diagnosed in more than 1600 individuals with a mortality rate between 35% and 40%. GLS-5300 is a DNA plasmid vaccine that expresses the MERS CoV spike (S) glycoprotein. This study will evaluate the safety of GLS-5300 at one of three dose levels following a three-injection vaccination regimen followed by electroporation. The study will also assess immune responses over a 1 year period with respect to the generation of antibody and cellular responses.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I, Open Label Dose Ranging Safety Study of GLS-5300 in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GLS-5300 is a DNA plasmid vaccine that expresses the MERS CoV spike (S) glycoprotein. Following administration of the vaccine, a specialized medical device, CELLECTRA®, will deliver brief electrical pulses in a process known as electroporation (EP), to help move DNA into cells more efficiently.</detailed_description>
