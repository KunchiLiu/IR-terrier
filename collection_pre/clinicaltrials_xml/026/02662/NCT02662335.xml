	<brief_summary>This randomized clinical trial studies computerized cognitive retraining in improving cognitive function in breast cancer survivors. Cancer-related cognitive deficits, such as thinking and memory issues, are common among breast cancer survivors. The severity of these cognitive deficits is associated with a significant negative impact on daily function and quality of life. A computerized cognitive retraining method may help researchers find ways to improve cognitive function and quality of life in breast cancer survivors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Computerized Cognitive Retraining in Improving Cognitive Function in Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a 6-week computerized working memory training program in breast cancer survivors who subjectively report cognitive deficits: evaluate feasibility of study procedures (recruitment and screening procedures, number of participants recruited, screened, and retained, attrition rate and reason, weekly phone calls completed with participants); evaluate the acceptability of an adaptive computerized working memory training intervention (burden, adherence to training schedule, performance level achieved, and participant satisfaction with computerized exercises). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the difference in the posttest means at T2 (week #7) adjusted for T1 (baselines) in the primary working memory outcomes of visuo-spatial working memory (VSWM), visual working memory (VWM), and executive function (EF) as measured by the neuropsychological tests (Rey Auditory Test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale [WAIS] IV symbol test, WAIS IV coding test, Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System [DKFES] color tests, Trails A and Trails B tests, and WAIS IV Letter and Number sequencing test) and self-report Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) surveys (Applied Cognition General Concerns Short Form, Applied Cognition Executive Function Short Form, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy [FACT] Cognitive Function) between the intervention group and wait control group. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I (COMPUTER-ASSISTED COGNITIVE TRAINING): Patients complete a computerized working memory training program (Cogmed) over 35 minutes a day, 5 times a week for 6 weeks. ARM II (WAIT LIST): Patients undergo standard follow-up care for 6 weeks. Following standard follow-up care, patients may complete Cogmed as in the Intervention Group in weeks 7-13.</detailed_description>
