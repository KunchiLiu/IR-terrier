	<brief_summary>The purpose of this First-in-Human study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability after single ascending oral doses of GLPG2222 given to healthy subjects, compared to placebo (Part 1). Also, the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending oral doses of GLPG2222 given to healthy subjects daily for 14 days compared to placebo, will be evaluated (Part 2). Furthermore, during the course of the study after single and multiple oral dose administrations, the amount of GLPG2222 present in the blood and urine (pharmacokinetics) will be characterized. The potential of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 interaction after repeated dosing with GLPG2222 will be explored as well.</brief_summary>
