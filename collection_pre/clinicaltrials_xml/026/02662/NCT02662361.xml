	<detailed_description>Objective: To investigate the patient-related risk factors for peri-implant disease in partially edentulous patients rehabilitated with implants supported crown or bridge so as to provide evidence for clinical prevention and control. Methods:A total of 131 patients will enroll in the study. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis is used to determine the patient factors associated with peri-implant disease. The variables include age, gender, smoking and alcohol consumption, presence of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, bruxism, bleeding upon brushing, reason for extraction, oral hygiene and periodontal status.</detailed_description>
