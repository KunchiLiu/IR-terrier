	<brief_summary>A prospective randomized study of patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy between 2012 and 2015 will be performed. Patients will be divided into 3 groups: Analgesia iv exclusively (Group 1), epidural analgesia+analgesia iv (Group 2) and port-sites infiltration+analgesia iv (Group 3). Pain will be quantified by means of a Visual Analogic Scale and morphine rescue needs were determined 24 hours after surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A prospective randomized study of patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy between 2012 and 2015 will be performed. Patients will be randomized using a computerized simple randomization scheme in a 1:1:1 ratio into 3 groups: those patients receiving only intravenous analgesia (Group 1), those ones receiving intravenous analgesia associated to epidural analgesia (Group 2) and those patients receiving intravenous analgesia associated with port-sites infiltration with bupivacaine. Pain quantification as measured by Visual Analogic Scale (VAS), ranging from 0 (absence of pain) to 10 (unbearable pain) will be evaluated 24 hours after surgery.</detailed_description>
