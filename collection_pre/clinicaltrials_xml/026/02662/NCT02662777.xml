	<detailed_description>Anastomotic Leakages or other defects in the upper gastrointestinal tract can have serious consequences for the affected patients. Different parameters, like the size, location, time to diagnosis of the lesion, but also the general condition of the patient, have a significant influence on the clinical outcome of the patient. Often this situation is accompanied by symptoms of sepsis and a significant morbidity rate with corresponding substantial mortality rate. For this reason the treatment of this clinical situation is often a challenge for the clinician. Besides surgical examination and the endoscopic stent system, good experiences have been obtained with the Endo-SPONGE速 therapy for the lower gastrointestinal tract. In the future the endoluminal vacuum therapy for the upper gastrointestinal is available, too, with Eso-SPONGE速. Eso-SPONGE速 represent an innovative therapy concept for the treatment of this problem in the upper gastrointestinal tract, which can contribute significantly to the reduction of morbidity and mortality of the patients. The overall success rate of endoscopic esophageal vacuum therapy in the literature ranges from 80-100%. Currently only cohort studies including a small number of patients have been performed and published. Therefore an international, prospective and multicenter registry was designed to collect clinical evidence for Eso-SPONGE treatment concept in a large population under daily clinical routine.</detailed_description>
