	<criteria>Patients with known or newly discovered chronic heart failure admitted to hospital because of the clinical signs of acut cardiac decompensation High level of fatigue (the patient cannot stand on a scale) Amputated upper and/or lower limb(s) The BCM analysis is not possible technically (e.g. open wounds on the limbs) Severe obesity (&gt;130 kg) Patients on chronic hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis Severe fluid volume in the transcellular space Patients with a unipolar pacemaker whose sensitivity threshold is very low Pregnancy, lactation</criteria>
