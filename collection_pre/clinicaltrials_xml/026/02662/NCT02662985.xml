	<brief_summary>This study is designed to leverage the sensitivity of ultrasonography available in clinical practice setting to better describe the time course of response to secukinumab (150 mg and 300 mg) on joint synovitis and enthesitis in PsA patients with an inadequate response to non-biologic DMARDs. PDUS changes in joint synovitis will be assessed using the global Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT)-European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) synovitis score (GLOESS) and changes in joint enthesitis will be assessed using the OMERACT enthesitis score.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Application of Power Doppler Ultrasonography (PDUS) to Measure Response to Secukinumab Treatment in Patients With Active Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 52-week, multicenter, international study consisting of a 2 to 4-week Screening period, a 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind treatment period (Period 1), a 12-week open-label treatment period (Period 2) and a 6-month open-label extension period (Period 3). Treatment Period 1 is a 12-week placebo-controlled, randomized period primarily designed to demonstrate the early and optimal efficacy of secukinumab vs placebo on joint synovitis using PDUS via the GLOESS and global entheseal score after 12 weeks of treatment. The main aim of Period 2 is to assess the maintenance or increased magnitude of treatment response on joint synovitis for patients from the original secukinumab groups and to assess the time course of response with secukinumab on joint synovitis in the original placebo group switched to secukinumab from Week 12. The main aim of Period 3 (extension period) is to allow patients who respond to secukinumab to extend study treatment up to Week 52 or until commercial drug becomes available, whichever occurs sooner.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patient must be able to understand and communicate with the Investigator and comply with the requirements of the study and must provide written, signed and dated informed consent before any study assessment is performed. 2. Male or female patients at least 18 years of age. 3. Diagnosis of PsA as per CASPAR with active PsA for at least 6 months and a TJC ≥ 3 of 78 and SJC ≥ 3 of 76 at Baseline. 4. Patients must have a total synovitis PDUS score ≥ 2 and inflammation related to PD signal ≥ 2 for at least 2 (affected joints as observed via PDUS) of 48 joints at the Screening visit and at the Baseline visit (before infusion). 5. At least 1 clinicallyinvolved enthesitis site at Screening and at the Baseline visit (before infusion) defined by SPARCC index different from 0. 1. Chest Xray or chest MRI with evidence of ongoing infectious or malignant process obtained within 3 months prior to Screening and evaluated by a qualified physician. 2. Previous exposure to secukinumab or other biologic drug directly targeting IL17 or IL17 receptor. 3. Any change in the dose of oral corticosteroids in the last 4 weeks prior to the Baseline visit or use of i.v. intramuscular or intraarticular corticosteroid during the last 4 weeks prior to the enrollment visit. 4. Patients who have previously been treated with TNFα inhibitors (investigational or approved). 5. History of hypersensitivity to the study drug or its excipients or to drugs of similar classes. 6. Previous treatment with any celldepleting therapies including but not limited to anti CD20 investigational agents (e.g. CAMPATH, antiCD4, antiCD5, antiCD3, anti CD19). 7. Prohibited psoriasis treatments/medications with topical corticosteroids in the last 4 weeks prior to randomization. 8. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women..</criteria>
