	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the efficacy of analgesia provided by liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel) when compared to bupivacaine HCL as a transverse abdominis plane (TAP) block in terms of discharge milestones, opioid use, costs, and patient-reported satisfaction at 12, 24, and 72 hours. The investigators propose that Exparel will lower opioid use, length of stay, and overall cost of abdominally-based autologous breast reconstruction, and will lead to greater patient satisfaction.</brief_summary>
