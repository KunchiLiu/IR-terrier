	<brief_summary>This study investigates the use of a kinematic measurement device to quantify the abnormal head movements and postures in patients with cervical dystonia (CD) in order to individualize and optimize botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) injection therapy. A single sensor captures five degrees of freedom of the neck and head that distinguish which muscle(s) contribute to CD and the amount of BoNT-A to inject into these muscle(s). The efficacy, relief and improvements in social, occupation and function by injections will be investigated. The efficacy of BoNT-A therapy using either BoNT-A injection parameters from clinical-based assessments and kinematically-based assessments will be investigated in CD patients. Individuals clinically diagnosed with CD will be randomized for two treatment conditions: A) injection parameters from a kinematic assessment only, or B) injection parameters from a clinical assessment only.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Consenting male and female individuals between the ages of 18 and 80 Diagnosed with idiopathic spasmodic torticollis (also called cervical dystonia) by neurologist Botulinum neurotoxin type A injection(BoNT A; Botox速) na誰ve individuals will be randomized into either clinicalassessment arm or kinematicassessment arm and the participants will be blinded to which arm they are a part of CD individuals who are receiving suboptimal BoNTA effects will be recruited to receive kinematicbased injections. These participants will have to wait a minimum of 4 months before participating in this study Able to attend all study sessions Able to provide written consent Pregnant individuals Women who are nursing Individuals with a known Botox速 allergy Individuals with a known or suspected traumatic cause for the torticollis, a prior thalamotomy, or peripheral (nerve or muscle) operation Individuals with cervical contractures that limit passive range of motion Motor/nerve diseases such as myasthenia gravis, other diseases of the neuromuscular junction and/or Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Myotomy or denervation surgery involving the neck or shoulder region</criteria>
