	<brief_title>A Safety and Feasibility Study of AGS-003-LNG for the Treatment of Stage 3 Non Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Feasibility and Safety study of autologous dendritic cell immunotherapy (AGS-003-LNG) in patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer. Non-small cell lung cancer tumor will be resected from the patient. RNA from the tumor will be amplified and subsequently electroporated into matured, autologous dendritic cells. The dendritic cells with tumor RNA will be dosed back to the patient. Study will investigate feasibility and safety.</detailed_description>
