	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to develop a mobile health (mHealth) application that will both advance theory in and clinical practice of homework (HW) implementation. The mobile health application will enhance the existing evidence informed curriculum of a Multiple Family Group model (called 4 Rs and 2 Ss for Strengthening Families Model) for families with children who have disruptive behavior disorders. This mobile application consists of two primary components that will support engagement and integration of the model's core concepts in family life. The first component focuses on delivering homework via a highly engaging, multiplayer, interactive, cooperative, and skill-building game platform aimed at improving the "Design" and "Do" process of homework.The second component focuses on targeting factors putatively related to poor HW implementation within the "Do" process.</brief_summary>
