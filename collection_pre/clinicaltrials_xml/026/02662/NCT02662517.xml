	<brief_summary>Human breast milk contains growth factors including neurotrophins and cells with neuroprotective potential. Concerning growth factors milk of preterms differs significantly from term milk. The aim of this study is to give a profile of human milk concerning non-nutritive factors depending on gestational age and lactation phase.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neurotrophins (epidermal growth factor (EGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), nerve growth factor (NGF), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)) as well as amount of cells, especially positive for sex-determining transformer protein (TRA)-1-81 and stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA)-4, are planned to be quantified in human breast milk of extremely preterm newborns as well as term newborns at different stages of lactation.</detailed_description>
