	<brief_title>Effect of Language and Confusion on Pain During Peripheral Intravenous Catheterization (KTHYPE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinicians used to warn patients of pain or discomfort before potentially painful procedures like peripherical intravenous catheterization (PIVC). However, suggestions for negative perceptual experiences causes more pain and anxiety. During This does not improve at all the real-life experience of the act. On the contrary, the use of gentler words improves pain perception and subjective patient experience. Furthermore, hypnosis has been demonstrated as efficient and the pain perception seems to be modulate by hypnotic suggestions.</detailed_description>
