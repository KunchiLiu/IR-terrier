	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine whether in patients with early type 2 diabetes,a short-term intensive metabolic intervention comprising of sitagliptin, metformin, basal insulin glargine and lifestyle approaches will be superior to standard diabetes therapy in achieving sustained diabetes remission.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Remission Evaluation of a Metabolic Intervention in Type 2 Diabetes With Sitagliptin (REMIT-Sita)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicentre, open-label, randomized controlled trial in 100 patients with recently-diagnosed T2DM. Participants will be randomized to 2 treatment groups: (a) a 12-week course of treatment with sitagliptin, metformin, insulin glargine and lifestyle therapy, or (b) standard diabetes therapy, and followed for a total of 64 weeks (1 year and 3 months). In all participants with HbA1C &lt; 7.3% at the 12 week visit, glucose-lowering medications will be discontinued and participants will be encouraged to continue with lifestyle modifications and regular glucose monitoring. Participants with HbA1C ≥ 7.3% at this visit or who meet criteria for hyperglycemic relapse after stopping drugs will receive standard glycemic management as informed by the current Canadian Diabetes Association clinical practice guidelines</detailed_description>
