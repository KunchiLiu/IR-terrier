	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) combined with recombined human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor(rhGM-CSF) is safe, effective in the treatment of stage IV NSCLC patients who failed in second-line chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of SBRT in Combination With rhGM-CSF for Stage IV NSCLC Patients Who Failed in Second-line Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metastasis lesion will be treated with a SBRT of 50Gy/5F from day 1 to day 5 in one cycle.Subcutaneous injection of human recombined granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (125ug/m² per day) will be executed from day 1 to day 14 in this cycle. Another metastasis lesion will be treated likewise concurrently with rhGM-CSF in a consecutive cycle. Efficacy evaluation,especially abscopal effect evaluation, will be conducted at the end of therapy and every month after that. Adverse events will be recorded according to NCI-CTC version 4.03.</detailed_description>
