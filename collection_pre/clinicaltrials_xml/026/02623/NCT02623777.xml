	<brief_summary>During this project the investigators will evaluate whether the effects of arabinoxylan oligosaccharides (AXOS) consumption on insulin resistance in participants with metabolic syndrome can be explained by the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Secondly, the investigators will evaluate whether changes in gut hormone production might explain the effect on insulin resistance.</brief_summary>
