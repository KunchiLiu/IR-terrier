	<brief_title>A Comparison of Controlled Ventilation With the V60 Non-Invasive Ventilator vs. Traditional Mask Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine whether an experienced anesthesia provider can adequately and/or easily mask ventilate an anesthetized patient with a commercial non-invasive ventilator device. The ventilator subject of this study is commonly used in the ICU and investigators aim to evaluate its usefulness in the OR. Investigators believe that the ventilator will ventilate with consistent breath rates, adequate tidal volumes and minimal airway pressures. The providers subjective scoring of ease or difficulty of ventilation with each device will also be recorded.</detailed_description>
