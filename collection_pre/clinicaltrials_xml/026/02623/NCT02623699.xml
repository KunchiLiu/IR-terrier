	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of BIIB067 in adults with ALS. The secondary objective is to evaluate the effects of BIIB067 on levels of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Weakness attributable to ALS and documented SOD1 mutation at Screening Visit 2. A forced vital capacity (FVC) ≥50% of predicted value as adjusted for sex, age, and height (from the sitting position). Participants with stable FVC &lt;50% but ≥45%, whose FVC has not declined by more than 5% in the last 6 months may be considered for inclusion, at the discretion of the Investigator. If taking riluzole, Participant must be on a stable dose for ≥30 days prior to Day 1 and expected to remain at that dose until the final study visit. Medically able to undergo the study procedures, and to adhere to the visit schedule at the time of study entry, as determined by the Investigator. Key History of or positive test result for human immunodeficiency virus. History of or positive test result for hepatitis C virus antibody or hepatitis B virus (defined as positive for both hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B core antibody). Treatment with another investigational drug, biological agent, or device within 1 month or 5 halflives of study agent, whichever is longer. Specifically, no prior treatment with small interfering ribonucleic acid, stem cell therapy, or gene therapy is allowed. Current enrollment in any other interventional study. Current or recent (within 1 month) use, or anticipated need, in the opinion of the Investigator, of copper (II) (diacetylbis (N4methylthiosemicarbazone)) or pyrimethamine. Current or anticipated need, in the opinion of the Investigator, of a diaphragm pacing system (DPS) during the study period. Tracheostomy NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
