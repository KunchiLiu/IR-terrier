	<brief_summary>The Macular Edema Ranibizumab v. Intravitreal anti-inflammatory Therapy (MERIT) Trial will compare the relative efficacy and safety of intravitreal methotrexate, intravitreal ranibizumab, and the intravitreal dexamethasone implant for the treatment of uveitic macular edema persisting after an intravitreal corticosteroid injection. MERIT is a parallel design (1:1:1), randomized comparative trial with an anniversary close-out at the 6 month clinic visit. The primary outcome is percent change in central subfield thickness from the baseline OCT measurement to the 12 week visit.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Macular Edema Ranibizumab v. Intravitreal Anti-inflammatory Therapy Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Macular edema (ME) is the most common structural complication and cause of visual impairment and legal blindness in uveitis patients. Traditional approaches to the treatment of uveitic ME have included the use of regional corticosteroid therapy, delivered periocularly, including posterior sub-Tenon's and orbital floor injections, or via the intravitreal route. While corticosteroid injections may reduce ME and improve vision, the effect is often variable with a limited duration. Persistent macular edema is a common occurrence and often requires repeated intravitreal injections of corticosteroids, which expose eyes to a significant risk of increased intraocular pressure ocular and cataract development. The often refractory nature of uveitic ME and its impact on visual function underscores the need to identify effective alternative medical therapeutic options. Recent pilot studies have shown intravitreal methotrexate (MTX) and intravitreal ranibizumab (Lucentis®, Genentech Inc., San Francisco, CA) to be promising treatments for uveitic ME, and intravitreal dexamethasone implant (Ozurdex®, Allergan, Irvine, CA) has recently been approved by the U.S. FDA for uveitic ME in patients with non-infectious uveitis. In addition to being effective, intravitreal MTX and ranibizumab potentially may have less ocular side effects than corticosteroids, particularly less IOP elevation. However, the relative efficacy of these treatments is unknown. The Macular Edema Ranibizumab v. Intravitreal anti-inflammatory Therapy (MERIT) Trial will compare the relative efficacy and safety of intravitreal methotrexate, ranibizumab, and dexamethasone implant. MERIT is a parallel design (1:1:1), randomized comparative effectiveness trial with an anniversary close-out at the 6 month clinic visit. The primary outcome is percent change in central subfield thickness from the baseline OCT measurement to the 12 week visit.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eye level inclusion criteria at least one eye must meet all of the following conditions: 1. Inactive or minimally active noninfectious anterior, intermediate, posterior or panuveitis, as defined by SUN criteria as ≤ 0.5+ anterior chamber cells, ≤ 0.5+ vitreous haze grade and no active retinal/choroidal lesions for a minimum of 4 weeks; 2. Macular edema (ME) defined as the presence of macular thickness greater than the normal range for the OCT machine being used (see cut points below), regardless of the presence of cysts, following an intravitreal corticosteroid injection (≥ 4 weeks following intravitreal triamcinolone injection or ≥ 12 weeks following intravitreal dexamethasone implant injection); Greater than 300 μm for Zeiss Cirrus Greater than 320 μm for Heidelberg Spectralis Greater than 300 μm for Topcon 3DOCT 3. Baseline fluorescein angiogram that, as assessed by the study ophthalmologist, is gradable for degree of leakage in the central subfield; 4. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) 5/200 or better; 5. Baseline intraocular pressure &gt; 5 mm Hg and ≤ 21 mm Hg (current use ≤3 intraocular pressurelowering medications and/or prior glaucoma surgery are acceptable); 6. Media clarity and pupillary dilation sufficient to allow OCT testing and assessment of the fundus; Patient level exclusion criteria 1. History of infectious uveitis in either eye; 2. History of scleritis or keratitis of any type in either eye; 3. History of central serous retinopathy in either eye; 4. Active infectious conjunctivitis in either eye; 5. Oral prednisone dose &gt; 10 mg per day (or of an alternative corticosteroid at a dose higher than that equipotent to prednisone 10 mg per day) OR oral prednisone dose ≤ 10 mg per day that has not been stable for at least 4 weeks; 6. Systemic immunosuppressive drug therapy that has not been stable for at least 28 days (note use of systemic methotrexate is acceptable as long as regimen has been stable for at least 28 days); 7. Use of oral acetazolamide or other systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor at baseline; 8. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any component of the study drugs; 9. For women of childbearing potential: pregnancy, breastfeeding, or a positive pregnancy test; unwilling to practice an adequate birth control method (abstinence, combination barrier and spermicide, or hormonal) for duration of trial; Eye level exclusion criteria at least one eye that meets all inclusion criteria cannot have any of the following conditions 10. History of infectious endophthalmitis; 11. History of uncontrolled glaucoma as defined by optic nerve damage (cup/disc ratio of ≥ 0.9 or any notching of optic nerve to the rim); 12. Presence of an epiretinal membrane noted clinically or by OCT that per the judgment of study ophthalmologist may be significant enough to limit improvement of ME (i.e., causing substantial wrinkling of the retinal surface); 13. Torn or ruptured posterior lens capsule; 14. Presence of silicone oil; 15. Ozurdex administered in past 12 weeks; 16. AntiVEGF agent, intravitreal methotrexate, or intravitreal/periocular corticosteroid administered in past 4 weeksIntravitreal/periocular corticosteroid administered in past 4 weeks; 17.
