	<brief_title>Stay Healthy In Nature Everyday: Family Nature Outings in a Low Income Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite mounting evidence that nature matters for human health, we are not aware of any prospective intervention trials looking at the use of nature as a health intervention. Like other protective factors, such as the presence of a caring adult, safe play places, greater stimulation, the presence of green-space in a child's life has been empirically linked to greater resilience. Nature has been proposed as a buffer to stress through several pathways: by providing a space for friends and families to gather (thereby increasing social support and improving family relationships), by increasing opportunities for physical activity, and by improving cognition. Research to date suggests that participation in outdoor activities facilitates a sense of connectedness to place. This sense of attachment may also provide a form of social support. Families served by Children's Hospital Oakland Primary Care Clinic experience high levels of stress. As a safety-net clinic, the primary care clinic serves a diverse set of patients, with a common thread of poverty. The Stay Healthy In Nature program was developed to encourage stress management skills through play and physical activity in parks. The program uses a combination of facilitated and independent outings into local parks to encourage sustained behavior change and measurable health benefits.</detailed_description>
