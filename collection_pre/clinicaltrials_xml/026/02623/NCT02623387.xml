	<brief_title>Ultrasound Guided Versus Standard Paravertebral Blockade in Breast Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adequate pain control is important in breast cancer surgery. In addition to benefits to patients, effective pain management strategies also facilitate day case surgery. Regional anaesthetic techniques, and paravertebral blocks in particular, are valuable in this sphere. The conventional method of administering this block is blind and depends on anatomical landmarks for placement. Performing the block under US guidance provides real time imaging while advancing the needle. This might allow for a more accurate placement and hence a more effective block which would enhance pain relief and minimise complications.</detailed_description>
