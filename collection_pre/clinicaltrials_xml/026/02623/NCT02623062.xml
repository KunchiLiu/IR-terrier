	<brief_summary>This study is being conducted in China to provide evidence for inclusion in applications to competent authorities that the Compound Sodium Alginate Oral Suspension sachet is effective in managing the symptoms of heartburn and acid regurgitation in patients with gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Compound Sodium Alginate Oral Suspension Sachet Symptomatic Relief Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-centre, randomised, double blind, two arm, parallel group, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with moderate to severe and frequent GERD symptoms. After signing a written informed consent, patients will undergo a screening period of up to 7 days. Patients who satisfy the study entry requirements within 7 days of consent, will be randomised to receive either Compound Sodium Alginate Oral Suspension sachets (20ml four times daily) or matching placebo sachets (20ml four times daily),for a 7- day treatment period. At the beginning and end of the treatment period, patients will be required to complete the Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ). In addition, at the end of the 7 (-1 day to +2 days) day treatment period, patients will be required to complete the Overall Treatment Evaluation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Primary diagnosis: Current evidence of symptomatic GERD/NERD that comply with the Montreal definition of GERD/Nonerosive Esophageal Reflux Disease (NERD). GERD is a condition which develops when the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications. The concept of NERD is preserved in the typical reflux syndrome without esophageal injury, while reflux esophagitis falls under the category of esophageal syndromes with esophageal injury. GERD status: patients will be recruited by the Investigator from outpatient clinics, hospital database or those who respond to the advertising. Patients must have a GERD history of frequent episodes of GERDrelated symptoms during the last 3 months, and must have had troublesome heartburn and/or regurgitation of at least moderate intensity on at least 4 days during the week before the start of screening. Patients must be sufficiently literate to be able to complete the RDQ unaided. Patients who have a history of drug, solvent or alcohol abuse (weekly alcohol intake â‰¥ 140g). Patients who have suffered cardiac chest pain within the last year. Patients who have suffered a recent, significant unexplained weight loss of more than 6 kg in the last 6 months. Female patients of childbearing potential who, for the duration of the study, are either unwilling or unable to take adequate contraceptive precautions or are unwilling to be sexually abstinent. Pregnancy or lactating mother. Patients with a history and/or symptom profile suggestive of the following: any other gastrointestinal (GI) disease (e.g. gastric or duodenal erosions and polyps larger than 0.5 cm), erosive GERD (Los Angeles [LA] classification grades CD), Barrett's esophagus, peptic ulcer and/or ulcer complications, ZollingerEllison syndrome, gastric carcinoma, pyloric stenosis, oesophageal or gastric surgery, intestinal obstruction, current pernicious anaemia, indication for Hpylori eradication, hiatal hernias greater than 3 cm, known gastrointestinal bleeding (hematochezia or hematemesis) within the last 3 months, and severe diseases of other major body systems. Patients who have taken anticholinesterase drugs, traditional Chinese medicines for treating gastrointestinal disease, Ulcermin or misoprostol preparations within 7 days prior to screening or throughout the study. Patients who have taken Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) during the 10 days prior to screening, prokinetics or H2 antagonists during the 5 days prior to screening, or systemic glucocorticosteroids, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs except low dose aspirin given for cardioprotection) on more than 3 consecutive days during the last 28 days prior to screening or PPIbased triple or quadruple therapy for eradication of Hpylori during the last 28 days prior to screening and throughout the study. Patients who have taken any antacids within 24 hours before randomisation (Visit 2) and are unwilling or unable to withhold from taking them for the duration of the study. Patients taking mucous membrane protection drugs or motility stimulants within the 5 days prior to screening and are unwilling or unable to withhold from taking them for the duration of the study. Patients with difficulty in swallowing. Patients with known hypophosphataemia, phenylketonuria or hypercalcaemia. Patients with severe constipation, or history of intestinal obstruction. In the opinion of the Investigator, patients with insufficient heart or kidney function and patients who require a low sodium diet. Patients with any coexisting condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would be likely to compromise patient safety or interfere with assessment of efficacy. Patients with any clinically significant abnormal laboratory values. Patients with severe/impaired renal function or insufficiency. Any previous history of allergy or known intolerance to any of the formulation constituents. Relevant clinically significant abnormalities in the physical examination, ECG and safety analysis. Previously randomised into the study. Employee at study site. Partner or firstdegree relative (e.g. parents, siblings or children) of the Investigator. Participation in a clinical study in the previous 6 months. Unable in the opinion of the Investigator to comply fully with the study requirements. Patients taking or requiring to take macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin, azithromycin, from the day before screening Patients who failed screening will not be allowed to reenter the study</criteria>
