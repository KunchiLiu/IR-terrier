	<brief_title>Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of JNJ-55375515 in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), double-blind (neither the investigator nor the participants know what treatment the participant is receiving), placebo-controlled (an inactive comparator treatment that has no study drug in it), single center study in healthy male participants and female participants of non-childbearing potential (surgically sterile or post menopausal), aged 18 to 58 years inclusive. This study will consist of two parts; a Single Ascending Dose (SAD) part and a Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) part. The SAD will consist of 6 escalating dose cohorts. Participants in each cohort will be randomized to receive a single oral administration of JNJ-55375515 or placebo after an overnight fast. The planned doses of JNJ-55375515 range from 0.75 to 100 milligrams (mg). Participants in an additional cohort will be dosed in the fed state to determine the effects of food on the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of JNJ-55375515. An additional optional cohort may be evaluated to further explore the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of JNJ-55375515, with the maximal dose not exceeding 200 mg. The study duration for participants in the SAD part of the study will be approximately 2 to 5.5 weeks, including eligibility Screening. The MAD will consist of 3 cohorts of 9 participants. Participants will receive once daily oral doses of JNJ-55375515 or placebo for 10 consecutive days. The study duration for participants in the MAD part of this study will be approximately 3 to 7 weeks including the eligibility Screening. The Safety of Participants will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
