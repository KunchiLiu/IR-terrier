	<brief_summary>This study will compare two clinically accepted protocols for surveillance imaging in individuals who are found to have a small pulmonary nodule on chest computed tomography (CT) scans.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Watch the Spot Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will conduct an unblinded, prospective, pragmatic, cluster-randomized, comparative effectiveness trial of more intensive versus less intensive CT surveillance of patients found to have small pulmonary nodules in diverse health care settings. The goal of this pragmatic clinical trial is to identify the surveillance strategy that will maximize early diagnosis for individuals with cancerous nodules, while minimizing unnecessary surveillance of patients without cancer that can result in emotional stress, exposure to harmful ionizing radiation, and the discovery of incidental findings that may lead to unnecessary treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The target population includes adults with small lung nodules that may represent a new diagnosis of lung cancer, who typically would be managed by CT surveillance in usual clinical practice. Thus, we will enroll all patients: aged ≥35 years at least one nodule measuring ≤15 mm in average diameter on chest CT.
