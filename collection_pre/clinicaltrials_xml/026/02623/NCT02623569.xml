	<brief_title>To Assess the Anti-anginal Safety and Efficacy of Ivabradine in Subjects With Stable，Symptomatic Chronic Angina</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Washout period：Chronic angina patients stop using medicine that affect heart rate. The patients undergoes ETT after 2-7 days and positive ETT into the treatment period(If not take similar medicine, patients can be carried out ETT directly)。 2. Treatment period：Patients carried out ETT after therapy with Ivabradine(5mg,bid)/ Atenolol(12.5mg,bid) for 4 weeks.The dose adjust base on test result and heart rate, Ivabradine(5mg,bid)/Atenolol(12.5mg,bid) or Ivabradine(7.5mg,bid)/ Atenolol(25mg,bid) for 8 weeks and carried out ETT. 3. security period：After the treatment period, all patients to take Atenolol 12.5mg/ 25mg bid 1 week. If heart rate are low 50 times/min after taking Ivabradine 5mg/ Atenolol 12.5mg, subjects should withdrawal and dropped out study. If subjects heart rate are low 50 times/min after taking Ivabradine 7.5mg/ Atenolol 25mg, subjects should change the dose to Ivabradine 5mg/ Atenolol 12.5mg.</detailed_description>
