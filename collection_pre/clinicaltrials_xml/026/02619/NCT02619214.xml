	<brief_summary>Clinical trial controlled randomized of parallels groups. The study is designed to look for differences in the oxidative stress level among healthy patients receiving 2 different oxygen concentrations: 30% and 60% during general anesthesia. Once the patient has been informed, the affirmative agreement has been obtained and inclusion and exclusion criteria verified the patients are randomized to 30% or 60% oxygen concentration. In the operating room while placing the intravenous line, a sample blood is obtained. General anesthesia is induced and maintained with sevoflurane. After Anesthesia induction the anesthesia machine is fixed in order to provide the oxygen concentration according to the randomization. One hour later a second venous sample is obtained. Samples are stored in cold conditions until their analysis in the laboratories of the biology faculty - Barcelona University.</brief_summary>
