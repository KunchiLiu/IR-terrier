	<brief_title>Therapy of Ventilator-associated Tracheobronchitis Caused by Gram Negative Bacteria With Nebulized Colistin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients diagnosed ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis due to gram negative organism are included to the study.The patients will be received colistin inhalation 75 mg every 12 hours at least 5 days. The primary objective is to evaluate clinical outcome of inhaled colistin. The secondary objectives are microbiological clearance and toxicity of inhaled colistin. The sample size was estimated to 62 patients.</detailed_description>
