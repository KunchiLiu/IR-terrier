	<detailed_description>Women affected with hyperemesis gravidarum are at severe nutritional risk. Reference values for biochemical parameters evaluating nutritional status during early pregnancy needs to be determined. The investigators will compare clinical nutritional parameters (weight gain/weight loss) with rate of nausea (PUQE-questionnaire), self-reported nutritional intake form and biochemical measurements (prealbumin) in women admitted to hospital with hyperemesis gravidarum and healthy pregnant women. For hyperemesis patients measurements will be repeated at discharge.</detailed_description>
