	<brief_title>Autologous Bone Marrow Stem Cells for Chronic Leg Ulcer Treatment in Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Implantation of bone marrow mononuclear cells, including endothelial progenitor cells and mesenchymal stromal cells, into leg ulcers has been shown to improve wound healing. In the present study the safety and efficacy of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells implantation will be investigated in patients with chronic leg ulcers. Forty cases will be enrolled. Improvement in the pain, rate and extent of leg ulcer wound healing as measured by change in wound surface area will be evaluated until one year.</detailed_description>
