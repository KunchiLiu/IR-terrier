	<brief_summary>Dexamethasone, a high-potency, long-acting glucocorticoid, when added to bupivacaine, it extended the duration of analgesia. We aim to study the effectiveness of spinal dexamethasone in Transuretheral prostatectomy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Spinal Dexamethasone During Transuretheral Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal anesthesia for endoscopic urology surgery like transurethral resection of the prostate is a well-established technique. Opioids are extensively used as an adjunct to local anesthetics in neuraxial blockade to enhance the duration of postoperative analgesia. However, worrisome adverse effects like pruritus, urinary retention, postoperative vomiting and respiratory depression limit its use. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of Intrathecal dexamethasone as adjunct to local anesthetics.</detailed_description>
