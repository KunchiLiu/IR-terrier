	<brief_summary>This is a case control observational study using Bronchial-alveolar lavage (BAL) as specimen for GeneXpert, a real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for detection of tuberculosis (TB). Patients suspicious of TB, who require bronchoscopy as part of the investigation procedures, will be recruited for this study over a period of 18 months. Clinical likelihood of TB will be systematically scored according to various clinical parameters. This will determine the pre-test probability. Clinician will decide if anti-TB treatment is to be started and patients will be followed up for a minimal of 18 months. Sensitivity, specificity, positive, negative predictive values and the respective likelihood ratio will be calculated accordingly.</brief_summary>
