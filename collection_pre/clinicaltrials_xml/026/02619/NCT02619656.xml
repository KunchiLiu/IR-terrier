	<brief_title>A Trial of Supplemental CO2 Versus Room Air in Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background and study aims: Pneumoperitoneum following PEG placement has been reported in up to 60% of cases, and while usually benign and self-limited, it can lead to evaluation for suspected perforation. This study was designed to determine whether using CO2 compared to ambient air for insufflation during PEG reduces post-procedure pneumoperitoneum. Patients and Methods: Prospective, double blind, randomized trial of 35 consecutive patients undergoing PEG at a single academic medical center. Patients were randomized to insufflation with CO2 or ambient air. Primary outcome was pneumoperitoneum determined by left-lateral decubitus abdominal x-rays 30 min after PEG placement. Secondary endpoints included abdominal distention, pain, and bloating.</detailed_description>
