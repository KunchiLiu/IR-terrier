	<brief_summary>The standard or usual treatment for this disease is standard chemotherapy alone. For the first part of this study (phase I), there are two purposes. The first is to see whether AZD2014 can affect glioblastoma multiforme, and the second purpose is to see what effects it has.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>mTORC1/mTORC2 Kinase Inhibitor AZD2014 in Previously Treated Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In both the phase I &amp; II parts of the study, consenting patients will receive single agent AZD2014 for 2 days immediately prior to surgery (and PK sample) at a fixed dose of 125 mg bid po (i.e. on days -2, -1, and on morning of day 0 [day of surgery]). After recovery from surgery, patients will, within 7-21 days after tumour resection, either start the dose escalation part of the phase I (within 7-21 days after tumour resection) (at the appropriate dose level) or continue on the phase II if the phase II is open. Patients who are unable to proceed to the dose escalation part post resection will be replaced. For this part of the study the purpose is to find the highest dose of AZD2014 that can be tolerated without causing very severe side effects when receiving temozolomide therapy and to see what effects the study drugs have on the participant and their cancer. This is done by starting at a dose lower than the one that investigators know can be given safely to patients when used on its own. Participants are given AZD2014 together with temozolomide and will be watched very closely to see what side effects they have and to make sure the side effects are not severe. If the side effects are not severe, then new participants will be given a higher dose of AZD2014. Participants joining this study later on will get higher doses of AZD2014 than participants who join earlier. This will continue until a dose is found that causes severe but temporary side effects. Doses higher than that will not be given. The researchers doing this study are also interested in looking for markers that will help predict which patients are most likely to be helped by AZD2014. For the second phase of this study (phase II), the purpose is to find out the effects that AZD2014 has on participants and their glioblastoma, using doses found to be safe in the first part of the study, when given with temozolomide.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Glioblastoma</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patients must have histologically confirmed glioblastoma multiforme that is recurrent after primary treatment (surgery/radiation/temozolomide) (i.e. first progression). Patients may not have had disease progression while receiving adjuvant temozolomide or radiation. All patients must have an available formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue block (from their primary tumour) and must have provided informed consent for the release of the block. Patients participating in the pharmacodynamics study must have provided consent for release of a representative sample of the resected tumour. Presence of clinically and/or radiologically documented disease. MRI scan must be performed within 14 days prior to registration. All patients enrolled to phase II must have measurable disease according to RANO criteria as follows: At least one enhancing lesion which is ≥ 10 mm x 10 mm Patients must be ≥18 years of age. Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Patients must have received one prior temozolomide regimen, discontinued at least 16 weeks prior to registration. Patients may have received one other cytotoxic regimen (for example CCNU). Patients may not have received immunotherapies, biologic and viral therapies, angiogenesis inhibitors, mTOR, or PARP inhibitors Patients must have recovered from all reversible toxicity related to prior chemotherapy and have adequate washout from prior chemotherapy, and investigational agents as follows: longest of one of the following: two weeks, standard cycle length of prior regimen, 5 halflives for investigational drugs. Prior external beam radiation must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to registration. Previous surgery is permitted provided that a minimum of 21 days have elapsed between any major surgery (excluding resection for patients participating in the Pharmacodynamic Study) and date of registration, and that wound healing has occurred. Patients must have recovered from any treatment related toxicities prior to registration (unless grade 1, irreversible, or considered by investigator as not clinically significant). Hematology: Neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L; Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L; INR ≤ 1.5 Biochemistry: Serum Creatinine or Creatinine Clearance* ≥ 50 ml/min (calculated by Cockcroft and Gault equation) Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤ 5x ULN in the presence of liver metastases) Electrolytes within normal limits * Creatinine clearance to be measured directly by 24 hour urine sampling or as calculated by appropriate formula below: Females: GFR = 1.04 x (140age) x weight in kg / serum creatinine in μmol/L Males: GFR = 1.23 x (140age) x weight in kg / serum creatinine in µmol/L Patient consent must be appropriately obtained in accordance with applicable local and regulatory requirements. Each patient must sign a consent form prior to enrollment in the trial to document their willingness to participate. Patients who cannot give informed consent (i.e. mentally incompetent patients, or those physically incapacitated such as comatose patients) are not to be recruited into the study. Patients competent but physically unable to sign the consent form may have the document signed by their nearest relative or legal guardian. Each patient will be provided with a full explanation of the study before consent is requested. Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow up. In accordance with CCTG policy, protocol treatment is to begin within 2 working days of patient registration (exceptions will be made if surgical resection is delayed). Women/men of childbearing potential must have agreed to use 2 methods of contraception (1 highly effective method and 1 barrrier method) until 4 weeks after the end of treatment. Acceptable methods of highly effective contraception include: Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system. Male partner's sterilization (with the appropriate postvasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). True abstinence. Acceptable barrier methods of contraception include: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository. Please note: use of oral, injected, or implanted hormonal methods of contraception cannot be considered highly effective as it is currently unknown whether AZD2014 may reduce their effectiveness).
