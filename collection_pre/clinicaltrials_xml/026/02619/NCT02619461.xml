	<brief_title>The Acute Effect of Exercise on Appetite Appetite-regulating Hormones and Inflammation in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In summary, exercise does induce a variety of metabolic mechanisms on a central and peripheral level, related to appetite other than solely gut peptides. The literature points towards a rather loose coupling when it comes to high intensity exercise and the suppression of food intake, without a clear explanation of the cause of exercise induced anorexia. This study is aimed to investigate high-intensity exercise and its effects on appetite and satiety hormones, inflammation, stress and eating behaviors on appetite and food intake. The objective of the current study is to investigate the factors contributing to exercise-induced anorexia in lean and obese children, and maximize its translation into post-exercise suppression of food intake and promotion of negative energy balance particularly in obese children. It is hypothesized that high-intensity exercise would promote a greater suppression of food intake through suppression of appetite ratings via physiological mechanisms depending on stress and inflammation rather than gut peptides.</detailed_description>
