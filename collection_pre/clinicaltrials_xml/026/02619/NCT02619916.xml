	<brief_title>MBCT and CBT for Depression in Patients After Cancer: a Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer patients are prone to develop depressive symptoms, even after curative treatment. Conventional therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) are frequently used for reducing these depressive symptoms in patients with medical conditions. However, until now evidence from proper designed randomized controlled trials regarding the effectiveness of both interventions in cancer survivors, is lacking. Therefore, our longitudinal study aims to investigate the effectiveness of CBT and MBCT in reducing depressive symptoms in cancer survivors. In addition, potential moderators and mediators of each intervention will be explored.</detailed_description>
