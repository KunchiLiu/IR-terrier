	<brief_summary>Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition of the intestines that causes abdominal pain, diarrhea, tunnels around the anus (fistulas), and extraintestinal symptoms. Effective medical treatments exist to treat the disease; however they can have significant side effects. Previous studies have shown that sexual function is impaired in patients with Crohn's disease. It is likely that both the symptoms related to the disease, medications used to treat the disease, and surgery all impair sexual function in a variety of ways. For example, body image may be impaired, patients may be worried about bowel incontinence or unpleasant odors associated with diarrhea, patients may have significant pelvic pain secondary to perianal fistulas, or they may have painful intercourse from adjacent inflammation or scarring in the pelvis. The impact of medical treatment on patient's ability to regain sexual function is not known. The investigators propose a 6 month study to compare sexual function before and after treatment in patients with Crohn's disease about to initiate therapy with an anti-TNF drug for treatment of perianal fistula or intestinal Crohn's or about to initiate therapy with steroids. The investigators anticipate that the investigators will show that therapy with an anti TNF agent will result in a more rapid and greater return of sexual function than steroids. This information will be important to help counsel patients about the optimal treatment to begin for treatment of their Crohn's disease. Furthermore, it would be the first study to evaluate the impact of medical therapy on sexual function.</brief_summary>
