	<detailed_description>Managing Type 1 Diabetes requires daily checks of blood glucose and medication adjustments. Children and adolescents are known to have more difficulty with this than adults. Parents/legal guardians also face the task of helping with this self-management. A weekly text message regarding Type 1 Diabetes, sent to the parent or the parent and adolescent, may help to remind and motivate an individual to perform the daily tasks needed to manage their Type 1 Diabetes.</detailed_description>
