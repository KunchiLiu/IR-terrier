	<brief_title>Manage Diarrhea in Patients With Multiple Myeloma While Receiving Conditioning Chemotherapy for Autologous SCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study of SBI, colesevelam, and placebo in patients undergoing autologous HSCT for the clinical care of multiple myeloma. The number of adults undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) has grown significantly over the past two decades as a result of the availability of therapies for advanced hematologic and solid tumor malignancies, and the broader selection criteria for eligibility to receive these transplants. Generally, the stem cell transplant procedure consists of administration of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy to ablate all residual malignancy (called conditioning therapy), followed by intravenous infusion of hematopoietic stem cells to restore bone marrow function. Generally, HSCT has a positive effect on survival, despite serious adverse effects and life-threatening complications. Diarrhea can affect up to 91% of patients receiving autologous or allogeneic HSCT and is identified by 9% of the patients as the single most debilitating adverse effect post-HSCT. Other commonly encountered symptoms are nausea and vomiting (13%) and mouth sores (42%). The impact of diarrhea can be significant and result in dehydration, negative impact on quality of life, prolonged hospitalization with an increased cost and risk, and the diarrhea may be potentially life-threatening.</detailed_description>
