	<brief_summary>Skin prick tests (SPT) are commonly used in daily allergological practice to assess skin reactivity to allergens. Multiple factors can contribute to non-optimal results of conventional wheal and flare measurement (CWFM) of SPT such as inaccurate measurements, observer-dependency and absence of traceability. This study aims to evaluate the quantification of SPT by a novel High Speed Laser Doppler Imaging (HSL-DI) and to compare it with CWFM. First, SPT with birch and/or grass pollen extracts as well as positive and negative controls will be performed in 20 volunteers (11 atopics, 9 non-atopics) to establish the characteristics (cut-off, optimal reading time and allergen concentration) of HSL-DI analysis based on two parameters ("area" and "flow" measurement). In a second step, fifty patients will be tested with birch and grass pollen extracts at optimal allergen concentration and time window. Analysis of SPT by HSL-DI and CWFM will be compared.</brief_summary>
