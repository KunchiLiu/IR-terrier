	<brief_summary>This study compares whether addition of Magnesium or Midazolam intrathecally to epidurally administered isobaric Ropivacaine improves the quality of blockade, haemodynamics and duration of analgesia post-operatively. 25 parturients were given intrathecal Magnesium and rest of the 25 parturients were given intrathecal Midazolam combined with 0.75% Ropivacaine via epidural route.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparative Study of Intrathecal Magnesium Sulphate &amp; Midazolam With Epidural Ropivacaine for Caesarean Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Magnesium sulphate and Midazolam have been used in clinical trials as adjuvants to local anaesthetics via intrathecal and epidural routes and are effective in augmenting the quality of block and prolonging post-operative analgesia. Noxious stimulation leads to the release of glutamate and aspartate neuratransmitters which bind to various sub-classes of excitatory aminoacid, including the NMDA receptor. Intrathecal magnesium potentiates neuraxial anaesthesia by blocking NMDA receptors with out causing significant side effects as reported in various studies. Intrathecal Midazolam produces antinociception at spinal cord-level through benzodiazepine GABA-A receptor complex which are present abundantly in the lamina 2 of spinal cord. Midazolam also releases endogenous opioid acting at spinal delta receptors and also enhances adenosine release which also augments analgesia.</detailed_description>
