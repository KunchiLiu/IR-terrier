	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to purpose of this study is to assess if regorafenib is active enough, in terms of 6-month progression-free rate, to warrant further comparative studies in patients with RAS-mutant advanced colorectal cancer who have progressed after first-line oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab.</brief_summary>

Life expectancy of greater than 3 months 1. Previous treatment with regorafenib or irinotecan 2. Are taking strong cytochrome P (CYP) CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, voriconazole) or strong CYP3A4 inducers (eg, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John's Wort) 3. Have had a major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment 4. Have congestive heart failure classified as New York Heart Association Class 2 or higher 5. Have had unstable angina (angina symptoms at rest) or newonset angina &lt; 3 months prior to screening. 6. Have had a myocardial infarction &lt; 6 months prior to initiation of study treatment. 7. Have cardiac arrhythmias requiring antiarrhythmic therapy, with the exception of beta blockers or digoxin. 8. Have had arterial or venous thrombotic or embolic events such as cerebrovascular accident (including transient ischemic attacks), deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism within 6 months prior to the initiation of study treatment 9.

Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] &gt;140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] &gt; 90 mmHg) 12. Have interstitial lung disease with ongoing signs and symptoms at the time informed consent is obtained 13. Have persistent proteinuria &gt; 3.5 g/24 hours measured by urine protein creatinine ratio from a random urine sample (&lt; Grade 3, CTCAE v 4.0). 14. Have unresolved toxicity higher than National Cancer InstituteCommon Terminology for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v 4.0) Grade 1 attributed to any prior therapy/procedure, excluding alopecia and/or oxaliplatininduced neurotoxicity ≤ Grade 2 and hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL as per inclusion criteria 15.
