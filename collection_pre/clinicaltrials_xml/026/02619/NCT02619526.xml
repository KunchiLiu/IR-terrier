	<brief_summary>Heart failure (HF) is a common and disabling condition in the elderly. Randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses have clearly demonstrated that long-term use of β blockers improves the outcomes of patients with HF. However, limited data have been available on the treatment of HF with preserved ejection fraction (EF) in the elderly. No study has specifically compared the relative effectiveness of carvedilol and nebivolol in treating HF in old age patients with preserved EF.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Effects of Nebivolol and Carvedilol on Diastolic Function in the Elderly Heart Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial is a prospective, randomized, open-label, active controlled study designed to investigate effects of nebivolol and carvedilol on diastolic function of the left ventricle (LV) in the elderly HF patients with preserved EF. Patients will be included in the study if they had LVEF ≥ 40%, NYHA functional class I, II or III, and clinical stability without hospital admission for HF in the preceding 3 months.</detailed_description>
