	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical trial is to compare the use of thrust manipulation to non-thrust mobilizations for mechanical neck pain when they are applied to both the cervical and thoracic spine. Both of these techniques have been compared in previous trials but a pragmatic approach will be employed as well as controlling for clinical equipoise.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thrust Manipulation vs. Non-thrust Mobilizations for Mechanical Neck Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total sample size of 136 subjects with mechanical neck pain will be recruited to participant in this trial from multiple clinic and university sites around the country. Each subject will be evaluated by a licensed physical therapist that specializes in orthopedic manual therapy (OMT). Each treating therapist will be blinded be the data collection and each data collection therapist will be blinded to the treatment allocation. Subjects data will be collected at the initial visit, second visit, and at discharge. The maximum number of weeks that a subject may be enrolled is 8 weeks (2 months). At that point, they are discharged from the study. The treating therapist will allocate the subject through the already completed randomization procedures. Once the subject is randomized, the treating therapist will perform the OMT based on their clinical reasoning and in a manner they feel would benefit the patient the most. In addition to the OMT, each subject will receive a home exercise program, advice, encouragement, and education. A number of outcome variables will be collected regarded pain and disability as well as one physical performance measure.</detailed_description>
