	<brief_title>Shock Index To DEtect Low Plasma Fibrinogen In Trauma (SIDE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypofibrinogenemia is common in severe trauma and below the threshold of 2.3 g/l is associated with increased mortality. Although guidelines for management of the trauma induced coagulopathy does not recommend any specific timing of fibrinogen substitution, several papers suggest that early substitution might be associated with improved outcome. Laboratory measurement of plasma fibrinogen level, thromboelastometry and/or its estimation based on base excess, hemoglobin level, Injury Severity Score or combinations require diagnostic procedures that are associated with with a certain time delay and prolongs the time to fibrinogen substitution.</detailed_description>
